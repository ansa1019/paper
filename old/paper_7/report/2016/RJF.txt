item 7.   management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following management's discussion and analysis ("md&a") is intended to help the reader understand the results of our operations and financial condition. this md&a is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements. where "nm" is used in various percentage change computations, the computed percentage change has been determined not to be meaningful.
executive overview we operate as a financial services and bank holding company. results in the businesses in which we operate are highly correlated to the general overall strength of economic conditions and, more specifically, to the direction of the u.s. equity and fixed income markets, the corporate and mortgage lending markets and commercial and residential credit trends.  overall market conditions, interest rates, economic, political and regulatory trends, and industry competition are among the factors which could affect us and which are unpredictable and beyond our control.  these factors affect the financial decisions made by market participants which include investors, borrowers, and competitors, impacting their level of participation in the financial markets. these factors also impact the level of public offerings, investment banking activity, trading profits, interest rate volatility and asset valuations, or a combination thereof.  in turn, these decisions and factors affect our business results.
year ended september 30, 2016 compared with the year ended september 30, 2015
we achieved net revenues of $5.4 billion, a $203 million, or 4%, increase over the prior year. our net income of $529 million reflects an increase of $27 million, or 5%, and our diluted earnings per share for the current year amount to $3.65, a 6% increase. the current year diluted earnings per share benefited from our repurchase of common stock in open market transactions. total client assets under administration increased to $604.4 billion at september 30, 2016, a 26% increase over the prior year level. the increase in assets under administration is attributable to our acquisitions of alex. brown and 3macs, strong financial advisor recruiting results, high levels of retention of our existing financial advisors, and an increase in u. s. equity markets over the year.
after excluding the acquisition-related expenses we incurred during the current year, our non-gaap adjusted net income amounts to $556 million,(1) an increase of 11% over the prior year. non-gaap adjusted diluted earnings per share amounts to $3.84,(1) an increase of 12% over the $3.43 diluted earnings per share in the prior year.
net revenues increased in each of our four operating segments. our non-operating other segment reflects a decline in net revenues as the prior year experienced higher valuation gains from our private equity investments than the current year as well as realized gains on sales of ars. non-interest expenses have increased $202 million, or 5%. the increase primarily results from: increases in compensation, commissions and benefits due to annual raises, growth in related commission and fee revenues, and increases in benefits expenses; increases in communications and information processing expenses resulting from our continued investment in our pcg platform and in improving our compliance and regulatory systems; an increase in the bank loan loss provision resulting from loan growth and an increase associated with the credit deterioration of certain loans in the energy sector, and increases in other expenses predominately due to increases in certain legal and regulatory expenses.
a summary of the most significant items impacting our financial results as compared to the prior year are as follows:
•   our private client group segment generated net revenues of $3.62 billion, a 3% increase, while pre-tax income decreased by $2 million to $341 million. the increase in revenues is primarily attributable to an increase in account and service fee income, most notably an increase in fees associated with our multi-bank client cash sweep program resulting from both an increase in short-term interest rates, and an increase in client cash balances resulting from clients' reaction to market volatility and uncertainty. securities commissions and fee revenues increased 1% overall. fees arising from fee-based accounts as well as commissions on fixed income products increased substantially, more than offsetting declines in commissions on mutual funds, equity securities and new issue sales credits. non-interest expenses increased compared to the prior year level, most significantly due to higher administrative expenses to support our continued growth, higher communications and information technology expenses resulting from our continued investments in our platform and in improving our compliance and regulatory systems, and an increase in other expense predominately due to certain legal and regulatory expenses. the segment's margin on net revenues decreased to 9.4% from 9.8%.

•   the capital markets segment generated net revenues of $1 billion, a 4% increase, while pre-tax income increased $32 million, or 30%, to $139 million. the increase in revenues is driven by an increase in trading profits, sales commissions on fixed income products, and to a lesser extent an increase in tax credit fund syndication fee revenues, offset by declines in equity underwriting fee and merger and acquisition and advisory fee revenues. non-interest expenses increased a modest 1% over the prior year level.
•   our asset management segment generated net revenues of $404 million, a 3% increase, while pre-tax income decreased $3 million, or 2%, to $132 million. non-discretionary asset-based administration fee revenues increased, driven by an increase in assets held in these programs over the prior year level. advisory fee revenues from managed programs approximate the prior year despite the increase in balances of financial assets under management in managed programs as of fiscal year end due to the volatility of markets during the year and the timing of our fee computations. expenses have increased 6% over the prior year level, due in large part to a prior year reversal of certain incentive compensation expense accruals for associates who left the firm during the prior year, which did not recur in the current year.
•   rj bank generated net revenues of $494 million, a 19% increase, while pre-tax income increased $59 million, or 21%, to $337 million. the loan loss provision increased nearly $5 million, or 20%, over the prior year level due to higher corporate loan growth, charges during the current year resulting from loans outstanding within the energy sector, and additional provision for corporate loan downgrades. non-interest expenses (excluding provision for loan losses) increased $16 million, or 15%, primarily due to an increase in the affiliate deposit account servicing fees paid to the private client group resulting from an increase in balances, and an increase in fdic insurance premiums.
•   activities in our other segment reflect a pre-tax loss that is $84 million, or 129%, more than the prior year. total revenues in the segment decreased $21 million, or 31%, primarily resulting from a decrease in private equity valuation gains, and a decrease of $11 million in gains on the sale of certain ars securities resulting from prior year sales that did not recur in the current year, offset by increased interest revenue and foreign exchange gains. acquisition-related expenses of $41 million are reflected in this segment, which did not occur in the prior year. these expenses result from our incremental acquisition-related expenses for our acquisitions of alex. brown, 3macs, and mummert.
•   our effective tax rate was 33.9% in fiscal year 2016, down from the 37.1% in the prior year. the reduction in our effective tax rate compared to the prior year was due to the following factors: (1) as a result of the fiscal year 2016 increase in equity market values compared to fiscal year 2015, the change in the amount of our non-taxable gains/losses arising from the value of our company-owned life insurance portfolio had the effect of decreasing our effective tax rate by 1.5% compared to the prior year; (2) adjustments associated with planned divestitures of our remaining businesses in south america accounted for an effective rate decrease of 1.1%; (3) we settled significant state tax audits during the year which reduced our effective rate by 0.4%; and (4) we were able to generate and utilize additional low-income housing tax credits to apply against our tax liability which had a favorable 0.5% impact on our effective tax rate.
•   we repurchased approximately 3.2 million shares of our common stock in open market transactions during the year, for a total purchase price of approximately $144.5 million, reflecting an average per share repurchase price of $45.69 (see part ii, item 5 in this report, for additional information on these share repurchases). the current year diluted earnings per share benefited by $0.05 as a result of these repurchases.
consistent with our growth strategies, we completed three acquisitions during the year - alex. brown, 3macs, and mummert. we continue to evaluate future opportunities, but remain committed to our strategy that acquisitions must meet our strategic growth objectives, involve entities that share our culture of conservatism and "client-first" values, and be executed at purchase prices that provide us opportunities to increase our shareholders' value.
the number and significance of possible regulatory changes that impact the businesses in which we operate continues to grow and evolve. in april 2016, the dol issued its final regulation expanding the definition of who is deemed an "investment advice fiduciary" under erisa as a result of giving investment advice to a plan, plan participant or beneficiary, as well as under the internal revenue code for individual retirement accounts and non-erisa plans. refer to the "fiduciary duty standard" section of item 1 "regulation" in this report for further discussion of the regulation, its effective dates, and its potential impact.
year ended september 30, 2015 compared with the year ended september 30, 2014
we achieved net revenues of $5.2 billion in fiscal year 2015, a $339 million, or 7%, increase compared to the prior year. all four operating segments achieved net revenue increases. total client assets under administration increased to $480 billion at september 30, 2015, a 1% increase over the prior year level. the increase in assets under administration is attributable to strong
36
index financial advisor recruiting results and high levels of retention of our existing financial advisors, which more than offset the decline in the u.s. equity markets for the year (primarily occurring in our fourth fiscal quarter of fiscal year 2015).
we achieved net income in fiscal year 2015 of $502 million, an increase of $22 million, or 5%, compared to the prior year. three of our four operating segments achieved increased profitability in fiscal year 2015 over the prior year level. fully diluted earnings per share of $3.43 increased $0.11, or 3%, over the prior year amount.
non-interest expenses in fiscal year 2015 increased $278 million, or 7%, compared to the prior year. the increase is primarily due to the increase in compensation, commissions and benefits expenses associated with the increased revenues. in addition, as a result of various growth strategies across our businesses in fiscal year 2015, we experienced an increase in our business development expenses. our strategic efforts during fiscal year 2015 to continually improve the technology available to our financial advisors, as well as the additional costs of compliance with various new rules and regulations impacting our industry, are factors impacting an increase in our communications and information processing expenses. the provision for loan losses increased significantly in fiscal year 2015 over the prior year, as fiscal year 2014 benefited to a greater extent than fiscal year 2015, from improved credit characteristics of the loan portfolio. the combination of the above noted factors, even after consideration of the incremental expenses resulting from activities associated with the strategic growth initiatives that should favorably impact future revenues, resulted in a pre-tax margin on net revenues in fiscal year 2015 of 15.3%, a level that is nearly equivalent to the 15.4% pre-tax margin on net revenues in the prior year.
a summary of the most significant items impacting our financial results in fiscal 2015 as compared to the fiscal year 2014 are as follows:
•   our private client group segment generated net revenues in fiscal year 2015 of $3.5 billion, a $228 million, or 7%, increase over the prior year. pre-tax income amounted to $342 million, a $12 million, or 4%, increase over the prior year. the increase in revenues in fiscal year 2015 is primarily attributable to increased securities commissions and fee revenues, predominately arising from fee-based accounts, as well as an increase in mutual fund and annuity service fee revenues. client assets under administration of the private client group increased 1% over the prior year level, to $453.3 billion at september 30, 2015. the increase in fiscal year 2015 commission revenues and client assets have resulted primarily from successful recruiting of financial advisors, and high levels of financial advisor retention. financial advisor recruiting in fiscal year 2015 was strong with a net increase of 331 financial advisors over the year to 6,596 affiliated financial advisors as of september 30, 2015. there was an overall net increase in client assets despite the impact of the decline in the market value of assets that occurred during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2015 as a result of declining equity market conditions. commission expenses in fiscal year 2015 increased in proportion to the increase in commission revenues while all other components of non-interest expense increased 5% as we incurred increases in certain costs associated with the successful recruiting efforts and continued information system improvements. on july 31, 2015, we completed our acquisition of the producers choice, llc ("tpc"), a private insurance and annuity marketing organization based in troy, michigan. our acquisition of tpc brings more life insurance and annuity experts to the firm to support financial advisors and their clients.
•   the capital markets segment generated fiscal year 2015 net revenues of $960 million, a $7 million, or 1%, increase over the prior year. pre-tax income in fiscal year 2015 was $107 million, a decrease of $24 million, or 18%, compared to the prior year. fiscal year 2015 reflected increases over the prior year in merger and acquisition fees and tax credit fund syndication fees. commission revenues from fixed income institutional sales increased in fiscal year 2015 over the prior year level, resulting in part from growth in our public finance activities. however, equity underwriting revenues declined compared to the prior year as a result of weakness in both the energy and real estate sectors, which also led to a decline in commission revenues on equity products in fiscal year 2015. the net profit generated by this segment in fiscal year 2015 was negatively impacted by increased costs, some of which result from our efforts during the year to broadly build out certain sector capabilities and to increase investment banking coverage in certain sectors, which we believe present solid long-term opportunities for future revenue growth. the continued difficult market environment in canada in fiscal year 2015 negatively impacted this segment's revenues and profitability.
•   our asset management segment generated net revenues in fiscal year 2015 of $392 million, a $23 million, or 6%, increase over the prior year. pre-tax income in fiscal year 2015 was $135 million, a $7 million, or 5%, increase over the prior year. financial assets under management increased 1% from the prior year, to $65.2 billion as of september 30, 2015. the increase resulted from net inflows of client assets, which more than offset the unfavorable impact of the decline in the market value of assets that occurred during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2015 as a result of declining equity market conditions. on april 30, 2015, we completed our acquisition of cougar global investments limited ("cougar"), an asset
37
index management firm based in toronto, canada that markets its investment services to high net worth individuals, families, foundations, trusts and institutions in canada and the united states.
•   rj bank generated net revenues in fiscal year 2015 of $414 million, a $63 million, or 18%, increase over the prior year. pre-tax income in fiscal year 2015 was $279 million, a $36 million, or 15% increase, over the prior year. net interest income increased due to growth in average loans outstanding, coupled with a modest increase in net interest margin in fiscal year 2015. our provision for loan losses in fiscal year 2015 increased $10 million, or 74% compared to the prior year. we incurred substantial provision for loan losses associated with loan growth in both years, however the majority of the year-over-year increase resulted from the prior year benefiting to a greater extent than fiscal year 2015, from improved credit characteristics of the loan portfolio. the credit characteristics of the loan portfolio generally improved over the year, reflecting the positive impact of improved economic conditions.
•   activities in our other segment in fiscal year 2015 resulted in a pre-tax loss that was $19 million less than the prior year. net revenues in this segment in fiscal year 2015 increased $25 million, resulting from increases in revenues associated with our private equity portfolio investments, and an increase in gains resulting from our auction rate securities portfolio sales and redemption activities. as a result of the fiscal year 2015 increase in private equity investment revenues, the portion of this segment's pre-tax income that is attributable to noncontrolling interests also increased.
•   our fiscal year 2015 effective tax rate was 37.1%, up from the 35.8% in the prior year. as a result of the fiscal year 2015 decline in equity market values compared to positive markets in fiscal year 2014, the change in the amount of our non-taxable gains/losses arising from the value of our company-owned life insurance portfolio had the effect of increasing our effective tax rate by 1.2% compared to the prior year effective tax rate.

index reconciliation of the gaap measures to the non-gaap measures for fiscal year 2016, we utilized certain non-gaap calculations as additional measures to aid in, and enhance, the understanding of our financial results. we believe that the non-gaap measures provide useful information by excluding certain material items that may not be indicative of our core operating results. we believe that these non-gaap measures will allow for better evaluation of the operating performance of the business and facilitate a meaningful comparison of our results in the current year to those in prior and future years. the non-gaap financial information should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with gaap. in addition, our non-gaap measures may not be comparable to similarly titled non-gaap measures of other companies.
the non-gaap adjustments are comprised entirely of acquisition-related expenses (associated with our acquisitions of alex. brown, 3macs and mummert) net of applicable taxes. our acquisition-related expenses are incremental expenses arising solely as a result of the acquisition, which do not represent recurring costs within the fully integrated combined organization. there are no non-gaap adjustments in either of the fiscal years ended september 30, 2015 or 2014. see the footnotes below for further explanation of each item.

(1)   the non-gaap adjustment adds back to pre-tax income acquisition-related expenses incurred during the fiscal year associated with our acquisitions described above.
(2)   the non-gaap adjustment reduces net income for the income tax effect of the pre-tax non-gaap adjustments, utilizing the fiscal year effective tax rate to determine the current tax expense.
(3)   computed by adding the total equity attributable to rjf as of each quarter-end date during the fiscal year, plus the beginning of the fiscal year total, divided by five.
(4)   the calculation of non-gaap average equity includes the impact on equity of the non-gaap adjustments described in the table above.
(5)   computed by utilizing the adjusted net income attributable to rjf non-gaap and the average equity non-gaap. see footnotes (3) and (4) above for the calculation of average equity non-gaap.
(6)   computed by dividing the adjusted pre-tax income attributable to rjf by net revenues (gaap basis).

index net interest analysis given the relationship of our interest sensitive assets to liabilities, any changes in short-term interest rates are likely to have a meaningful impact on our overall financial performance, as we have certain assets and liabilities, primarily held in our pcg and rj bank segments, which are subject to changes in interest rates. based on the current level of short-term interest rates, gradual increases in short-term interest rates would have the most significant favorable impact on our pcg and rj bank segments (refer to the table in item 7a - interest rate risk in this report, which presents an analysis of rj bank's estimated net interest income over a twelve month period based on instantaneous shifts in interest rates using the asset/liability model applied by rj bank).
the closing of the alex. brown acquisition occurred late in fiscal year 2016, therefore we expect that our average interest-earning assets will increase substantially in fiscal year 2017, over the average fiscal year 2016 levels. the substantial client cash and margin balances associated with the alex. brown division client accounts should have a favorable impact on our net interest earnings.
in december 2015, the federal reserve bank announced an increase in its benchmark short-term interest rate by 25 basis points. we estimate that this increase had a favorable impact on our pre-tax income of an amount approximating $60 million in fiscal year 2016, reflecting approximately $80 million of additional pre-tax income on an annualized basis.
our latest projection of the impact of additional increases by the federal reserve bank in its benchmark short-term interest rate, which is based upon september 30, 2016 balances, projects that an additional 25 basis point rise would result in an additional increase in our annual pre-tax income in a range of approximately $48 million to $60 million over a twelve month period. the realization of such amounts is dependent upon the realization of certain key assumptions in our analysis. such assumptions include our estimates of the timing and amounts of: earnings/deposit rates paid on our clients' cash balances; client cash balance levels; the level of earning assets; and rj bank's net interest margin. in our analysis, we assume that between 40% and 50% of such rate increase would also be reflected as a rate increase on earning/deposits paid on our clients' cash balances.
we anticipate that a majority of any future increases would be reflected in account and service fee revenues (resulting from an increase in the fees generated in lieu of interest income from our multi-bank sweep program with unaffiliated banks and the discontinuance of money market fund fee waivers) which are reported in the pcg segment, and the remaining portion of the increase would be reflected in net interest income reported primarily in our pcg and rj bank segments.
if the federal reserve bank was to reverse its december 2015 action and decrease the benchmark short-term interest rate, the impact on our net interest income would be an unfavorable reversal of the positive impact described above.

index year ended september 30, 2016 compared with the year ended september 30, 2015 - net interest analysis net interest income increased $88 million, or 20%. net interest income is earned primarily by our rj bank and pcg segments, which are discussed separately below.
the rj bank segment's net interest income increased $75 million, or 19%, resulting from an increase in average interest-earning banking assets partially offset by a small decline in the net interest margin.  refer to the discussion of the specific components of rj bank's net interest income in the rj bank section of this md&a.
net interest income in the pcg segment increased $8 million, or 9%. average customer cash balances and the related segregated asset balances increased compared to the prior year as many clients reacted to uncertainties in the equity markets during portions of the current year by increasing the cash balances in their brokerage accounts. the december 2015 federal reserve bank short-term interest rate increase further increased the net interest earned on these segregated asset balances. in addition, both the interest rates and the average balances associated with margin loans provided to brokerage clients increased.
interest income earned on the available for sale securities portfolio increased $2 million, or 49%, due to increased yields and balances. see note 7 of our notes to consolidated financial statements in this form 10-k for additional information on our available for sale securities.
interest expense incurred on our other borrowings increased by $7 million, or 113%. these borrowings are in large part comprised of rj bank's borrowings from the fhlb and the related interest rate hedges. see note 15 of our notes to consolidated financial statements in this form 10-k for additional information regarding all of our borrowings other than our senior notes payable.
interest expense incurred on our senior notes increased by $2 million, or 3%. the incremental interest expense arising from our july 2016 $800 million senior note issuances exceeded the interest savings resulting from our april 2016 repayment of the $250 million 4.25% issuance which matured. see note 17 of our notes to consolidated financial statements in this form 10-k for additional information.
year ended september 30, 2015 compared with the year ended september 30, 2014 - net interest analysis net interest income increased $58 million, or 16%, in fiscal year 2015 compared to the prior year. net interest income is earned primarily by our rj bank and pcg segments, which are discussed separately below.
the rj bank segment's net interest income in fiscal year 2015 increased $57 million, or 16%, primarily as a result of an increase in average loans outstanding as well as a modest increase in net interest margin.  refer to the discussion of the specific components of rj bank's net interest income in the rj bank section of this md&a.
net interest income in the pcg segment was nearly unchanged in fiscal 2015 compared to the prior year. a decrease in net interest income arising from our broker-dealer margin lending activities, where a decline in margin interest rates more than offset the impact of slightly higher average client margin balances outstanding, was nearly offset by an increase in net interest revenue arising from our securities lending activities.
net interest income arising from our securities lending activities increased $1 million, or 16%, in fiscal year 2015, due primarily to an increase in interest income associated with hard-to-borrow securities in our box lending program. these revenues increased $3 million in fiscal year 2015 due to our ability to lend these securities at a premium. the increase in revenues was offset by a $2 million increase in interest expense during fiscal year 2015 associated with our stock borrow activities, as a result of additional expense associated with borrowing hard-to-borrow securities.
interest income earned on the available for sale securities portfolio held in our rj bank and other segments decreased $1 million, or 22%, due to lower average investment balances and a slight decrease in yields on the portfolio in fiscal year 2015. the decrease in average balances outstanding is the result of sales and redemptions within the portfolio during fiscal year 2015 (see note 7 of our notes to consolidated financial statements in this form 10-k for additional information on our available for sale securities).
interest income earned on our trading instruments held in the capital markets segment increased $2 million, or 9%, in fiscal 2015, due to slightly higher average trading security inventory levels, partially offset by the impact of lower yields (see note 6 of our notes to consolidated financial statements in this form 10-k for additional information on our trading instruments).

the success of the pcg segment is dependent upon the quality of our products, services, financial advisors and support personnel including our ability to attract, retain and motivate a sufficient number of these associates. we face competition for qualified associates from major financial services companies, including other brokerage firms, insurance companies, banking institutions and discount brokerage firms.
revenues of the pcg segment are correlated with total pcg client assets under administration, which include assets in fee-based accounts, and the overall u.s. equities markets. rj&a advisors operate under the rj&a registered investment advisor ("ria") license while independent contractors affiliated with rjfs may operate either under their own ria license, or the ria license of rjfsa. the investment advisory fee revenues associated with these activities are recorded within securities commissions and fee revenues on our consolidated financial statements. refer to the securities commissions and fees section of our summary

index of significant accounting policies in note 2 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in this form 10-k for our accounting policies on presenting these revenues in our consolidated financial statements.
net interest revenue in the private client group is generated by client balances, predominantly the earnings on margin loans and assets segregated pursuant to regulations, less interest paid on client cash balances (the "client interest program"). we also utilize a multi-bank sweep program which generates fee revenue from unaffiliated banks in lieu of interest revenue. the cash sweep program, known as the raymond james bank deposit program ("rjbdp"), is a multi-bank (rj bank and many non-affiliated banks) program under which clients' cash deposits in their brokerage accounts are re-deposited into interest-bearing deposit accounts (up to $250,000 per bank for individual accounts and up to $500,000 per bank for joint accounts) at various third party banks. this program enables clients to obtain up to $2.5 million in individual fdic deposit insurance coverage ($5 million for joint accounts) while earning competitive rates on their cash balances.
clients' transactions in securities are affected on either a cash or margin basis. margin loans to clients are collateralized by the securities purchased or by other securities owned by the client. interest is charged to clients on the amount borrowed. the interest rate charged to a client on a margin loan is based on current interest rates and on the outstanding amount of the loan.
typically, broker-dealers utilize bank borrowings and equity capital as the primary sources of funds to finance clients' margin account borrowings. rj&a's source of funds to finance clients' margin account balances has been cash balances in brokerage clients' accounts, which are funds awaiting investment. in addition, pursuant to written agreements with clients, broker-dealers are permitted by the sec and finra rules to lend client securities in margin accounts to other financial institutions. sec regulations, however, restrict the use of clients' funds derived from pledging and lending clients' securities, as well as funds awaiting investment, to the financing of margin account balances; to the extent not so used, such funds are required to be deposited in a special segregated account for the benefit of clients. the regulations also require broker-dealers, within designated periods of time, to obtain possession or control of, and to segregate, clients' fully paid and excess margin securities.

total pcg assets under administration increased 27% over september 30, 2015. the increase results from net client inflows attributable to strong financial advisor recruiting results, high levels of retention of our existing financial advisors, our fiscal year 2016 acquisitions of alex. brown and 3macs which resulted in a combined $50 billion of client asset inflows as of their respective acquisition closing dates, and an increase in u. s. equity markets at september 30, 2016 compared to the prior year. total pcg assets in fee-based accounts increased 29% compared to september 30, 2015. increased client assets under administration typically result in higher fee-based account revenues and mutual fund and annuity service fees. in periods where equity markets improve, assets under administration increase and client activity generally increases, thereby having a favorable impact on financial advisor productivity. generally, assets under administration, client activity, and financial advisor productivity decline in periods where equity markets reflect downward trends. higher client cash balances generally lead to increased interest income and account fee revenues, depending upon spreads realized in our client interest program and rjbdp.

index the number of financial advisors as of september 30, 2016 reflects a net increase of 550 individuals, or an 8% net increase, over the number of financial advisors as of september 30, 2015. the net increase results from strong financial advisor recruiting and high levels of retention throughout fiscal year 2016, as well as the addition of 265 financial advisors as a result of our acquisitions of alex. brown and 3macs. importantly, the client asset levels and productivity measures associated with those financial advisors recruited during the fiscal year exceed our historical benchmark averages. notwithstanding the future impact of changes in the overall economy, and more specifically their impact on future equity markets and fixed income markets, factors over which we have no control, we believe that this increase in productive financial advisors is a positive indication of potential future revenue growth in this segment.
year ended september 30, 2016 compared with the year ended september 30, 2015 - private client group net revenues increased $109 million, or 3%, to $3.62 billion. pre-tax income decreased $2 million, to $341 million. pcg's pre-tax margin on net revenues decreased to 9.4% as compared to the prior year's 9.8%. the 3macs and alex. brown acquisitions were completed late in the fiscal year and therefore the impact of these acquisitions on this segment's operations were not significant to our fiscal year 2016 results.
securities commissions and fees increased $42 million, or 1%.  revenues earned on fee-based accounts increased $116 million, or 8%, commissions earned on fixed income products increased $21 million, or 29%, and commission revenues on insurance and annuity products increased $14 million, or 4%. offsetting these increases, commissions on mutual funds decreased $49 million, or 7%, new issue sales credits declined $31 million, or 41%, and commissions on equity products decreased $30 million, or 11%, all of which reflect the challenging equity market conditions during significant portions of the current year.
total account and service fees increased $62 million, or 14%. client account and service fees increased $54 million, or 31%, primarily due to an increase in rjbdp fees resulting from increased average balances in the program as well as the december 2015 increase in interest rates. mutual fund and annuity service fees increased $6 million, or 2%, primarily as a result of an increase in money market processing fees and omnibus fees arising from increased client assets and positions which are paid to us by companies whose products we distribute.  omnibus fees are generally based on the number of positions held in our client portfolios and compensate us for recordkeeping.
total segment revenues increased 3%. the portion of total segment revenues that we consider to be recurring is approximately 77% at september 30, 2016, an increase from 75% at september 30, 2015. recurring commission and fee revenues include asset-based fees, trailing commissions from mutual funds and variable annuities/insurance products, mutual fund and annuity service fees, fees earned on funds in our multi-bank sweep program, and interest. assets in fee-based accounts in fiscal year 2016 increased by a percentage greater than the percentage increases for total pcg client assets as clients continue to elect fee-based alternatives versus traditional transaction-based accounts. at september 30, 2016, such assets were $231.0 billion, an increase of 29% compared to the $179.4 billion as of september 30, 2015.
net interest income in the pcg segment increased $8 million, or 9%. average customer cash balances and the related segregated asset balances increased compared to the prior year as many clients reacted to uncertainties in the equity markets during portions of the current year by increasing the cash balances in their brokerage accounts. the december 2015 federal reserve bank short-term interest rate increase further increased the net interest earned on these segregated asset balances. in addition, both the average interest rate and the average client margin balances outstanding increased.
non-interest expenses increased $110 million, or 3%.   administrative and incentive compensation and benefits expense increased $43 million, or 8%, resulting in part from annual increases in salaries, increases in employee benefit plan costs and additional staffing levels, primarily in pcg operations and information technology functions, to support our continuing growth. clearance and other expense increased $35 million, or 49%, primarily resulting from increases in other expense related to certain legal and regulatory expenses which are approximately $40 million higher than the prior year level. sales commission expense increased $23 million, or 1%, which is consistent with the 1% increase in securities commissions and fees revenues. communications and information processing expense increased $9 million, or 6%, due to increases in software consulting and other information technology expenses associated with our continued investment in our platform and improving our compliance and regulatory systems.
year ended september 30, 2015 compared with the year ended september 30, 2014 - private client group net revenues in fiscal year 2015 increased $228 million, or 7%, to $3.5 billion while pre-tax income increased $12 million, or 4%, to $342 million. pcg's pre-tax margin on net revenues decreased slightly to 9.8% as compared to 10.1% in fiscal year 2014.

index securities commissions and fees in fiscal year 2015 increased $178 million, or 6%.  client assets under administration increased to $453.3 billion, an increase of $2.7 billion, or 1%, compared to september 30, 2014. the year over year increase in client assets in fiscal year 2015 was driven by positive net inflows generated by financial advisor retention and recruiting results, as the equity markets in the u.s. were down compared to the prior year. the most significant increase in these revenues in fiscal year 2015 arose from revenues earned on fee-based accounts, which increased $212 million, or 17%, and was partially offset by a $27 million, or 9%, decrease in commissions on equity products, a $13 million, or 15%, decrease in new issue sales credits due to a decrease in equity underwritings, and a $4 million, or 5%, decrease in commissions on fixed income products. fiscal year 2015 includes a $7 million decrease in mutual fund commission revenues due to the resolution of a mutual fund share class issue that resulted in refunds of commissions being paid during the year to certain of our clients. despite this unusual item, mutual fund commission revenues still increased $2 million, compared to fiscal year 2014. commission revenues on equity products have decreased in our canadian broker-dealer subsidiary as a result of the weaker canadian currency compared to the u.s. dollar, as well as the overall challenging canadian market conditions that existed throughout fiscal year 2015. commission earnings on fixed income products in fiscal year 2015 decreased primarily due to the continuation of historically low interest rates which continue to result in challenging fixed income market conditions.
total account and service fee revenues in fiscal year 2015 increased $52 million, or 13%. mutual fund and annuity service fees increased $37 million, or 17%, primarily as a result of an increase in education and marketing support ("ems") fees (which include no-transaction-fee ("ntf") program revenues), and mutual fund omnibus fees, all of which are paid to us by the mutual fund companies whose products we distribute.  during fiscal year 2014, we implemented technology changes in our ems program and standardized tiered service levels provided to many mutual fund companies, resulting in increased fees earned from ems arrangements. omnibus fees are generally based on the number of positions held in our client portfolios. increases in such revenues are a result of increases in the number of positions for existing fund families on the omnibus platform as well as new fund families joining the omnibus program during fiscal year 2015. client account and service fees in fiscal year 2015 increased $14 million, or 9%, as a result of the changes made in many of our fee schedules implemented since december 2013. in addition, transaction handling fees in fee-based accounts increased due to the increased number of transactions, fees generated in lieu of interest income from our multi-bank sweep program with unaffiliated banks increased due to higher average balances in the program, and sbl affiliate servicing fees increased (refer to the rj bank results of operations in this report for additional information on sbl activities) as sbl balances have continued to grow in fiscal year 2015.
pcg net interest is relatively unchanged in fiscal year 2015 compared to fiscal year 2014. net interest income arising from our broker-dealer margin lending activities in fiscal year 2015 decreased slightly compared to the fiscal year 2014 level, a slight decline in margin interest rates more than offset the impact of slightly higher average margin loan balances outstanding. the rate of growth in margin loan balances in fiscal year 2015 has been negatively impacted by the popularity of our sbl product offered by rj bank. as a result of the extremely low rate interest rate environment that existed during fiscal year 2015 and the related low net interest spreads earned, there was only a nominal impact on our net interest revenues resulting from changes in client cash balances.
total segment revenues in fiscal year 2015 increased 7%. the portion of total segment revenues that we consider to be recurring is approximately 75% at september 30, 2015, an increase from 72% at september 30, 2014.  assets in fee-based accounts in fiscal year 2015 increased more than average pcg client assets as clients continue to elect fee-based alternatives versus traditional transaction-based accounts. at september 30, 2015, such assets were $179.4 billion, an increase of 7% compared to the $167.7 billion as of september 30, 2014.
non-interest expenses in fiscal year 2015 increased $216 million, or 7%.  sales commission expense increased $167 million, or 8%, largely consistent with the 6% increase in commission and fee revenues, coupled with increased hiring bonuses resulting from the high level of recruiting activity in fiscal year 2015.  administrative and incentive compensation and benefits expense in fiscal year 2015 increased $34 million, or 7%, in part from annual increases in salary expenses, increases in employee benefit plan costs, and additional staffing levels, primarily in information technology functions, to support our continuing growth. business development expenses increased $12 million, or 14%, due to increased recruiting activity and the related incoming account transfer fee expenses, and conference and travel related expenses in fiscal year 2015.

the capital markets segment consists primarily of equity and fixed income products and services.  the activities include institutional sales and trading in the u.s., canada and europe; management of and participation in debt and equity public offerings; financial advisory services, including private placements and merger and acquisition services; public finance activities; and the syndication and related management of investment partnerships designed to yield returns in the form of low-income housing tax credits to institutions.  we provide securities brokerage services to institutions with an emphasis on the sale of u.s. and canadian equities and fixed income products. institutional sales commissions for both equity and fixed income products are driven primarily through trade volume, resulting from a combination of participation in public offerings, general market activity, and by the capital markets group's ability to find attractive investment opportunities and promote those opportunities to potential and existing clients.  revenues from investment banking activities are driven principally by our role in the offering and the number and dollar value of the transactions with which we are involved.  this segment also includes trading of taxable and tax-exempt fixed income products, as well as equity securities in the over-the-counter ("otc") and canadian markets.  this trading involves the purchase of securities from, and the sale of securities to, our clients as well as other dealers who may be purchasing or selling securities for their own account or acting as agent for their clients.  profits and losses related to this trading activity are primarily derived from the spreads between bid and ask prices, as well as market trends for the individual securities during the period we hold them.
no single client accounts for a material percentage of this segment's total business.

index year ended september 30, 2016 compared with the year ended september 30, 2015 - capital markets net revenues increased $40 million, or 4%, to nearly $1 billion. pre-tax income increased $32 million, or 30%, to $139 million.
commission revenues increased $13 million, or 2%. institutional fixed income commissions increased $32 million, or 11%, benefiting from increased activity during the year both in the anticipation of, and the aftermath resulting from, the eventual december 2015 federal reserve bank action to increase short-term interest rates, as well as the interest rate volatility in the markets during much of the fiscal year. offsetting this increase, institutional equity sales commissions decreased $19 million, or 8%, resulting primarily from decreased equity underwriting activities throughout most of fiscal year 2016.
underwriting revenues decreased by $20 million, or 27%, while merger and acquisition and advisory fees decreased $14 million, or 8%. the late september 2015 decline in the equity markets, coupled with market uncertainty in advance of the december 2015 federal reserve bank announcement and their related commentary on interest rates, combined to result in an unfavorable market environment for equity activities during much of the fiscal year. as a result, we experienced lower volumes in both our merger and acquisition advisory and underwriting activities throughout most of fiscal year 2016. while merger and acquisition and advisory fees are a volatile revenue source in general, the number of merger and acquisition transactions in fiscal year 2016, and especially in the first three months of the fiscal year, was particularly low. most of the decrease in our equity underwriting revenues results from our domestic operations. revenues from our canadian activities were relatively unchanged from the low amount generated in the prior year. the number of both lead-managed and co-managed underwritings in both our domestic and canadian operations decreased during fiscal year 2016 compared to fiscal year 2015.
we experienced solid performance in our public finance underwritings in the current year, which positively impacted both our securities commissions and fee revenues and our investment banking revenues. the combined revenues resulting from these public finance business activities increased 1% over the prior year level.
tax credit fund syndication fee revenues increased $15 million, or 33%, due to an increase in the volume of tax credit fund partnership interests sold during the current year. as a market leader amongst syndicators of low-income housing tax credit fund ("lihtc") investments, we achieved a new milestone in fiscal year 2016 by selling over $1 billion of such investments to institutional investors. additionally, we were able to recognize nearly $7 million in revenues that were associated with partnership interests sold in prior years which had been deferred in those years. current year recognition of these previously deferred revenues results from the favorable resolution of certain conditions associated with the partnership interests. as of september 30, 2016, approximately $11 million of previously deferred revenues remain to be recognized in future revenues, whenever such conditions for revenue recognition are fully satisfied.
our net trading profit increased $33 million, or 60%. trading profits generated in our fixed income operations increased approximately $27 million, reflecting solid results in most product categories. within our equity capital markets operations, the prior year included $5 million of realized trading losses attributable to an equity underwriting position held in our canadian subsidiary that did not recur in the current year.
other revenues increased $11 million, or 68%. these revenues include $5 million arising from revenues associated with our annual analyst best picks. foreign exchange gains associated with certain of our international operations increased $4 million.
non-interest expenses increased $10 million, or 1%.  sales commissions expense increased $6 million, or 3%, consistent with the 2% increase in institutional sales commission revenues. administrative and incentive compensation and benefit expense increased $5 million, or 1%, consistent with annual increases in salaries and increases in employee benefit plan costs. our business development expenses decreased $4 million, or 9%, reflecting the outcome of heightened expense management.
noncontrolling interests is primarily comprised of the net pre-tax impact (which are net losses) from the consolidation of certain low-income housing tax credit funds, with noncontrolling interests reflecting the portion of such losses that we do not own.  total segment expenses attributable to others approximate the prior year level.
year ended september 30, 2015 compared with the year ended september 30, 2014 - capital markets net revenues in fiscal year 2015 increased $7 million, or 1%, while pre-tax income decreased $24 million, or 18%.
institutional fixed income sales commissions in fiscal year 2015 increased $38 million, or 15%, benefiting from increased interest rate volatility and public finance activities during fiscal year 2015. offsetting this increase, institutional equity sales
49
index commissions decreased $14 million, or 5%, resulting primarily from decreased equity underwriting activities throughout fiscal year 2015, particularly in the energy and real estate sectors.
merger and acquisitions and advisory fee revenues in fiscal year 2015 increased $11 million, or 7%, reaching $162 million. we experienced significant increases in these revenues in fiscal year 2015 arising from our u.s. operations, led by our technology services sector and reflecting the benefit of prior years' investments in other business sectors. the portion of these revenues arising from our canadian operations decreased significantly due to the difficult canadian equity market conditions throughout fiscal year 2015, especially in the natural resources sector.
our net trading profits in fiscal year 2015 decreased $5 million, or 8%. typically, our trading profits are generated primarily from fixed income securities. however, in fiscal year 2015, the primary reason for the decrease is $5 million of realized trading losses arising in our canadian operations, primarily attributable to a loss on an equity underwriting position. despite the continuation of the challenging fixed income market conditions throughout fiscal year 2015, fixed income trading results were solid and steady throughout the year, assisted by the trading profits generated on gnma and fnma mbs.
underwriting fee revenues in fiscal year 2015 decreased $26 million, or 26%. equity underwriting activities related to both initial public offerings and follow-on offerings declined significantly in the fiscal year. the market sectors that historically represent our areas of strength had relatively lower activity levels during fiscal year 2015.
we experienced growth in our public finance underwritings in fiscal year 2015 with a 63% increase in the par value of lead managed new issues compared to the prior year. this increase favorably impacts both our securities commissions and fees revenues and our investment banking revenues. the combined revenues resulting from our public finance business activities in fiscal year 2015 increased $11 million, or 17%.
tax credit fund syndication fee revenues in fiscal year 2015 increased by $10 million, or 29%, due to a 17% increase in the volume of tax credit fund partnership interests sold during the year. our continued growth in this business over the past several years has resulted in our ascension to a market leading position amongst syndicators of lihtc investments.
non-interest expenses in fiscal year 2015 increased $26 million, or 3%. sales commissions expense increased $6 million, or 3%, which is correlated with the 5% increase in overall institutional sales commission revenues. business development expenses in fiscal year 2015 increased $4 million, or 9%, predominately in our equity capital markets operations, representing recruiting and other costs as they pursue opportunities for future growth and revenues. clearance and other expense increased $13 million, or 19%, primarily due to a higher volume of trades, as reflected by the increase in institutional sales commission revenues, and $3 million of expense related to historical european trading activities.
during fiscal year 2015, we made investments in our domestic equity capital markets business through successful recruiting of experienced professionals to broadly build out our life sciences sector capabilities and to increase investment banking coverage in the financial services, energy and government services sectors. while the immediate impact of these hires results in an increase in compensation expense, we believe the long-term result of these efforts will have a favorable impact on both revenues and net profits of the segment.
losses of real estate partnerships held by consolidated vies result directly from the consolidation of certain low-income housing tax credit funds, and in fiscal year 2015 decreased $3 million, or 6%, compared to fiscal year 2014. since we only hold an insignificant interest in these consolidated funds, nearly all of these losses are attributable to others and are therefore included in the offsetting noncontrolling interests. refer to note 11 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in this form 10-k for further information on the consolidation of vies.
noncontrolling interests includes the impact of consolidating certain low-income housing tax credit funds, which impacts other revenue, interest expense, and the losses of real estate partnerships held by consolidated vies (as described in the preceding paragraph), and reflects the portion of these consolidated entities which we do not own.  total segment expenses attributable to others in fiscal year 2015 decreased by $4 million, corresponding with the reduction in losses of real estate partnerships held by consolidated vies discussed in the preceding paragraph.

the asset management segment includes the operations of eagle, the eagle funds, ams, clarivest asset management, inc. ("clarivest"), cougar, rj trust, and other fee-based programs.  revenues for this segment are primarily generated by the investment advisory fees related to asset management services provided for individual and institutional investment portfolios, along with mutual funds.  we generate revenues in this segment by providing investment advisory and asset management services to either individual or institutional investment portfolios, along with mutual funds. investment advisory fee revenues are earned on the assets held in either managed or non-discretionary asset-based programs. these fees are computed based on balances either at the beginning of the quarter, the end of the quarter, or average daily assets. asset balances are impacted by both the performance of the market and the new sales and redemptions of client accounts/funds. rising markets have historically had a positive impact on investment advisory fee revenues as existing accounts increase in value, and individuals and institutions may commit incremental funds in rising markets.
no single client accounts for a material percentage of this segment's total business.
managed programs as of september 30, 2016, approximately 80% of investment advisory fees recorded in this segment are earned from assets held in managed programs.  of these revenues, approximately 70% of our investment advisory fees recorded each quarter are determined based on balances at the beginning of a quarter, approximately 15% are based on balances at the end of the quarter and the remaining 15% are computed based on average assets throughout the quarter.
in fiscal year 2015, rjf acquired cougar. eagle offers cougar's global asset allocation strategies to its clients worldwide. cougar has a substantial amount of assets under advisement, which are non-discretionary advised assets. see note 3 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in this form 10-k for additional information regarding the cougar acquisition. the majority of the assets managed by cougar are reflected in non-discretionary asset-based program balances.

(1)   the fiscal year 2016 net inflows include approximately $2.0 billion of client assets resulting from our acquisition of alex. brown.
(2)   the "other" category in the prior year includes $1.05 billion of assets that were previously included in eagle asset management, inc. programs which were transferred into non-discretionary asset-based programs. the asset balances in non-discretionary asset-based programs are discussed below.
non-discretionary asset-based programs as of september 30, 2016, approximately 20% of investment advisory fee revenues recorded in this segment are earned for administrative services on assets held in certain non-discretionary asset-based programs. these assets totaled $119.3 billion, $91.0 billion, and $81.3 billion as of september 30, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. the majority of the administrative fees associated with these programs are determined based on balances at the beginning of the quarter, with a portion based on month-end balances. all such fees are reflected within "non-discretionary asset-based administration" revenues in this segment's results of operations.
year ended september 30, 2016 compared with the year ended september 30, 2015 - asset management revenues increased $12 million, or 3%, to $404 million. pre-tax income decreased $3 million, or 2%, to $132 million.
52
index total investment advisory and related administrative fee revenues increased by $6 million, or 2%. revenues from non-discretionary asset-based administration activities increased $7 million, or 10%, primarily resulting from the 31% increase in assets held in such programs. assets arising from our alex. brown and 3macs acquisitions had little impact on revenues as the acquisitions occurred late in the fiscal year. offsetting this increase, advisory fee revenues from managed programs decreased by approximately $1 million. although financial assets under management increased $11.8 billion, or nearly 18% (net of assets managed for affiliated entities) compared to the prior year level, such balances have been lower on fee billing dates during the current year. also, a portion of the increase in assets arose from our acquisition of alex. brown which occurred late in the fiscal year.
other income increased $6 million, or 12%, resulting in part from rj trust which generated an increase in trust fee income arising from their 30% increase in trust assets from the prior year level. in addition, eagle received increased shareholder servicing fees and money market fee sharing related to the increase in interest rates.
expenses increased by approximately $16 million, or 6%, primarily resulting from an $11 million, or 11%, increase in administrative and incentive compensation expenses, a $2 million, or 3%, increase in investment sub-advisory fee expense, a $2 million, or 7%, increase in communications and information processing expense, and a $2 million, or 3%, increase in other expense. the increase in administrative and incentive compensation expenses results primarily from annual salary increases, increases in personnel to support the growth of the business and increases in certain employee benefit plan costs. in addition, the prior year incentive compensation expense included a reversal of certain incentive compensation expense accruals for associates who left the firm during the prior year; such a reversal did not recur in the current year. the increase in sub-advisory fee expense results from increased assets under management in applicable programs. the increase in communication and information processing expense results from increased costs in support of growth in the business. the increase in other expense is in part the result of an increase in revenue sharing with pcg, certain regulatory compliance and legal expenses, and certain incremental costs associated with cougar including amortization of intangible assets arising from the acquisition.
noncontrolling interests includes the impact of the consolidation of certain subsidiary investment advisors and other subsidiaries. the portion of net income attributable to noncontrolling interests decreased $1 million compared to the prior year as a result of the reduction in the amount of performance fee revenues earned in the current year that are attributable to others.
year ended september 30, 2015 compared to the year ended september 30, 2014 - asset management pre-tax income in the asset management segment in fiscal year 2015 increased $7 million, or 5%.
investment advisory fee revenue in fiscal year 2015 increased by $21 million, or 6%, generated by an increase in assets under management that resulted from net inflows of client assets. market values depreciated primarily as a result of the equity market decline that occurred during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2015. performance fees, which are earned by managed funds for exceeding certain performance targets, amounted to $5 million in fiscal year 2015, a decrease of $5 million from the amount earned in the prior year.
other revenue in fiscal year 2015 increased by $2 million, or 4%, primarily resulting from an increase in fee income generated by rj trust, reflecting a 4% increase in rj trust client assets compared to the prior year, to $3.51 billion as of september 30, 2015.
expenses increased in fiscal year 2015 by approximately $18 million, or 8%, primarily resulting from an $8 million, or 18%, increase in investment sub-advisory fees, a $3 million, or 16%, increase in communications and information support processing expense, and a $7 million, or 14%, increase in other expenses. the increase in investment sub-advisory fee expense in fiscal year 2015 is primarily attributable to increased fees paid to external managers for raymond james consulting services and uma programs, which both experienced increases in asset levels compared to the prior year. the fiscal year 2015 increase in communications and information processing expense result from additional costs associated with supporting the steadily increasing levels of assets under management as well as the growth in asset levels in our non-discretionary asset-based programs. the increase in other expense in fiscal year 2015 is primarily due to eagle's share of certain costs incurred in the organization and start-up of a new fund in which eagle serves as the sub-advisor.
noncontrolling interests includes the impact of the consolidation of certain subsidiary investment advisors and other subsidiaries (including clarivest). total segment net income attributable to others in fiscal year 2015 decreased $2 million compared to the prior year primarily as a result of a reduction in the amount of performance fee revenues earned in fiscal year 2015 that were attributable to others.

index increases and decreases in interest income and interest expense result from changes in average balances (volume) of interest-earning banking assets and liabilities, as well as changes in average interest rates. the following table shows the effect that these factors had on the interest earned on rj bank's interest-earning assets and the interest incurred on its interest-bearing liabilities. the effect of changes in volume is determined by multiplying the change in volume by the previous period's average yield/cost. similarly, the effect of rate changes is calculated by multiplying the change in average yield/cost by the previous year's volume. changes applicable to both volume and rate have been allocated proportionately.

index year ended september 30, 2016 compared with the year ended september 30, 2015 - rj bank net revenues increased $80 million, or 19%, to $494 million. pre-tax income increased $59 million, or 21%, to $337 million.
the increase in pre-tax income was primarily attributable to a $75 million, or 19%, increase in net interest income and a $5 million, or 43%, increase in other income, offset by an increase of $5 million, or 20%, in the provision for loan losses, and a $16 million, or 15%, increase in non-interest expenses (excluding provision for loan losses).
the $75 million increase in net interest income was the result of a $2.6 billion increase in average interest-earning banking assets partially offset by a small decline in net interest margin. the increase in average interest-earning banking assets was driven by a $2.2 billion increase in average loans and a $443 million increase in average cash and investments. the increase in average loans was comprised of a $1.4 billion, or 16%, increase in average corporate loans, a $444 million, or 35%, increase in average sbl balances, and a $291 million, or 15%, increase in average residential mortgage loans. the net interest margin decreased to 3.04% from 3.07% due to an increase in average, lower-yielding cash balances in addition to an increase in total cost of funds to 0.16% from 0.10%. the average interest-earning banking assets yield increased slightly to 3.18% from 3.15% compared to the prior year primarily due to an increase in the loan portfolio yield to 3.42% from 3.34%. this resulted primarily from the federal reserve bank's december 2015 increase in short-term interest rates. the increase in total cost of funds primarily resulted from an increase in deposit and borrowing costs, which includes additional expense from our interest rate hedging activities. borrowing costs increased to 1.81% from 0.61% in the prior year.
corresponding to the increase in average interest-earning banking assets, average interest-bearing banking liabilities increased $2.4 billion to $14.3 billion.
the increase in the provision for loan losses as compared to the prior year is primarily due to higher corporate loan growth, the charges during the current year related to loans outstanding within the energy sector, as well as additional provision for corporate loan downgrades resulting in higher criticized loans as compared to the prior year. the provision for loan losses also reflects the offsetting impact of improved credit characteristics from the continued decline in residential mortgage loan delinquencies and nonperforming loans.
other income increased $5 million as compared to prior year primarily due to increases in affiliate income related to the current year growth in securities-based lending, gains realized from the sale of available for sale securities, trading gains as a result of higher sales of small business administration ("sba") loan securitizations, and lower foreign exchange losses.
non-interest expenses (excluding provision for loan losses) increased $16 million as compared to the prior year. the current year expense included an $8 million increase in affiliate deposit account servicing fees and a $4 million increase in fdic insurance premiums both resulting from the increase in deposit balances. other increases in non-interest expense included a $2 million increase in sbl affiliate fees due to increased sbl balances, a $2 million increase in communications and information processing expense, a $2 million increase in compensation and benefits resulting from salary increases and staff additions, and a $1 million increase in equity losses related to rj bank's investment in low income housing tax credit projects (these losses are by design of the investment structure, income tax credits not reflected in the pre-tax operating results of the segment are received by rjf which net an overall positive return on such investments). these increases in non-interest expenses were partially offset by a $3 million decrease in expense related to the reserve for unfunded lending commitments.
year ended september 30, 2015 compared to the year ended september 30, 2014 - rj bank pre-tax income in the rj bank segment in fiscal year 2015 increased $36 million, or 15% compared to fiscal year 2014.  the increase in pre-tax income in fiscal year 2015 was primarily attributable to a $63 million, or 18%, increase in net revenues, offset by an increase of $10 million, or 74%, in the provision for loan losses and a $17 million, or 17%, increase in non-interest expenses (excluding the provision for loan losses). the increase in net revenues in fiscal year 2015 was attributable to a $57 million increase in net interest income and a $6 million increase in other income.
the $57 million increase in net interest income in fiscal year 2015 was the result of a $1.6 billion increase in average interest-earning banking assets and an increase in the net interest margin compared to fiscal year 2014. the increase in average interest-earning banking assets in fiscal year 2015 was primarily driven by a $2.1 billion increase in average loans offset by a $440 million decrease in average cash and investments. in fiscal year 2015, average corporate loans increased $1.4 billion, or 19%, average sbl balances increased $488 million, or 62%, and average residential mortgage loans increased $173 million, or 10%. the yield on interest-earning banking assets increased to 3.15% from 3.04% due to an improvement in the earning-asset composition from lower-yielding cash and investments to a larger percentage of higher yielding loans in fiscal year 2015. the loan portfolio yield
61
index decreased slightly in fiscal year 2015 to 3.34% from 3.39% in fiscal year 2014. primarily as a result of the increase in the yield of the average interest-earning banking assets in fiscal year 2015, the net interest margin increased to 3.07% from 2.98%.
corresponding to the increase in average interest-earning banking assets, average interest-bearing banking liabilities in fiscal year 2015 increased $1.4 billion to $11.9 billion.
the increase in other income in fiscal year 2015 was due to a decrease of $4 million in foreign currency losses, a $1 million increase resulting from held for sale loan activities, and a $1 million increase in gains from the sale of foreclosed properties.
a significant portion of the provision for loan losses in both fiscal year 2015 and 2014 resulted from loan portfolio growth in each year. the primary factors impacting the year over year increase in provision for loan losses in fiscal year 2015 results from the varying impact of credit characteristics which were particular to fiscal year 2015 and 2014. the fiscal year 2015 provision for loan losses was impacted by an increase in corporate criticized loans, which was partially offset by the impact of improved credit characteristics of the residential mortgage loan portfolio. fiscal year 2014 benefited to a greater extent than fiscal year 2015 from the improved credit characteristics of the loan portfolio including a decrease in corporate criticized loans.
the $17 million increase in non-interest expenses (excluding the provision for loan losses) in fiscal year 2015 was primarily attributable to a $3 million, or 68%, increase in sbl affiliate fees due to increases in sbl balances; a $2 million, or 5%, increase in affiliate deposit account servicing fees related to increased deposit balances; a $2 million increase in expenses related to the reserve for unfunded lending commitments; a $2 million or 17% increase in fdic insurance premiums; a $2 million, or 9%, increase in compensation and benefits resulting from annual raises and increases in the costs of certain employee benefit programs coupled with increases in the number of personnel; a $1 million, or 22%, increase in communications and information processing expense; and a $1 million increase of expense related to other taxes.

this segment results include our principal capital and private equity activities, certain corporate overhead costs of rjf including the interest cost on our public debt, and the acquisition and integration costs associated with certain acquisitions (including for fiscal year 2016, acquisition costs associated with our acquisitions of alex. brown, 3macs and mummert, see note 3 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements in this form 10-k for additional information).
year ended september 30, 2016 compared to the year ended september 30, 2015 - other the pre-tax loss generated by this segment increased by approximately $84 million, or 129%.
62
index total revenues in this segment decreased $21 million, or 31%. private equity gains included in other revenues decreased by $24 million, or 50%. realized gains on the sale of ars securities decreased by $11 million due to the nonrecurring prior year gain on the sale of all of our jefferson county, alabama limited obligation school warrants ars. offsetting these decreases, prior year foreign exchange losses of $5 million arising from certain canadian denominated liabilities did not recur in the current year, and interest income increased $5 million resulting from the increase in interest rates and higher corporate cash balances throughout most of the current year.
interest expense increased $1 million, or 1%. the most significant component of the increase was the interest expense incurred on our senior notes, which increased by $2 million, or 3% as the average outstanding balance increased due to our july 2016 issuance of $800 million of senior notes payable. the new issuances more than offset the impact of the april 2016 repayment of $250 million in maturing senior notes. see note 17 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in this form 10-k for additional information.
compensation and other expense increased $20 million, or 49%. of the increase, $6 million is due to increases in expenses associated with certain corporate benefit plans provided to associates, $5 million is the result of an increase in corporate charitable donations, and $4 million is the result of additional executive compensation expense resulting from the favorable results of operations and new personnel.
the acquisition-related expenses pertain to incremental expenses incurred in connection with our acquisitions of alex. brown, 3macs and mummert. see note 3 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in this form 10-k for information regarding the components of these expenses.
the portion of revenue attributable to noncontrolling interests increased $2 million, despite the decrease in total gains generated in the private equity portfolio. in the prior year, we had significant gains on certain investments in which a relatively small portion was attributable to others. in the current year, gains on those investments did not recur, and thus a larger portion of our total gains were attributable to others.
year ended september 30, 2015 compared to the year ended september 30, 2014 - other the pre-tax loss generated by this segment in fiscal year 2015 decreased by approximately $19 million, or 23%.
net revenues in this segment in fiscal year 2015 increased $25 million, or 71%. the increase in fiscal year 2015 results from a $25 million increase in revenues arising from our principal capital and private equity portfolio investments. we also realized an increase in fiscal year 2015 revenues arising from the sale or redemption activities in our ars portfolio of $4 million, which were offset by certain foreign currency translation losses that primarily result from the weakened canadian dollar, and decreases in the valuation of other investments (primarily in managed equities). the fiscal year 2015 ars portfolio gain is primarily the result of an $11 million gain on the sale of all of our jefferson county, alabama limited obligation school warrants ars. in the fiscal year 2014, gains resulting from sales and redemption activities in our ars portfolio were primarily comprised of a $5.5 million gain on the redemption of jefferson county alabama sewer revenue refunding warrants ars.
the portion of revenue attributable to noncontrolling interests in fiscal year 2015 increased $8 million, as the increase in revenues generated by our private equity portfolio resulted in higher amounts of such revenues that are attributable to others.

liquidity and capital resources liquidity is essential to our business.  the primary goal of our liquidity management activities is to ensure adequate funding to conduct our business over a range of market environments.
senior management establishes our liquidity and capital policies. these policies include senior management's review of short- and long-term cash flow forecasts, review of monthly capital expenditures, the monitoring of the availability of alternative sources of financing, and the daily monitoring of liquidity in our significant subsidiaries. our decisions on the allocation of capital to our business units consider, among other factors, projected profitability and cash flow, risk and impact on future liquidity needs. our treasury department assists in evaluating, monitoring and controlling the impact that our business activities have on our financial condition, liquidity and capital structure as well as maintains our relationships with various lenders. the objectives of these policies are to support the successful execution of our business strategies while ensuring ongoing and sufficient liquidity.
liquidity is provided primarily through our business operations and financing activities.  financing activities could include bank borrowings, repurchase agreement transactions or additional capital raising activities under our "universal" shelf registration statement.
cash used in operating activities during the year ended september 30, 2016 was $518 million. successful operating results generated a $650 million increase in cash.
increases in cash from operations include:
•   an increase in brokerage client payables had a $1.82 billion favorable impact on cash. the increase largely results from two factors. first, many clients reacted to uncertainties in the equity markets by increasing the cash balances in their brokerage accounts. second, our brokerage client account balances increased as a result of our fiscal year 2016 acquisitions of alex. brown and 3macs. cumulatively, these two factors result in the increase in brokerage client payables and a corresponding increase in assets segregated pursuant to regulations which is discussed below.
•   stock loaned, net of stock borrowed, increased $153 million.
•   accrued compensation, commissions and benefits increased $46 million as a result of the increased financial results we achieved in fiscal year 2016.
offsetting these, decreases in cash used in operations resulted from:
•   a $1.95 billion increase in assets segregated pursuant to regulations and other segregated assets, primarily resulting from the increase in client cash balances described above.
64
index
•   an increase in our brokerage client receivables and other receivables of $621 million.
•   loans provided to financial advisors, net of repayments, increased resulting in the use of $345 million in cash. the increase in loans was due in part to retention incentives provided to financial advisors joining us as a result of our alex. brown and 3macs acquisitions. in addition, loans provided to recruited financial advisors resulted from organic growth.
•   an increase in securities purchased under agreements to resell, net of securities sold under agreements to repurchase, used $135 million.
•   purchases and originations of loans held for sale, net of proceeds from sales and securitizations, resulted in a $101 million decrease.
investing activities resulted in the use of $2.98 billion of cash during the year ended september 30, 2016.
the primary investing activities were:
•   an increase in bank loans used $2.28 billion.
•   purchases of available for sale investments held at rj bank, net of proceeds from maturations, repayments and sales within the portfolio, used $356 million.
•   our acquisitions of alex. brown, 3macs, and mummert, net of the cash acquired in such transactions, used $175 million.
•   the investment in fixed assets, predominately internally-developed computer software, used $122 million.
•   the funding of other investments used $40 million.
financing activities provided $2.58 billion of cash during the year ended september 30, 2016.
increases in cash from financing activities resulted from:
•   rj bank deposit balance increases provided $2.34 billion.
•   proceeds of $542 million from the issuance of senior notes, net of repayments of scheduled maturities and debt issuance costs.
•   proceeds of $43 million from the exercise of stock options and employee stock purchases.
•   proceeds of $25 million from fhlb borrowings.
offsetting these, decreases in cash from financing activities resulted from:
•   our repurchase of $163 million of rjf shares, including $144.5 million used for repurchases pursuant to a share repurchase authorization (see part ii - item 5 in this report, for additional information on our share repurchases).
•   repayments of our short-term borrowings of $115 million.
•   payment of dividends to our shareholders of $113 million.
the effect of currency exchange rates on our cash balances has resulted in a $29 million decrease in our u.s. dollar denominated cash balance during the year ended september 30, 2016. this effect is primarily attributable to cash balances we have that are denominated in canadian currency. while the canadian dollar to u.s. dollar exchange rate increased 1.7% since september 30, 2015, which has a favorable impact on this measure, the amount of our cash balance denominated in canadian currency has also increased, the effect of which more than offsets the favorable impact of the change in exchange rates.
we believe our existing assets, most of which are liquid in nature, together with funds generated from operations and committed and uncommitted financing facilities, should provide adequate funds for continuing operations at current levels of activity.

index sources of liquidity approximately $810 million of our total september 30, 2016 cash and cash equivalents (a portion of which resides in a deposit account at rj bank) was available to the parent company without restrictions.  the cash and cash equivalents held were as follows:

other subsidiaries                        166,387
total cash and cash equivalents        $1,650,452
(1)   rjf maintains a depository account at rj bank which has a balance of $350 million as of september 30, 2016. this cash balance is reflected in the rjf total, and is excluded from the rj bank total, since this balance is available to rjf on-demand and without restriction.
(2)   rjf has loaned $828 million to rj&amp;a as of september 30, 2016 (a portion of which is included in the rj&amp;a cash balance presented in this table), which rj&amp;a has invested on behalf of rjf in cash and cash equivalents or otherwise deployed in its normal business activities.
in addition to the cash balances described above, we have other various potential sources of cash available to the parent from subsidiaries which are described in the following section.
at september 30, 2016 the rjf loan to rj&a was $828 million. of this balance, $371 million was not held in cash. rj&a has other means of raising cash that include borrowings on committed or uncommitted facilities that are described in the following sections. were rj&a to have made such borrowings as of september 30, 2016, cash available to the parent at such time would have approximated $1.18 billion rather than the $810 million of cash available to the parent on september 30, 2016 presented above.
liquidity available from subsidiaries liquidity is principally available to the parent company from rj&a and rj bank.
rj&a is required to maintain net capital equal to the greater of $1 million or 2% of aggregate debit balances arising from client balances. covenants in rj&a's committed secured financing facilities require its net capital to be a minimum of 10% of aggregate debit items.  at september 30, 2016, rj&a significantly exceeded both the minimum regulatory and its financing covenants net capital requirements. at that date, rj&a had excess net capital of approximately $460 million, of which approximately $120 million is available for dividend while still maintaining the internally targeted net capital ratio of 15% of aggregate debit items.  there are also limitations on the amount of dividends that may be declared by a broker-dealer without finra approval.
rj bank may pay dividends to the parent company without the prior approval of its regulator as long as the dividend does not exceed the sum of rj bank's current calendar year and the previous two calendar years' retained net income, and rj bank maintains its targeted capital to risk-weighted assets ratios.  at september 30, 2016, rj bank had approximately $194 million of capital in excess of the amount it would need at september 30, 2016 to maintain its internally targeted total capital to risk-weighted assets ratio of 12.5%, and could pay a dividend of such amount without requiring prior approval of its regulator.
although we have liquidity available to us from our other subsidiaries, the available amounts are not as significant as the amounts described above, and in certain instances may be subject to regulatory requirements.

(1)   our ability to borrow is dependent upon compliance with the conditions in the various committed loan agreements and collateral eligibility requirements.
(2)   lenders are under no contractual obligation to lend to us under uncommitted credit facilities.
(3)   as of september 30, 2016, we had outstanding borrowings under two uncommitted secured borrowing arrangements with lenders.
(4)   we generally utilize the rj&amp;a facilities to finance a portion of our fixed income securities trading instruments.
(5)   this financing arrangement is primarily denominated in canadian dollars, amounts presented in the table have been converted to u.s. dollars at the currency exchange rate in effect as of september 30, 2016.
the committed financing arrangements are in the form of either tri-party repurchase agreements or secured lines of credit, or in the case of the rjf credit facility, an unsecured line of credit.  the uncommitted financing arrangements are in the form of secured lines of credit, secured bilateral or tri-party repurchase agreements, or unsecured lines of credit.
we maintain three unsecured settlement lines of credit available to our argentine joint venture in the aggregate amount of $12 million. of the aggregate amount, one settlement line for $9 million is guaranteed by rjf. we had no borrowings outstanding on these lines of credit as of september 30, 2016.
rj bank had $575 million in fhlb borrowings outstanding at september 30, 2016, comprised of two floating-rate advances, totaling $550 million and a $25 million fixed-rate advance, all of which are secured by a blanket lien on rj bank's residential loan portfolio (see note 15 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in this form 10-k for additional information regarding these borrowings). rj bank has an additional $1.1 billion in immediate credit available from the fhlb as of september 30, 2016 and total available credit of 30% of total assets with the pledge of additional collateral to the fhlb.
rj bank is eligible to participate in the fed's discount-window program; however, rj bank does not view borrowings from the fed as a primary source of funding.  the credit available in this program is subject to periodic review, may be terminated or reduced at the discretion of the fed, and would be secured by pledged c&i loans.
from time to time we purchase short-term securities under agreements to resell ("reverse repurchase agreements") and sell securities under agreements to repurchase ("repurchase agreements").  we account for each of these types of transactions as collateralized financings with the outstanding balances on the repurchase agreements included in securities sold under agreements to repurchase.  at september 30, 2016, collateralized financings outstanding in the amount of $193 million are included in securities sold under agreements to repurchase on the consolidated statements of financial condition included in this form 10-k. of this total, outstanding balances on the uncommitted secured agreements (which are reflected in the table of financing arrangements
67
index above) were $185 million as of september 30, 2016.  there were no outstanding balances on committed facilities as of september 30, 2016. borrowings on these secured or unsecured facilities are generally collateralized by non-customer, rj&a owned securities.  the required market value of the collateral associated with the committed secured facilities ranges from 102% to 140% of the amount financed.
the average daily balance outstanding during the five most recent successive quarters, the maximum month-end balance outstanding during the quarter and the period-end balances for repurchase agreements and reverse repurchase agreements of rjf are as follows:
repurchase transactions                                                                                                                                 reverse repurchase transactions for the quarter ended:         average daily balance outstanding            maximum month-end balance outstanding during the quarter              end of period balance outstanding            average daily balance outstanding            maximum month-end balance outstanding during the quarter              end of period balance outstanding

at september 30, 2016, in addition to the financing arrangements described above, we had $33 million outstanding on a mortgage loan for our st. petersburg, florida home-office complex, that is included in other borrowings in our consolidated statements of financial condition.
at september 30, 2016 we have senior notes payable of $1.70 billion. our senior notes payable, exclusive of any unaccreted premiums or discounts and debt issuance costs, is comprised of $300 million par 8.60% senior notes due august 2019, $250 million par 5.625% senior notes due 2024, $500 million par 3.625% senior notes due 2026, $350 million par 6.90% senior notes due 2042, and $300 million par 4.95% senior notes due july 2046. see note 17 in the notes to the consolidated financial statements in this form 10-k for additional information.
our current senior long-term debt ratings are:
rating agency                                            rating   outlook standard &amp; poor's ratings services ("s&amp;p") (1)   bbb      positive moody's investors services ("moody's") (2)               baa2     positive
(1)    the s&p rating and outlook are as presented in their september 2016 report.
(2)    the moody's rating and outlook are as presented in their june 2016 report.
our current long-term debt ratings depend upon a number of factors including industry dynamics, operating and economic environment, operating results and margins, earnings trends and volatility, balance sheet composition, liquidity and liquidity management, our capital structure, our overall risk management, business diversification and market share, and competitive position in the markets in which we operate. deteriorations in any of these factors could impact our credit ratings.  any rating downgrades could increase our costs in the event we were to pursue obtaining additional financing.
should our credit rating be downgraded prior to a public debt offering it is probable that we would have to offer a higher rate of interest to bond holders.  a downgrade to below investment grade may make a public debt offering difficult to execute on terms we would consider to be favorable.  a downgrade below investment grade could result in the termination of certain derivative contracts and the counterparties to the derivative instruments could request immediate payment or demand immediate and ongoing overnight collateralization on our derivative instruments in liability positions (see note 18 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in this form 10-k for additional information). a credit downgrade could create a reputational issue and could also result in certain counterparties limiting their business with us, result in negative comments by analysts and potentially impact investor perception of us, and resultantly impact our stock price and/or our clients' perception of us. a credit downgrade would result in rjf incurring a higher commitment fee on any unused balance on one of its borrowing arrangements, the $300 million revolving credit facility, in addition to triggering a higher interest rate applicable to any borrowings outstanding on that line as of
68
index and subsequent to such downgrade. conversely, an improvement in rjf's current credit rating would have a favorable impact on the commitment fee as well as the interest rate applicable to any borrowings on such line. none of our credit agreements contain a condition or event of default related to our credit ratings.
other sources of liquidity we own life insurance policies which are utilized to fund certain non-qualified deferred compensation plans and other employee benefit plans. the policies which we could readily borrow against have a cash surrender value of approximately $323 million as of september 30, 2016 and we are able to borrow up to 90%, or $291 million of the september 30, 2016 total, without restriction.  to effect any such borrowing, the underlying investments would be converted to money market investments. thus, a portion of any such borrowings could require us to take market risks as a component of our cost associated with the borrowing. there are no borrowings outstanding against any of these policies as of september 30, 2016.
on may 22, 2015 we filed a "universal" shelf registration statement with the sec to be in a position to access the capital markets if and when necessary or perceived by us to be opportune. in july 2016, we chose to access such markets to issue senior notes, see note 17 in the notes to the consolidated financial statements in this form 10-k for additional information.
see the "contractual obligations" section below for information regarding our contractual obligations.
potential impact of morgan keegan matters subject to indemnification by regions on our liquidity as more fully described in note 21 in the notes to consolidated financial statements in this form 10-k, under the agreement with regions governing our 2012 acquisition of morgan keegan, regions is obligated to indemnify rjf for losses we may incur in connection with any morgan keegan legal proceedings pending as of the closing date for that transaction (which was april 2, 2012), or commenced after the closing date but related to pre-closing matters received prior to april 2, 2015. as a result of the indemnity, we do not anticipate the resolution of any pre-closing date morgan keegan litigation matters to negatively impact our liquidity (see note 21 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in this form 10-k, and part i item 3 - legal proceedings, in this report, for further information regarding the nature of the pre-closing date matters).
statement of financial condition analysis the assets on our consolidated statement of financial condition consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents (a large portion of which is segregated for the benefit of clients), receivables including bank loans, financial instruments held for either trading purposes or as investments, and other assets.  a significant portion of our assets are liquid in nature, providing us with flexibility in financing our business.
total assets of $31.6 billion at september 30, 2016 are approximately $5.13 billion, or 19%, greater than our total assets as of september 30, 2015. net bank loans receivable increased $2.22 billion primarily due to the growth of rj bank's corporate loan portfolio during the year. additionally, assets segregated pursuant to federal regulations (for the benefit of our clients) increased $1.98 billion, most significantly due to the increase in our brokerage client payable balances discussed in the following paragraph, in addition to a number of other less significant factors. brokerage client receivables increased $529 million primarily resulting from an increase in margin loan balances arising from our acquisition of alex. brown. loans to financial advisors increased $350 million resulting from both retention incentives provided to financial advisors joining us as a result of our alex. brown and 3macs acquisitions, as well as loans provided to recruited financial advisors resulting from organic growth. available for sale securities increased $346 million primarily resulting from an increase in such investments held by rj bank. our intangible assets and goodwill increased $127 million primarily as a result of our fiscal year 2016 acquisitions of alex. brown, 3macs, and mummert. offsetting the increases in assets, our cash and cash equivalents balance decreased $951 million, refer to the discussion of the components of this decrease in the "liquidity and capital resources" section within this item 7.
as of september 30, 2016, our liabilities of $26.4 billion were $4.76 billion, or 22% more than our liabilities as of september 30, 2015. the increase is primarily due to a $2.34 billion increase in bank deposit liabilities as rj bank retained a higher portion of rjbdp balances to in part, fund a portion of their net loan growth. brokerage client payable balances increased $1.77 billion, reflecting increases in client cash balances in brokerage accounts due to clients reacting to uncertain equity markets since september 30, 2015 by holding more cash, as well as an increase in client accounts resulting from our acquisitions of alex. brown and 3macs. our outstanding balance of senior notes payable increased $543 million which is the net result of our july 2016 issuance of $500 million 3.625% senior notes and $300 million 4.95% senior notes and the $250 million april 2016 repayment upon maturity of our 4.25% senior notes. trade and other accounts payable decreased $139 million primarily resulting from a
69
index decrease of $108 million in the liability associated with morgan keegan legal matter contingencies which were subject to indemnification (see note 21 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements in this form 10-k for additional information).

critical accounting estimates the consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with gaap, which require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during any reporting period in our consolidated financial statements. management has established detailed policies and control procedures intended to ensure the appropriateness of such estimates and assumptions and their consistent application from period to period. for a description of our significant accounting policies, see note 2 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in this form 10-k.
we believe that of our accounting estimates and assumptions, those described below involve a high degree of judgment and complexity. due to their nature, estimates involve judgment based upon available information. actual results or amounts could differ from estimates and the difference could have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. therefore, understanding these critical accounting estimates is important in understanding the reported results of our operations and our financial position.
valuation of certain financial instruments, investments and other assets the use of fair value to measure financial instruments, with related gains or losses recognized in our consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income, is fundamental to our financial statements and our risk management processes.
"trading instruments" and "available for sale securities" are reflected in the consolidated statements of financial condition at fair value or amounts that approximate fair value. unrealized gains and losses related to these financial instruments are reflected in our net income or our total comprehensive income, depending on the underlying purpose of the instrument.
we measure the fair value of our financial instruments in accordance with gaap, which defines fair value, establishes a framework that we use to measure fair value and provides for certain disclosures we provide about our fair value measurements included in our financial statements.
fair value is defined by gaap as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between willing market participants on the measurement date. we determine the fair values of our financial instruments and any other assets and liabilities required by gaap to be recognized at fair value in the financial statements as of the close of business of each financial statement reporting period. these fair value determination processes also apply to any of our impairment tests or assessments performed for nonfinancial instruments such as goodwill, identifiable intangible assets, certain real estate owned and other long-lived assets.
in determining the fair value of our financial instruments in accordance with gaap, we use various valuation approaches, including market and/or income approaches. fair value is a market-based measure considered from the perspective of a market participant. as such, even when assumptions from market participants are not readily available, our own assumptions reflect those that we believe market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability at the measurement date. gaap provides for the following three levels to be used to classify our fair value measurements:
level 1-financial instruments included in level 1 are highly liquid instruments with quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. these include equity securities traded in active markets and certain u. s. treasury securities, other governmental obligations, or publicly traded corporate debt securities.
level 2-financial instruments reported in level 2 include those that have pricing inputs that are other than quoted prices in active markets, but which are either directly or indirectly observable as of the reporting date (i.e. prices for similar instruments). instruments that are generally included in this category are equity securities that are not actively traded, corporate obligations infrequently traded, certain government and municipal obligations, interest rate swaps, certain asset-backed securities ("abs"), certain collateralized mortgage obligations ("cmos"), certain mbs, certain other derivative instruments, brokered certificate
72
index of deposits, corporate loans and nonrecurring fair value measurements for certain loans held for sale, impaired loans and other real estate owned ("oreo").
level 3-financial instruments reported in level 3 have little, if any, market activity and are measured using our best estimate of fair value, where the inputs into the determination of fair value are both significant to the fair value measurement and unobservable. these valuations require significant judgment or estimation. instruments in this category generally include: equity securities with unobservable inputs such as those investments made in our principal capital activities, certain non-agency abs, pools of interest-only sba loan strips ("i/o strips"), certain municipal and corporate obligations which include ars, and nonrecurring fair value measurements for certain impaired loans.
gaap requires that we maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when performing our fair value measurements. the availability of observable inputs can vary from instrument to instrument and in certain cases, the inputs used to measure fair value may fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy. in such cases, an instrument's level within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. our assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement of an instrument requires judgment and consideration of factors specific to the instrument.
see notes 5, 6, 7 and 18 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in this form 10-k for additional information on our financial instruments.
investments in private equity measured at net asset value per share effective september 30, 2016, we adopted new accounting guidance related to the classification and disclosure of certain investments using the net asset value ("nav") as a practical expedient to measure the fair value of the investment. among its provisions, this new guidance eliminates, for all investments in which fair value is measured using nav as a practical expedient, the requirement to categorize such investments within the fair value hierarchy. we have retroactively applied this new guidance to investments held in the prior fiscal year. as a practical expedient, we utilize nav or its equivalent to determine the recorded value of a portion of our private equity portfolio. we utilize nav when the fund investment does not have a readily determinable fair value and the nav of the fund is calculated in a manner consistent with the measurement principles of investment company accounting, including measurement of the investments at fair value. see note 5 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in this form 10-k for additional information on our private equity investments measured at nav.
level 3 assets and liabilities as of september 30, 2016, 8% of our total assets and 3% of our total liabilities are financial instruments measured at fair value on a recurring basis. in comparison as of september 30, 2015, financial instruments measured at fair value on a recurring basis represented 7% of our total assets and 3% of our total liabilities.
financial instruments measured at fair value on a recurring basis categorized as level 3 amount to $215 million as of september 30, 2016 and represent 9% of our assets measured at fair value. of the level 3 assets as of september 30, 2016, our ars positions comprise $125 million, or 58%, and our private equity investments not measured at nav comprise $83 million, or 39%, of the total.  our level 3 assets decreased $9 million, or 4%, as compared to the september 30, 2015 level. our ars portfolio decreased approximately $14 million compared to september 30, 2015, primarily resulting from decreases in the valuation of the portfolio, and to a lesser extent, sales and redemption activities (see notes 5 and 7 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in this form 10-k for additional information). offsetting this decrease, our private equity investments not measured at nav increased $6 million as valuation increases more than offset the net impact of capital contributed/distributions received. level 3 assets represent 4% of total equity as of september 30, 2016, reflecting a decrease from the 5% of total equity measure as of september 30, 2015.
financial instruments which are liabilities categorized as level 3 amount are insignificant as of both september 30, 2016 and 2015.
valuation techniques the fair value for certain of our financial instruments is derived using pricing models and other valuation techniques that involve significant management judgment. the price transparency of financial instruments is a key determinant of the degree of judgment involved in determining the fair value of our financial instruments. financial instruments for which actively quoted prices or pricing parameters are available will generally have a higher degree of price transparency than financial instruments that
73
index are thinly traded or not quoted. in accordance with gaap, the criteria used to determine whether the market for a financial instrument is active or inactive is based on the particular asset or liability. for equity securities, our definition of actively traded is based on average daily volume and other market trading statistics. we have determined the market for certain other types of financial instruments, including certain cmos, abs, certain collateralized debt obligations and ars, to be volatile, uncertain or inactive as of both september 30, 2016 and 2015. as a result, the valuation of these financial instruments included significant management judgment in determining the relevance and reliability of market information available. we considered the inactivity of the market to be evidenced by several factors, including a continued decreased price transparency caused by decreased volume of trades relative to historical levels, stale transaction prices and transaction prices that varied significantly either over time or among market makers.
the level within the fair value hierarchy, specific valuation techniques, and other significant accounting policies pertaining to certain financial instruments with the most significant carrying values that are presented in our consolidated statements of financial condition as of september 30, 2016 are described below.
trading instruments and trading instruments sold but not yet purchased trading securities are comprised primarily of the financial instruments held by our broker-dealer subsidiaries (see note 6 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in this form 10-k for more information). when available, we use quoted prices in active markets to determine the fair value of these securities. such instruments are classified within level 1 of the fair value hierarchy. examples include exchange traded equity securities and liquid government debt securities. as of september 30, 2016, 4% of our gross trading security assets and 62% of our gross trading securities sold but not yet purchased, are classified as level 1 of the fair value hierarchy.
when trading securities are traded in secondary markets and quoted market prices do not exist for such securities, we utilize valuation techniques, including matrix pricing, to estimate fair value. matrix pricing generally utilizes spread-based models periodically re-calibrated to observable inputs such as market trades, or to dealer price bids in similar securities in order to derive the fair value of the instruments. valuation techniques may also rely on other observable inputs such as yield curves, interest rates and expected principal repayments, and default probabilities. instruments valued using these inputs are typically classified within level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. examples include certain municipal debt securities, corporate debt securities, agency mbs, brokered certificates of deposit and restricted equity securities in public companies. we utilize prices from independent services to corroborate our estimate of fair value. depending upon the type of security, the pricing service may provide a listed price, a matrix price, or use other methods including broker-dealer price quotations. as of september 30, 2016, 96% of our gross trading security assets and 38% of our gross trading securities sold but not yet purchased, are classified as level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.
positions in illiquid trading securities that do not have readily determinable fair values require significant judgment or estimation. for these securities, we use pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies, or similar techniques. assumptions utilized by these techniques include estimates of future delinquencies, loss severities, defaults and prepayments, or redemptions. securities valued using these techniques are classified within level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. for certain cmos, where there has been limited activity or less transparency around significant inputs to the valuation, such as assumptions regarding performance of the underlying mortgages, these securities are currently classified within level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. as of september 30, 2016, less than 1% of our gross trading security assets, and none of our trading instruments sold but not yet purchased, are classified as level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.
we enter into derivatives contracts as part of our fixed income operations in either over-the-counter market activities, or through "matched book" activities. see note 18 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in this form 10-k for more information.
fair values for the interest rate derivative contracts arising from our over-the-counter market activities are obtained from internal pricing models that consider current market trading levels and the contractual prices for the underlying financial instruments, as well as time value, yield curve and other volatility factors underlying the positions. since our model inputs can be observed in a liquid market and the models do not require significant judgment, such derivative contracts are classified within level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. we utilize values obtained from third party counterparty derivatives dealers to corroborate the output of our internal pricing models. the fair value of any cash collateral exchanged as part of the interest rate swap contract is netted, by counterparty, against the fair value of the derivative instrument.
fair value for our matched book derivatives are determined using an internal model which includes inputs from independent pricing sources to project future cash flows under each underlying derivative contract. the cash flows are discounted to determine the present value. since any changes in fair value are completely offset by an opposite change in the offsetting transaction position,
74
index there is no net impact on our consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income from changes in the fair value of these derivative instruments. we record the value of each matched book derivative position held at fair value, as either an asset or an offsetting liability, presented as "derivative instruments associated with offsetting matched book positions" as applicable, on our consolidated statements of financial condition.
rj bank enters into three month forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge the risk related to their investment in their canadian subsidiary. these derivatives are recorded at fair value on the consolidated statements of financial condition, the majority of which are designated as net investment hedges. the fair value of rj bank's forward foreign exchange contracts is determined by obtaining valuations from a third party pricing service. these third party valuations are based on observable inputs such as spot rates, foreign exchange rates and both u.s. and canadian interest rate curves. we validate the observable inputs utilized in the third party valuation model by preparing an independent calculation using a secondary, third party valuation model. these forward foreign exchange contracts are classified within level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.
we enter into certain interest rate swap contracts (the "rj bank interest hedges") which swap variable interest payments on debt for fixed interest payments. through the rj bank interest hedges, rj bank is able to mitigate a portion of the market risk associated with certain fixed rate interest earning assets held by rj bank. the rj bank interest hedges are recorded at fair value on the consolidated statements of financial condition and are designated as cash flow hedges. the fair value of rj bank interest hedges is obtained from internal pricing models that consider current market trading levels and the contractual prices for the underlying financial instruments, as well as time value, yield curve and other volatility factors underlying the positions. since our model inputs can be observed in a liquid market and the models do not require significant judgment, such derivative contracts are classified within level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. we utilize values obtained from a third party to corroborate the output of our internal pricing models.
available for sale securities available for sale securities are comprised primarily of mbs, cmos, and other equity securities held predominately by rj bank (the "rj bank afs securities"), and ars held by a non-broker-dealer subsidiary of rjf (collectively referred to as the "rjf afs securities"). of the rjf afs securities, 85% of the portfolio is classified as level 2 and 15% is classified as level 3, of the fair value hierarchy.
debt and equity securities classified as available for sale are reported at fair value with unrealized gains and losses, net of deferred taxes, recorded through other comprehensive (loss) income and thereafter presented in shareholders' equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income ("aoci") unless the loss is considered to be other-than-temporary, in which case the related credit loss portion is recognized as a loss in other revenue. realized gains and losses on sales of such securities are recognized using the specific identification method and reflected in other revenue in the period they are sold.
the fair value of agency and non-agency securities included within the rj bank afs securities is determined by obtaining third party pricing service bid quotations from two independent pricing services. third party pricing service bid quotations are based on either current market data or the most recently available market data. the third party pricing services provide comparable price evaluations utilizing available market data for similar securities. the market data the third party pricing services utilize for these price evaluations includes observable data comprised of benchmark yields, reported trades, broker-dealer quotes, issuer spreads, two-sided markets, benchmark securities, bids, offers, reference data including market research publications, and loan performance experience. in order to validate that the pricing information used by the primary third party pricing service is observable, we request, on a quarterly basis, some of the key market data available for a sample of securities and compare this data to that which we observed in our independent accumulation of market information. securities valued using these valuation techniques are classified within level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.
for non-agency securities within the rj bank afs securities where a significant difference exists between the primary third party pricing service bid quotation and the secondary third party pricing service, we utilize a discounted cash flow analysis to determine which third party price quote is more representative of fair value under the current market conditions. the fair values for most non-agency securities at september 30, 2016 were based on the respective primary third party pricing service bid quotation. securities measured using these valuation techniques are generally classified within level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.
ars are long-term variable rate securities tied to short-term interest rates that were intended to be reset through a "dutch auction" process, which generally occurs every seven to 35 days. holders of ars were previously able to liquidate their holdings to prospective buyers by participating in the auctions. during 2008, the dutch auction process failed and holders were no longer able to liquidate their holdings through the auction process. the fair value of the ars holdings is estimated based on internal pricing models. the pricing model takes into consideration the characteristics of the underlying securities, as well as multiple
75
index inputs including the issuer and its credit quality, data from any recent trades, the expected timing of redemptions and an estimated yield premium that a market participant would require over otherwise comparable securities to compensate for the illiquidity of the ars. these inputs require significant management judgment and, accordingly, these securities are classified within level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.
for any rjf afs securities in an unrealized loss position at the reporting period end, we make an assessment whether these securities are impaired on an other-than-temporary basis. in order to evaluate our risk exposure and any potential impairment of these securities, on at least a quarterly basis, we review the characteristics of each security owned such as, where applicable, collateral type, delinquency and foreclosure levels, credit enhancement, projected loan losses, collateral coverage, the presence of u.s. government or government agency guarantees, and issuer credit rating. the following factors are considered to determine whether an impairment is other-than-temporary: our intention to sell the security, our assessment of whether it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before the recovery of its amortized cost basis, and whether the evidence indicating that we will recover the amortized cost basis of a security in full outweighs evidence to the contrary. evidence considered in this assessment includes the reasons for the impairment, the severity and duration of the impairment, changes in value subsequent to period end, recent events specific to the issuer or industry, and forecasted performance of the security. securities on which there is an unrealized loss that is deemed to be other-than-temporary are written-down to fair value with the credit loss portion of the write-down recorded as a realized loss in other revenue and the non-credit portion of the write-down recorded net of deferred taxes in other comprehensive (loss) income and are thereafter presented in equity as a component of aoci. the credit loss portion of the write-down is the difference between the present value of the cash flows expected to be collected and the amortized cost basis of the security. the previous amortized cost basis of the security less the other-than-temporary impairment recognized in earnings establishes the new cost basis for the security.
for any rjf afs securities, we estimate the portion of loss attributable to credit using a discounted cash flow model. for rj bank afs securities, our discounted cash flow model utilizes relevant assumptions such as prepayment rate, default rate, and loss severity on a loan level basis. these assumptions are subject to change depending on a number of factors such as economic conditions, changes in home prices, and delinquency and foreclosure statistics, among others. events that may trigger material declines in fair values or additional credit losses for these securities in the future would include, but are not limited to, deterioration of credit metrics, significantly higher levels of default and severity of loss on the underlying collateral, deteriorating credit enhancement and loss coverage ratios, or further illiquidity.
private equity investments private equity investments are carried at either nav as a practical expedient, or fair value utilizing valuation techniques categorized as level 3 in the fair value hierarchy. our total private equity investments as of september 30, 2016 amount to $195 million prior to the consideration of the noncontrolling interest portion we do not own. of this, 57% are valued using the nav as a practical expedient, and 43% are valued at fair value. the valuation of these investments at fair value requires significant management judgment due to the absence of quoted market prices, inherent lack of liquidity and long-term nature of these assets. as a result, these values cannot be determined with precision and the calculated fair value estimates may not be realizable in a current sale or immediate settlement of the instrument. in comparison, our total private equity investments gross value, prior to the consideration of the noncontrolling interest portion we do not own, as of september 30, 2015 amounted to $209 million. of this total, 63% were valued using nav as a practical expedient, and 37% were valued at fair value utilizing valuation techniques categorized as level 3. see note 5 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in this form 10-k for additional information on our private equity investments, including the amounts associated with noncontrolling interests.
valuation of identifiable intangible assets during fiscal year 2016, we acquired alex. brown, 3macs, and mummert. in each case, we accounted for the acquisition under the acquisition method of accounting with the assets and liabilities recorded as of the acquisition date at their respective fair values in our consolidated financial statements. the assets to be measured at fair value include any acquired identifiable intangible assets including, but not limited to, assets such as trade names, customer relationships, non-compete agreements, and contracts which include favorable terms.
the process of identifying potential identifiable assets to value in any acquisition transaction is subjective, and involves management judgment. estimating the fair value of identifiable intangible assets involves the use of valuation techniques that rely on significant estimates and assumptions. these estimates and assumptions may include forecasted revenue growth rates, forecasted allocations of expense and risk-adjusted discount rates. we base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable given the information that is available to us at the time of our assessment; however, actual future results may differ significantly from those estimates.
76
index in some instances, depending on the nature of the intangible asset, the determination of the useful life of the asset can also be subjective, and involve significant management judgment.
the outcome of the identifiable intangible asset valuation process has a direct, inverse impact on the determination of the amount of goodwill arising from the application of the acquisition method of accounting for the transaction. the greater the identifiable intangible asset valuation, the lower the goodwill. additionally, the greater the identifiable intangible asset, the greater amortization expense associated with such asset will be in future periods, and therefore, the lower future net income will be.
goodwill impairment goodwill, under gaap, must be allocated to reporting units and tested for impairment at least annually. the annual goodwill impairment testing involves the application of significant management judgment, especially when estimating the fair value of its reporting units.
we perform goodwill testing on an annual basis or when an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value.  we have elected december 31 as our annual goodwill impairment evaluation date. during the quarter ended march 31, 2016 we performed a qualitative impairment assessment for certain of our reporting units and a quantitative impairment assessment for our two rj ltd. reporting units operating in canada.
for each reporting unit that we performed qualitative assessments, we determined whether it is more likely than not that the carrying value of such reporting unit, including the recorded goodwill, is in excess of the fair value of the reporting unit. in any instance in which we are unable to qualitatively conclude that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the reporting unit carrying value including goodwill, a quantitative analysis of the fair value of the reporting unit would be performed. based upon the outcome of our qualitative assessments, we determined that no quantitative analysis of the fair value of any of the reporting units we elected to qualitatively analyze for impairment as of december 31, 2015 was required, and we concluded that none of the goodwill allocated to any of those reporting units as of december 31, 2015 was impaired. no events have occurred since december 31, 2015 that would cause us to update this impairment testing.
in the rj ltd. reporting unit testing, we elected to perform quantitative assessments for the two reporting units within rj ltd. that include an allocation of goodwill. although gaap provides the option to perform a qualitative analysis which may result in a conclusion that no quantitative analysis of the reporting unit equity value is required, for this year's annual goodwill testing of our two rj ltd. reporting units, we elected to perform a quantitative analysis. in these analyses, we make significant assumptions and estimates about the extent and timing of future cash flows and discount rates, as well as utilize data from peer group companies to assess the equity value of each rj ltd. reporting unit. based upon the outcome of our quantitative assessments, we concluded there was no impairment of goodwill. the fair value of the equity of the rj ltd. pcg reporting unit was substantially in excess of its book carrying value, which includes goodwill. however, primarily as a result of the unfavorable impacts of the prolonged commodity recession in canada on our business, most specifically impacting the natural resources sector of that economy, the fair value of the equity of the rj ltd. ecm reporting unit is not substantially in excess of its book carrying value, which includes goodwill. the rj ltd. ecm reporting unit goodwill balance was $16.9 million as of december 31, 2015, and we estimate that the excess of the fair value of the reporting unit over its carrying value including goodwill approximates 10%. should the equity market conditions in canada fail to improve, or we otherwise fail to perform as we have projected, an impairment charge of some portion, or perhaps all, of such goodwill could occur. refer to note 13 in the notes to the consolidated financial statements in this form 10-k for a discussion of the valuation methodologies and a summary of the key assumptions we applied in determining the fair value of our two rj ltd. reporting units. no events have occurred since december 31, 2015 that would cause us to update this impairment testing.
deterioration in economic market conditions, especially those impacting revenues reported in our pcg and capital markets segments, as well as increased costs arising from the effects of recent regulatory or legislative changes, may result in declines in reporting unit performance beyond management's current expectations. declines in reporting unit performance, increases in equity capital requirements, or increases in the estimated cost of equity, could cause the estimated fair values of our reporting units or their associated goodwill to decline, which could result in a material impairment charge to earnings in a future period related to some portion of the associated goodwill.

index loss provisions loss provisions arising from legal and regulatory matters the recorded amount of liabilities related to legal and regulatory matters is subject to significant management judgment. for a description of the significant estimates and judgments associated with establishing such accruals, see the "contingent liabilities" section of note 2 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in this form 10-k.
loss provisions arising from operations of our broker-dealers the recorded amount of liabilities associated with brokerage client receivables and loans to financial advisors and certain key revenue producers, is subject to significant management judgment. for a description of the significant estimates and judgments associated with establishing these broker-dealer related liabilities, see the "brokerage client receivables, loans to financial advisors and allowance for doubtful accounts" section of note 2 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in this form 10-k.
loan loss provisions arising from operations of rj bank rj bank provides an allowance for loan losses which reflects our continuing evaluation of the probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio. refer to note 2 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in this form 10-k for discussion of rj bank's policies regarding the allowance for loan losses, and refer to note 9 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in this form 10-k for quantitative information regarding the allowance balances as of september 30, 2016.
at september 30, 2016, the amortized cost of all rj bank loans was $15.4 billion and an allowance for loan losses of $197 million was recorded against that balance. the total allowance for loan losses is equal to 1.30% of the amortized cost of the loan portfolio.
rj bank's process of evaluating its probable loan losses includes a complex analysis of several quantitative and qualitative factors, requiring a substantial amount of judgment. due to the uncertainty associated with this subjectivity, our underlying assumptions and judgments could prove to be inaccurate, and the allowance for loan losses could then be insufficient to cover actual losses. in such an event, any losses would result in a decrease in our net income as well as a decrease in the level of regulatory capital at rj bank.
the provision for loan losses in the current year includes a provision resulting from an increase in the qualitative reserve related to loans in the energy sector.
income taxes the objectives of accounting for income taxes are to recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year. we utilize the asset and liability method to provide income taxes on all transactions recorded in the consolidated financial statements. this method requires that income taxes reflect the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets or liabilities for book and tax purposes. accordingly, a deferred tax asset or liability for each temporary difference is determined based on the tax rates that we expect to be in effect when the underlying items of income and expense are realized. judgment is required in assessing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns, including the repatriation of undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries. variations in the actual outcome of these future tax consequences could materially impact our financial position, results of operations, or liquidity.
we have provided for u.s. deferred income taxes on undistributed earnings not considered permanently reinvested in our non-u.s. subsidiaries. to the extent that the cumulative undistributed earnings of non-u.s. subsidiaries are considered to be permanently invested, no deferred u.s. federal income taxes have been provided. because the time or manner of repatriation is uncertain, we cannot determine the impact of local taxes, withholding taxes and foreign tax credits associated with the future repatriation of such earnings, and therefore cannot quantify the tax liability that would be payable in the event all such foreign earnings are repatriated. at the present time, we have no plans or intentions to repatriate funds for which no u.s. income tax has been provided.
see note 20 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in this form 10-k for further information.

index effects of recently issued accounting standards, and accounting standards not yet adopted in january 2014, the fasb issued new guidance which allows investors in low income housing tax credit programs that meet specified conditions to present the net tax benefits (net of amortization of the cost of the investment) within income tax expense. the cost of the investments that meet the specified conditions will be amortized in proportion to (and over the same period as) the total expected tax benefits, including tax credits and other tax benefits as they are realized on the tax return. this new guidance first became effective for this financial report covering the quarter ending december 31, 2015. based upon the nature of our investments in lihtc structures, we do not meet the specified conditions which allow for election of this accounting treatment and thus the adoption of this guidance did not have any direct impact on our financial position or results of operations.
in january 2014, the fasb issued new guidance which clarifies when banks and similar institutions (creditors) should reclassify mortgage loans collateralized by residential real estate properties from the loan portfolio to oreo. this guidance defines when an in-substance repossession or foreclosure has occurred and when a creditor is considered to have received physical possession of residential real estate property collateralizing a consumer mortgage loan. this new guidance first became effective for this financial report covering the quarter ending december 31, 2015. this new guidance had no impact on our financial position and results of operations. given the nature of our oreo balances as of december 31, 2015, its adoption did not materially impact our oreo disclosures.
in april 2014, the fasb issued new guidance which changes the prior guidance regarding the requirements for reporting discontinued operations. under the new guidance, a disposal of a component of an entity or a group of components of an entity, are required to be reported in discontinued operations if the disposal represents a strategic shift that has (or will have) a major effect on an entity's operations and financial results when any of the following occurs: (1) the component of an entity or group of components of an entity meets certain criteria to be classified as held for sale. (2) the component of an entity or group of components of an entity is disposed of by sale. (3) the component of an entity or group of components of an entity is disposed of other than by sale (for example by abandonment or in a distribution to owners in a spinoff). the new guidance requires additional disclosures about discontinued operations that meet the above criteria. this new guidance is first effective for the period ended december 31, 2015. due to the immaterial nature of our disposals in fiscal year 2016, this new guidance did not have any impact on our financial position or results of operations.
in may 2014, the fasb issued new guidance regarding revenue recognition. in august 2015, the fasb amended this new guidance by deferring the initial required implementation date by one year. the new guidance is a comprehensive new revenue recognition model that requires a company to recognize revenue to depict the transfer of goods or services to a customer at an amount that reflects the consideration it expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services. the fasb is expected to amend the guidance as the work of various industry implementation working groups identify implementation issues and fasb provides clarifying guidance in response to such feedback. in march 2016, the fasb issued such a clarifying amendment regarding certain principal versus agent considerations. in may 2016, the fasb issued additional amendments regarding the rescission of certain sec staff observer comments upon adoption of the new standard as well as providing an update to certain narrow topics within the scope of the new revenue recognition guidance. this new revenue recognition guidance, including clarifications, is first effective for our financial report covering the quarter ending december 31, 2018, early adoption is permitted in certain circumstances. upon adoption, we may use either a full retrospective or a modified retrospective approach with respect to presentation of comparable periods prior to the effective date, we are still evaluating which transition approach to use. we are continuing our evaluation of the impact the adoption of this new guidance will have on our financial position and results of operations.
in june 2014, the fasb issued amended guidance for the accounting for share-based payments when the terms of an award provide that a performance target could be achieved after the requisite service period. the new guidance requires that a performance target that affects vesting of an award and that could be achieved after the requisite service period be treated as a performance condition. this new guidance is first effective for our interim financial report covering the quarter ending december 31, 2016. the adoption of this guidance is not anticipated to have a significant impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations.
in august 2014, the fasb issued amended guidance that requires an entity's management to evaluate whether there are conditions or events, considered in the aggregate, that raise substantial doubt about the entity's ability to continue as a going concern. the new guidance: (1) provides for a definition of substantial doubt, (2) requires an evaluation every reporting period including interim periods, (3) provides principles for considering the mitigating effect of management's plans, (4) requires certain disclosures when substantial doubt is alleviated as a result of consideration of management's plans, (5) requires an express statement and other disclosures when substantial doubt is not alleviated, and (6) requires an assessment for a period of one year after the date that the financial statements are issued (or available to be issued). this new guidance is first effective for our interim financial
79
index report covering the quarter ending after december 31, 2016. the adoption of this guidance is not anticipated to have any impact on our consolidated financial statements or related disclosures.
in november 2014, the fasb issued amended guidance regarding the accounting for hybrid financial instruments (which in this context would apply to any shares of rjf stock that include embedded derivative features such as conversion rights, redemption rights, voting rights, and liquidation and dividend payment preferences) issued in the form of a share. the new guidance clarifies how current gaap should be interpreted in evaluating the economic characteristics and risks of a host contract in a hybrid financial instrument that is issued in the form of a share. this new guidance is first effective for our interim financial report covering the quarter ending december 31, 2016. the adoption of this guidance is not anticipated to have any impact on our financial position and results of operations.
in january 2015, the fasb issued guidance that eliminates from gaap the concept of extraordinary items. this new guidance is effective for us for our fiscal year commencing on october 1, 2016. given that the adoption of this new guidance could impact certain presentations in our consolidated statements of income, depending upon the nature of future events and circumstances, but would not impact our determinations of net income presented in such statements, we do not anticipate that the adoption of this guidance will have any impact on the presentation of our results of operations.
in february 2015, the fasb issued amended guidance to the consolidation model. in october 2016, the fasb issued an additional amendment to this guidance. the impact of these amendments on the consolidation model are to:
•   eliminate the deferral of the application of the new consolidation model, which had resulted in the application of prior accounting guidance to consolidation determinations of certain investment funds (see note 2 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in this form 10-k for a discussion of how this deferral is applicable to our managed funds).
•   make certain changes to the variable interest consolidation model.
•   make certain changes to the voting interest consolidation model.
this amended guidance is effective for us for our fiscal year commencing on october 1, 2016. the adoption of this new guidance will likely impact our financial statements in the following manner:
•   will likely change certain historical conclusions that we are the primary beneficiary of certain lihtc funds. we currently anticipate that we will deconsolidate each of the non-guaranteed lihtc funds we currently consolidate.
•   we will apply this new guidance to our managed funds, but do not anticipate that we will conclude that we are the primary beneficiary of such managed funds. accordingly, we believe that our historical practice of not consolidating the managed funds will continue after the adoption of this amended guidance.
we believe the application of this amended guidance will significantly improve the meaningfulness of our consolidated financial statements. we will adopt this amended guidance in our interim financial report covering the quarter ending december 31, 2016.
in april 2015, the fasb issued guidance governing the presentation of debt issuance costs in the consolidated financial statements. under the new guidance, debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability are required to be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability, consistent with debt discounts. in august 2015, the fasb issued additional clarifying guidance indicating that for debt issuance costs related to line-of-credit arrangements, the sec staff would not object to an entity deferring and presenting debt issuance costs ratably over the term of the line-of-credit arrangement, regardless of whether there are any outstanding borrowings on the line-of-credit arrangement. this new guidance first became effective for this financial report covering the year ended september 30, 2016. see note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in this form 10-k for additional information regarding our adoption of this guidance.
in april 2015, the fasb issued guidance governing a customer's accounting for fees paid in a cloud computing arrangement. under the new guidance, if a cloud computing arrangement includes a software license, then the customer should account for the software license element of the arrangement consistent with the acquisition of other software licenses. if a cloud computing arrangement does not include a software license, the customer should account for the arrangement as a service contract. this new guidance is effective for us for our fiscal year commencing on october 1, 2016. given that we have a limited number of cloud computing arrangements, we do not expect the adoption of this new guidance to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.
in may 2015, the fasb issued guidance governing disclosures for entities who elect to measure the fair value of certain investments in certain entities using the net asset value per share (or its equivalent) practical expedient. under the new guidance, the requirement to categorize within the fair value hierarchy all investments for which fair value is measured using the net asset
80
index value practical expedient is eliminated. additionally, the new guidance eliminates the requirement to make certain disclosures for all investments that are eligible to be measured at fair value using the net asset value per share practical expedient, rather, those disclosures are limited to investments for which the entity has elected to measure the fair value using that practical expedient. we adopted this new guidance as of september 30, 2016, its adoption impacted certain of our fair value disclosures, however, it did not have an impact on our financial position. see notes 1 and 5 in the notes to consolidated financial statements in this form 10-k for additional information.
in june 2015, the fasb issued amended guidance related to technical corrections and improvements.  this amended guidance: 1) includes amendments related to differences between the original guidance and the codification. 2) provides guidance clarification and reference corrections. 3) streamlines or simplifies the codification through minor structural changes to headings or minor edits of text to improve the usefulness and understandability of the codification. 4) makes minor improvements to the guidance.  the amendments that require transition guidance are effective for our fiscal year commencing on october 1, 2016 and early adoption is permitted.  all other amendments will be effective upon issuance of the amended guidance.  we do not anticipate that the adoption of this new guidance will have any material impact on our consolidated financial statements.
in september 2015, the fasb issued guidance governing adjustments to the provisional amounts recognized at the acquisition date with a corresponding adjustment to goodwill. such adjustments are required when new information is obtained about facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date that, if known, would have affected the measurement amounts initially recognized or would have resulted in the recognition of additional assets and liabilities. this new guidance eliminates the requirement to retrospectively account for such adjustments. this new guidance is effective for our fiscal year commencing on october 1, 2016, and early adoption is permitted in certain circumstances. we do not expect the adoption of this new guidance to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. where possible, we plan on adopting this simplifying guidance early. given that this guidance applies to entity specific transactions and would only become relevant in certain circumstances, we are unable to estimate the impact, if any, this new guidance may have on our financial position.
in november 2015, the fasb issued guidance simplifying the presentation of deferred income taxes on the statement of financial position by eliminating the requirement to separately present current and noncurrent deferred tax liabilities and assets on such statements. given that we do not present current and noncurrent balances separately on our consolidated statements of financial position, this simplifying guidance will have no impact our consolidated statements of financial position.
in january 2016, the fasb issued guidance related to the accounting for financial instruments. among its provisions, this new guidance:
•   requires equity investments (other than those accounted for under the equity method or those that result from the consolidation of the investee) to be measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in net income. however, an entity may choose to measure equity investments that do not have readily determinable fair values at cost minus impairment, if any.
•   simplifies the impairment assessment of equity investments without readily determinable fair values by requiring a qualitative assessment to identify impairment.
•   eliminates the requirement to disclose the method(s) and significant assumptions used to estimate the fair value that is required to be disclosed for financial instruments measured at amortized cost on the balance sheet.
•   requires the use of the exit price notion when measuring the fair value of financial instruments for disclosure purposes.
•   requires an entity to present separately in other comprehensive income the portion of the total change in the fair value of a liability resulting from a change in the instrument-specific credit risk when the entity has elected to measure the liability at fair value in accordance with the fair value option.
•   requires separate presentation of financial assets and financial liabilities by measurement category and form of financial asset (that is, securities or loans and receivables) on the balance sheet or the accompanying notes to the financial statements.
•   clarifies that an entity should evaluate the need for a valuation allowance on a deferred tax asset related to available for sale securities in combination with the entity's other deferred tax assets.
this new guidance is effective for us for our fiscal year commencing on october 1, 2018. early adoption is generally not permitted. we are evaluating the impact, if any, the adoption of this new guidance will have on our financial position and results of operations.
in february 2016, the fasb issued new guidance related to the accounting for leases. the new guidance requires the recognition of assets and liabilities on the balance sheet related to the rights and obligations created by lease agreements regardless of whether they are classified as finance or operating leases. consistent with current guidance, the recognition, measurement and presentation of expenses and cash flows arising from a lease will primarily depend upon its classification as a finance or operating lease. the new guidance requires new disclosures to help financial statement users better understand the amount, timing, and cash flows
81
index arising from leases. the new guidance is first effective for our financial report covering the quarter ended december 31, 2019, early adoption is permitted. this new guidance will impact our financial position and results of operations. we are evaluating the magnitude of such impact.
in march 2016, the fasb issued new guidance related to derivatives and hedging, specifically the effect of derivative contract novations on existing hedge accounting relationships. the new guidance clarifies that a change in counterparty to a derivative instrument that has been designated as a hedging instrument under the current guidance does not, in and of itself, require re-designation of that hedging relationship provided that all other hedge accounting criteria continue to be met. the new guidance is first effective for our financial report covering the quarter ended december 31, 2017, early adoption is permitted. we are evaluating the impact the adoption of this new guidance will have on our financial position and results of operations.
in march 2016, the fasb issued new guidance related to derivatives and hedging, specifically contingent put and call options in debt instruments. the new guidance clarifies the requirements for assessing whether contingent call (put) options that can accelerate the payment of principal on debt instruments are clearly and closely related to their debt hosts. an entity performing the assessment is required to assess the embedded call (put) options solely in accordance with the following four-step decision sequence; an entity must consider 1) whether the payoff is adjusted based on changes in an index, 2) whether the payoff is indexed to an underlying other than interest rates or credit risk, 3) whether the debt involves a substantial premium or discount and 4) whether the call (put) option is contingently exercisable. the new guidance is first effective for our financial report covering the quarter ended december 31, 2017, early adoption is permitted. we are evaluating the impact the adoption of this new guidance will have on our financial position and results of operations.
in march 2016, the fasb issued new guidance related to equity method investments and joint ventures. the new guidance eliminates the requirement that when an investment qualifies for use of the equity method as a result of an increase in the level of ownership interest or degree of influence, an investor must adjust the investment, results of operations, and retained earnings retroactively on a step-by-step basis as if the equity method had been in effect during all previous periods that the investment had been held. additionally, the new guidance requires that the equity method investor add the cost of acquiring the additional interest in the investee to the current basis of the investor's previously held interest and adopt the equity method of accounting as of the date the investment becomes qualified for equity method accounting and therefore upon qualifying for the equity method of accounting, no retroactive adjustment of the investment is required. the new guidance is first effective for our financial report covering the quarter ended december 31, 2017, early adoption is permitted. given that this guidance applies to entity specific transactions and would only become relevant in certain circumstances, we are unable to estimate the impact, if any, this new guidance may have on our financial position.
in march 2016, the fasb issued amended guidance related to stock compensation. the amended guidance involves several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment transactions, including the income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, and classification on the statement of cash flows. the amended guidance is first effective for our financial report covering the quarter ended december 31, 2017, although early adoption is permitted. we believe the adoption of this new guidance will improve the meaningfulness of the presentation of our financial position and results of operations and we plan to adopt this guidance early, after we have satisfactorily addressed all of its provisions. we anticipate, based upon the fair value of rjf shares as of september 30, 2016, that the implementation of this guidance will have a favorable impact on our tax expense and net earnings, beginning in the period of adoption.
in june 2016, the fasb issued new guidance related to the measurement of credit losses on financial instruments. the amended guidance involves several aspects of the accounting for credit losses related to certain financial instruments including assets measured at amortized cost, available-for-sale debt securities and certain off-balance sheet commitments. the new guidance broadens the information that an entity must consider in developing its estimated credit losses expected to occur over the remaining life of assets measured either collectively or individually and expands the disclosure requirements regarding an entity's assumptions, models, and methods for estimating credit losses. additionally the new guidance requires new disclosures of the amortized cost balance for each class of financial asset by credit quality indicator, disaggregated by the year of origination. the new guidance is first effective for our financial report covering the quarter ended december 31, 2020, early adoption is permitted although not prior to our financial report covering the quarter ended december 31, 2019. we are evaluating the impact the adoption of this new guidance will have on our financial position and results of operations.
in august 2016, the fasb issued amended guidance related to the statement of cash flows. the amended guidance involves several aspects of the classification of certain cash receipts and cash payments including debt prepayment or debt extinguishment costs, settlement of zero-coupon debt instruments or other debt instruments with coupon interest rates that are insignificant in relation to the effective interest rate of the borrowing, contingent consideration payments made after a business combination, proceeds from the settlement of insurance claims, proceeds from the settlement of corporate-owned life insurance policies, including
82
index bank-owned life insurance policies, distributions received from equity method investees, beneficial interests in securitization transactions and separately identifiable cash flows and application of the predominance principle. the amended guidance is first effective for our financial report covering the quarter ended december 31, 2017, early adoption is permitted. the adoption of this new guidance will impact our statement of cash flows, however, we are evaluating the impact the adoption of this new guidance will have on our financial position and results of operations.
in october 2016, the fasb issued guidance related to the accounting for income tax consequences of intra-entity transfers of assets. current gaap prohibits the recognition of current and deferred income taxes for intra-entity asset transfer until the asset has been sold to an outside party. under the new guidance, an entity should recognize the income tax consequences of an inter-entity transfer of an asset when the transfer occurs. the guidance is first effective for our financial report covering the quarter ended december 31, 2018, early adoption is permitted. we are evaluating the impact the adoption of this new guidance will have on our financial position and results of operations.
off-balance sheet arrangements information concerning our off-balance sheet arrangements is included in note 26 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in this form 10-k.
effects of inflation our assets are primarily liquid in nature and are not significantly affected by inflation. however, the rate of inflation affects our expenses, including employee compensation, communications and occupancy, which may not be readily recoverable through charges for services we provide to our clients.

"risk factors," and elsewhere in this annual report on form 10-k.
executive overview we are a leading global provider of comprehensive pv solar energy solutions. we design, manufacture, and sell pv solar modules with an advanced thin-film semiconductor technology and also develop, design, construct, and sell pv solar power systems that primarily use the modules we manufacture. additionally, we provide o&m services to system owners that use solar modules manufactured by us or by third-party manufacturers. we have substantial, ongoing r&d efforts focused on module and system-level innovations. we are the world's largest thin-film pv solar module manufacturer and one of the world's largest pv solar module manufacturers. our mission is to create enduring value by enabling a world powered by clean, affordable solar energy.
certain highlights of our financial results and other key operational developments for the year ended december 31, 2016 include the following:
•   net sales for 2016 decreased by 18% to $3.0 billion compared to $3.6 billion in 2015. the decrease in net sales was primarily attributable to the sale of majority interests in the north star and lost hills projects in 2015, the completion of substantially all construction activities on the imperial solar energy center west and decatur projects in 2015, the completion of substantially all construction activities on the silver state south and mccoy projects in the first half of 2016, and lower revenue from "module plus" transactions, which are transactions in which we sell both our modules plus selected bos parts. this decrease in revenue was partially offset by an increase in the volume of modules sold to third parties, higher revenue from the commencement of construction of the taylor and butler projects in late 2015, and the commencement of construction of the east pecos project in early 2016.
•   gross profit decreased 1.8 percentage points to 23.9% during 2016 from 25.7% during 2015, primarily due to the mix of lower gross profit projects sold and under construction, higher inventory write-downs, and the reduction in our module collection and recycling obligation in 2015 resulting from certain recycling technology advancements, partially offset by the higher gross margins on modules sales to third parties.
•   as of december 31, 2016, we had 28 installed production lines at our manufacturing facilities in perrysburg, ohio and kulim, malaysia. we produced 3.1 gw of solar modules during 2016, which represented a 24% increase from 2015. the increase in production was primarily driven by increased throughput and higher module conversion efficiencies. we expect to produce approximately 2.2 gw of solar modules during 2017 as we ramp down production of our series 4 modules and continue the transition to series 6 module manufacturing.
•   during 2016, we ran our manufacturing facilities at approximately 97% capacity utilization, which represented a 5.0 percentage point increase from 2015.
•   the average conversion efficiency of our modules produced in 2016 was 16.4%, which represented an improvement of 0.8 percentage points from our average conversion efficiency of 15.6% in 2015.

market overview the solar industry continues to be characterized by intense pricing competition, both at the module and system levels. in particular, module average selling prices in the united states and several other key markets have experienced an accelerated decline in recent months, and module average selling prices are expected to continue to decline to some degree in the short and medium terms according to market forecasts. in the aggregate, we believe manufacturers of solar modules and cells have significant installed production capacity, relative to global demand, and the ability for additional capacity expansion. we believe the solar industry may from time to time experience periods of structural imbalance between supply and demand (i.e., where production capacity exceeds global demand), and that such periods will put pressure on pricing. we believe the solar industry is currently in such a period. additionally, intense competition at the system level may result in an environment in which pricing falls rapidly, thereby further increasing demand for solar energy solutions but constraining the ability for project developers; epc companies; and vertically-integrated solar companies such as first solar to sustain meaningful and consistent profitability. in light of such market realities, we are executing our long term strategic plan, under which we are focusing on our competitive strengths. such strengths include our advanced module and system technologies as well as our vertically-integrated business model that enables us to provide utility-scale pv solar energy solutions to key markets with current electricity needs.
worldwide solar markets continue to develop, in part aided by demand elasticity resulting from declining industry average selling prices, both at the module and system level, which make solar power more affordable to new markets. we are developing, constructing, or operating multiple solar projects around the world, many of which are the largest or among the largest in their regions. we continue to execute on our advanced-stage utility-scale project pipeline, which includes the construction of some of the world's largest pv solar power systems. we expect a substantial portion of our consolidated net sales, operating income, and cash flows through the end of 2018 to be derived from these projects. we continue to advance the development and selling efforts for the other projects included in our advanced-stage utility-scale project pipeline, develop our early-to-mid stage project pipeline, and evaluate acquisitions of projects to expand our advanced-stage utility-scale project pipeline. see the tables under "management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations - systems project pipeline" for additional information about these and other projects within our systems business advanced-stage project pipeline.
lower industry module and system pricing, while currently challenging for certain solar manufacturers (particularly manufacturers with high cost structures), is expected to continue to contribute to global market diversification and volume elasticity. over time, declining average selling prices are consistent with the erosion of one of the primary historical constraints to widespread solar market penetration, its affordability. in the near term, however, declining average selling prices are expected to adversely affect our results of operations relative to prior years. if competitors reduce pricing to levels below their costs, bid aggressively low prices for module sale agreements, epc agreements, and ppas, or are able to operate at minimal or negative operating margins for sustained periods of time, our results of operations could be further adversely affected. in certain markets in california and elsewhere, an oversupply imbalance at the grid level may further contribute to reduced short-to-medium term demand for new solar installations relative to prior years, lower ppa pricing, and lower margins on module and systems sales to such markets. we continue to mitigate these uncertainties in part by executing on our module technology improvements, including our transition to series 6 module manufacturing, continuing the development of key markets, and implementing certain other cost reduction initiatives, including both manufacturing and bos costs.
we continue to face intense competition from manufacturers of crystalline silicon solar modules and other types of solar modules and pv solar power systems. solar module manufacturers compete with one another on price and on several module value attributes, including conversion efficiency, energy yield, and reliability, and, with respect to pv solar power systems, net present value, return on equity, and lcoe, meaning the net present value of total life cycle costs of the system divided by the quantity of energy which is expected to be produced over the system's life. as noted above, competition on the basis of selling price per watt has intensified in recent months, resulting in sharp declines in module average selling prices in several key markets. in addition, we believe crystalline silicon cell and wafer manufacturers have begun transitioning from lower efficiency back surface field ("bsf") multi-crystalline cells (the legacy technology against which we generally compete in our markets) to higher efficiency perc multi-crystalline and mono-crystalline cells at potentially competitive cost structures.
48
we believe we are among the lowest cost pv module manufacturers in the solar industry on a module cost per watt basis, based on publicly available information. this cost competitiveness is reflected in the price at which we sell our modules and fully integrated pv solar power systems and enables our systems to compete favorably. our cost competitiveness is based in large part on our module conversion efficiency, proprietary manufacturing technology (which enables us to produce a cdte module in less than 3.5 hours using a continuous and highly automated industrial manufacturing process, as opposed to a batch process), and our operational excellence. in addition, our cdte modules use approximately 1-2% of the amount of the semiconductor material that is used to manufacture traditional crystalline silicon solar modules. the cost of polysilicon is a significant driver of the manufacturing cost of crystalline silicon solar modules, and the timing and rate of change in the cost of silicon feedstock and polysilicon could lead to changes in solar module pricing levels. polysilicon costs have had periods of decline over the past several years, and polysilicon consumption per cell has been reduced through the adoption of diamond wafer saw technology, contributing to a decline in our relative manufacturing cost competitiveness over traditional crystalline silicon module manufacturers.
given the smaller size (sometimes referred to as form factor) of our current series 4 cdte modules compared to certain types of crystalline silicon modules, we may incur higher labor and bos costs associated with the construction of systems using our modules. thus, to compete effectively on an lcoe basis, our series 4 modules may need to maintain a certain cost advantage per watt compared to crystalline silicon-based modules with larger form factors. we recently introduced our next generation series 6 module technology, which is expected to enable the production of modules with a larger form factor along with better product attributes and a lower manufacturing cost structure. accordingly, the larger form factor of our series 6 modules is expected to reduce the number of electrical connections and hardware required for system installation. the resulting labor and material savings are expected to represent a significant improvement compared to current technologies and a substantial reduction in total installed costs resulting in improved project returns as bos costs represent a significant portion of the costs associated with the construction of a typical utility-scale system. see note 4 "restructuring and asset impairments" to our consolidated financial statements for the year ended december 31, 2016 included in this annual report on form 10-k for additional information regarding the transition to series 6 module manufacturing.
in terms of energy yield, in many climates, our cdte modules provide a significant energy production advantage over most conventional crystalline silicon solar modules (including bsf and perc technologies) of equivalent efficiency rating. for example, our cdte solar modules provide a superior temperature coefficient, which results in stronger system performance in typical high insolation climates as the majority of a system's generation, on average, occurs when module temperatures are well above 25°c (standard test conditions). in addition, our cdte modules provide a superior spectral response in humid environments where atmospheric moisture alters the solar spectrum relative to laboratory standards. our cdte solar modules also provide a better shading response than conventional crystalline silicon solar modules, which may lose up to three times as much power as cdte solar modules when shading occurs. as a result of these and other factors, our pv solar power systems typically produce more annual energy in real world field conditions than competing systems with the same nameplate capacity.
while our modules and pv solar power systems are generally competitive in cost, reliability, and performance attributes, there can be no guarantee such competitiveness will continue to exist in the future to the same extent or at all. any declines in the competitiveness of our products could result in additional margin compression, further declines in the average selling prices of our modules and systems, erosion in our market share for modules and systems, decreases in the rate of net sales growth, and/or declines in overall net sales. we continue to focus on enhancing the competitiveness of our solar modules and pv solar power systems by accelerating progress along our module technology and cost reduction roadmaps, continuing to make technological advances at the system level, using innovative installation techniques and know-how, and leveraging volume procurement around standardized hardware platforms. such procurement efforts include the use of high-quality, conventional bos components as we have phased out the use of our proprietary trackers and fixed mounting structures to further reduce system costs and streamline our operations.
certain trends and uncertainties we believe that our operations may be favorably or unfavorably impacted by the following trends and uncertainties that may affect our financial condition and results of operations. see item 1a. "risk factors" and elsewhere in this annual report on form 10-k for a discussion of other risks that may affect our financial condition and results of operations.

long term strategic plan our long term strategic plan is a long-term roadmap to achieve our technology, growth, and cost leadership objectives. in executing our long term strategic plan, we are focusing on providing utility-scale pv solar energy solutions using our modules in key geographic markets that we believe have a compelling need for mass-scale pv electricity, including markets throughout the americas, the asia-pacific region, and the middle east. as part of our long term strategic plan, we are focusing on opportunities in which our pv solar energy solutions can compete directly with fossil fuel offerings on an lcoe or similar basis, or complement such fossil fuel electricity offerings. execution of the long term strategic plan entails a prioritization of market opportunities worldwide relative to our core strengths and a corresponding allocation of resources around the globe. this prioritization involves a focus on our core module and utility-scale offerings and exists within a current market environment that includes rooftop and distributed generation solar, particularly in the united states. while it is unclear how rooftop and distributed generation solar might impact our core utility-scale offerings in the next several years, we believe that utility-scale solar will continue to be a compelling solar offering for companies with technology and cost leadership and will continue to represent an increasing portion of the overall electricity generation mix.
we are closely evaluating and managing the appropriate level of resources required as we pursue the most advantageous and cost effective projects and partnerships in our target markets. we have dedicated, and intend to continue to dedicate, significant capital and human resources to reduce the total installed cost of pv solar energy, to optimize the design and logistics around our pv solar energy solutions, and to ensure that our solutions integrate well into the overall electricity ecosystem of each specific market. we expect that, over time, an increasing portion of our consolidated net sales, operating income, and cash flows may come from solar offerings in the key geographic markets described above as we execute on our long term strategic plan. the timing, execution, and financial impacts of our long term strategic plan are subject to risks and uncertainties, as described in item 1a. "risk factors," and elsewhere in this annual report on form 10-k. we are focusing our resources in those markets and energy applications in which solar power can be a least-cost, best-fit energy solution, particularly in regions with high solar resources, significant current or projected electricity demand, and/or relatively high existing electricity prices. as part of these efforts, we continue to optimize resources globally, including business development, sales personnel, and other supporting professional staff in target markets.
joint ventures or other strategic arrangements with partners are a key part of our long term strategic plan, and we generally use such arrangements to expedite our penetration of various key markets and establish relationships with potential customers. we also enter into joint ventures or strategic arrangements with customers or other entities to maximize the value of particular projects. some of these arrangements involve and are expected in the future to involve significant investments or other allocations of capital. we continue to develop relationships with customers in these strategic markets with a view to creating opportunities for utility-scale pv solar power systems. we sell such systems directly to end customers, including utilities, independent power producers, commercial and industrial companies, and other system owners. depending on the market opportunity, our sales offerings may range from module-only sales, to module sales with a range of development, epc services, and other solutions, to full turn-key pv solar power system sales. we expect these offerings to continue to evolve over time as we work with our customers to optimize how our pv solar energy solutions can best meet our customers' energy and economic needs.
in order to create or maintain a market position in certain strategically targeted markets, our offerings from time to time may need to be competitively priced at levels associated with minimal gross profit margins, which may adversely affect our results of operations. we expect the profitability associated with our various sales offerings to vary from one another over time, and possibly vary from our internal long-range profitability expectations and targets, depending on the market opportunity and the relative competitiveness of our offerings compared with other energy solutions, fossil fuel-based or otherwise, that are available to potential customers. in addition, as we execute on our long term strategic plan, we will continue to monitor and adapt to any changing dynamics in the market set of potential buyers of solar project assets. market environments with few potential project buyers and a higher cost of capital would generally exert downward pressure on the potential revenue from the uncontracted solar project assets we are developing, whereas, conversely, market environments with many potential project buyers and a lower cost of capital would likely have a favorable impact on the potential revenue from such uncontracted solar project assets.
50
we expect to use our working capital, project financing arrangements, or availability under our revolving credit facility to finance the construction of certain pv solar power systems for strategic purposes or to maximize the value of such systems at the time of sale. from time to time, we may temporarily own and operate certain pv solar power systems, often with the intention to sell at a later date. we may also elect to construct and temporarily retain ownership interests in systems for which there is no ppa with an off-taker, such as a utility, but rather an intent to sell the electricity produced by the system on an open contract basis until the system is sold. additionally, our joint ventures and other business arrangements with strategic partners have and may in the future result in us temporarily retaining a noncontrolling ownership interest in the underlying systems projects we develop, supply modules to, or construct potentially for a period of up to several years. such business arrangements could become increasingly important to our competitive profile in markets globally, including north america. in each of the above mentioned examples, we may retain such ownership interests in a consolidated or unconsolidated separate entity.
we continually evaluate forecasted global demand, competition, and our addressable market, and seek to effectively balance manufacturing capacity with market demand and the nature and extent of our competition. to the extent we make investments to add or otherwise modify our manufacturing capacity in response to market demand and competition, such investments would require significant internal and possibly external sources of liquidity and would be subject to certain risks and uncertainties described in item 1a. risk factors, including those entitled "our future success depends on our ability to effectively balance manufacturing production with market demand, convert existing production facilities to support new product lines, such as our transition to series 6 module manufacturing, and, when necessary, continue to build new manufacturing plants over time in response to such demand and add production lines in a cost-effective manner, all of which are subject to risks and uncertainties" and "if any future production lines are not built in line with our committed schedules it may impair any future growth plans. if any future production lines do not achieve operating metrics similar to our existing production lines, our solar modules could perform below expectations and cause us to lose customers."
8point3 energy partners lp in june 2015, the partnership completed the ipo. as part of the ipo, we contributed interests in various projects to a subsidiary of the partnership in exchange for an ownership interest in the entity. since the formation of the partnership, we and sunpower have, from time to time, continued to sell interests in solar projects to the partnership. the partnership owns and operates a portfolio of solar energy generation projects and is expected to acquire additional interests in projects from the sponsors. in addition, the partnership is expected to provide the sponsors with optionality in the project sales process. given the broader economic factors currently impacting the yieldco sector in general, including yieldco equity valuations generally, the timing and execution of project sales to the partnership are subject to market conditions. for additional information, see item 1a. "risk factors - we may not be able to achieve the full strategic and financial benefits expected to result from the formation of 8point3 energy partners lp, on a timely basis or at all" and "note 12 "investments in unconsolidated affiliates and joint ventures - 8point3 energy partners lp" of our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10-k.
construction of some of the world's largest pv solar power systems we continue to execute on our advanced-stage utility-scale project pipeline and expect a substantial portion of our consolidated net sales, operating income, and cash flows through the end of 2018 to be derived from several large projects in this pipeline, including the following contracted projects which will be among the world's largest pv solar power systems: the 280 mw california flats project, located in monterey county, california; the 250 mw moapa project, located in clark county, nevada; the 150 mw rosamond project located in kern county, california; and the 150 mw sun streams project, located in maricopa county, arizona. please see the tables under "management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations - systems project pipeline" for additional information about these and other projects within our systems business advanced-stage project pipeline. the construction progress of these projects is subject to risks and delays as described in item 1a. "risk factors," and elsewhere in this annual report on form 10-k. revenue recognition for these and other system projects is in many cases not linear in nature due to the timing of when all revenue recognition criteria are met, and consequently, period-over-period comparisons of results of operations may not be meaningful. expected revenue from projects without a ppa, for which electricity will be sold on an open contract basis, may be subject to greater variability and uncertainty based on market factors compared to projects with a ppa.
51
systems project pipeline the following tables summarize, as of february 22, 2017, our approximately 2.0 gw systems business advanced-stage project pipeline. as of december 31, 2016, for the projects sold/under contract in our advanced-stage project pipeline of 275 mw, we have not recognized any significant amount of revenue. the remaining revenue to be recognized subsequent to december 31, 2016 for the projects sold/under contract is expected to be approximately $0.8 billion. the majority of such revenue is expected to be recognized through the later of the substantial completion or closing dates of the projects. the remaining revenue to be recognized does not have a direct correlation to expected remaining module shipments for such projects sold/under contract as expected module shipments do not represent total systems revenues and do not consider the timing of when all revenue recognition criteria are met, including the timing of module installation. the actual volume of modules installed in our projects sold/under contract will be greater than the project size in mw ac as module volumes required for a project are based upon mw dc, which will be greater than the mw ac size pursuant to a dc-ac ratio typically ranging from 1.2 to 1.3. such ratio varies across different projects due to various system design factors. projects are removed from our advanced-stage project pipeline tables below once we have substantially completed construction and after substantially all revenue has been recognized. projects, or portions of projects, may also be removed from the tables below in the event an epc-contracted or partner-developed project does not obtain permitting or financing, an unsold or uncontracted project is not sold or contracted due to the changing economics of the project or other factors, or we decide to temporarily own and operate, or retain interests in, such projects based on strategic opportunities or market factors.
in january 2017, we discontinued development of the 310 mw ac tribal solar project. the development of solar energy projects, such as the tribal solar project, involves numerous risks, and typically requires developers, such as first solar, to spend significant sums and devote substantial resources to a project before a determination can be made whether the project is feasible, economically attractive, or capable of being built. for more information about the risks associated with project development, see item 1a. "risk factors - project development or construction activities may not be successful; projects under development may not receive required permits, real property rights, ppas, interconnection, and transmission arrangements; or financing or construction may not commence or proceed as scheduled, which could increase our costs and impair our ability to recover our investments." in light of significant uncertainties and risks related to the land use rights and obtaining the required permits and approvals, among other factors, and our experience developing over 6 gw of solar energy projects, we made the determination that it would not be prudent to continue development of the tribal solar project. we therefore notified sce that we were unwilling to pay the excess costs related to certain transmission upgrades and new transmission facilities, and the ppa was terminated pursuant to its terms. accordingly, sce has released to us the full amount of the performance security, and we have ceased development activities related to the tribal solar project. as of december 31, 2016, we estimated that the tribal solar project was 2% completed and had a likely substantial completion date, if any, in 2021.
we continually seek to make additions to our advanced-stage project pipeline. we are actively developing our early to mid-stage project pipeline in order to secure ppas and are also pursuing opportunities to acquire advanced-stage projects, which already have ppas in place. new additions to our project pipeline during the period from february 24, 2016 to february 22, 2017 included a 126 mw ac solar power project in california, 60 mw ac of solar power projects in india, a 49 mw ac solar power project in australia, 41 mw ac of solar power projects in japan, a 40 mw ac solar power project in california, and a 25 mw ac solar power project in honduras.

segment overview we operate our business in two segments. our components segment involves the design, manufacture, and sale of cdte solar modules, which convert sunlight into electricity, and our systems segment includes the development, construction, operation, and maintenance of pv solar power systems, which primarily use our solar modules.
see note 23 "segment and geographical information" to our consolidated financial statements for the year ended december 31, 2016 included in this annual report on form 10-k for more information on our operating segments. see also item 7 "management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations - systems project pipeline" for a description of the system projects in our advanced-stage project pipeline.
product revenue the following table sets forth the total amounts of solar module and solar power system net sales for the years ended december 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014. for the purpose of the following table, (i) solar module revenue is composed of revenue from the sale of solar modules to third parties, which does not include any modules sold as part of our pv solar power systems, and (ii) solar power system revenue is composed of revenue from the sale of pv solar power systems and related products and services, including any modules installed in such systems and any revenue generated by such systems (in thousands):
2016                    2015                    2014
solar module revenue                  $675,453                $227,461                $228,319
solar power system revenue           2,275,875               3,351,534               3,162,868
net sales                           $2,951,328              $3,578,995              $3,391,187
solar module revenue to third parties increased by $448.0 million during 2016 compared to 2015 primarily as a result of a 211% increase in the volume of watts sold, partially offset by a 5% decrease in the average selling price per watt. solar power system revenue decreased by $1,075.7 million during 2016 compared to 2015 primarily from the sale of majority interests in the north star and lost hills projects in 2015, the completion of substantially all construction activities on the imperial solar energy center west and decatur projects in 2015, the completion of substantially all construction activities on the silver state south and mccoy projects in the first half of 2016, and lower revenue from module plus transactions. this decrease in revenue was partially offset by higher revenue from the commencement of construction on the taylor and butler projects in late 2015 and the commencement of construction on the east pecos project in early 2016.

solar module revenue to third parties decreased by $0.9 million during 2015 compared to 2014 primarily due to a 10% decrease in the average selling price per watt, partially offset by an 11% increase in the volume of watts sold. solar power system revenue increased by $188.7 million during 2015 compared to 2014 primarily due to higher revenue from module plus transactions. our net sales for 2015 also included the sale of majority interests in the partially constructed desert stateline project and north star project and higher revenue from the silver state south, mccoy, and imperial energy center west projects, which commenced construction in late 2014. these 2015 net sales were offset by lower revenue from the completion, or substantial completion, of the desert sunlight, solar gen 2, topaz, and campo verde projects in 2014.
net sales components business we generally price and sell our solar modules per watt of nameplate power. during 2016, a significant portion of net sales for our components business included modules installed in our pv solar power systems described below under "net sales - systems business." other than the modules included in our systems, we sold the majority of our solar modules to integrators and operators of systems in india, the united states, and the uae.
from time to time, we enter into module sales agreements with customers worldwide for specific projects or volumes of modules. such agreements are generally short-term in nature. during 2016, substantially all of our components business net sales, excluding modules installed in our systems, were denominated in u.s. dollars.
we transfer title and risk of loss to the customer and recognize revenue upon shipment or delivery, depending on the terms of the underlying sales contracts. pricing is typically fixed or determinable at the time of shipment, and our customers generally do not have extended payment terms or rights of return under these contracts. the revenue recognition policies for our components business are described further in note 2 "summary of significant accounting policies" to our consolidated financial statements for the year ended december 31, 2016 included in this annual report on form 10-k.
during 2016, southern power company and nextera energy, inc. each accounted for more than 10% of our components business' net sales, which includes the solar modules used in our systems projects.
systems business through our fully integrated systems business, we provide complete turn-key pv solar power systems, or solar solutions, which may include project development, epc services, and o&m services. additionally, we may temporarily own and operate, or retain interests in, certain of our pv solar power systems, which are also included within our systems business. we typically use the percentage-of-completion method using actual costs incurred over total estimated costs to construct a project (including module costs) as our standard accounting policy and apply this method after all revenue recognition criteria have been met. there are also instances in which we recognize revenue after a project has been completed, primarily due to a project not being sold prior to completion or because all revenue recognition criteria have not been met. the revenue recognition policies for our systems business are described in further detail in note 2 "summary of significant accounting policies" to our consolidated financial statements for the year ended december 31, 2016 included in this annual report on form 10-k.
during 2016, the majority of our systems business net sales were generated in north america, and the principal customers of our systems business were southern power company; nextera energy, inc.; and recurrent energy, llc, each of which accounted for more than 10% of the segment's net sales.

net sales from our components segment, which includes solar modules used in our systems projects, increased by $94.7 million in 2016 primarily as a result of a 17% increase in the volume of watts sold, partially offset by a 9% decrease in the average selling price per watt. net sales from our systems segment, which excludes solar modules used in our systems projects, decreased by $722.4 million in 2016 primarily from the sale of majority interests in the north star and lost hills projects in 2015, the completion of substantially all construction activities on the imperial solar energy center west and decatur projects in 2015, and the completion of substantially all construction activities on the silver state south and mccoy projects in the first half of 2016. this decrease in revenue was partially offset by higher revenue from the commencement of construction on the taylor and butler projects in late 2015 and the commencement of construction on the east pecos project in early 2016.
net sales from our components segment, which includes solar modules used in our systems projects, increased by $286.9 million in 2015 primarily due to a 33% increase in the volume of watts sold, partially offset by a 5% decrease in the average selling price per watt. net sales from our systems segment, which excludes solar modules used in our systems projects, decreased by $99.1 million in 2015 primarily as a result of lower revenue from the completion, or substantial completion, of the desert sunlight, solar gen 2, topaz, and campo verde projects in 2014. these decreases were partially offset by the sale of majority interests in the partially constructed desert stateline project and north star project, and higher revenue from the silver state south, mccoy, and imperial solar energy center west projects, which commenced construction in late 2014.
cost of sales components business our cost of sales includes the cost of raw materials and components for manufacturing solar modules, such as glass, transparent conductive coatings, cdte and other thin-film semiconductors, laminate materials, connector assemblies, edge seal materials, and other materials and components. in addition, our cost of sales includes direct labor for the manufacturing of solar modules and manufacturing overhead such as engineering, equipment maintenance, environmental health and safety, quality and production control, information technology, and procurement costs. our cost of sales also includes depreciation of manufacturing plant and equipment, facility-related expenses, and costs associated with shipping, warranties, and our solar module collection and recycling obligation (excluding accretion).
as further described in note 23 "segment and geographical information" to our consolidated financial statements for the year ended december 31, 2016 included in this annual report on form 10-k, we include the sale of solar modules manufactured by our components business and used by our systems business within net sales of our components business. therefore, the related cost of sales is also included within our components business.
systems business for our systems business, project-related costs include development costs (legal, consulting, transmission upgrade, interconnection, permitting, and other similar costs), standard epc costs (consisting primarily of bos costs for inverters, electrical and mounting hardware, project management and engineering costs, and construction labor costs), and site specific costs.

our cost of sales decreased $412.4 million, or 16%, and increased 1.8 percentage points as a percentage of net sales when comparing 2016 with 2015. the decrease in cost of sales was primarily the result of a $476.1 million decrease in our systems segment cost of sales primarily due to the volume of projects under construction and the timing of when all revenue recognition criteria were met. this net decrease was partially offset by a $63.7 million increase in our components segment cost of sales primarily due to the following:
•   higher costs of $190.8 million associated with the increased volume of modules sold directly to third parties and as part of our systems business projects;
•   a reduction in our module collection and recycling obligation of $69.6 million during 2015 resulting from certain recycling technology advancements, which significantly increased the throughput of modules able to be recycled at a point in time, along with other material and labor cost reductions; and
•   higher inventory write-downs of $22.3 million primarily related to our remaining crystalline silicon module inventories; partially offset by
•   continued reductions in the cost per watt of our solar modules, which decreased our components segment cost of sales by $246.5 million.
our cost of sales increased $93.5 million, or 4%, and decreased 1.4 percentage points as a percentage of net sales when comparing 2015 with 2014. the increase in cost of sales was driven by a $60.9 million increase in our systems segment cost of sales primarily due to a mix of lower gross profit system projects sold or under construction during the period. our components segment cost of sales increased by $32.6 million primarily as a result of the following:
•   higher costs of $309.4 million associated with the increased volume of modules sold as part of our systems business projects; partially offset by
•   continued manufacturing cost reductions of $135.1 million;
•   a reduction in our module collection and recycling obligation of $69.6 million, as described above; and
•   lower underutilization penalties of $55.0 million due to the improved capacity utilization of our manufacturing facilities. during 2015, we ran our factories at approximately 92% capacity utilization, which represented an 11.0 percentage point increase from 2014.
gross profit gross profit is affected by numerous factors, including the selling prices of our modules and systems, our manufacturing costs, bos costs, project development costs, the capacity utilization of our manufacturing facilities, and foreign exchange rates. gross profit is also affected by the mix of net sales generated by our components and systems businesses.

the decrease in our research and development expense during 2016 compared to 2015 was primarily due to reductions in our r&d headcount and employee compensation expense resulting from the restructuring activities further discussed in note 4 "restructuring and asset impairments" to our consolidated financial statements for the year ended december 31, 2016 included in this annual report on form 10-k. during 2016, the average conversion efficiency of our cdte solar modules produced was 16.4% compared to 15.6% in 2015.
the decrease in our research and development expense during 2015 compared to 2014 was primarily due to reduced material and module testing costs associated with the development of next-generation cdte solar modules and lower costs for outside services, partially offset by higher employee compensation expense. during 2015, the average conversion efficiency of our cdte solar modules was 15.6% compared to 14.0% in 2014.
selling, general and administrative selling, general and administrative expense consists primarily of salaries and other personnel-related costs, professional fees, insurance costs, travel expenses, and other business development and selling expenses.

liquidity and capital resources as of december 31, 2016, we believe that our cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities, cash flows from operating activities including the contracted portion of our advanced-stage project pipeline, availability under our revolving credit facility considering minimum liquidity covenant requirements, and access to the capital markets will be sufficient to meet our working capital, systems project investment, and capital expenditure needs for at least the next 12 months. we monitor our working capital to ensure we have adequate liquidity, both domestically and internationally.
we intend to maintain appropriate debt levels based upon cash flow expectations, our overall cost of capital, and expected cash requirements for operations, capital expenditures, and strategic discretionary spending. in the future, we may also engage in additional debt or equity financings, including project specific debt financings. we believe that when necessary, we will have adequate access to the capital markets, although our ability to raise capital on terms commercially acceptable to us could be constrained if there is insufficient lender or investor interest due to industry-wide or company-specific concerns. such financings could result in increased debt service expenses or dilution to our existing stockholders.
as of december 31, 2016, we had $2.0 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities compared to $1.8 billion as of december 31, 2015. cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities as of december 31, 2016 increased primarily as the result of proceeds from the sale of certain equity method investments and cash generated from operating activities, partially offset by expenditures for property, plant, and equipment. as of december 31, 2016, $1.2 billion of our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities were held by foreign subsidiaries and were primarily based in u.s. dollar, euro, and malaysian ringgit denominated holdings. as of december 31, 2015, $1.5 billion of our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities were held by foreign subsidiaries and were primarily based in u.s. dollar and euro denominated holdings.
we utilize a variety of tax planning and financing strategies in an effort to ensure that our worldwide cash is available in the locations in which it is needed. if these funds were needed for our operations in the u.s., we could be required to accrue and pay u.s. taxes to repatriate such funds. in november 2016, we distributed $750.0 million of cash to the u.s. to fund capital investments associated with our transition to series 6 module manufacturing. other than this distribution, we intend to permanently reinvest our unremitted earnings outside of the u.s., with the exception of canada and germany, and our future plans do not demonstrate a need to repatriate additional amounts to fund our domestic operations. furthermore, changes to foreign government banking regulations may restrict our ability to move funds among various jurisdictions under certain circumstances, which could negatively impact our access to capital, resulting in an adverse effect on our liquidity and capital resources.
our systems business requires significant liquidity and is expected to continue to have significant liquidity requirements in the future. the net amount of our project assets, deferred project costs, billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings, and payments and billings for deferred project costs, which approximates our net capital investment in the development and construction of systems projects was $1.1 billion as of december 31, 2016. solar power project development and construction cycles, which span the time between the identification of a site location and the commercial operation of a system, vary substantially and can take many years to mature. as a result of these long project cycles and strategic decisions to finance the construction of certain projects, we may need to make significant up-front investments of resources in advance of the receipt of any cash from the sale of such projects. these up-front investments may include using our working capital, project financing arrangements, or availability under our revolving credit facility to finance the construction of such projects. for example, we may have to complete, or substantially complete, the construction of a systems project before such project is sold. delays in construction progress or in completing the sale of our systems projects that we are self-financing may also impact our liquidity. we have historically financed these up-front systems project investments primarily using working capital. in certain circumstances, we may need to finance construction costs exclusively using working capital, if project financing becomes unavailable due to market-wide, regional, or other concerns.
we are partnering with local developers on project development in markets around the world where we may take an equity stake in a project for a number of years. we are also self-developing projects in such markets where we may hold all or a significant portion of the equity in the projects for several years. given the duration of these investments and the currency risk relative to the u.s. dollar in some of these new markets, we continue to explore local financing alternatives. should these financing alternatives be unavailable or too cost prohibitive, we could be exposed to significant currency risk and our liquidity could be adversely impacted.
62
additionally, we may elect to retain an ownership interest in certain systems projects after they become operational if we determine it would be of economic and strategic benefit to do so. if, for example, we cannot sell a systems project at economics that are attractive to us or potential customers are unwilling to assume the risks and rewards typical of pv solar power system ownership, we may instead elect to temporarily own and operate such systems until we can sell the systems on economically attractive terms. as with traditional electricity generation assets, the selling price of a pv solar power system could be higher at or post-completion to reflect the elimination of construction and performance risks and other uncertainties. the decision to retain ownership of a system impacts liquidity depending upon the size and cost of the project. as of december 31, 2016, we had $448.6 million of pv solar power systems that have been placed in service, primarily in international markets. we may elect to enter into temporary or long-term project financing to reduce the impact on our liquidity and working capital with regards to such projects and systems. we may also consider entering into tax equity or other arrangements with respect to ownership interests in certain of our projects, including selling interests in our projects to the partnership described under "management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations - certain trends and uncertainties - 8point3 energy partners lp," which could cause a portion of the economics of such projects to be recognized over time.
the following additional considerations have impacted or may impact our liquidity in 2017 and beyond:
•   the amount of accounts receivable, unbilled and retainage as of december 31, 2016 was $205.5 million, which included $199.3 million of unbilled amounts. these unbilled accounts receivable represent revenue that has been recognized in advance of billing the customer under the terms of the underlying construction contracts. such construction costs have been funded with working capital, and the unbilled amounts are expected to be billed and collected from customers during the next 12 months. once we meet the billing criteria under a construction contract, we bill our customers accordingly and reclassify the accounts receivable, unbilled and retainage to accounts receivable trade, net. the amount of accounts receivable, unbilled and retainage as of december 31, 2016 also included $6.3 million of retainage, which represents the portion of a systems project contract price earned by us for work performed, but held for payment by our customer as a form of security until we reach certain construction milestones. such retainage amounts relate to construction costs incurred and construction work already performed.
•   the amount of solar module inventory and bos parts as of december 31, 2016 was $365.1 million. as we continue with the construction of our advanced-stage project pipeline, we must produce solar modules and procure bos parts in the required volumes to support our planned construction schedules. as part of this construction cycle, we typically must manufacture modules or acquire the necessary bos parts for construction activities in advance of receiving payment for such materials, which may temporarily reduce our liquidity. once solar modules and bos parts are installed in a project, such installed amounts are classified as either project assets, deferred project costs, pv solar power systems, or cost of sales depending upon whether the project is subject to a definitive sales contract and whether all revenue recognition criteria have been met. as of december 31, 2016, $104.9 million, or 35%, of our solar module inventory was either on-site or in-transit to our systems projects. all bos parts are for our systems business projects.
•   we may commit working capital during 2017 and beyond to acquire solar power projects in various stages of development, including advanced-stage projects with ppas, and to continue developing those projects as necessary. depending upon the size and stage of development, costs to acquire such solar power projects could be significant. when evaluating project acquisition opportunities, we consider both the strategic and financial benefits of any such acquisitions.
•   joint ventures or other strategic arrangements with partners are a key part of our strategy. we have initiatives in several markets to expedite our penetration of those markets and establish relationships with potential customers. some of these arrangements involve and are expected to involve significant investments or other allocations of capital that could reduce our liquidity or require us to pursue additional sources of financing, assuming such sources are available to us. additionally, we have elected and may in the future elect or be required to temporarily retain a noncontrolling ownership interest in certain underlying systems projects we develop, supply modules to, or construct. any such retained ownership interest is expected to impact our liquidity to the extent we do not obtain new sources of capital to fund such investments.
•   we expect to make significant capital investments over the next two years as we transition our production to series 6 module technology and purchase the related manufacturing equipment. we expect the aggregate capital investment for this program to be approximately $1 billion. during 2017, we expect to spend $525 million to $625 million for capital expenditures, the majority of which is associated with the series 6 transition. we believe these capital expenditures will further increase our solar module conversion efficiencies, reduce manufacturing costs, and reduce the overall cost of systems employing our modules.

cash flows the following table summarizes the key cash flow metrics for the years ended december 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014 (in thousands):
years ended
2016                  2015                  2014

effect of exchange rate changes on cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash            (6,306   )           (19,272   )           (19,487   )
net increase (decrease) in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash                  $208,574             $(399,451   )          $281,304
operating activities the increase in cash provided by operating activities during 2016 was primarily driven by the lower volume of solar power projects under development and construction, which generally require significant liquidity when such projects are financed using working capital. specifically, the reduction in the volume of our system business affected our trade accounts receivable, project assets, deferred project costs, and certain current liabilities. the increase in cash provided by operating activities was also driven by the sale of certain other solar power projects at or near substantial completion. the decrease in cash provided by operating activities during 2015 was primarily driven by the increase in project assets and deferred project costs resulting from our financing the construction of certain projects with our working capital and increases in our trade accounts receivable.
investing activities the increase in cash provided by investing activities during 2016 was primarily due to proceeds from sales of equity and cost method investments of $291.5 million, including the sale of our remaining interest in the desert stateline project, and higher net proceeds from sales and maturities of marketable securities and restricted investments of $102.9 million during 2016 compared to $203.1 million of net purchases of marketable securities and restricted investments in 2015. the effects of these items were partially offset by lower distributions received from equity method investments in 2016. the decrease in cash used in investing activities during 2015 was driven by the receipt of $239.0 million from the ipo of the partnership, and lower purchases of property, plant and equipment. the effects of these items were partially offset by net purchases of marketable securities of $203.1 million during 2015 compared to $77.5 million during 2014.
financing activities cash used in financing activities during 2016 was mainly driven by payments of long-term debt of $137.4 million. cash provided by financing activities during 2015 primarily resulted from $146.0 million of proceeds from borrowings under our project construction credit facilities in chile, india, and japan and $44.7 million of proceeds from the leaseback financing associated with the maryland solar project, partially offset by $47.1 million of payments of long-term debt.

critical accounting estimates in preparing our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states, we make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts of reported assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses, as well as the disclosure of contingent liabilities. some of our accounting policies require the application of significant judgment in the selection of the appropriate assumptions for making these estimates. by their nature, these judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty. we base our judgments and estimates on our historical experience, our forecasts, and other available information, as appropriate. the actual results experienced by us may differ materially and adversely from our estimates. to the extent there are material differences between our estimates and the actual results, our future results of operations will be affected. our significant accounting policies are described in note 2 "summary of significant accounting policies" to our consolidated financial statements for the year ended december 31, 2016 included in this annual report on form 10-k. our critical accounting estimates, which require the most significant management estimates and judgment in determining the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10-k, are as follows:
revenue recognition - systems business. we recognize revenue for arrangements entered into by our systems business generally using two revenue recognition models, following the guidance in either asc 605-35, construction-type and production-type contracts, or asc 360-20, real estate sales, for arrangements which include land or land rights.
systems business sales arrangements in which we construct a pv solar power system for a specific customer on land that is controlled by the customer, and has not been previously controlled by first solar, are accounted for under asc 605-35. for such sales arrangements, we use the percentage-of-completion method, as described further below, using actual costs incurred over total estimated costs to develop and construct the system (including module costs) as our standard accounting policy.
systems business sales arrangements in which we convey control of land or land rights as part of the transaction are accounted for under asc 360-20. accordingly, we use one of the following revenue recognition methods, based upon an evaluation of the substance and form of the terms and conditions of such real estate sales:
(i)   we apply the percentage-of-completion method, as further described below, to certain real estate sales arrangements in which we convey control of land or land rights when a sale has been consummated, we have transferred the usual risks and rewards of ownership to the buyer, the initial and continuing investment criteria have been met, we have the ability to estimate our costs and progress toward completion, and all other revenue recognition criteria have been met. when evaluating whether the usual risks and rewards of ownership have transferred to the buyer, we consider whether we have or may be contingently required to have any prohibited forms of continuing involvement with the project pursuant to asc 360-20. the initial and continuing investment requirements, which demonstrate a buyer's commitment to honor its obligations for the sales arrangement, can typically be met through the receipt of cash or an irrevocable letter of credit from a highly creditworthy lending institution.
(ii)   depending on whether the initial and continuing investment requirements have been met and whether collectability from the buyer is reasonably assured, we may align our revenue recognition and release of project assets or deferred project costs to cost of sales with the receipt of payment from the buyer if the sale has been consummated and we have transferred the usual risks and rewards of ownership to the buyer.
for any systems business sales arrangements containing multiple deliverables not required to be accounted for under asc 605-35 (long-term construction contracts) or asc 360-20 (real estate sales), we analyze each activity within the sales arrangement to adhere to the separation guidelines of asc 605-25 for multiple-element arrangements. we allocate revenue for any transactions involving multiple elements to each unit of accounting based on its relative selling price and recognize revenue for each unit of accounting when all revenue recognition criteria for a unit of accounting have been met.
our system business sales arrangements within the scope of asc 360-20 involve a range of standard product warranties, which include limited solar module warranties, limited bos warranties, and system capacity and energy performance testing. each standard product warranty program represents a risk of the module manufacturer or system epc contractor, and is not an obligation or risk of a system owner. these programs do not represent any guarantee of energy output and relate to the underlying performance of the system assets. consequently, our product warranty programs do not represent any guarantees of cash flows related to the systems, and we have not assumed any of the risks and rewards of ownership with respect to such programs. separately, our system customers may also engage us to provide o&m services, which would typically include an effective availability guarantee. our availability guarantees are an incremental offering within separate arrangements for o&m services. availability guarantees are guarantees of our own service performance and do not represent guarantees of a system's output or cash flows. accordingly, our product warranties and market based service contracts are not forms of continuing involvement that would indicate that substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership have not been transferred to the system owner.
66
revenue recognition - percentage-of-completion. in applying the percentage-of-completion method, we use the actual costs incurred relative to the total estimated costs (including module costs) in order to determine the progress towards completion and calculate the corresponding amount of revenue and profit to recognize. costs incurred include solar modules, direct materials, labor, subcontractor costs, and those indirect costs related to contract performance, such as indirect labor and supplies. we recognize solar module and direct material costs as incurred when such items have been installed in a system. when contracts specify that title to solar modules and direct materials transfers to the customer before installation has been performed, we will not recognize revenue or the associated costs until those materials are installed and have met all other revenue recognition requirements. we consider solar modules and direct materials to be installed when they are permanently placed or affixed to a pv solar power system as required by engineering designs. solar modules manufactured and owned by us that will be used in our systems remain within inventory until such modules are installed in a system.
the percentage-of-completion method of revenue recognition requires us to make estimates of net contract revenues and costs to complete our projects. in making such estimates, management judgments are required to evaluate significant assumptions including the amount of net contract revenues, the cost of materials and labor, expected labor productivity, the impact of potential variances in schedule completion, and the impact of any penalties, claims, change orders, or performance incentives.
if estimated total costs on any contract are greater than the net contract revenues, we recognize the entire estimated loss in the period the loss becomes known. the cumulative effect of the revisions to estimates related to net contract revenues and costs to complete contracts, including penalties, claims, change orders, performance incentives, anticipated losses, and others are recorded in the period in which the revisions to estimates are identified and the amounts can be reasonably estimated. the effect of the changes on future periods are recognized as if the revised estimates had been used since revenue was initially recognized under the contract. such revisions could occur in any reporting period, and the effects may be material depending on the size of the contracts or the changes in estimates.
accrued solar module collection and recycling liability. we recognize expense at the time of sale for the estimated cost of our future obligations for collecting and recycling solar modules covered by our solar module collection and recycling program. we estimate the cost of our collection and recycling obligations based on the present value of the expected probability-weighted future cost of collecting and recycling the solar modules, which includes estimates for the cost of packaging materials, the cost of freight from the solar module installation sites to a recycling center, the material, labor, capital costs, and scale of recycling centers, and an estimated third-party profit margin and return on risk for collection and recycling services. we base these estimates on (i) our experience collecting and recycling our solar modules, (ii) the expected timing of when our solar modules will be returned for recycling, and (iii) expected economic conditions at the time the solar modules will be collected and recycled. in the periods between the time of sale and the related settlement of the collection and recycling obligation, we accrete the carrying amount of the associated liability by applying the discount rate used for its initial measurement. we periodically review our estimates of expected future recycling costs and may adjust our liability accordingly.
at december 31, 2016, our estimated liability for collecting and recycling solar modules covered by our collection and recycling program was $166.3 million. a 1% increase in the annualized inflation rate used in our estimated future collection and recycling cost per module would increase our liability by $37.5 million, and a 1% decrease in that rate would decrease our liability by $31.0 million.
product warranties. we provide a limited pv solar module warranty covering defects in materials and workmanship under normal use and service conditions for generally 10 years. we also typically warrant that modules installed in accordance with agreed-upon specifications will produce at least 97% of their labeled power output rating during the first year, with the warranty coverage reducing by 0.7% every year thereafter throughout the 25-year performance warranty period. in resolving claims under both the limited defect and power output warranties, we typically have the option of either repairing or replacing the covered modules or, under the limited power output warranty, providing additional modules to remedy the power shortfall. we also have the option to make a payment for the then-current market price of modules to resolve the claims. such limited module warranties are standard for module sales and may be transferred from the original purchasers of the solar modules to subsequent purchasers upon resale.
67
as an alternative form of our standard limited module power output warranty, we also offer an aggregated or system-level limited module performance warranty. this system-level limited module performance warranty is designed for utility-scale systems and provides 25-year system-level energy degradation protection. in addition, this warranty represents a practical expedient to address the challenge of identifying, from the potential millions of modules installed in a utility-scale system, individual modules that may be performing below warranty thresholds by focusing on the aggregate energy generated by the system rather than the power output of individual modules. the system-level module performance warranty typically is calculated as a percentage of a system's expected energy production, adjusted for certain actual site conditions, with the warranted level of performance declining each year in a linear fashion, but never falling below 80% during the term of the warranty. in resolving claims under the system-level limited module performance warranty to restore the system to warranted performance levels, we first must validate that the root cause of the issue is due to module performance; we then have the option of either repairing or replacing the covered modules, providing supplemental modules, or making a cash payment. consistent with our limited module power output warranty, when we elect to satisfy a warranty claim by providing replacement or supplemental modules under the system-level module performance warranty, we do not have any obligation to pay for the labor to remove or install modules.
in addition to our limited solar module warranties described above, for pv solar power systems built by us, we typically provide a limited product warranty on bos parts for defects in engineering design, installation, and workmanship for a period of one to two years following the substantial completion of a system. in resolving claims under such bos warranties, we have the option of remedying the defect through repair or replacement.
when we recognize revenue for module or systems sales, we accrue liabilities for the estimated future costs of meeting our limited warranty obligations. we make and revise these estimates based primarily on the number of our solar modules under warranty installed at customer locations, our historical experience with warranty claims, our monitoring of field installation sites, our internal testing of and the expected future performance of our solar modules and bos components, and our estimated per-module replacement costs.
at december 31, 2016, our accrued liabilities for product warranties was $252.4 million. we estimate our limited product warranty liability for power output and defects in materials and workmanship under normal use and service conditions based on a warranty return rate of approximately 1% to 3% for modules covered under warranty. as of december 31, 2016, 1% change in the estimated warranty return rate would change our module warranty liability by $83.5 million, and a 1% change in the estimated warranty return rate for bos components would not have a material impact on the associated warranty liability.
performance testing. for systems sales arrangements, we also conduct performance testing of a system prior to substantial completion to confirm the system meets its operational and capacity expectations noted in the epc agreement. in addition, we may provide an energy performance test during the first or second year of a system's operation to demonstrate that the actual energy generation for the applicable year meets or exceeds the modeled energy expectation, after certain adjustments. these tests are based on meteorological, energy, and equipment performance data measured at the system's location as well as certain projections of such data over the remaining measurement period. if there is an underperformance event with regards to these tests, we may incur liquidated damages as a percentage of the epc contract price. if necessary, we accrue estimates for liquidated damages at the end of each reporting period based on our performance testing. in certain instances, a bonus payment may be received at the end of the first year if the system performs above a specified level.
as part of our o&m service offerings, we typically offer an effective availability guarantee, which stipulates that a system will be available to generate a certain percentage of total possible energy during a specific period after adjusting for factors outside of our control as the service provider, such as weather, curtailment, outages, force majeure, and other conditions that may affect system availability. effective availability guarantees are only offered as part of our o&m services and terminate at the end of an o&m arrangement. these guarantees are based on meteorological, energy, and equipment performance data measured at the system's location as well as certain projections of such data over the remaining measurement period. if we fail to meet the contractual threshold for these guarantees, we may incur liquidated damages for certain lost energy under the ppa. if necessary, we accrue estimates for liquidated damages at the end of each reporting period based on our effective availability calculations. conversely, many of our o&m agreements contain provisions whereby we may receive a bonus payment if system availability exceeds a separate threshold.
68
accounting for income taxes. we are subject to the income tax laws of the united states, and its states and municipalities, and those of the foreign jurisdictions in which we have significant business operations. these tax laws are complex and subject to different interpretations by the taxpayer and the relevant governmental taxing authorities. we must make judgments and interpretations about the application of these inherently complex tax laws when determining our provision for income taxes and must also make estimates about when in the future certain items affect taxable income in the various tax jurisdictions. disputes over interpretations of the tax laws may be settled with the taxing authority upon examination or audit. we regularly evaluate the likelihood of assessments in each of the taxing jurisdictions resulting from current and future examinations, and we record tax liabilities as appropriate.
we establish liabilities for potential additional taxes based on our assessment of the outcome of our tax positions. once established, we adjust the liabilities when additional information becomes available or when an event occurs requiring an adjustment. significant judgment is required in making these estimates and the actual cost of a tax assessment, fine, or penalty may ultimately be materially different from our recorded liabilities, if any.
in preparing our consolidated financial statements, we calculate our income tax expense based on our interpretation of the tax laws and regulations in the various jurisdictions where we conduct business. this requires us to estimate our current tax obligations, assess uncertain tax positions, and assess temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities. these temporary differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities.
we must also assess the likelihood that each of our deferred tax assets will be realized. to the extent we believe that realization of any of our deferred tax assets is not more likely than not, we establish a valuation allowance. when we establish a valuation allowance or increase this allowance in a reporting period, we generally record a corresponding tax expense in our consolidated statement of operations. conversely, to the extent circumstances indicate that a valuation allowance is no longer necessary, that portion of the valuation allowance is reversed, which generally reduces our overall income tax expense.
we also consider the unremitted earnings of our foreign subsidiaries and determine whether such amounts are indefinitely reinvested. no additional u.s. or non-u.s. taxes have been accrued that may be incurred if such amounts were repatriated to the united states. we have concluded that, except for the earnings of our canadian and german subsidiaries and with respect to previously taxed income, all such accumulated earnings are currently indefinitely reinvested or that if upon repatriation no additional u.s. or non-u.s. tax would be due. if our intention to indefinitely reinvest the earnings of our foreign subsidiaries changes, additional u.s. and non-u.s. taxes may be required to be accrued.
we continually explore initiatives to better align our tax and legal entity structure with the footprint of our non-u.s. operations and recognize the tax impact of these initiatives, including changes in the assessment of uncertain tax positions, indefinite reinvestment exception assertions, and the realizability of deferred tax assets, in the period when we believe all necessary internal and external approvals associated with such initiatives have been obtained, or when the initiatives are materially complete. it is possible that the completion of one or more of these initiatives may occur within the next 12 months.
long-lived asset impairment. we assess long-lived assets classified as "held and used," including our property, plant and equipment, project assets, and pv solar power systems, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances arise, including consideration of technological obsolescence, that may indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable, and these assessments require significant judgment in determining whether such events or changes have occurred. relevant considerations may include a significant decrease in the market price of a long-lived asset; a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which a long-lived asset is being used or in its physical condition; a significant adverse change in the business climate that could affect the value of a long-lived asset; an accumulation of costs significantly in excess of the amount originally expected for the acquisition or construction of a long-lived asset; a current-period operating or cash flow loss combined with a history of such losses or a projection of future losses associated with the use of a long-lived asset; or a current expectation that, more likely than not, a long-lived asset will be sold or otherwise disposed of significantly before the end of its previously estimated useful life. for purposes of recognition and measurement of an impairment loss, long-lived assets are grouped with other assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities, and we must exercise judgment in assessing such groupings and levels.

when impairment indicators are present, we compare undiscounted future cash flows, including the eventual disposition of the asset group at market value, to the asset group's carrying value to determine if the asset group is recoverable. if the carrying value of the asset group exceeds the undiscounted future cash flows, we measure any impairment by comparing the fair value of the asset group to its carrying value. fair value is generally determined by considering (i) internally developed discounted cash flows for the asset group, (ii) actual third-party valuations, and/or (iii) information available regarding the current market value for such assets. if the fair value of an asset group is determined to be less than its the carrying value, an impairment in the amount of the difference is recorded in the period that the impairment indicator occurs. estimating future cash flows requires significant judgment, and such projections may vary from the cash flows eventually realized.
goodwill. goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price of acquired businesses over the estimated fair value assigned to the individual assets acquired and liabilities assumed. we do not amortize goodwill, but instead are required to test goodwill for impairment at least annually. if necessary, we would record any impairment in accordance with asc 350, intangibles - goodwill and other. we perform impairment tests between scheduled annual tests in the fourth quarter if facts and circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit that has goodwill is less than its carrying value.
we may first make a qualitative assessment of whether it is more likely than not that a reporting unit's fair value is less than its carrying value to determine whether it is necessary to perform the two-step goodwill impairment test. the qualitative impairment test considers various factors including macroeconomic conditions, industry and market considerations, cost factors, the overall financial performance of a reporting unit, and any other relevant events affecting the entity or its reporting units. if we determine through the qualitative assessment that a reporting unit's fair value is more likely than not greater than its carrying value, the two-step impairment test is not required. if the qualitative assessment indicates it is more likely than not that a reporting unit's fair value is less than its carrying value, we must perform the two-step impairment test. we may also elect to proceed directly to the two-step impairment test without considering such qualitative factors.
the first step in a two-step impairment test is the comparison of the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount, including goodwill. our reporting units consist of our cdte module manufacturing business and our fully integrated systems business. in accordance with the authoritative guidance over fair value measurements, we define the fair value of a reporting unit as the price that would be received to sell the unit as a whole in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. we primarily use the income approach methodology of valuation, which includes the discounted cash flow method, to estimate the fair value of our reporting units.
significant management judgment is required when estimating the fair value of our reporting units including the forecasting of future operating results and the selection of discount and expected future growth rates that we use in determining the projected cash flows. if the estimated fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, goodwill is not impaired and no further analysis is required.
if the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value in the first step, then we are required to perform the second step of the impairment test. in this step, we assign the fair value of the reporting unit calculated in step one to all of the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit, as if a market participant just acquired the reporting unit in a business combination. the excess of the fair value of the reporting unit determined in the first step of the impairment test over the total amount assigned to the assets and liabilities in the second step of the impairment test represents the implied fair value of goodwill. if the carrying value of a reporting unit's goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of goodwill, we would record an impairment loss equal to the difference. if there is no such excess, then all goodwill for a reporting unit is considered impaired.

item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations unless otherwise indicated or the context otherwise requires, as used in this "management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations," the terms "we," "us," "the company," "our," "cdw" and similar terms refer to cdw corporation and its subsidiaries. "management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations" should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this report. this discussion contains forward-looking statements that are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties. actual results may differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements. see "forward-looking statements" above.
overview cdw corporation is a fortune 500 company and a leading provider of integrated information technology ("it") solutions in the united states, canada and the united kingdom. we help over 250,000 small, medium and large business, and government, education and healthcare customers by delivering critical solutions to meet their increasingly complex it needs. our broad array of offerings ranges from discrete hardware and software products to integrated it solutions such as mobility, security, data center, virtualization and digital workspace. we are technology "agnostic," with a product portfolio including more than 100,000 products from more than 1,000 leading and emerging brands. our solutions are delivered in physical, virtual and cloud-based environments. we provide our products and solutions through over 5,500 customer-facing coworkers, including sellers, highly-skilled technology specialists and advanced service delivery engineers.
we are a leading sales channel partner for many original equipment manufacturers ("oems"), software publishers and cloud providers (collectively, our "vendor partners"), whose products we sell or include in the solutions we offer. we provide our vendor partners with a cost-effective way to reach customers and deliver a consistent brand experience through our established end-market coverage, technical expertise and extensive customer access.
on august 1, 2015, we purchased the remaining 65% of kelway's outstanding common stock, which increased our ownership interest from 35% to 100%, and provided us control. rebranded cdw uk in april 2016, the acquisition extended our footprint into the united kingdom. it also enhanced our ability to provide it solutions to us based customers with multinational locations. financial results of cdw uk are included in our consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition. for further details regarding the acquisition, see note 3 (acquisition) to the accompanying consolidated financial statements, under item 8, "financial statements and supplementary data".
we have two reportable segments, corporate and public. we segregate the corporate segment into private sector business customers in the us based on employee size between medium/large customers, which primarily includes organizations with more than 100 employees, and small business customers, which primarily includes organizations with up to 100 employees. our public segment is comprised of government agencies and education and healthcare institutions in the us. we also have two other operating segments: canada and cdw uk, each of which do not meet the reportable segment quantitative thresholds and, accordingly, are included in an all other category ("other"). for additional information relating to cdw uk, see note 3 (acquisition) to our consolidated financial statements. the cdw advanced services business consists primarily of customized engineering services delivered by technology specialists and engineers, and managed services that include infrastructure as a service ("iaas") offerings. effective january 1, 2016, the cdw advanced services business was included in our corporate and public segments. effective january 1, 2017, we established small business as its own operating segment to align our financial reporting with the manner in which the chief operating decision maker assesses performance and makes resource allocation decisions. by separating small
29
business from our corporate segment we will drive increased focus and accountability for both segments. to achieve our vision to be small business customers "first choice for technology" we are aligning coworkers and digital resources that point directly at this growing market.
we may sell all or only select products that our vendor partners offer. each vendor partner agreement provides for specific terms and conditions, which may include one or more of the following: product return privileges, price protection policies, purchase discounts and vendor incentive programs, such as purchase or sales rebates and cooperative advertising reimbursements. we also resell software for major software publishers. our agreements with software publishers allow the end-user customer to acquire software or licensed products and services. in addition to helping our customers determine the best software solutions for their needs, we help them manage their software agreements, including warranties and renewals. a significant portion of our advertising and marketing expenses is reimbursed through cooperative advertising programs with our vendor partners. these programs are at the discretion of our vendor partners and are typically tied to sales or other commitments to be met by us within a specified period of time.
trends and key factors affecting our financial performance we believe the following trends and key factors may have an important impact on our financial performance:
•   general economic conditions are a key factor affecting our ability to generate sales and achieve our targeted operating results as they impact our customers' willingness to spend on information technology. this is particularly the case for corporate customers, as their purchases tend to reflect confidence in their business prospects, which are driven by their perceptions of business conditions. purchasing behavior may be different between our medium/large customers and small business customers due to their perception of business conditions.
•   changes in spending policies, budget priorities and revenue levels are a key factor influencing government purchasing levels. our government results also reflect increased interest in meeting public safety needs through technology solutions by state and local customers, as well as our ability to address strategic changes made by the federal government toward a more programmatic technology strategy.
•   customer focus on security has been, and we expect will continue to be, an ongoing trend. customers are seeking solutions to protect their internal systems against threats and are implementing solutions that provide enterprise-wide visibility, detection expertise and investigation workflows. they are also implementing endpoint security, firewall segmentation and user authentication tools.
•   the healthcare industry continues to experience consolidation, which has caused uneven technology growth as customers assess their post-acquisition state.
•   our education sales channel performance continues to be impacted by the implementation of networking projects related to the us federal communications commission e-rate program. we are also seeing positive impacts as schools develop digital testing and curriculum programs, and work to create new learning environments for students. within the higher education market, networking projects continue to be a key priority across campuses. while technology is an opportunity to create cost savings and improve productivity, funding is a key determinant of technology spending in education.
•   there continues to be substantial uncertainty regarding the impact of brexit. potential adverse consequences of brexit such as global market uncertainty, volatility in currency exchange rates, greater restrictions on imports and exports between uk and eu countries and increased regulatory complexities could have a negative impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
•   technology trends drive customer purchase behaviors and we are seeing continuing evolution in the market. innovation influences customer purchases across all of our customer end-markets. key trends in technology include increasing adoption of cloud-based solutions for certain key workloads, including security, as well as adoption of hyper-converged appliances to deliver greater flexibility and efficiency. in addition, hybrid cloud solutions are being adopted, along with software being embedded into solutions.
key business metrics we monitor a number of financial and non-financial measures and ratios on a regular basis in order to track the progress of our business and make adjustments as necessary. we believe that the most important of these measures and ratios include average daily sales, gross margin, operating margin, net income, non-gaap net income, net income per common share, non-gaap net income per diluted share, ebitda and adjusted ebitda, free cash flow, return on invested capital, cash and cash equivalents,
30
net working capital, cash conversion cycle (defined to be days of sales outstanding in accounts receivable plus days of supply in inventory minus days of purchases outstanding in accounts payable, based on a rolling three-month average), debt levels including available credit and leverage ratios, sales per coworker and coworker turnover. these measures and ratios are compared to standards or objectives set by management, so that actions can be taken, as necessary, in order to achieve the standards and objectives.
non-gaap net income, non-gaap net income per diluted share, ebitda and adjusted ebitda are non-gaap financial measures.
we believe these measures provide analysts, investors and management with helpful information regarding the underlying operating performance of our business, as they remove the impact of items that management believes are not reflective of underlying operating performance. management uses these measures to evaluate period-over-period performance as management believes they provide a more comparable measure of the underlying business. additionally, adjusted ebitda is a measure in the credit agreement governing our senior secured term loan facility ("term loan") used to evaluate our ability to make certain investments, incur additional debt, and make restricted payments, such as dividends and share repurchases, as well as whether we are required to make additional principal prepayments on the term loan beyond the quarterly amortization payments. for further details regarding the term loan, see long-term debt and financing arrangements within management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and note 8 (long-term debt) to the accompanying consolidated financial statements. for the definitions of non-gaap net income and adjusted ebitda and reconciliations to net income, see "results of operations".

(1)   there were 254 selling days for the years ended december 31, 2016 and 2015.
total net sales in 2016 increased $993 million, or 7.6%, to $13,982 million, compared to $12,989 million in 2015, reflecting both solid organic increases and the inclusion of seven months of incremental cdw uk sales. total net sales increased 8.3% on a constant currency basis. there were five key trends that impacted our net sales growth. first, customers were seeking to optimize their infrastructure by extending asset lives or adding capacity, which led to increases in warranties and virtualization software. second, customer focus on designing it securely continued to be a major area of interest for customers, and we saw excellent increases across our entire security portfolio, including security software. we also saw our customers seeking architectures
32
to increase the flexibility and efficiency of their it infrastructure, which drove increased adoption of cloud solutions for certain workloads, including security, as well as increased sales of hyper-converged infrastructure. fourth, we saw the on-going trend where a greater proportion of solutions are being delivered via software. with software becoming more "mission critical," customers continued to turn to software assurance to protect their investment. finally, customer demand for digital signage and video screens, as well as notebook/mobile devices, drove growth across all of our customer end-markets.
corporate segment net sales in 2016 increased $62 million, or 0.9%, compared to 2015, driven by sales growth within the small business customer channel. net sales to medium/large customers increased $4 million, or 0.1%, year over year, as customer demand for longer tail purchases, including data center and networking solutions, was impacted by slow economic growth and market trends. medium/large had strong sales performance in notebook/mobile devices and software products. economic conditions had less of an impact on small business results, as net sales to small business customers increased by $57 million, or 5.2%, between periods, driven by growth in notebooks/mobile devices, desktops, and video projection hardware.
public segment net sales in 2016 increased $406 million, or 7.8%, between years. net sales to government customers increased $163 million, or 9.6%. state and local government customers continued to focus on public safety and we benefited from new contracts. our federal channel saw low single-digit growth as the success we had meeting new strategic programs was partially offset by the impact of several large client device purchase orders that were delayed into 2017. net sales to education customers increased $199 million, or 11.0%, year over year, driven by continued success providing client devices to support digital testing and curriculums, as well as desktops and video projection hardware to support new learning environments for students. healthcare growth was 2.6% or $43 million, driven by notebooks/mobile devices, desktops and software. patient data security continues to be a top concern. we continued to see some of our larger customers shifting priorities to reducing costs due to industry consolidation.
net sales in other, which is comprised of our canadian and cdw uk operations, increased $526 million, or 62.8%, compared 2015. the increase in net sales was primarily driven by the impact of consolidating twelve months of cdw uk net sales in 2016 compared to consolidating five months of cdw uk results in 2015. both our canadian and uk businesses grew high-single digits in local currency in 2016. currency was impacted by canadian dollar to us dollar translation in the first half of the year and british pound to us dollar translation in the second half.
gross profit gross profit increased $211 million, or 10.0%, to $2,327 million in 2016, compared to $2,116 million in 2015. as a percentage of net sales, gross profit increased 30 basis points to 16.6% in 2016, from 16.3% in 2015.
gross profit margin was positively impacted 30 basis points by a higher mix of net service contract revenue as customers looked to extend the life of equipment through warranties, protect their software investments through software assurance and adopt cloud solutions to deliver certain workloads. all of these solutions grew faster than our overall net sales. in addition, vendor partner funding positively impacted gross margin by 35 basis points. these increases helped offset the impact of 30 basis points from unfavorable product margin.
gross profit margin may fluctuate based on various factors, including vendor incentive and inventory price protection programs, cooperative advertising funds classified as a reduction of cost of sales, product mix, net service contract revenue, commission revenue, pricing strategies, market conditions and other factors.
selling and administrative expenses selling and administrative expenses increased $119 million, or 9.7%, to $1,345 million in 2016, compared to $1,226 million in 2015. as a percentage of total net sales, selling and administrative expenses increased 20 basis points to 9.6% in 2016, up from 9.4% in 2015. payroll costs increased $65 million, or 11.7%, year over year, primarily due to incremental coworker hires at the end of 2015, higher compensation costs consistent with increased gross profit and the inclusion of twelve months of cdw uk payroll costs in 2016 compared to five months in 2015. total coworker count was 8,516 at december 31, 2016, up 51 from 8,465 at december 31, 2015. amortization expense related to intangibles increased $18 million, or 8.8%, during 2016 compared to 2015, primarily due to incremental amortization expense related to the intangible assets arising from our acquisition of cdw uk. non-cash equity-based compensation expense increased $8 million, or 25.8%, during 2016 compared to 2015, primarily due to annual equity awards granted under our 2013 long-term incentive plan, performance against long-term incentive program targets and equity awards granted in connection with our acquisition of cdw uk.

interest expense, net at december 31, 2016, our outstanding long-term debt totaled $3,234 million, compared to $3,260 million at december 31, 2015, a decrease of $26 million primarily due to principal payments on the loans. net interest expense in 2016 was $147 million, a decrease of $13 million, compared to $160 million in 2015. this decrease was primarily due to the lower effective interest rates and the lower principal loan balances for 2016 compared to 2015 as a result of redemptions and refinancing activities completed during 2016 and 2015, and the impact in 2016 of mark-to-market gains associated with our interest rate cap agreements.

(1)   we repaid all of the remaining aggregate principal amount outstanding. the loss recognized represents the difference between the aggregate principal amount and the net carrying amount of the purchased debt, adjusted for the remaining unamortized deferred financing costs and premium.
gain on remeasurement of equity investment on august 1, 2015, we completed the acquisition of cdw uk by purchasing the remaining 65% of its outstanding common stock which increased our ownership interest from 35% to 100%, and provided us control. as a result, our previously held 35% equity investment was remeasured to fair value, resulting in a gain of $98 million recorded in gain on remeasurement of equity investment in the consolidated statements of operations.
income tax expense income tax expense was $248 million in 2016, compared to $244 million in 2015. the effective income tax rate, expressed by calculating income tax expense or benefit as a percentage of income before income taxes, was 36.9% and 37.7% for 2016 and 2015, respectively.
for 2016, the effective tax rate differed from the us federal statutory rate primarily due to state income taxes and non-deductible meals and entertainment expenses, which were partially offset by lower corporate tax rates on our international income, a deferred tax benefit as a result of a tax rate reduction in the uk and excess tax benefits on equity compensation as a result of adopting asu 2016-09. for 2015, the effective tax rate differed from the us federal statutory rate primarily due to state income taxes and withholding tax expense on the earnings of our canadian business as a result of no longer asserting permanent reinvestment, which was partially offset by a deferred tax benefit as a result of a tax rate reduction in the uk. the lower effective tax rate for 2016 as compared to 2015 was primarily attributable to a larger benefit in 2016 related to our international income, which is taxed at lower tax rates than our us income, excess tax benefits on equity compensation as a result of adopting asu 2016-09 in 2016 and less canadian withholding tax expense in 2016 than in 2015, partially offset by a greater deferred tax benefit related to uk tax rate reductions in 2015 than in 2016.
non-gaap financial measure reconciliations we have included reconciliations of non-gaap net income, ebitda, adjusted ebitda, adjusted ebitda margin and consolidated net sales growth on a constant currency basis for the years ended december 31, 2016 and 2015 below.
non-gaap net income excludes, among other things, charges related to the amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, non-cash equity-based compensation, acquisition and integration expenses, and gains and losses from the extinguishment

of long-term debt. ebitda is defined as consolidated net income before interest expense, income tax expense, depreciation and amortization. adjusted ebitda, which is a measure defined in our credit agreements, means ebitda adjusted for certain items which are described in the table below. consolidated net sales growth on a constant currency basis is defined as consolidated net sales growth excluding the impact of foreign currency translation on net sales compared to the prior period.
non-gaap net income, ebitda, adjusted ebitda, adjusted ebitda margin and consolidated net sales growth on a constant currency basis are considered non-gaap financial measures. generally, a non-gaap financial measure is a numerical measure of a company's performance or financial position that either excludes or includes amounts that are not normally included or excluded in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with gaap. non-gaap measures used by management may differ from similar measures used by other companies, even when similar terms are used to identify such measures.
we believe these measures provide analysts, investors and management with helpful information regarding the underlying operating performance of our business, as they remove the impact of items that management believes are not reflective of underlying operating performance. management uses these measures to evaluate period-over-period performance as management believes they provide a more comparable measure of the underlying business. additionally, adjusted ebitda is a measure in the credit agreement governing our senior secured term loan facility ("term loan") used to evaluate our ability to make certain investments, incur additional debt and make restricted payments, such as dividends and share repurchases, as well as whether we are required to make additional principal prepayments on the term loan beyond the quarterly amortization payments. for further details regarding the term loan, see note 8 (long-term debt) to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.
non-gaap net income non-gaap net income was $569 million for the year ended december 31, 2016, an increase of $65 million, or 13.0%, compared to $504 million for the year ended december 31, 2015.

total net sales in 2015 increased $914 million, or 7.6%, to $12,989 million, compared to $12,075 million in 2014, reflecting both organic net sales growth and the impact of consolidating five months of cdw uk net sales. customer priorities continued to shift more towards integrated solutions, which drove higher growth in solutions sales compared to transactional product sales. strong sales performance in solutions-focused products was driven by netcomm and server and server-related products. the growth in transactional products was led by notebooks/mobile devices, partially offset by a decline in desktop computers.
organic net sales, which excludes the impact of the acquisition of cdw uk, increased $563.5 million, or 4.7%, to $12,638.0 million in 2015, compared to $12,074.5 million in 2014. organic net sales on a constant currency basis, which excludes the impact of foreign currency translation, in 2015 increased $635.0 million, or 5.3%, to $12,638.0 million, compared to $12,003.0 million in 2014. for additional information, see "non-gaap financial measure reconciliations" below.
corporate segment net sales in 2015 increased $364 million, or 5.5%, compared to 2014, driven by sales growth in both our medium/large and small business customer channels and reflecting stronger performance in solutions sales compared to transactional product sales. within our corporate segment, net sales to medium/large customers increased $297 million, or 5.3%, year over year, primarily due to strong sales performance in solutions-focused products driven by netcomm products and server and server-related products. growth in transactional products was driven by notebook/mobile devices, partially offset by a decline in desktop computers. net sales to small business customers increased by $67 million, or 6.6%, between periods, driven by growth in notebooks/mobile devices and netcomm products, partially offset by a decline in desktop computers.
public segment net sales in 2015 increased $245 million, or 5.0%, between years, due to strong sales performance in government and growth in healthcare, partially offset by education remaining relatively flat. net sales to government customers increased $225 million, or 15.2%, between periods, as sales to both federal and state/local government customers experienced mid-teens growth. the increase in net sales to the federal government was driven by growth in sales of netcomm products, software and enterprise storage, as we continued to benefit from strategic changes made to better align with new federal government purchasing programs implemented last year. a continued focus on public safety drove the increase in net sales to state/local government customers, which was led by netcomm products, notebooks/mobile devices and software, partially offset by a decline in desktop computers. net sales to education customers decreased $20 million, or 1.1%, year over year, primarily due to declines in notebooks/mobile devices, partially offset by growth in netcomm products. net sales to healthcare customers increased $40 million, or 2.5%, year over year, driven by growth in netcomm and server-related products, partially offset by declines in desktop computers and point-of-care technology carts, as some of our larger customers shifted priorities to reducing costs due to industry consolidation.

net sales in other in 2015 increased $305 million, or 57.2%, compared to 2014. other is comprised of canada and cdw uk. the increase in 2015 net sales was driven by the impact of consolidating five months of cdw uk, partially offset by a decline in the us dollar-denominated net sales of canada. the net sales of canada in constant currency continued to grow during 2015 compared to 2014.
gross profit gross profit increased $195 million, or 10.1%, to $2,116 million in 2015, compared to $1,921 million in 2014. as a percentage of net sales, gross profit increased 40 basis points to 16.3% in 2015, from 15.9% in 2014.
net service contract revenue, including items such as third-party services, warranties and saas, contributed a positive impact of 15 basis points to gross profit margin as our cost paid to the vendor or third-party service provider is recorded as a reduction to net sales, resulting in net sales being equal to the gross profit on the transaction. gross profit margin was positively impacted 15 basis points due to a higher mix of services and improved product margin. we also experienced a favorable impact of 10 basis points from vendor partner funding. vendor partner funding includes purchase discounts, volume rebates and cooperative advertising.
gross profit margin may fluctuate based on various factors, including vendor incentive and inventory price protection programs, cooperative advertising funds classified as a reduction of cost of sales, product mix, net service contract revenue, commission revenue, pricing strategies, market conditions and other factors.
selling and administrative expenses selling and administrative expenses increased $116 million, or 10.4%, to $1,226 million in 2015, compared to $1,110 million in 2014. as a percentage of total net sales, selling and administrative expenses increased 20 basis points to 9.4% in 2015, up from 9.2% in 2014. sales payroll costs increased $60 million, or 12.0%, year over year, primarily due to increased sales compensation consistent with growth in solutions-related sales, an increase in gross profit and consolidating five months of incremental cdw uk sales payroll costs. in addition, certain coworker costs increased $10.0 million, or 3.8%, during 2015 compared to the prior year, due to higher costs consistent with increased coworker count, primarily due to our acquisition of cdw uk. total coworker count was 8,465 at december 31, 2015, up 1,254 from 7,211 at december 31, 2014. amortization expense related to intangibles increased $17 million, or 9.2%, during 2015 compared to 2014, primarily due to incremental amortization expense related to the intangible assets arising from our acquisition of cdw uk. non-cash equity-based compensation expense increased $15 million, or 90.7%, during 2015 compared to 2014, primarily due to annual equity awards granted under our 2013 long-term incentive plan in 2015, performance against long-term incentive program targets and equity awards granted in connection with our acquisition of cdw uk. in addition, we incurred $10 million of acquisition and integration costs in 2015 related to our acquisition of cdw uk.

interest expense, net at december 31, 2015, our outstanding long-term debt totaled $3,260 million, compared to $3,166 million at december 31, 2014, an increase of $94 million primarily due to the completion of the acquisition of cdw uk. net interest expense in 2015 was $160 million, a decrease of $38 million, compared to $197 million in 2014. this decrease was primarily due to lower effective interest rates for 2015, compared to 2014 as a result of redemptions and refinancing activities completed during 2014 and 2015.

gain on remeasurement of equity investment on august 1, 2015, we completed the acquisition of cdw uk by purchasing the remaining 65% of its outstanding common stock, which increased our ownership interest from 35% to 100% and provided us control. as a result, our previously held 35% equity investment was remeasured to fair value, resulting in a gain of $98 million recorded in gain on remeasurement of equity investment in the consolidated statements of operations.
income tax expense income tax expense was $244 million in 2015, compared to $143 million in 2014. the effective income tax rate, expressed by calculating income tax expense or benefit as a percentage of income before income taxes, was 37.7% and 36.8% for 2015 and 2014, respectively.
for 2015, the effective tax rate differed from the us federal statutory rate primarily due to state income taxes and withholding tax expense on the earnings of our canadian business as a result of no longer asserting permanent reinvestment, which was partially offset by a deferred tax benefit as a result of a tax rate reduction in the uk for 2014, the effective tax rate differed from the us federal statutory rate primarily due to state income taxes, including current year state income tax credits. the higher effective tax rate for 2015 as compared to 2014 was primarily attributable to higher state income taxes due to lower state income tax credits and the aforementioned canadian withholding tax expense partially offset by the deferred tax benefit reflecting the tax rate reduction in the uk we are asserting that the unremitted earnings of our uk business are indefinitely reinvested.

seasonality while we have not historically experienced significant seasonality throughout the year, net sales in our corporate segment, which primarily serves private sector business customers, are typically higher in the fourth quarter than in other quarters due to customers spending their remaining technology budget dollars at the end of the year. additionally, net sales in our public segment have historically been higher in the third quarter than in other quarters primarily due to the buying patterns of the federal government and education customers.
liquidity and capital resources overview we finance our operations and capital expenditures with internally generated cash from operations. we also have $716 million of availability for borrowings under our senior secured asset-based revolving credit facility and an additional £50 million ($62 million as of december 31, 2016) under the cdw uk revolving credit facility. our liquidity and borrowing plans are established to align with our financial and strategic planning processes and ensure we have the necessary funding to meet our operating commitments, which primarily include the purchase of inventory, payroll and general expenses. we also take into consideration our overall capital allocation strategy, which includes investment for future growth, dividend payments, acquisitions and stock repurchases. we believe we have adequate sources of liquidity and funding available for at least the next year, however, there are a number of factors that may negatively impact our available sources of funds. the amount of cash generated from operations will be dependent upon factors such as the successful execution of our business plan and general economic conditions.
long-term debt activities on august 17, 2016, we entered into a new seven-year $1,490 million aggregate principal amount senior secured term loan facility ("term loan"). the term loan was issued at a price that was 99.50% of par, which resulted in a discount of $7 million. fees of $5 million were capitalized as deferred financing costs and are being amortized over the seven-year term on a straight-line basis. the term loan replaced the prior senior secured term loan facility that had an outstanding aggregate principal amount of $1,490 million.
on august 1, 2016, we entered into a new five-year £56 million ($69 million as of december 31, 2016) aggregate principal amount term loan facility ("cdw uk term loan"). the cdw uk term loan replaced the prior senior secured term loan facility (the "prior cdw uk term loan facility") that had an outstanding aggregate principal amount of £56 million. in connection with this refinancing, the prior cdw uk term loan facility was amended to include both the cdw uk term loan and a £50 million revolving credit facility ("cdw uk revolving credit facility"). the cdw uk revolving credit facility replaced the prior £50 million revolving credit facility and expires on august 1, 2021.

(3)   the change in cash flows was primarily due to an increase in collections during 2016 due to the higher accounts receivable balance as of december 31, 2015 driven by higher sales in our public segment where customers generally take longer to pay than customers in our corporate segment. in addition, the lower accounts receivable balances as of december 31, 2014, driven by early payments from certain customers, resulted in lower cash flows in the prior year period.
(4)   the increase in cash flows was primarily due to the timing of inventory purchases and longer payment terms with certain vendors.

(1)   includes items such as deferred income taxes, depreciation and amortization, equity-based compensation expense, gain on remeasurement of equity method investment, loss (income) from equity method investment and net loss on extinguishments of long-term debt.
(2)   the increase in cash flows reflected stronger operating results driven by organic sales growth and the impact of consolidating five months of cdw uk financial results. a decrease in interest expense, partially offset by higher income tax expense, also contributed to the strong operating results.
(3)   the decrease in cash flows was driven by a higher accounts receivable balance at december 31, 2015 driven by higher sales in our public segment where customers generally take longer to pay than customers in our corporate segment, slower government payments in certain states due to budget issues and the lower accounts receivable balance at december 31, 2014 driven by early payments from certain customers.
46
(4)   the decrease in cash flows was primarily due to the lower inventory balance as of december 31, 2014 as a result of the timing of inventory receipts and earlier than expected inventory shipments at the end of 2014 due to accelerated customer roll-outs and an increase in inventory on-hand as of december 31, 2015 to support the growth in the business.
(5)   the increase in cash flows was primarily due to the timing of inventory purchases, longer payment terms with certain vendors and growth in the business.
in order to manage our working capital and operating cash needs, we monitor our cash conversion cycle, defined as days of sales outstanding in accounts receivable plus days of supply in inventory minus days of purchases outstanding in accounts payable, based on a rolling three-month average. components of our cash conversion cycle are as follows:

(1)   represents the rolling three-month average of the balance of trade accounts receivable, net at the end of the period divided by average daily net sales for the same three-month period. also incorporates components of other miscellaneous receivables.
(2)   represents the rolling three-month average of the balance of merchandise inventory at the end of the period divided by average daily cost of goods sold for the same three-month period.
(3)   represents the rolling three-month average of the combined balance of accounts payable-trade, excluding cash overdrafts, and accounts payable-inventory financing at the end of the period divided by average daily cost of goods sold for the same three-month period.
the cash conversion cycle was 19 and 21 days at december 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. the increase in dso was primarily driven by higher net sales and related accounts receivable for third-party services such as saas, software assurance and warranties. these services have an unfavorable impact on dso as the receivable is recognized on the balance sheet on a gross basis while the corresponding sales amount in the statement of operations is recorded on a net basis. these services have a favorable impact on dpo as the payable is recognized on the balance sheet without a corresponding cost of sale in the statement of operations because the cost paid to the vendor or third-party service provider is recorded as a reduction to net sales. in addition to the impact of these services on dpo, dpo also increased due to the mix of payables with certain vendors that have longer payment terms.
the cash conversion cycle remained at 21 days at december 31, 2015 and december 31, 2014. the increase in dso was primarily driven by a higher accounts receivable balance at december 31, 2015 driven by higher public segment sales where customers generally take longer to pay than customers in our corporate segment, slower government payments in certain states due to budget issues and an increase in net sales and related accounts receivable for third-party services such as software assurance and warranties. these services have an unfavorable impact on dso as the receivable is recognized on the balance sheet on a gross basis while the corresponding sales amount in the statement of operations is recorded on a net basis. these services have a favorable impact on dpo as the payable is recognized on the balance sheet without a corresponding cost of sale in the statement of operations because the cost paid to the vendor or third-party service provider is recorded as a reduction to net sales. in addition to the impact of these services on dpo, dpo also increased due to the mix of payables with certain vendors that have longer payment terms.
investing activities net cash used in investing activities decreased $289 million in 2016 compared to 2015. the decrease in cash used was primarily due to the completion of the acquisition of cdw uk in 2015. additionally, capital expenditures decreased $26 million to $64 million from $90 million for 2016 and 2015, respectively, primarily due to spending for our new office location in 2015.
net cash used in investing activities increased $190 million in 2015 compared to 2014. the increase was primarily due to the completion of the acquisition of cdw uk by purchasing the remaining 65% of its outstanding common stock on august 1, 2015. additionally, capital expenditures increased $35 million to $90 million from $55 million for 2015 and 2014, respectively, primarily for our new office location and an increase in spending related to improvements to our information technology systems.
47
financing activities net cash used in financing activities increased $78 million in 2016 compared to 2015. the increase was primarily driven by higher share repurchases during the year ended december 31, 2016 which resulted in an increase in cash used for financing activities of $126 million. the increase was partially offset by the changes in accounts payable-inventory financing, which resulted in an increase in cash provided for financing activities of $48 million. the increase in cash provided by accounts payable-inventory financing was primarily due to a new vendor added to our previously existing inventory financing agreement. for a description of the inventory financing transactions impacting each period, see note 6 (inventory financing agreements) to the accompanying consolidated financial statements. for more information on our share repurchase program, see item 5, "market for registrant's common equity, related stockholder matters and issuer purchases of equity securities."
net cash used in financing activities increased $115 million in 2015 compared to 2014. the increase was primarily driven by share repurchases during the year ended december 31, 2015 which resulted in an increase in cash used for financing activities of $241 million. for more information on our share repurchase program, see item 5, "market for registrant's common equity, related stockholder matters and issuer purchases of equity securities." the increase was partially offset by the changes in accounts payable-inventory financing, which resulted in an increase in cash provided for financing activities of $20 million, and the net impact of our debt transactions which resulted in cash outflows of $7 million and $146 million during the years ended december 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. the increase in cash provided by accounts payable-inventory financing was primarily due to a new vendor added to our previously existing inventory financing agreement. for a description of the debt transactions impacting each period, see note 8 (long-term debt) to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.
long-term debt and financing arrangements as of december 31, 2016, we had total indebtedness of $3.2 billion, of which $1.6 billion was secured indebtedness. at december 31, 2016, we were in compliance with the covenants under our various credit agreements and indentures. the amount of cdw's restricted payment capacity under the senior secured term loan facility was $892 million at december 31, 2016. the amount of restricted payment capacity for the cdw uk term loan was $131 million.
for additional details regarding our debt and refinancing activities, refer to note 8 (long-term debt) to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.
inventory financing agreements we have entered into agreements with certain financial intermediaries to facilitate the purchase of inventory from various suppliers under certain terms and conditions. these amounts are classified separately as accounts payable-inventory financing on the consolidated balance sheets. we do not incur any interest expense associated with these agreements as balances are paid when they are due. for further details, see note 6 (inventory financing agreements) to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.
contractual obligations we have future obligations under various contracts relating to debt and interest payments, operating leases and asset retirement obligations. our estimated future payments, based on undiscounted amounts, under contractual obligations that existed as of december 31, 2016, are as follows:

(3)   includes the minimum lease payments for non-cancelable operating leases of properties and equipment used in our operations. capital leases included in property and equipment are not material.
(4)   represent commitments to return property subject to operating leases to original condition upon lease termination.
off-balance sheet arrangements we have no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a material current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.
inflation inflation has not had a material impact on our operating results. we generally have been able to pass along price increases to our customers, though certain economic factors and technological advances in recent years have tended to place downward pressure on pricing. we also have been able to generally offset the effects of inflation on operating costs by continuing to emphasize productivity improvements and by accelerating our overall cash conversion cycle. there can be no assurances, however, that inflation would not have a material impact on our sales or operating costs in the future.
commitments and contingencies the information set forth in note 14 (commitments and contingencies) to the accompanying consolidated financial statements included in part ii, item 8 of this form 10-k is incorporated herein by reference.
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with gaap requires management to make use of certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reported periods. we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. these estimates have not historically required significant management judgment. our actual results have not differed materially from our estimates, nor have we historically made significant changes to the methods for determining these estimates. we do not believe it is reasonably likely that the estimates and related assumptions will change materially in the foreseeable future however actual results could differ from those estimates.
in note 1 (description of business and summary of significant accounting policies) to the accompanying consolidated financial statements, we include a discussion of the significant accounting policies used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. we believe the following are the most critical accounting policies and estimates that include significant judgments used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements. we consider an accounting policy or estimate to be critical if it requires assumptions to be made that were uncertain at the time they were made, and if changes in these assumptions could have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations.
revenue recognition we are a primary distribution channel for a large group of vendors and suppliers, including oems, software publishers and wholesale distributors. we record revenue from sales transactions when title and risk of loss are passed to our customer, there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement for sale, delivery has occurred and/or services have been rendered, the sales price is fixed or determinable, and collectability is reasonably assured. our shipping terms typically specify f.o.b. destination, at which time title and risk of loss have passed to the customer.
revenues from the sales of hardware products and software products and licenses are generally recognized on a gross basis with the selling price to the customer recorded as sales and the acquisition cost of the product recorded as cost of sales. these items can be delivered to customers in a variety of ways, including (i) as physical product shipped from our warehouse, (ii) via drop-shipment by the vendor or supplier, or (iii) via electronic delivery for software licenses. at the time of sale, we record an estimate for sales returns and allowances based on historical experience. our vendor partners warrant most of the products we sell.
49
we leverage drop-shipment arrangements with many of our vendors and suppliers to deliver products to our customers without having to physically hold the inventory at our warehouses, thereby increasing efficiency and reducing costs. we recognize revenue for drop-shipment arrangements on a gross basis upon delivery to the customer with contract terms that typically specify f.o.b. destination. we recognize revenue on a gross basis as the principal in the transaction because we are the primary obligor in the arrangement, we assume inventory risk if the product is returned by the customer, we set the price of the product charged to the customer, we assume credit risk for the amounts invoiced, and we work closely with our customers to determine their hardware and software specifications. these arrangements generally represent approximately 45% to 55% of total net sales, which includes approximately 20% to 30% related to electronic delivery for software licenses.
revenue from professional services is recognized in either of two ways: services as an hourly rate (recognized using a percentage of completion model) or a fixed fee (recognized using a proportional performance model for the fixed fee). revenues for cloud computing solutions including saas and iaas arrangements with one time invoicing to the customer are recognized at the time of invoice. revenues for data center services such as managed and remote managed services, server co-location, internet connectivity, data backup and storage, and saas and iaas arrangements where the customer is invoiced over time are recognized over the period service is provided.
we also sell certain products for which we act as an agent. products in this category include the sale of third-party services, warranties, software assurance ("sa") and third-party hosted saas and iaas arrangements. sa is a product that allows customers to upgrade, at no additional cost, to the latest technology if new applications are introduced during the period that the sa is in effect. these sales do not meet the criteria for gross sales recognition, and thus are recognized on a net basis at the time of sale. under net sales recognition, the cost paid to the vendor or third-party service provider is recorded as a reduction to sales, resulting in net sales being equal to the gross profit on the transaction.
our larger customers are offered the opportunity by certain of our vendors to purchase software licenses and sa under enterprise agreements ("eas"). under eas, customers are considered to be compliant with applicable license requirements for the ensuing year, regardless of changes to their employee base. customers are charged an annual true-up fee for changes in the number of users over the year. with most eas, our vendors will transfer the license and bill the customer directly, paying resellers such as us an agency fee or commission on these sales. we record these fees as a component of net sales as earned and there is no corresponding cost of sales amount. in certain instances, we bill the customer directly under an ea and account for the individual items sold based on the nature of the item. our vendors typically dictate how the ea will be sold to the customer.
we also sell some of our products and services as part of bundled contract arrangements containing multiple deliverables, which may include a combination of the products and services. for each deliverable that represents a separate unit of accounting, total arrangement consideration is allocated based upon the relative selling prices of each element. the allocated arrangement consideration is recognized as revenue in accordance with the principles described above. selling prices are determined by using vendor specific objective evidence ("vsoe") if it exists. otherwise, selling prices are determined using third party evidence ("tpe"). if neither vsoe or tpe is available, we use our best estimate of selling prices.
we record freight billed to our customers as net sales and the related freight costs as a cost of sales.
deferred revenue includes (1) payments received from customers in advance of providing the product or performing services, and (2) amounts deferred if other conditions of revenue recognition have not been met.
we perform an analysis of the estimated number of days of sales in-transit to customers at the end of each period based on a weighted-average analysis of commercial delivery terms that includes drop-shipment arrangements. this analysis is the basis upon which we estimate the amount of sales in-transit at the end of the period and adjust revenue and the related costs to reflect only what has been received by the customer. changes in delivery patterns may result in a different number of business days used in making this adjustment and could have a material impact on our revenue recognition for the period.
vendor programs we receive incentives from certain of our vendors related to cooperative advertising allowances, volume rebates, bid programs, price protection and other programs. these incentives generally relate to written agreements with specified performance requirements with the vendors and are recorded as adjustments to cost of sales or inventory, depending on the nature of the incentive. vendors may change the terms of some or all of these programs, which could have an impact on our results of operations.
we record receivables from vendors related to these programs when the amounts are probable and reasonably estimable. some programs are based on the achievement of specific targets, and we base our estimates on information provided by our vendors and internal information to assess our progress toward achieving those targets. if actual performance does not match our estimates, we may be required to adjust our receivables. we record reserves for vendor receivables for estimated losses due to vendors'
50
inability to pay or rejections by vendors of claims; however, if actual collections differ from our estimates, we may incur additional losses that could have a material impact on gross profit and income from operations.
goodwill goodwill is not amortized but is subject to periodic testing for impairment at the reporting unit level. we perform an evaluation of goodwill, utilizing either a quantitative or qualitative impairment test, on an annual basis, or more frequently if circumstances indicate a potential impairment. the annual test for impairment is conducted as of december 1. our reporting units used to assess potential goodwill impairment are the same as our operating segments.
under a quantitative assessment, testing for impairment of goodwill is a two-step process. the first step compares the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount, including goodwill. if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the second step compares the implied fair value of reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill to determine the amount of impairment loss. fair value of a reporting unit is determined by using a weighted combination of an income approach (75%) and a market approach (25%), as this combination is considered the most indicative of our fair value in an orderly transaction between market participants.
under the income approach, we determine fair value based on estimated future cash flows of a reporting unit, discounted by an estimated weighted-average cost of capital, which reflects the overall level of inherent risk of a reporting unit and the rate of return an outside investor would expect to earn. the estimated future cash flows of each reporting unit are based on internally generated forecasts for the remainder of the respective reporting period and the next ten years. we use a range of 2.0-3.5% long-term assumed consolidated annual net sales growth rate for periods after the ten-year forecast.
under the market approach, we utilize valuation multiples derived from publicly available information for guideline companies to provide an indication of how much a knowledgeable investor in the marketplace would be willing to pay for a company. the valuation multiples are applied to the reporting units.
determining the fair value of a reporting unit is judgmental in nature and requires the use of significant estimates and assumptions, including net sales growth rates, gross margins, operating margins, discount rates and future market conditions, among others. any changes in the judgments, estimates or assumptions used could produce significantly different results.
under a qualitative assessment, the most recent quantitative assessment is the starting point to determine if it is more likely than not that the reporting unit's fair value is less than its carrying value. as part of this qualitative assessment, we assess relevant events and circumstances including macroeconomic conditions, industry and market conditions, cost factors, overall financial performance, changes in share price and entity-specific events.
december 1, 2016 impairment analysis we completed our annual impairment analysis as of december 1, 2016. for the corporate, public and canada reporting units, we performed a qualitative analysis. we determined that it was more-likely-than-not that the individual fair values of the corporate, public and canada reporting units exceeded the individual carrying values. as a result of this determination, the quantitative two-step impairment analysis was deemed unnecessary. due to the substantial uncertainty regarding the impact of the referendum on the united kingdom's ("uk") membership of the european union ("eu") advising for the exit of the uk from europe, we performed a quantitative analysis of the cdw uk reporting unit. based on the results of the quantitative analysis, we determined that the fair value of the cdw uk reporting unit exceeded its carrying value by 16% and no impairment existed. we identified that the most sensitive assumptions used in the quantitative analysis were net sales growth and ebitda margin and, although we believe our assumptions are reasonable based on current market conditions, actual results may vary significantly and could expose us to impairment charges in the future.
december 1, 2015 impairment analysis we completed our annual impairment analysis as of december 1, 2015 by utilizing a qualitative assessment for all reporting units. we determined that it was more-likely-than-not that the fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its carrying value. as a result of this determination, the quantitative two-step impairment analysis was deemed unnecessary.
intangible assets intangible assets include customer relationships, trade names, internally developed software and other intangibles. intangible assets with finite lives are amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets. the cost of software developed or obtained for internal use is capitalized and amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life. these intangible assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. determination of recoverability is based on an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows
51
resulting from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition. if the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future undiscounted cash flows, an impairment loss is recorded for the excess of the asset's carrying amount over its fair value. in addition, each quarter, we evaluate whether events and circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining estimated useful life of each of these intangible assets. if we were to determine that a change to the remaining estimated useful life of an intangible asset was necessary, then the remaining carrying amount of the intangible asset would be amortized prospectively over that revised remaining useful life.
during the years ended december 31, 2016 and 2015, we concluded our intangible assets with finite lives were not impaired and no changes to the remaining useful lives were necessary.
income taxes deferred income taxes are provided to reflect the differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in the consolidated financial statements using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. we perform an evaluation of the realizability of our deferred tax assets on a quarterly basis. this evaluation requires us to use estimates and make assumptions and considers all positive and negative evidence and factors, such as the scheduled reversal of temporary differences, the mix of earnings in the jurisdictions in which we operate, and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies.
we account for unrecognized tax benefits based upon our assessment of whether a tax benefit is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by tax authorities. we report a liability for unrecognized tax benefits resulting from unrecognized tax benefits taken or expected to be taken in a tax return and recognize interest and penalties, if any, related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense.

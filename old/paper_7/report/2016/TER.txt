item 7:   managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations

overview we are a leading global supplier of automation equipment for test and industrial applications. we design, develop, manufacture and sell automatic test systems used to test semiconductors, wireless products, data storage and complex electronics systems in the consumer electronics, wireless, automotive, industrial, computing, communications, and aerospace and defense industries. our industrial automation products include collaborative robots used by global manufacturing and light industrial customers to improve quality, increase manufacturing efficiency and decrease manufacturing costs. our automatic test equipment and industrial automation products and services include:
   semiconductor test (semiconductor test) systems;

   defense/aerospace (defense/aerospace) test instrumentation and systems, storage test (storage test) systems, and circuit-board test and inspection (production board test) systems (collectively these products represent system test);

   industrial automation (industrial automation) products; and

   wireless test (wireless test) systems.

we have a broad customer base which includes integrated device manufacturers (idms), outsourced semiconductor assembly and test providers (osats), original equipment manufacturers (oems), wafer foundries, fabless companies that design, but contract with others for the manufacture of integrated circuits (ics), developers of wireless devices and consumer electronics, manufacturers of circuit boards, automotive suppliers, wireless product manufacturers, storage device manufacturers, aerospace and military contractors, and distributors that sell collaborative robots.
in 2015, we acquired universal robots a/s (universal robots), the leading supplier of collaborative robots which are low-cost, easy-to-deploy and simple-to-program robots that work side by side with production workers to improve quality, increase manufacturing efficiency and decrease manufacturing costs. universal robots is a separate operating and reportable segment, industrial automation. the acquisition of universal robots provides a growth engine to our business and complements our existing system test and wireless test segments. the total purchase price for universal robots was approximately $315 million, which included cash paid of approximately $284 million and $32 million in fair value of contingent consideration payable upon achievement of revenue and earnings targets through 2018. contingent consideration paid for 2015 was $15 million. the maximum payment for each of the two remaining universal robots earn-outs is $25.0 million.
in 2014, we acquired avionics interface technologies, llc (ait), a supplier of equipment for testing state-of-the-art data communication buses. the acquisition of ait complements our defense/aerospace line of bus test instrumentation for commercial and defense avionics systems. ait is included in our system test segment. the total purchase price for ait was approximately $21 million, which included cash paid of approximately $19 million and $2 million in fair value of contingent consideration payable upon achievement of revenue and gross margin targets in 2015 and 2016. the total amount of contingent consideration paid was $1.1 million.
we believe our recent acquisitions have enhanced our opportunities for growth. we intend to continue to invest in our business, grow market share in our markets and expand further our addressable markets while tightly managing our costs.
the sales of our products and services are dependent, to a large degree, on customers who are subject to cyclical trends in the demand for their products. these cyclical periods have had, and will continue to have, a significant effect on our business since our customers often delay or accelerate purchases in reaction to changes in their businesses and to demand fluctuations in the semiconductor and electronics industries. historically, these demand fluctuations have resulted in significant variations in our results of operations. the sharp swings in the semiconductor and electronics industries in recent years have generally affected the semiconductor and electronics test equipment and services industries more significantly than the overall capital equipment sector.
22
in recent years, this cyclical demand has become an even/odd year trend where demand has increased in even years and decreased in odd years due principally to demand swings in the mobility market of our semiconductor test business. we expect the even/odd year demand trend in the mobility market to most likely lessen in the future due to slower smart phone unit growth, along with rising device complexity and the reduced impact of parallel test in our semiconductor test business.
on april 16, 2016, an earthquake in kumamoto, japan damaged our main building at that location. the building, which was used for engineering, production, and support operations, was damaged beyond repair. with respect to the location, we have $10 million of earthquake insurance with a deductible of approximately $2.5 million. as a result, we impaired the building and recorded a charge of $4.2 million and a charge of $1.2 million for other earthquake related expenses. the $5.4 million of total charges were offset by $5.4 million of property insurance recovery. we have temporarily transferred some operations to other facilities in japan and elsewhere while our kumamoto operations are restored.
in the second quarter of 2016, the wireless test reporting unit (which is our wireless test operating and reportable segment) reduced headcount by 11% as a result of a sharp decline in projected demand attributable to an estimated smaller future wireless test market. the decrease in projected demand was due to lower forecasted buying from our largest wireless test segment customer (who has contributed between 51% and 73% of annual wireless test sales since the litepoint acquisition in 2011 through 2015) as a result of the customers numerous operational efficiencies; slower smartphone growth rates; and a slowdown of new wireless technology adoption. we considered the headcount reduction and sharp decline in projected demand to be a triggering event for an interim goodwill impairment test. following the interim goodwill impairment test, we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $254.9 million, with approximately $8.0 million of goodwill remaining, and $83.3 million for the impairment of acquired intangible assets with approximately $5.0 million of intangible assets remaining. in the third quarter of 2016, the wireless test reporting unit reduced headcount by an additional 14%.
in the fourth quarter of 2014, we performed our annual goodwill impairment test and recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $98.9 million in our wireless test segment as a result of decreased projected demand attributable to an estimated smaller future wireless test market due to reuse of wireless test equipment, price competition and different testing techniques.
critical accounting policies and estimates we have identified the policies discussed below as critical to understanding our business and our results of operations and financial condition. the impact and any associated risks related to these policies on our business operations is discussed throughout managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations where such policies affect our reported and expected financial results.
revenue recognition we recognize revenues, including revenues from distributors, when there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement, title and risk of loss have passed, delivery has occurred or the services have been rendered, the sales price is fixed or determinable and collection of the related receivable is reasonably assured. title and risk of loss generally pass to our customers upon shipment or at delivery destination point. in circumstances where either title or risk of loss pass upon destination, acceptance or cash payment, we defer revenue recognition until such events occur except when title transfer is tied to cash payment outside the united states. outside the united states, we recognize revenues upon shipment or at delivery destination point, even if we retain a form of title to products delivered to customers, provided the sole purpose is to enable us to recover the products in the event of customer payment default and the arrangement does not prohibit the customers use or resale of the product in the ordinary course of business.
our equipment has non-software and embedded software components that function together to deliver the equipments essential functionality. revenue is recognized upon shipment or at delivery destination point, provided that customer acceptance criteria can be demonstrated prior to shipment. certain contracts require us to
23
perform tests of the product to ensure that performance meets the published product specifications or customer requested specifications, which are generally conducted prior to shipment. where the criteria cannot be demonstrated prior to shipment, revenue is deferred until customer acceptance has been received. we also defer the portion of the sales price that is not due until acceptance, which represents deferred profit.
for multiple element arrangements, we allocate revenues to all deliverables based on their relative selling prices. in such circumstances, a hierarchy is used to determine the selling price for allocating revenues to deliverables as follows: (i) vendor-specific objective evidence of selling price (vsoe), (ii) third-party evidence of selling price (tpe), and (iii) best estimate of the selling price (besp). for a delivered item to be considered a separate unit, the delivered item must have value to the customer on a standalone basis and the delivery or performance of the undelivered item must be considered probable and substantially in our control.
our post-shipment obligations include installation, training services, one-year standard warranties, and extended warranties. installation does not alter the product capabilities, does not require specialized skills or tools and can be performed by the customers or other vendors. installation is typically provided within five days of product shipment and is completed within one to two days thereafter. training services are optional and do not affect the customers ability to use the product. we defer revenues for the selling price of installation and training. extended warranties constitute warranty obligations beyond one year and we defer revenues in accordance with financial accounting standards board (fasb) accounting standards codification (asc) 605-20, separately priced extended warranty and product maintenance contracts and asc 605-25, revenue recognition multiple-element arrangements. service revenue is recognized over the contractual period or as services are performed.
our products are generally subject to warranty and the related costs of the warranty are provided for in cost of revenues when product revenue is recognized. we classify shipping and handling costs in cost of revenues.
we do not provide our customers with contractual rights of return for any of our products.
translation of non-u.s. currencies the functional currency for all non-u.s. subsidiaries is the u.s. dollar, except for the industrial automation segment for which the local currency is its functional currency. all foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities are remeasured on a monthly basis into the functional currency using exchange rates in effect at the end of the period. all foreign currency denominated non-monetary assets and liabilities are remeasured into the functional currency using historical exchange rates. net foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from remeasurement are included in other (income) expense, net. for industrial automation, assets and liabilities are translated into u.s. dollars using exchange rates in effect at the end of the period. revenues and expense amounts are translated using an average of exchange rates in effect during the period. translation adjustments are recorded within accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).
retirement and postretirement plans we recognize net actuarial gains and losses and the change in the fair value of the plan assets in our operating results in the year in which they occur or upon any interim remeasurement of the plans. we calculate the expected return on plan assets using the fair value of the plan assets. actuarial gains and losses are generally measured annually as of december 31 and, accordingly, recorded during the fourth quarter of each year or upon any interim remeasurement of the plans.
inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out basis) or net realizable value. on a quarterly basis, we use consistent methodologies to evaluate all inventories for net realizable value. we record a provision
24
for both excess and obsolete inventory when such write-downs or write-offs are identified through the quarterly review process. the inventory valuation is based upon assumptions about future demand, product mix, and possible alternative uses.
equity incentive and stock purchase plans stock-based compensation expense is based on the grant-date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of asc 718, compensationstock compensation. as required by asc 718, we have made an estimate of expected forfeitures and are recognizing compensation costs only for those stock-based compensation awards expected to vest.
income taxes deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between financial reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse. the measurement of deferred tax assets is reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. we performed the required assessment of positive and negative evidence regarding the realization of the net deferred tax assets in accordance with asc 740, accounting for income taxes. this assessment included the evaluation of scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities, estimates of projected future taxable income and tax-planning strategies. although realization is not assured, based on our assessment, we concluded that it is more likely than not that such assets, net of the existing valuation allowance, will be realized. u.s. income taxes are not provided for on the earnings of non-u.s. subsidiaries which are expected to be reinvested indefinitely in operations outside the u.s. for intra-period tax allocations, we first utilize non-equity related tax attributes, such as net operating losses and credit carryforwards, and then equity-related tax attributes. we use the with-and-without method for calculating excess stock compensation deductions and do not take into account any indirect impacts of excess stock compensation deductions on our research and development tax credits, domestic production activities deduction, and other differences between financial reporting and tax reporting.
investments we account for our investments in debt and equity securities in accordance with the provisions of asc 320-10, investmentsdebt and equity securities. on a quarterly basis, we review our investments to identify and evaluate those that have an indication of a potential other-than-temporary impairment. factors considered in determining whether a loss is other-than-temporary include:
   the length of time and the extent to which the market value has been less than cost;

   the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer; and

   the intent and ability to retain the investment in the issuer for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value.

goodwill, intangible and long-lived assets we assess goodwill for impairment at least annually in the fourth quarter, as of december 31, on a reporting unit basis, or more frequently, when events and circumstances occur indicating that the recorded goodwill may be impaired. if the book value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the implied fair value of goodwill is compared with the carrying amount of goodwill. if the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds the implied fair value, an impairment charge is recorded in an amount equal to that excess.
in the second quarter of 2016, the wireless test reporting unit (which is our wireless test operating and reportable segment) reduced headcount by 11% as a result of a sharp decline in projected demand attributable to
25
an estimated smaller future wireless test market. the decrease in projected demand was due to lower forecasted buying from our largest wireless test segment customer (who has contributed between 51% and 73% of annual wireless test sales since the litepoint acquisition in 2011 through 2015) as a result of the customers numerous operational efficiencies; slower smartphone growth rates; and a slowdown of new wireless technology adoption. we considered the headcount reduction and sharp decline in projected demand to be a triggering event for an interim goodwill impairment test. following the interim goodwill impairment test, we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $254.9 million, with approximately $8.0 million of goodwill remaining. in the third quarter of 2016, the wireless test reporting unit reduced headcount by an additional 14%. no goodwill impairment was identified in the fourth quarter of 2016, as part of the annual goodwill impairment test.
no goodwill impairment was identified in 2015. in the fourth quarter of 2014, we performed our annual goodwill impairment test and recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $98.9 million in our wireless test segment as a result of decreased projected demand attributable to an estimated smaller future wireless test market due to reuse of wireless test equipment, price competition and different testing techniques.
we assess the impairment of intangible and long-lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. factors we consider important in the determination of an impairment include significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results, significant changes in the manner that we use the acquired asset and significant negative industry or economic trends.
as a result of the interim goodwill impairment test in the second quarter of 2016 described above, we performed an impairment test of the wireless test segments intangible and long-lived assets based on the comparison of the estimated undiscounted cash flows to the recorded value of the assets and recorded an $83.3 million acquired intangible assets impairment charge, with approximately $5.0 million of intangible assets remaining. there were no events or circumstances indicating that the carrying value of acquired intangible and long-lived assets may not be recoverable in 2015, as such no impairment test was performed as of december 31, 2015. as a result of the wireless test segment goodwill impairment charge in the fourth quarter of 2014 described above, we also performed an impairment test of the wireless test segments intangible and long-lived assets as of december 31, 2014, with no indication of impairment. when we determine that the carrying value of intangible and long-lived assets may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment, we measure any impairment based on a projected discounted cash flow method using a discount rate commensurate with the associated risks.

the increase in semiconductor test revenues of $166.7 million, or 14%, from 2015 to 2016 was driven primarily by system-on-a-chip (soc) product volume in the mobile application processor market. the decrease in semiconductor test revenues of $99.3 million, or 8%, from 2014 to 2015 was primarily due to a decrease in soc product volume, driven by smaller microcontroller, power management and radio frequency test markets.
the decrease in system test revenues of $21.8 million, or 10%, from 2015 to 2016 was primarily due to lower sales in storage test of 3.5 hard disk drive testers used for testing drives for cloud storage applications. the increase in system test revenues of $49.1 million, or 30%, from 2014 to 2015 was primarily due to higher sales in storage test of 3.5 hard disk drive testers used for testing drives for cloud storage applications.
the acquisition of universal robots, which is our industrial automation segment, completed in june 2015, added $99.0 million of revenues in 2016 and $41.9 million of revenues in 2015.
the decrease in wireless test revenues of $88.4 million, or 48%, from 2015 to 2016 was driven by lower demand for connectivity and cellular test systems primarily from our largest wireless test segment customer. as a result of significant customer concentration in our wireless test segment, revenues in that segment are subject to significant fluctuations based on the segments largest customers order levels. wireless test revenues were approximately flat from 2014 to 2015 as an increase in cellular product volume was offset by lower connectivity product volume.
our four reportable segments accounted for the following percentages of consolidated revenues:

our product revenues increased $112.6 million, or 8%, in 2016 from 2015 primarily due to higher volume in the mobile application processor market in semiconductor test and the addition of universal robots in june 2015. this increase was partially offset by decreases in wireless test revenues due to lower demand for connectivity and cellular test systems and lower sales in storage test of 3.5 hard disk drive testers for cloud storage. service revenues, which are derived from the servicing of our installed base of products and include equipment maintenance contracts, repairs, extended warranties, parts sales, and applications support increased $1.0 million.
our product revenues decreased $23.4 million, or 2%, in 2015 from 2014 primarily due to lower soc product volume, driven by smaller microcontroller, power management and radio frequency test markets. this decrease was partially offset by higher sales in storage test of 3.5 hard disk drive testers for cloud storage and the addition of universal robots in 2015. service revenues increased $15.2 million or 5%.
in 2016, two customers each accounted for 12% of our consolidated revenues. in 2015, revenues from one customer accounted for 13% of our consolidated revenues. in 2014, no single customer accounted for more than 10% of our consolidated revenues. in each of the years, 2016, 2015 and 2014, our five largest customers in aggregate accounted for 36%, 34% and 30%, respectively, of our consolidated revenues. we estimate product demand driven by a single oem customer, combining direct sales to that customer with sales to the customers osats, accounted for approximately 25%, 23%, and 22% of our consolidated revenues in 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively.

we assess the carrying value of our inventory on a quarterly basis by estimating future demand and comparing that demand against on-hand and on-order inventory positions. forecasted revenue information is obtained from the sales and marketing groups and incorporates factors such as backlog and future product demand. this quarterly process identifies obsolete and excess inventory. obsolete inventory, which represents items for which there is no demand, is fully reserved. excess inventory, which represents inventory items that are not expected to be consumed during the next twelve quarters for our semiconductor test, system test and industrial automation segments and next four quarters for our wireless test segment, is written-down to estimated net realizable value.
during the year ended december 31, 2016, we recorded an inventory provision of $17.5 million included in cost of revenues, primarily due to downward revisions to previously forecasted demand levels. of the $17.5 million of total excess and obsolete provisions, $9.7 million was in semiconductor test, $7.2 million was in wireless test and $0.6 million was related to system test.
during the year ended december 31, 2015, we recorded an inventory provision of $21.3 million included in cost of revenues, due to the following factors:
   a charge of $15.3 million due to downward revisions to previously forecasted demand levels, of which $8.2 million was for our 2.5 hard disk drive testers in storage test, $4.5 million was in semiconductor test and $2.5 million was in wireless test; and

   a $6.0 million inventory write-down as a result of product transition in semiconductor test.

during the year ended december 31, 2014, we recorded an inventory provision of $22.2 million included in cost of revenues, due to the following factors:
   a charge of $15.4 million due to downward revisions to previously forecasted demand levels, of which $8.1 million was in semiconductor test, $5.2 million was in wireless test and $2.1 million was in system test; and

   a $6.8 million inventory write-down as a result of product transition, of which $6.3 million was in semiconductor test and $0.5 million in wireless test.

during the years ended december 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, we scrapped $15.2 million, $7.0 million and $20.8 million of inventory, respectively, and sold $10.0 million, $7.9 million and $13.1 million of previously written-down or written-off inventory, respectively. as of december 31, 2016, we had inventory related reserves for amounts which had been written-down or written-off totaling $116.0 million. we have no pre-determined timeline to scrap the remaining inventory.

acquired intangible assets amortization expense decreased from 2015 to 2016 due to lower amortization expense in the wireless test segment due to the impairment of intangible assets in the second quarter of 2016, partially offset by increased amortization expense due to the universal robots acquisition in june 2015. acquired intangible assets amortization expense decreased from 2014 to 2015 due to intangible assets that became fully amortized during the year, partially offset by increased amortization expense due to the universal robots acquisition.
goodwill impairment we assess goodwill for impairment at least annually, in the fourth quarter, as of december 31, or on an interim basis between annual tests when events or circumstances indicate that it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value. in the second quarter of 2016, the wireless test reporting unit (which is our wireless test operating and reportable segment) reduced headcount by 11% as a result of a sharp decline in projected demand attributable to an estimated smaller future wireless test market. the decrease in projected demand was due to lower forecasted buying from our largest wireless test segment customer (who has contributed between 51% and 73% of annual wireless test sales since the litepoint acquisition in 2011 through 2015) as a result of the customers numerous operational efficiencies; slower smartphone growth rates; and a slowdown of new wireless technology adoption. we considered the headcount reduction and sharp decline in projected demand to be a triggering event for an interim goodwill impairment test. following the interim goodwill impairment test, we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $254.9 million in the second quarter of 2016. the fourth quarter 2016 and 2015 goodwill impairment tests did not identify any goodwill impairments. in the fourth quarter of 2014, we performed our annual goodwill impairment test and recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $98.9 million in our wireless test segment as a result of decreased projected demand attributable to an estimated smaller future wireless test market due to reuse of wireless test equipment, price competition and different testing techniques.
acquired intangible assets impairment we review long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable or that the useful lives of these assets are no longer appropriate. if undiscounted cash flows for the asset are less than the carrying amount, the asset is written down to its estimated fair value based on a discounted cash flow analysis. the cash flow estimates used to determine the impairment contain managements best estimates using appropriate assumptions and projections at that time. as a result of the wireless test segment goodwill impairment charge in the second quarter of 2016, we performed an impairment test of the wireless test segments intangible and long-lived assets based on a comparison of the estimated undiscounted cash flows to the recorded value of the assets. as a result of the analysis, we recorded an $83.3 million impairment charge in the second quarter of 2016 in acquired intangible assets impairment on the statements of operations.

during the year ended december 31, 2015, we recorded $3.6 million of other charges, of which $5.3 million was for the increase in the fair value of the universal robots contingent consideration liability and $1.0 million for acquisition costs related to universal robots, partially offset by a $2.9 million gain from fair value adjustments to decrease the acquisition contingent consideration liability related to ztec instruments inc. (ztec) ($1.6 million) and ait ($1.3 million).
during the year ended december 31, 2014, we recorded a $0.6 million gain from the fair value adjustment to decrease the ztec acquisition contingent consideration, partially offset by $0.4 million of acquisition costs related to ait.
restructuring during the year ended december 31, 2016, we recorded $6.0 million of severance charges related to headcount reductions of 146 people, of which 102 people were in wireless test and 44 people were in semiconductor test.
during the year ended december 31, 2015, we recorded $1.5 million of severance charges related to headcount reductions of 23 people primarily in system test and semiconductor test.
during the year ended december 31, 2014, we recorded $1.6 million of severance charges related to headcount reductions of approximately 43 people, primarily in semiconductor test and wireless test.
the remaining accrual for severance of $2.1 million is reflected in the accrued employees compensation and withholdings on the balance sheet and is expected to be paid by june 2017.

the decrease in income before income taxes from 2015 to 2016 was primarily due to a $254.9 million goodwill impairment charge and an $83.3 million acquired intangible assets impairment charge related to wireless test in 2016, and amortization of intangible assets related to our june 2015 acquisition of universal robots, which is our industrial automation segment, partially offset by higher revenues in semiconductor test application processor market and $3.2 million of pension actuarial gains in 2016 as compared to actuarial losses of $17.7 million in 2015.
the increase in income before income taxes from 2014 to 2015 was primarily due to a $98.9 million goodwill impairment charge related to wireless test in 2014 and lower pension expense related to actuarial losses of $17.7 million in 2015 as compared to $46.6 million in 2014. actuarial losses of $46.6 million in 2014 were primarily related to increases in life expectancy in the u.s.
income taxes income tax benefit for 2016 totaled $11.6 million. income tax expense for 2015 and 2014 totaled $46.6 million and $14.1 million, respectively. the effective tax rate for 2016, 2015 and 2014 was 21.1%, 18.4% and 14.8%, respectively.
the increase in the effective tax rate from 2015 to 2016 resulted from a shift in the geographic distribution of income which decreased income subject to taxation in the u.s. relative to lower tax rate jurisdictions, reductions in uncertain tax positions resulting from the expiration of statutes and the settlement of an audit, and an increase in non-taxable foreign exchange gains. these increases in the effective tax rate were partially offset by the effect of the non-deductible goodwill impairment charge, which reduced the benefit of the loss before income taxes in the u.s.
the increase in the effective tax rate from 2014 to 2015 resulted from a shift in the geographic distribution of income, which increased income subject to taxation in the u.s. relative to lower tax rate jurisdictions and a reduction in the benefit from u.s. research and development tax credits. these increases in the effective tax rate were partially offset by decreases associated with uncertain tax positions and a non-deductible goodwill impairment charge.
we qualify for a tax holiday in singapore by fulfilling the requirements of an agreement with the singapore economic development board under which certain headcount and spending requirements must be met. the tax savings attributable to the tax holiday for the years ended december 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 were $17.0 million or $0.08 per diluted share, $11.5 million or $0.05 per diluted share and $13.2 million or $0.06 per diluted share, respectively. the tax holiday is scheduled to expire on december 31, 2020.

liquidity and capital resources our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balance increased $604 million to $1,613 million from 2015 to 2016.
in 2016, changes in operating assets and liabilities provided cash of $40.8 million. this was due to a $33.7 million decrease in operating assets and a $7.1 million increase in operating liabilities.
the decrease in operating assets was due to an $18.3 million decrease in accounts receivable due to increased collections and a $34.3 million decrease in inventories, partially offset by an $18.9 million increase in prepayments and other assets.
the increase in operating liabilities was due to a $18.4 million increase in income taxes, a $3.9 million increase in accounts payable and a $7.6 million increase in other accrued liabilities, partially offset by a $13.2 million decrease in accrued employee compensation due primarily to variable compensation and employee stock compensation awards payroll tax payments, $6.0 million of retirement plans contributions and a $3.6 million decrease in customer advance payments and deferred revenue.
investing activities during 2016 used cash of $640.5 million, due to $1,656.3 million used for purchases of marketable securities, and $85.3 million used for purchases of property, plant and equipment, partially offset by proceeds from maturities and sales of marketable securities of $243.2 million and $852.8 million, respectively, and proceeds from property insurance of $5.1 million related to the japan earthquake.

35
in 2015, changes in operating assets and liabilities, net of businesses acquired, provided cash of $9.3 million. this was due to a $38.7 million increase in operating assets and a $48.0 million increase in operating liabilities.
the increase in operating assets was due to a $57.3 million increase in accounts receivable due to an increase in sales during the last month of the fourth quarter of 2015 compared to 2014, partially offset by a $15.6 million decrease in inventories and a $3.0 million decrease in prepayments and other assets.
the increase in operating liabilities was due to a $37.0 million increase in accounts payable as a result of our planned inventory increase in the fourth quarter of 2015 as we added material to maintain attractive lead times, a $17.0 million increase in customer advance payments and deferred revenue and a $11.3 million increase in other accrued liabilities, partially offset by $12.1 million of retirement plans contributions and a $5.2 million increase in income taxes.
investing activities during 2015 used cash of $113.7 million, due to $1,424.0 million used for purchases of marketable securities, $282.7 million used for the acquisition of universal robots, and $89.9 million used for purchases of property, plant and equipment, partially offset by proceeds from maturities and sales of marketable securities of $360.3 million and $1,316.1 million, respectively, proceeds from the sale of an equity investment of $5.4 million, and proceeds from life insurance of $1.1 million related to the cash surrender value from the cancellation of teradyne owned life insurance policies. the decrease in purchases of property, plant and equipment of $79.1 million was primarily due to an increase in purchases of testers for customer leasing in 2014.
financing activities during 2015 used cash of $328.7 million, due to $300.0 million used for the repurchase of 15.6 million shares of common stock at an average price of $19.20 per share, $50.7 million used for dividend payments, and $2.3 million used for debt issuance costs related to our april 2015 revolving credit facility, partially offset by $19.5 million from the issuance of common stock under employee stock purchase and stock option plans and $4.7 million from the tax benefit related to employee stock compensation awards.
in 2014, changes in operating assets and liabilities, net of businesses acquired, provided cash of $68.5 million. this was due to a $101.4 million decrease in operating assets and a $32.9 million decrease in operating liabilities.
the decrease in operating assets was due to a $41.5 million decrease in prepayments and other assets primarily related to a reduction in prepayments to our contract manufacturers, a $51.8 million decrease in inventories due to higher sales, and an $8.1 million decrease in accounts receivable.
the decrease in operating liabilities was due to $33.9 million of retirement plan contributions, a $17.0 million decrease in other accrued liabilities, a $16.9 million decrease in accounts payable, a $7.3 million decrease in accrued employee compensation due primarily to employee stock awards payroll taxes and variable compensation payments, and a $4.3 million convertible note interest payment, partially offset by a $24.4 million increase in income taxes, and a $22.0 million increase in customer advance payments and deferred revenue.

in january 2016, may 2016, august 2016 and november 2016, our board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.06 per share. total dividend payments in 2016 were $48.6 million.
in january 2015, may 2015, august 2015 and november 2015, our board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.06 per share. total dividend payments in 2015 were $50.7 million.
in january 2014, our board of directors declared an initial quarterly cash dividend of $0.06 per share. in each of the second, third and fourth quarters of 2014, we paid a cash dividend of $0.06 per share. total dividend payments in 2014 were $37.4 million.
in january 2017, our board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.07 per share to be paid on march 20, 2017 to shareholders of record as of february 24, 2017. payment of future cash dividends are subject to the discretion of our board of directors and will depend, among other things, upon our earnings, capital requirements and financial condition.
in january 2015, our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to $500 million of common stock. in 2015, we repurchased 15.6 million shares of common stock at an average price of $19.20, for a total cost of $300.0 million. in 2016, we repurchased 6.8 million shares of common stock at an average price of $21.39, for a total cost of $146.3 million. the cumulative repurchases as of december 31, 2016 totaled 22.5 million shares of common stock for $446.3 million at an average price per share of $19.87.
in december 2016, our board of directors approved a new $500 million share repurchase authorization which commenced on january 1, 2017. we intend to repurchase at least $200 million in 2017. our january 2015 stock repurchase program was terminated on december 31, 2016.
we believe our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balance will be sufficient to pay our quarterly dividend, execute our authorized share repurchase program and meet our working capital and expenditure needs for at least the next twelve months. the amount of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities in the u.s. and our operations in the u.s. provide sufficient liquidity to fund our business activities in the u.s. we have approximately $768 million of cash outside the u.s. that if repatriated would incur additional taxes. determination of the additional taxes that would be incurred is not practicable due to uncertainty regarding the remittance structure, the mix of earnings and earnings and profit pools in the year of remittance, and overall complexity of the calculation. inflation has not had a significant long-term impact on earnings.
retirement plans asc 715-20, compensationretirement benefitsdefined benefit plans, requires an employer with defined benefit plans or other postretirement benefit plans to recognize an asset or a liability on its balance sheet for the overfunded or underfunded status of the plans as defined by asc 715-20. the pension asset or liability represents the difference between the fair value of the pension plans assets and the projected benefit obligation as of december 31. for other postretirement benefit plans, the liability is the difference between the fair value of the plans assets and the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation as of december 31.
for the year ended december 31, 2016, our pension income, which includes the u.s. qualified pension plan (u.s. plan), certain qualified plans for non-u.s. subsidiaries, and a u.s. supplemental executive defined benefit plan, was approximately $(0.3) million. the largest portion of our 2016 pension income was $(5.2) million for our u.s. plan. pension expense or income is calculated based upon a number of actuarial assumptions. discount rate and expected return on assets are two assumptions which are important elements of pension plan expense (income) and asset/liability measurement. we evaluate our discount rate and expected rate
37
of return on assets assumptions annually on a plan and country specific basis. we evaluate other assumptions related to demographic factors, such as retirement age, mortality and turnover periodically, and update them to reflect our experience and expectations for the future. in the fourth quarter of 2014, we updated the mortality assumptions related to our u.s. retirement plans using the mortality tables published in october 2014 by the u.s. society of actuaries. the change in the mortality assumptions resulted in approximately $39.0 million of actuarial losses in 2014 for the u.s. retirement plans.
in developing the expected return on u.s. plan assets assumption, we evaluated input from our investment manager and pension consultants, including their forecast of asset class return expectations. we believe that 4.8% was an appropriate rate to use for 2016. the december 31, 2016 asset allocation for our u.s. plan was 88% invested in fixed income securities, 10% invested in equity securities, and 2% invested in other securities. our investment manager regularly reviews the actual asset allocation and periodically rebalances the portfolio to ensure alignment with our target allocations.
we recognize net actuarial gains and losses and the change in the fair value of plans assets in our operating results in the year in which they occur or upon any interim remeasurement of the plans. we calculate the expected return on plan assets using the fair value of the plan assets. actuarial gains and losses are generally measured annually as of december 31 and, accordingly, recorded during the fourth quarter of each year or upon any interim remeasurement of the plans.
the discount rate that we utilized for determining future pension obligations for the u.s. plan is based on the citigroup pension index adjusted for the u.s. plans expected cash flows and was 3.9% at december 31, 2016, down from 4.0% at december 31, 2015. we estimate that in 2017 we will recognize approximately $0.8 million of pension expense for the u.s. plan. the u.s. plan pension expense estimate for 2017 is based on a 3.9% discount rate and a 4.0% return on assets. future pension expense or income will depend on future investment performance, changes in future discount rates and various other factors related to the employee population participating in our pension plans.
as of december 31, 2016, our pension plans had unrecognized pension prior service cost of $0.1 million.
we performed a sensitivity analysis, which expresses the potential u.s. plan (income) expense for the year ending december 31, 2017, which would result from changes to either the discount rate or the expected return on plan assets. the below estimates exclude the impact of any potential actuarial gains or losses. it is difficult to reliably forecast or predict whether there will be any actuarial gains or losses in 2017 as they are primarily driven by events and circumstances beyond our control, such as changes in interest rates and the performance of the financial markets.

the assets of the u.s. plan consist substantially of fixed income securities. u.s. plan assets have increased from $298.4 million at december 31, 2015 to $307.3 million at december 31, 2016 while the u.s. plans liability increased from $297.8 million at december 31, 2015 to $299.6 million at december 31, 2016.
our funding policy is to make contributions to our pension plans in accordance with local laws and to the extent that such contributions are tax deductible. during 2016, we made contributions of $1.9 million to the u.s. plan, $2.6 million to the u.s. supplemental executive defined benefit pension plan and $0.9 million to certain qualified plans for non-u.s. subsidiaries. in 2017, we expect to contribute approximately $1.9 million to the u.s.
38
plan and $2.6 million to the u.s. supplemental executive defined benefit pension plan. contributions to be made in 2017 to certain qualified plans for non-u.s. subsidiaries are based on local statutory requirements and are estimated at approximately $0.8 million.
equity compensation plans in addition to our 1996 employee stock purchase plan discussed in note o: stock based compensation in notes to consolidated financial statements, we have a 2006 equity and cash compensation incentive plan (the 2006 equity plan) under which equity securities are authorized for issuance. the 2006 equity plan was initially approved by stockholders on may 25, 2006.
at our annual meeting of stockholders held may 21, 2013, our stockholders approved an amendment to the 2006 equity plan to increase the number of shares issuable thereunder by 10.0 million, for an aggregate of 32.0 million shares issuable thereunder, and our stockholders also approved an amendment to our 1996 employee stock purchase plan to increase the number of shares issuable thereunder by 5.0 million, for an aggregate of 30.4 million shares issuable thereunder. at our annual meeting of stockholders held may 12, 2015, our stockholders approved an amendment to the 2006 equity plan to extend its term until may 12, 2025.

2006 equity plan as of december 31, 2016 was 9,545,419 shares of our common stock. the 2006 equity plan authorizes the grant of stock-based awards in the form of (1) non-qualified and incentive stock options, (2) stock appreciation rights, (3) restricted stock awards and restricted stock unit awards, (4) phantom stock, and (5) other stock-based awards. awards may be tied to time-based vesting schedules and/or performance-based vesting measured by reference to performance criteria chosen by the compensation committee of the board of directors, which administers the 2006 equity plan. awards may be made to any employee, officer, consultant and advisor of teradyne and our subsidiaries, as well as, to our directors. the maximum number of shares of stock-based awards that may be granted to one participant during any one fiscal year is 2,000,000 shares of common stock. the 2006 equity plan will expire on may 12, 2025.
as of december 31, 2016, total unrecognized compensation expense related to non-vested restricted stock units and options was $40.6 million, and is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 2.3 years.

recently issued accounting pronouncements on january 26, 2017, the financial accounting standards board (fasb) issued accounting standards update (asu) 2017-04, intangiblesgoodwill and other (topic 350): simplifying the accounting for goodwill impairment. the new guidance removes step 2 of the goodwill impairment test, which requires a hypothetical purchase price allocation. goodwill impairment will now be the amount by which a reporting units carrying value exceeds its fair value, not to exceed the carrying amount of goodwill. all other goodwill impairment guidance will remain largely unchanged. entities will continue to have the option to perform a qualitative assessment to determine if a quantitative impairment test is necessary. the same one-step impairment test will be applied to goodwill at all reporting units, even those with zero or negative carrying amounts. entities
40
will be required to disclose the amount of goodwill at reporting units with zero or negative carrying amounts. the revised guidance will be applied prospectively, and is effective in 2020. early adoption is permitted for any impairment tests performed after january 1, 2017. we are currently evaluating the impact of this asu on our financial position, results of operations and statements of cash flows.
on october 24, 2016, the fasb issued asu 2016-16, accounting for income taxes: intra-entity asset transfers of assets other than inventory. under current generally accepted accounting principles (gaap), the tax effects of intra-entity asset transfers are deferred until the transferred asset is sold to a third party or otherwise recovered through use. the new guidance requires recognition of the tax expense from the sale of the asset in the sellers tax jurisdiction when the transfer occurs, even though the pre-tax effects of that transaction are eliminated in consolidation. any deferred tax asset that arises in the buyers jurisdiction would also be recognized at the time of the transfer. the new guidance does not apply to intra-entity transfers of inventory. the income tax consequences from the sale of inventory from one member of a consolidated entity to another will continue to be deferred until the inventory is sold to a third party. the new guidance will be effective in fiscal years beginning after december 15, 2017. early adoption is permitted. the modified retrospective approach will be required for transition to the new guidance, with a cumulative-effect adjustment recorded in retained earnings as of the beginning of the period of adoption. we do not expect this asu to have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations and statements of cash flows.
on march 31, 2016, the fasb issued asu 2016-09, compensation-stock compensation (topic 718): improvements to employee share-based payment accounting. this asu changes how companies account for certain aspects of share-based payment awards to employees, including the accounting for income taxes, forfeitures, and statutory tax withholding requirements, as well as classification in the statements of cash flows. this pronouncement is effective for annual periods beginning after december 15, 2016. early adoption is permitted. adoption of the new guidance will require recognition of excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies in the consolidated statements of operations on a prospective basis, with a cumulative effect adjustment to retained earnings for any prior year excess tax benefits or tax deficiencies not previously recorded. we expect the cumulative effect adjustment to increase retained earnings and deferred tax assets by approximately $39 million. in the years ended december 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, we recorded excess tax benefits of $6.1 million, $4.6 million, and $0.2 million, respectively, as a component of additional paid-in capital. in accordance with this asu, amounts for future periods related to the difference between the fair value of a restricted stock unit (rsu) on the grant date and the fair value on the vest date will be recorded as a discrete benefit or expense to the current income tax provision in the period in which the rsu vests. a majority of the future amounts will be recorded during the first quarter consistent with the vesting of a majority of our rsu grants.
in february 2016, the fasb issued asu 2016-02, leases (topic 842). the guidance in this asu supersedes the lease recognition requirements in accounting standards codification (asc) topic 840, leases. the new standard establishes a right-of-use (rou) model that requires a lessee to record an rou asset and a lease liability on the balance sheet for all leases with terms longer than twelve months. leases will be classified as either finance or operating, with classification affecting the pattern of expense recognition in the statements of operation. the new standard is effective for annual periods beginning after december 15, 2018 with early adoption permitted. a modified retrospective transition approach is required for lessees for capital and operating leases existing at, or entered into after, the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented in the financial statements. we are currently evaluating the impact of this asu on our financial position and results of operations.
in january 2016, the fasb issued asu 2016-01, financial instrumentsoverall (subtopic 825-10): recognition and measurement of financial assets and financial liabilities. this asu provides guidance for the recognition, measurement, presentation, and disclosure of financial instruments. the new pronouncement revises accounting related to equity investments and the presentation of certain fair value changes for financial liabilities measured at fair value. among other things, it amends the presentation and disclosure requirements of equity securities that do not result in consolidation and are not accounted for under the equity method. changes
41
in the fair value of these equity securities will be recognized directly in net income. this pronouncement is effective for fiscal years beginning after december 15, 2017. we are currently evaluating the impact of this asu on our financial position and results of operations.
in november 2015, the fasb issued asu 2015-17, income taxes (topic 740): balance sheet classification of deferred taxes. asu 2015-17 simplifies the presentation of deferred income taxes by eliminating the separate classification of deferred income tax liabilities and assets into current and noncurrent amounts in the balance sheet. the new guidance requires that all deferred tax liabilities and assets be classified as noncurrent in the balance sheet. this asu is effective for annual periods beginning after december 15, 2016, and may be applied either prospectively or retrospectively to all periods presented. early adoption is permitted. we early adopted this asu prospectively in the first quarter of 2016.
in april 2015, the fasb issued asu 2015-03, simplifying the presentation of debt issuance costs, which requires debt issuance costs to be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying value of the associated debt liability, consistent with the presentation for debt discount. asu 2015-03 does not specifically address requirements for the presentation or subsequent measurement of debt issuance costs related to line-of-credit arrangements. on august 8, 2015, the fasb issued asu 2015-15, interestimputation of interest (subtopic 835-30) clarifying that debt issuance costs related to line-of-credit arrangements could be presented as an asset and amortized over the term of the line-of-credit arrangement, regardless of whether there are any outstanding borrowings on the line-of-credit arrangement. we adopted this asu in the first quarter of 2016. adoption of this asu did not have a material impact on our financial position and results of operations.
in august 2014, the fasb issued asu 2014-15, presentation of financial statementsgoing concern (subtopic 205-40). asu 2014-15 provides guidance on managements responsibility in evaluating whether there is substantial doubt about an entitys ability to continue as a going concern and to provide related footnote disclosures. this asu is effective for annual periods ending after december 15, 2016. we do not expect this asu to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.
in may 2014, the fasb issued asu 2014-09, revenue from contracts with customers (topic 606), which will replace numerous requirements in u.s. gaap, including industry-specific requirements, and provide companies with a single revenue recognition model for recognizing revenue from contracts with customers. the core principle of the new standard is that a company should recognize revenue to show the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the company expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services. in august 2015, fasb issued asu 2015-14, which deferred the effective date of the new revenue standard by one year. for teradyne, the standard will be effective in the first quarter of 2018. the two permitted transition methods under the new standard are the full retrospective method, in which case the standard would be applied to each prior reporting period presented, or the modified retrospective method, in which case the cumulative effect of applying the standard would be recognized at the date of initial application. we have selected the modified retrospective transition method. we are currently evaluating the impact of this asu on our financial position and results of operations.

general motors company and subsidiaries non-gaap measures our non-gaap measures include earnings before interest and taxes (ebit)-adjusted presented net of noncontrolling interests, eps-diluted-adjusted, return on invested capital-adjusted (roic-adjusted) and adjusted automotive free cash flow. our calculation of these non-gaap measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies due to potential differences between companies in the method of calculation. as a result, the use of these non-gaap measures has limitations and should not be considered superior to, in isolation from, or as a substitute for, related u.s. gaap measures.
these non-gaap measures allow management and investors to view operating trends, perform analytical comparisons and benchmark performance between periods and among geographic regions to understand operating performance without regard to items we do not consider a component of our core operating performance. furthermore, these non-gaap measures allow investors the opportunity to measure and monitor our performance against our externally communicated targets and evaluate the investment decisions being made by management to improve roic-adjusted. management uses these measures in its financial, investment and operational decision-making processes, for internal reporting and as part of its forecasting and budgeting processes. further, our board of directors uses these and other measures as key metrics to determine management performance under our performance-based compensation plans. for these reasons we believe these non-gaap measures are useful for our investors.
ebit-adjusted is used by management and can be used by investors to review our consolidated operating results because it excludes automotive interest income, automotive interest expense and income taxes as well as certain additional adjustments that are not considered part of our core operations. examples of adjustments to ebit include but are not limited to impairment charges related to goodwill; impairment charges on long-lived assets and other exit costs resulting from strategic shifts in our operations or discrete market and business conditions; costs arising from the ignition switch recall and related legal matters; and certain currency devaluations associated with hyperinflationary economies. for ebit-adjusted and our other non-gaap measures, once we have made an adjustment in the current period for an item, we will also adjust the related non-gaap measure in any future periods in which there is an impact from the item.
eps-diluted-adjusted is used by management and can be used by investors to review our consolidated diluted earnings per share results on a consistent basis. eps-diluted-adjusted is calculated as net income attributable to common stockholders-diluted less certain adjustments noted above for ebit-adjusted and gains or losses on the extinguishment of debt obligations on an after-tax basis as well as redemptions of preferred stock and certain income tax adjustments divided by weighted-average common shares outstanding-diluted. examples of income tax adjustments include the establishment or reversal of significant deferred tax asset valuation allowances.
roic-adjusted is used by management and can be used by investors to review our investment and capital allocation decisions. we define roic-adjusted as ebit-adjusted for the trailing four quarters divided by average net assets, which is considered to be the average equity balances adjusted for average automotive debt and interest liabilities, exclusive of capital leases; average automotive net pension and other postretirement benefits (opeb) liabilities; and average automotive net income tax assets during the same period.
adjusted automotive free cash flow is used by management and can be used by investors to review the liquidity of our automotive operations and to measure and monitor our performance against our capital allocation program and evaluate our automotive liquidity against the substantial cash requirements of our automotive operations. we measure adjusted automotive free cash flow as automotive cash flow from operations less capital expenditures adjusted for management actions, primarily related to strengthening our balance sheet, such as prepayments of debt and discretionary contributions to employee benefit plans. refer to the "liquidity and capital resources" section of this md&a for our reconciliation of net automotive cash provided by (used in) operating activities under u.s. gaap to this non-gaap measure.

________
(a)   these adjustments were excluded because of the unique events associated with the ignition switch recall. these events included the creation of the ignition switch recall compensation program, as well as various investigations, inquiries, and complaints from various constituents.
(b)   this adjustment was excluded because it resulted from our decision to change the method we use to estimate costs associated with recall campaigns in gmna.
(c)   these adjustments were excluded because of the significant restructuring of our thailand operations and the strategic actions taken to focus on the production of pick-up trucks and suvs.
(d)   this adjustment was excluded because of the devaluation of the venezuela bolivar fuerte (bsf), our inability to transact at the complementary system of foreign currency administration (sicad) rate to obtain u.s. dollars and the market restrictions imposed by the venezuelan government.
(e)   these adjustments were excluded because they were driven by deteriorating market conditions in russia, which led to asset impairments in 2014 and our decision to exit the russia market in 2015. the russia exit costs primarily consisted of sales incentives, dealer restructuring and other contract cancellation costs, and asset impairments.

overview our strategic plan includes several major initiatives that we anticipate will help us achieve our goal of 9% to 10% margins on an ebit-adjusted basis (ebit-adjusted margins, calculated as ebit-adjusted divided by net sales and revenue) by early next decade: earn customers for life by delivering great products to our customers, leading the industry in quality and safety and improving the customer ownership experience; lead in technology and innovation, including onstar 4g lte and connected car, alternative propulsion, urban mobility including ride- and car-sharing through maven and our investment in lyft, active safety features and autonomous vehicles; grow our brands, particularly the cadillac brand in the u.s. and china and the chevrolet brand globally; continue our growth in china; continue the growth of gm financial into our full captive automotive financing company; and deliver core operating efficiencies.
in addition to our ebit-adjusted margin improvement goal, our overall financial targets include expected total annual operational and functional cost savings of $6.5 billion through 2018 compared to 2014 costs, of which approximately $4 billion has been realized as of december 31, 2016, and which we expect will more than offset our incremental investments in brand building, engineering and technology as we launch new products in 2017 and beyond; and execution of our capital allocation program as described in the "liquidity and capital resources" section of this md&a.
for the year ending december 31, 2017 we expect to continue to generate strong consolidated financial results including improved total net sales and revenue, ebit-adjusted and ebit-adjusted margins that equal or exceed the corresponding amounts in 2016, roic-adjusted of greater than 25%, automotive operating cash flow of approximately $15 billion, adjusted automotive free cash flow of approximately $6 billion and eps-diluted and eps-diluted-adjusted of between $6.00 and $6.50. we do not consider the potential future impact of adjustments on our expected financial results. we expect these financial results in part to be driven by favorable shifts in mix for our new or refreshed product launches, including crossovers.

we face continuing challenges from a market, operating and regulatory standpoint in a number of countries across the globe due to, among other factors, weak economic conditions, competitive pressures, our product portfolio offerings, emissions standards, foreign exchange volatility and political uncertainty. as a result of these conditions, we continue to strategically assess our performance and ability to achieve acceptable returns on our invested capital. as we continue to assess our performance, additional restructuring and rationalization actions may be required or a determination may be made that the carrying amount of our long-lived assets may not be recoverable in certain of these countries. such a determination may give rise to future asset impairments or other charges which may have a material impact on our results of operations.
gmna in the year ended december 31, 2016 industry sales to retail and fleet customers were 21.9 million units representing a 1.7% increase compared to the corresponding period in 2015 due to strong consumer demand driven by credit availability, low interest rates and low fuel prices.
in the year ended december 31, 2016 our vehicle sales in the u.s., our largest market in north america, totaled 3.0 million units for market share of 17.0%, representing a decrease of 0.3 percentage points compared to the corresponding period in 2015. the decrease in our u.s. market share was driven primarily by lower fleet market share due to a planned reduction in rental deliveries, partially offset by higher retail market share. u.s. retail sales, generally more profitable than fleet sales, generated an increase of 0.5 percentage points in market share, primarily driven by chevrolet.
we achieved ebit-adjusted margins of 10.1% during 2016 on continued strength of u.s. industry light vehicle sales, new product launches and material and other cost savings, which partially offset launch related costs. based on our current cost structure, we continue to estimate gmna's breakeven point at the u.s. industry level to be in the range of 10.0 - 11.0 million units. we expect to sustain an ebit-adjusted margin of 10% in 2017 on continued strength of u.s. industry light vehicle sales, key product launches and continued focus on overall cost savings.
gme as a result of moderate economic growth across europe (excluding russia) automotive industry sales to retail and fleet customers continued improving in the year ended december 31, 2016 with industry sales to retail and fleet customers of 18.8 million units representing a 6.1% increase compared to the corresponding period in 2015.
our european operations are benefiting from this trend and vehicle sales continue to show signs of improvement underscored by further improvement in our opel and vauxhall retail vehicle sales of 1.2 million units for market share of 5.7% in the year ended december 31, 2016 consistent with the corresponding period in 2015. we continue to implement various strategic actions to strengthen our operations and increase our competitiveness.
despite the improvements we experienced through most of 2016 we were unable to overcome the impacts of the u.k. referendum vote to leave the european union (brexit) resulting in a $0.3 billion unfavorable impact due primarily to adverse movement in the british pound against the u.s. dollar.
we anticipate the impacts of brexit to continue through 2017. we also anticipate headwinds associated with industry pricing pressures and increased costs associated with depreciation, amortization, marketing and costs associated with our new product launches. we intend to mitigate these headwinds with the full benefit of our recently launched astra and mokka x along with the 2017 launches of the insignia, ampera e, and two new crossovers that we believe will substantially increase our competitiveness in this growing market.
the german ministry of transportation and the kraftfahrt-bundesamt have requested the participation of a number of automotive manufacturers, including our german subsidiary, in continuing discussions on emissions control issues and have also requested, from time to time, written responses from our subsidiary on the subject. our german subsidiary has participated in these discussions and has provided the requested responses to inquiries concerning nitrogen oxide emission control systems of its diesel engines. in addition, the german and the eu parliaments have instigated inquiry commissions into government agencies' oversight of emissions enforcement, requesting our german subsidiary's participation. at the same time, the german government has instigated further industry-wide inquiries about co2 emissions. this scrutiny, regulatory changes and increased enforcement has led to

general motors company and subsidiaries increased testing and re-testing of our vehicles and analysis of their emissions control systems, which could lead to increased costs, penalties, negative publicity or reputational impact, and recall activity if regulators determine that emission levels and required regulatory compliance should be based on either a wider spectrum of driving conditions for future testing parameters or stricter or novel interpretations and consequent enforcement of existing requirements. no assurance can be given that the ultimate outcome of any potential investigations or increased testing resulting from this scrutiny would not materially and adversely affect us.
gmio in the year ended december 31, 2016 china industry sales were 28.3 million units, representing an increase of 12.9% compared to the corresponding period in 2015. in the year ended december 31, 2016 our china wholesale volumes increased by 4.9% compared to the corresponding period in 2015. our market share decreased to 13.8%, down 1.1 percentage points as our volume growth was less than that of the industry. strong growth in cadillac, buick and baojun passenger vehicles, including suvs, were partially offset by lower chevrolet sales because of model changeover and lower wuling sales because of a continued segment shift away from mini commercial vehicles. in the year ended december 31, 2016 our automotive china jvs generated equity income of $2.0 billion. we expect moderate industry growth in 2017 and continuation of pricing pressures which will continue to pressure margins. we continue to expect an increase in vehicle sales driven by new launches and expect to sustain strong china equity income by focusing on vehicle mix improvements, cost improvements and efficiencies, and downstream performance optimization.
a weaker economy due partially to lower oil prices and foreign exchange volatility, among other factors, negatively impacted the overall automotive industry in the rest of asia pacific, africa and the middle east and led to industry sales to retail and fleet customers of 18.9 million units, representing a decrease of 3.2% in the year ended december 31, 2016 compared to the corresponding period in 2015. in the year ended december 31, 2016 our retail sales totaled 0.7 million units leading to a market share of 3.6%, representing a decrease of 0.5 percentage points compared to the corresponding period in 2015. the decrease in retail sales volumes was due primarily to overall industry volume declines, foreign currency availability and economic challenges in the middle east, egypt and south africa.
in 2017 we expect the operating environment to remain challenging. as we strategically assess our performance and the manner in which we operate in certain countries, additional restructuring and rationalization actions may be required and may have a material impact on our results of operations.
gmsa the south american automotive industry continues to be challenged by weak economic conditions and lack of consumer confidence. industry sales to retail and fleet customers were 3.7 million units in the year ended december 31, 2016 representing a 12.3% decrease compared to the corresponding period in 2015. in the year ended december 31, 2016, our vehicle sales in brazil, our largest market in south america, totaled 0.3 million units for market share of 16.9%, representing an increase of 1.8 percentage points compared to the corresponding period in 2015 primarily driven by a refreshed portfolio.
in 2017 we expect conditions in south america to improve as the economy recovers driven by higher consumer confidence and lower interest rates. we will continue to monitor conditions in south america and take actions to address challenges in the region.
corporate in connection with our capital allocation program, as detailed in the "liquidity and capital resources" section of this md&a, we previously announced that our board of directors had authorized programs to purchase up to $5 billion and $4 billion of our common stock before the end of 2016 and 2017. we completed the $5 billion program in the three months ended september 30, 2016 and $1 billion of the $4 billion program in the three months ended december 31, 2016. in january 2017 we announced that our board of directors had authorized the purchase of up to an additional $5 billion of our common stock with no expiration date, subsequent to completing the remaining portion of the previously announced programs. through february 1, 2017 we had purchased 180 million shares of our outstanding common stock under our common stock repurchase program for $6.0 billion.
the ignition switch recall has led to various inquiries, investigations, subpoenas, requests for information and complaints from agencies or other representatives of u.s., federal, state and canadian governments. in addition these and other recalls have resulted in a number of claims and lawsuits. such lawsuits and investigations could in the future result in the imposition of material damages, fines, civil consent orders, civil and criminal penalties or other remedies. refer to note 15 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information.
takata matters on may 4, 2016 nhtsa issued an amended consent order requiring takata to file defect information reports (dirs) for previously unrecalled front airbag inflators that contain an ammonium nitrate-based propellant without a moisture absorbing desiccant on a multi-year, risk-based schedule through 2019 impacting tens of millions of vehicles produced by numerous automotive manufacturers. nhtsa concluded that the likely root cause of the rupturing of the airbag inflators is a function of
23
general motors company and subsidiaries time, temperature cycling and environmental moisture. on may 16, 2016 takata issued its first dir in connection with the amended consent order, and on january 3, 2017, takata issued its second set of dirs.
although we do not believe there is a safety defect at this time in any gm vehicles within the scope of the takata dir, in cooperation with nhtsa we filed preliminary dirs on may 27, 2016, updated as of june 13, 2016, covering 2.5 million of certain of our gmt900 vehicles, which are full-size pick-up trucks and suvs. on november 15, 2016, we filed a petition for inconsequentiality and request for deferral of determination regarding certain gmt900 vehicles equipped with takata inflators. on november 28, 2016, nhtsa granted gm's deferral request in connection with this petition. the deferral provides gm until august 31, 2017 to present evidence and analysis that our vehicles do not pose an unreasonable risk to motor vehicle safety. we believe that this timeline will permit us to complete our testing of the relevant non-desiccated takata inflators in gmt900 vehicles and to prove to nhtsa that the inflators in these vehicles do not present an unreasonable risk to safety and that no repair will ultimately be required.
takata filed a second set of equipment dirs on january 3, 2017 and we filed a second set of preliminary dirs for certain gmt900 vehicles on january 10, 2017. these january 2017 dirs are consistent with gm's may 2016 dirs. on the same day, we also filed a second petition for inconsequentiality and deferral of decision with respect to the vehicles subject to our january 2017 dirs. on january 18, 2017, nhtsa consolidated our first and second petitions for inconsequentiality and will rule on both at the same time.
we believe these vehicles are currently performing as designed and ongoing testing continues to support the belief that the vehicles' unique design and integration mitigates against inflator degradation. for example, the airbag inflators used in the vehicles are a variant engineered specifically for our vehicles, and include features such as greater venting, unique propellant wafer configurations, and machined steel end caps. the inflators are packaged in the instrument panel in such a way as to minimize exposure to moisture from the climate control system. also, these vehicles have features that minimize the maximum temperature to which the inflator will be exposed, such as larger interior volumes and standard solar absorbing windshields and side glass. we believe that the results of further testing and analysis will demonstrate that the vehicles do not present an unreasonable risk to safety and that no repair will ultimately be required. accordingly, no warranty provision has been made for any repair associated with our vehicles subject to the preliminary dirs and amended consent order. however, in the event we are ultimately obligated to repair the inflators in these vehicles, we estimate a reasonably possible cost of up to $880 million for the 6.9 million vehicles subject to either the preliminary dirs or future takata dirs under the amended consent order.
through january 27, 2017 we were aware of one putative class action pending against gm in federal court in the u.s., one putative class action in mexico and seven putative class actions pending in various provincial courts in canada arising out of allegations that airbag inflators manufactured by takata are defective. in addition, the new mexico attorney general has initiated litigation against takata and numerous automotive manufacturers, including gm. at this early stage of these proceedings, we are unable to provide an evaluation of the likelihood that a loss will be incurred or an estimate of the amounts or range of possible loss.
automotive financing - gm financial summary and outlook gm financial has expanded its leasing, near prime and prime lending programs in north america; therefore, leasing and prime lending have become a larger percentage of the originations and retail portfolio balance. gm financial's retail penetration in north america grew to approximately 33% in the year ended december 31, 2016 from approximately 30% in the corresponding period in 2015 as a result of the expanded leasing and lending programs. in the year ended december 31, 2016 gm financial's revenue consisted of leased vehicle income of 62%, retail finance charge income of 30%, commercial finance charge income of 5% and other income of 3%. we believe that offering a comprehensive suite of financing products will generate incremental sales of our vehicles, drive incremental gm financial earnings and help support our sales throughout various economic cycles.
consolidated results we review changes in our results of operations under five categories: volume, mix, price, cost and other. volume measures the impact of changes in wholesale vehicle volumes driven by industry volume, market share and changes in dealer stock levels. mix measures the impact of changes to the regional portfolio due to product, model, trim, country and option penetration in current year wholesale vehicle volumes. price measures the impact of changes related to manufacturer's suggested retail price and various sales allowances. cost includes primarily: (1) material and freight; (2) manufacturing, engineering, advertising, administrative and selling and warranty expense; and (3) non-vehicle related activity. other includes primarily foreign exchange and non-vehicle related automotive revenues as well as equity income or loss from our nonconsolidated affiliates. refer to the regional sections of this md&a for additional information.

general motors company and subsidiaries factors which most significantly influence a region's profitability are industry volume, market share, and the relative mix of vehicles (cars, trucks, crossovers) sold. variable profit is a key indicator of product profitability. variable profit is defined as revenue less material cost, freight, the variable component of manufacturing expense and warranty and recall-related costs. vehicles with higher selling prices generally have higher variable profit.

venezuelan operations our operations in venezuela, which remain consolidated, continue to be negatively impacted by economic recession and political instability in the country. during the years ended december 31, 2015 and 2014 we recorded devaluation and asset impairment charges of $0.7 billion and $0.4 billion in automotive cost of sales related to our inability to transact at the sicad rate to obtain u.s. dollars and the market restrictions imposed by the venezuelan government. we monitor the environment in venezuela closely to assess whether changes evolve such that we no longer maintain a controlling financial interest. absent ongoing vehicle production, our venezuelan subsidiaries may require additional financial support. at this time no decision has been made whether we will provide further financial support if required. if a determination is made in the future that we no longer maintain control, we may incur a charge based on exchange rates at december 31, 2016 of up to $0.1 billion.

liquidity and capital resources we believe that our current level of cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities and availability under our revolving credit facilities will be sufficient to meet our liquidity needs. we expect to have substantial cash requirements going forward which we plan to fund through total available liquidity and cash flows generated from operations. we also maintain access to the capital markets and may issue debt or equity securities from time to time, which may provide an additional source of liquidity. our future uses of cash, which may vary from time to time based on market conditions and other factors, are focused on three objectives: (1) reinvest in our business; (2) maintain an investment-grade balance sheet; and (3) return excess cash to stockholders. our known future material uses of cash include, among other possible demands: (1) capital expenditures of approximately $9 billion annually as well as payments for engineering and product development activities; (2) payments

general motors company and subsidiaries associated with previously announced vehicle recalls, the settlements of the multidistrict litigation and any other recall-related contingencies; (3) payments to service debt and other long-term obligations, including discretionary and mandatory contributions to our pension plans; (4) dividend payments on our common stock that are declared by our board of directors; and (5) payments to purchase shares of our common stock authorized by our board of directors.
our liquidity plans are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including those described in the "forward-looking statements" section of this md&a and item 1a. risk factors, some of which are outside of our control.
we continue to monitor and evaluate opportunities to strengthen our competitive position over the long-term while maintaining an investment-grade balance sheet. these actions may include opportunistic payments to reduce our long-term obligations as well as the possibility of acquisitions, dispositions, investments with joint venture partners and strategic alliances that we believe would generate significant advantages and substantially strengthen our business. these actions may negatively impact our liquidity in the short term.
our senior management evaluates our capital allocation program on an ongoing basis and recommends any modifications to the program to our board of directors not less than once annually. over the last six months of 2016, management conducted an extensive review of various capital allocation strategies including consideration of potential variations in our capital structure, changes in the pacing and/or nature of return of capital to shareholders (including a potential increase in our share repurchase program) and issuance or distribution of preferred or other securities. we regularly engage with our shareholders and received input as to the views of certain of our shareholders on capital allocation during this review. ultimately, management reaffirmed and our board of directors approved the capital allocation program, which includes reinvesting in our business at an average target roic-adjusted rate of 20% or greater, maintaining a strong investment grade balance sheet, including a target cash balance of $20 billion, and returning remaining free cash flow to shareholders. we also announced in january 2017 that our board of directors had authorized the purchase of up to an additional $5 billion of our common stock with no expiration date, subsequent to completing the remaining portion of the previously announced programs.
as part of our capital allocation program we previously announced that our board of directors had authorized programs to purchase up to $5 billion and $4 billion of our common stock before the end of 2016 and 2017. we completed the $5 billion program in the three months ended september 30, 2016 and $1 billion of the $4 billion program in the three months ended december 31, 2016. through february 1, 2017 we had purchased an aggregate of 180 million shares of our outstanding common stock under our common stock repurchase program for $6.0 billion. in the year ended december 31, 2016, we returned total cash to shareholders of $4.8 billion, consisting of dividends paid on our common stock and purchases of our common stock.
in february 2016 we issued $2.0 billion in aggregate principal amount of automotive senior unsecured notes and used the entire net proceeds to fund discretionary contributions to our u.s. hourly pension plan in the year ended december 31, 2016 to improve its funded status. refer to note 13 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information on the senior unsecured notes.
in may 2016 we amended our two primary revolving credit facilities, increasing our aggregate borrowing capacity from $12.5 billion to $14.5 billion. these facilities consist of a three-year, $4.0 billion facility and a five-year, $10.5 billion facility. both facilities are available to us as well as certain wholly-owned subsidiaries, including gm financial. the three-year, $4.0 billion facility allows for borrowings in u.s. dollars and other currencies and includes a gm financial borrowing sub-limit of $1.0 billion and a letter of credit sub-facility of $1.0 billion. the five-year, $10.5 billion facility allows for borrowings in u.s. dollars and other currencies and includes a gm financial borrowing sub-limit of $3.0 billion and a letter of credit sub-limit of $500 million.
automotive liquidity total available liquidity includes cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities and funds available under credit facilities. the amount of available liquidity is subject to intra-month and seasonal fluctuations and includes balances held by various business units and subsidiaries worldwide that are needed to fund their operations.
we manage our liquidity primarily at our treasury centers as well as at certain of our significant consolidated overseas subsidiaries. over 90% of our available liquidity excluding funds available under credit facilities was held within north america and at our regional treasury centers at december 31, 2016. our available liquidity includes approximately $0.6 billion deemed indefinitely reinvested in our foreign subsidiaries. we have used and will continue to use other methods including intercompany loans to utilize these funds across our global operations as needed.
our cash equivalents and marketable securities balances are primarily denominated in u.s. dollars and include investments in u.s. government and agency obligations, foreign government securities, time deposits, corporate debt securities and mortgage
32
general motors company and subsidiaries and asset-backed securities. our investment guidelines, which we may change from time to time, prescribe certain minimum credit worthiness thresholds and limit our exposures to any particular sector, asset class, issuance or security type. the majority of our current investments in debt securities are with a/a2 or better rated issuers.
we use credit facilities as a mechanism to provide additional flexibility in managing our global liquidity. the total size of our credit facilities was $14.6 billion and $12.6 billion at december 31, 2016 and 2015, which consisted principally of our two primary revolving credit facilities. we did not have any borrowings against our primary facilities, but had letters of credit outstanding under our sub-facility of $0.6 billion at december 31, 2016. gm financial had access to our revolving credit facilities at december 31, 2016 and 2015 but did not borrow against them. refer to note 13 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information on credit facilities. at december 31, 2016 and 2015 we had intercompany loans from gm financial of $0.5 billion and $0.4 billion, which consisted primarily of commercial loans to dealers we consolidate, and we had no intercompany loans to gm financial. the following table summarizes our automotive available liquidity (dollars in billions):

(a)   amounts include automotive interest payments based on contractual terms and current interest rates on our debt and capital lease obligations. automotive interest payments based on variable interest rates were determined using the interest rate in effect at december 31, 2016.
(b)   gm financial interest payments were determined using the interest rate in effect at december 31, 2016 for floating rate debt and the contractual rates for fixed rate debt. gm financial interest payments on floating rate tranches of the securitization notes payable were converted to a fixed rate based on the floating rate plus any expected hedge payments.
(c)   amounts include opeb payments under the current u.s. contractual labor agreements through 2019 and canada labor agreements through 2020. these agreements are generally renegotiated in the year of expiration. amounts do not include pension funding obligations, which are discussed in note 14 to our consolidated financial statements.
(d)   amounts do not include future cash payments for long-term purchase obligations and other accrued expenditures (unless specifically listed in the table above) which were recorded in accounts payable or accrued liabilities at december 31, 2016.
(e)   amounts include all expected future payments for both current and expected future service at december 31, 2016 for opeb obligations for salaried and hourly employees extending beyond the current north american union contract agreements. amounts do not include pension funding obligations, which are discussed in note 14 to our consolidated financial statements.
the table above does not reflect product warranty and related liabilities of $9.7 billion and unrecognized tax benefits of $1.2 billion due to the uncertainty regarding the future cash outflows potentially associated with these amounts.
critical accounting estimates accounting estimates are an integral part of the consolidated financial statements. these estimates require the use of judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses in the periods presented. we believe the accounting estimates employed are appropriate and the resulting balances are reasonable; however, due to the inherent uncertainties in developing estimates actual results could differ from the original estimates, requiring adjustments to these balances in future periods. refer to note 2 to our consolidated financial statements for our significant accounting policies related to our critical accounting estimates.
pension and opeb plans our defined benefit pension plans are accounted for on an actuarial basis, which requires the selection of various assumptions, including an expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, a discount rate, mortality rates of participants and expectation of mortality improvement. the expected long-term rate of return on u.s. plan assets that is utilized in determining pension expense is derived from periodic studies, which include a review of asset allocation strategies, anticipated future long-term performance of individual asset classes, risks using standard deviations and correlations of returns among the asset classes that comprise the plans' asset mix. while the studies give appropriate consideration to recent plan performance and historical returns, the assumptions are primarily long-term, prospective rates of return.
in december 2016 an investment policy study was completed for the u.s. pension plans. the study resulted in new target asset allocations being approved for the u.s. pension plans with resulting changes to the expected long-term rate of return on assets. the weighted-average long-term rate of return on assets decreased from 6.3% at december 31, 2015 to 6.2% at december 31, 2016. the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets used in determining pension expense for non-u.s. plans is determined in a similar manner to the u.s. plans.
another key assumption in determining net pension and opeb expense is the assumed discount rate used to discount plan obligations. we estimate the assumed discount rate for u.s. plans using a cash flow matching approach, which uses projected cash flows matched to spot rates along a high quality corporate yield curve to determine the weighted-average discount rate for the calculation of the present value of cash flows. effective 2016 we applied the individual annual yield curve rates instead of the assumed discount rate to determine the service cost and interest cost. this refinement more specifically links the cash flows related to service cost and interest cost to bonds maturing in their year of payment. the refinement reduced the service cost and interest cost in 2016 by $0.8 billion. there was no effect on the determination of the plan obligations which continues to be calculated using the assumed discount rate.
we have reviewed and incorporated the mortality improvement tables published by the society of actuaries in the three months ended december 31, 2016 that lowered life expectancies and thereby indicated the amount of estimated aggregate benefit payments to our u.s. pension plans' participants was decreasing. this change in assumption decreased the december 31, 2016 u.s. pension and opeb plans' benefit obligations by $0.9 billion.
significant differences in actual experience or significant changes in assumptions may materially affect the pension obligations. the effects of actual results differing from assumptions and the changing of assumptions are included in unamortized net actuarial gains and losses that are subject to amortization to pension expense over future periods. the unamortized pre-tax actuarial loss on our pension plans was $4.8 billion and $3.7 billion at december 31, 2016 and 2015. the year-over-year change is primarily due
37
general motors company and subsidiaries to the decrease in discount rates partially offset by assumption changes, primarily the u.s. mortality improvement scale. at december 31, 2016 $2.9 billion of the unamortized pre-tax actuarial loss is outside the corridor (10% of the projected benefit obligation (pbo)) and subject to amortization. the weighted-average amortization period is approximately twelve years resulting in amortization expense of $0.2 billion in 2017.
the underfunded status of the u.s. pension plans decreased by $3.2 billion in the year ended december 31, 2016 to $7.2 billion due primarily to: (1) a favorable effect of actual returns on plan assets of $4.0 billion; (2) contributions of $2.1 billion; and (3) favorable assumption changes, primarily the u.s. mortality improvement scale of $0.9 billion; partially offset by (4) interest and service cost of $2.4 billion; and (5) an unfavorable effect due to a decrease in discount rates of $1.5 billion.
the following table illustrates the sensitivity to a change in certain assumptions for the pension plans, holding all other assumptions constant:

valuation of deferred tax assets the ability to realize deferred tax assets depends on the ability to generate sufficient taxable income within the carryback or carryforward periods provided for in the tax law for each applicable tax jurisdiction. the assessment regarding whether a valuation allowance is required or should be adjusted is based on an evaluation of possible sources of taxable income and also considers all available positive and negative evidence factors. our accounting for the valuation of deferred tax assets represents our best estimate of future events. changes in our current estimates, due to unanticipated market conditions, governmental legislative actions or events, could have a material effect on our ability to utilize deferred tax assets.
at december 31, 2016 total deferred tax assets were $40 billion and valuation allowances against those deferred tax assets were $4.6 billion. refer to note 16 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information on the composition of these valuation allowances.
if law is enacted that reduces the u.s. statutory tax rate, we would record a significant, one-time reduction to the net deferred tax assets and related increase to income tax expense in the period that includes the enactment date of the tax rate change.
valuation of gm financial equipment on operating leases assets and residuals gm financial has investments in leased vehicles recorded as operating leases, which relate to vehicle leases to retail customers with lease terms ranging from two to five years. at the beginning of the lease contract a determination is made of the estimated realizable value (i.e., residual value) of the vehicle at the end of the lease term, which is the critical assumption underlying the estimated carrying value of leased assets. the estimated realizable value is based on the lower of the contracted residual value or the current market estimate of residual value based on independent lease guides. since the customer is not obligated to purchase the vehicle at the end of the contract, gm financial is exposed to a risk of loss to the extent the value of the vehicle at the end of the lease term is below the residual value estimated at contract inception. over the life of the lease gm financial evaluates the adequacy of the estimate of the residual value and may make adjustments to the extent the expected value of the vehicle at lease termination changes. adjustments could result in a change in the depreciation rate of the leased asset or if an impairment exists, an impairment charge.
the following table summarizes vehicles included in gm financial equipment on operating leases, net (vehicles in thousands):

trucks                            52

product warranty and recall campaigns the estimates related to product warranties are established using historical information on the nature, frequency and average cost of claims of each vehicle line or each model year of the vehicle line and assumptions about future activity and events. when little or no claims experience exists for a model year or a vehicle line, the estimate is based on comparable models.
in gmna we primarily accrue the costs for recall campaigns at the time of vehicle sale. in the other regions, there is not sufficient historical data to support the application of an actuarial-based estimation technique and the estimated costs are accrued at the time when they are probable and reasonably estimable, which typically occurs once it is determined a specific recall campaign is needed and announced.
the estimates related to recall campaigns accrued at the time of vehicle sale are established by applying a frequency times severity approach that considers the number of recall events, the number of vehicles per recall event, the assumed number of vehicles that will be brought in by customers for repair (take rate) and the cost per vehicle for each recall event. these estimates consider the nature, frequency and magnitude of historical recall campaigns. costs associated with recall campaigns not accrued at the time of vehicle sale are estimated based on the estimated cost of repairs and the estimated vehicles to be repaired. depending on part availability and time to complete repairs we may, from time to time, offer courtesy transportation at no cost to our customers. these estimates are re-evaluated on an ongoing basis and based on the best available information. revisions are made when necessary based on changes in these factors.
the estimated amount accrued for recall campaigns at the time of vehicle sale is most sensitive to the estimated number of recall events, the number of vehicles per recall event, the take rate, and the cost per vehicle for each recall event. the estimated cost of a recall campaign that is accrued on an individual basis is most sensitive to our estimated assumed take rate that is primarily developed based on our historical take rate experience. a 10% increase in the estimated take rate for all recall campaigns would increase the estimated cost by approximately $0.3 billion.
actual experience could differ from the amounts estimated requiring adjustments to these liabilities in future periods. due to the uncertainty and potential volatility of the factors contributing to developing estimates, changes in our assumptions could materially affect our results of operations.
sales incentives the estimated effect of sales incentives offered to dealers and end customers is recorded as a reduction of automotive net sales and revenue at the later of the time of sale or announcement of an incentive program to dealers. there may be numerous types of incentives available at any particular time, including a choice of incentives for a specific model. incentive programs are generally brand specific, model specific or sales region specific and are for specified time periods, which may be extended. significant factors used in estimating the cost of incentives include the volume of vehicles that will be affected by the incentive programs offered by product, the product mix, the rate of customer acceptance of any incentive program and the likelihood that an incentive program will be extended, all of which are estimated based on historical experience and assumptions concerning customer behavior and future market conditions. when an incentive program is announced, the number of vehicles in dealer
39
general motors company and subsidiaries inventory eligible for the incentive program is determined and a reduction of automotive net sales and revenue is recorded in the period in which the program is announced. if the actual number of affected vehicles differs from this estimate, or if a different mix of incentives is actually paid, the reduction in automotive net sales and revenue due to incentives could be affected. there are a multitude of inputs affecting the calculation of the estimate for sales incentives and an increase or decrease in any of these variables could have a significant effect on recorded sales incentives.

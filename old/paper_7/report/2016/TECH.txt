in fiscal 2016, biotechnology segment net sales increased 3% from the prior fiscal year. organic growth for the segment was 6% for the fiscal year, with currency translation having an unfavorable impact of 3% on revenue growth. growth was achieved in all major geographies, especially in china and from biopharma customers in the u.s. and europe. japan was the only notable exception, where demand was weak due to delayed funding from japanese government agencies.
in fiscal 2016, clinical controls segment net sales increased 34%. included in fiscal 2016 clinical controls segment net sales was $26.6 million generated by the acquisition of cliniqa in july 2015, contributing essentially all of the growth. solid organic growth in the hematology controls product line was offset by customer delayed projects in the glucose controls product line due to reimbursement pricing pressures in that particular market segment.
in fiscal 2016, the protein platforms segment net sales increased 17% from the prior fiscal year. organic revenue increased 14% with an unfavorable currency impact of 2% and acquisitions adding 5% to segment growth. this segment includes the proteinsimple product lines associated with the acquisitions of proteinsimple in july, 2014, cyvek in november, 2014, and zephyrus in march 2016, all of which expand the company's solutions that it can offer its customers by developing and commercializing proprietary systems and consumables for protein analysis. organic growth was driven by additional market demand for simple western instruments and consumables, a new instrument product launch in the biologics product line (maurice), and instrument/consumable sales of ella, the elisa-multiplexing solution that was the key technology acquired as part of the cyvek acquisition in the prior fiscal year. revenue from acquisitions included sales from proteinsimple and cyvek for the months that we did not own them in the prior year. there was no revenue from the zephyrus acquisition in fiscal 2016.
in fiscal 2015, biotechnology segment net sales increased 8% from the prior fiscal year. included in fiscal 2015 biotechnology segment net sales was $18.5 million generated by the acquisition of novus biologicals in july 2014 and the negative impact of foreign currency fluctuations of $8.5 million. excluding these amounts, organic net sales for the segment increased 3% in fiscal 2015, driven by a strong bio-pharma end-market in the us and significant government funding of life science research in china. the academia and government end-market in the u.s. continued to improve sequentially each quarter in 2015, which the company capitalized on through its distribution partnership with fisher scientific. in europe, most countries experienced growth in 2015, but this growth was negated by the timing of research cycles experienced by the company's large pharma customers located in germany. the pacific rim regions delivered modest growth, with the exception of japan, where the devaluation of the yen versus the us dollar encouraged local distributors to hold lower levels of inventory than in the prior year.
in fiscal 2015, clinical controls segment net sales increased 7%, with organic sales contributing 5% to growth and the acquisition of bionostics contributing 1% to growth.   growth came equally from solid demand for both the segment's hematology-based controls and blood glucose/gas-based controls attributable to close relationships with our oem customers.
in fiscal 2015, the new protein platforms segment generated net sales of $66.2 million. at this time, the segment included product lines associated with the acquisitions of proteinsimple in july, 2014 and cyvek in november, 2014.

gross margins consolidated gross margins were 68%, 68% and 70% in fiscal 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. gaap reported consolidated gross margins were negatively impacted as a result of purchase accounting related to inventory and intangible assets acquired during fiscal 2016, 2015, 2014 and prior years. under purchase accounting, inventory is valued at fair value less expected selling and marketing costs, resulting in reduced margins in future periods as the inventory is sold. excluding the impact of acquired inventory sold and amortization of intangibles, adjusted gross margins were 71%, 72% and 74% in fiscal 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.
a reconciliation of the reported consolidated gross margin percentages, adjusted for acquired inventory sold and intangible amortization included in cost of sales, is as follows:
year ended june 30,

2016              2015              2014
consolidated gross margin percentage                      67.5   %          67.9   %          70.3   %
identified adjustments:
costs recognized upon sale of acquired inventory           1.1   %           1.5   %           2.1   %
amortization of intangibles                                2.2   %           2.1   %           1.1   %
adjusted gross margin percentage                          70.8   %          71.6   %          73.5   %
fluctuations in adjusted gross margins, as a percentage of net sales, have primarily resulted from changes in foreign currency exchange rates and changes in product mix. in fiscal 2016, the biggest impact to gross margin, as compared to fiscal 2015, was the change in product mix associated with the aquisition of cliniqa. in fiscal 2015, the biggest impact to gross margin, as compared to fiscal 2014, was the change in product mix associated with the acquisitions of novus, proteinsimple, and cyvek.we expect that, in the future, gross margins will continue to be impacted by the mix of our portfolio growing at different rates as well as future acquisitions.
segment gross margins, as a percentage of net sales, were as follows:
year ended june 30,

2016              2015              2014
biotechnology              78.3   %          76.9   %          78.0   %
clinical controls          41.4   %          40.4   %          39.8   %
protein platforms          61.1   %          57.8   %
consolidated               67.5   %          67.9   %          70.3   %
the biotechnology segment gross margin percentage for fiscal 2016 improved when compared to fiscal 2015 primarily due to less costs associated with the fair value inventory adjustment associated with acquisition accounting of prior acquisitions.
the clinical controls segment gross margin percentage for fiscal 2016 and 2015 was negatively impacted by purchase accounting and intangible asset amortization related to the acquisition of bionostics in july 2013 and cliniqa in july 2015. gross margin percentage improvements in fiscal 2016 when compared to fiscal 2015 was mostly driven by operational productivity.
selling, general and administrative expenses selling, general and administrative expenses increased $21.5 million (18%) and $58.7 million (97%) in fiscal 2016 and 2015, respectively.
the increase in fiscal 2016 was primarily the result of $5.4 million added as a result of the cliniqa acquisition, including $3.4 million of increased costs associated with stock based compensation. the remaining increase in selling, general and administrative expenses in fiscal 2016 included investments made in global commercial resources, administrative infrastructure, non-cash stock based compensation, and annual wage, salary and benefits increases.
selling, general and administrative expenses increased $58.7 million (97%) in fiscal 2015. the increase in fiscal 2015 was mainly the result of the acquisitions of novus, proteinsimple, and cyvek including $37.1 million of selling, general and administrative expenses by the acquired companies and an increase of $10.5 million of intangible amortization compared to fiscal 2014. selling, general and administrative expenses in fiscal 2015 also included $4.5 million of acquisition related professional fees. the remaining increase in selling, general and administrative expenses in fiscal 2015 included investments made in global commercial resources, administrative infrastructure, non-cash stock based compensation, and annual wage, salary and benefits increases.

off-balance sheet arrangements the company is not a party to any off-balance sheet transactions, arrangements or obligations that have, or are reasonably likely to have, a current or future material effect on the company's financial condition, changes in the financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.
critical accounting policies management's discussion and analysis of the company's financial condition and results of operations are based upon the company's consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america (u.s. gaap). the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. on an ongoing basis, management evaluates its estimates. management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
the company has identified the policies outlined below as critical to its business operations and an understanding of results of operations. the listing is not intended to be a comprehensive list of all accounting policies; investors should also refer to note a to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k .
valuation of available-for-sale investments the company considers all of its marketable securities available-for-sale and reports them at fair market value. fair market values are based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability in the principal or most advantageous market. unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale investments are excluded from income, but are included, net of taxes, in other comprehensive income. if an "other-than-temporary" impairment is determined to exist, the difference between the value of the investment recorded in the financial statements and the company's current estimate of fair value is recognized as a charge to earnings in the period in which the impairment is determined. net unrealized losses on available-for-sale investments at june 30, 2016 were $5.5 million.
valuation of inventory inventories are stated at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out method) or market. the company regularly reviews inventory on hand for slow-moving and obsolete inventory, inventory not meeting quality control standards and inventory subject to expiration.
to meet strict customer quality standards, the company has established a highly controlled manufacturing process for proteins, antibodies and its chemically-based products. these products require the initial manufacture of multiple batches to determine if quality standards can be consistently met. in addition, the company will produce larger batches of established products than current sales requirements due to economies of scale. the manufacturing process for these products, therefore, has and will continue to produce quantities in excess of forecasted usage. the company values its manufactured protein and antibody inventory based on a two-year forecast and its chemically-based products on a five-year forecast. the establishment of a two-year or five-year forecast requires considerable judgment. inventory quantities in excess of the forecast are not valued due to uncertainty over salability. the value of protein, antibody and chemically-based product inventory not valued at june 30, 2016 was $24 million.
31
the fair value of inventory purchased through acquisitions was determined based on quantities acquired, selling prices at the date of acquisition and management's assumptions regarding inventory having future value and the costs to sell such inventories. inventory purchased in fiscal 2016 through the acquisition of cliniqa was increased $0.9 million inventory purchased in fiscal 2015 through the acquisitions of novus biologicals, proteinsimple, and cyvek was increased $4.1 million, $1.4 million and $0.1 million respectively. the increase in value of the fiscal 2015 acquired inventory remaining at june 30, 2015 was $2.3 million for novus biologicals. substantially all of proteinsimple and cyvek acquired inventory was sold as of june 30, 2015.
inventory purchased in fiscal 2014 through the acquisition of bionostics and primegene was increased $1.7 million to $5.7 million and $0.8 million to $1.0 million, respectively. substantially all of bionostics and primegene acquired inventory was sold as of june 30, 2015.
valuation of intangible assets and goodwill when a business is acquired, the purchase price is allocated, as applicable, between tangible assets, identifiable intangible assets and goodwill. determining the portion of the purchase price allocated to intangible assets requires significant estimates. the fair value of intangible assets acquired, including developed technologies, trade names, customer relationships and non-compete agreements, were based on management's forecasted cash inflows and outflows using a relief-from-royalty and multi-period excess earnings method with consideration to other factors including an independent valuation of management's assumptions. intangible assets are being amortized over their estimated useful lives, ranging from 3 to 20 years. the company reviews the carrying amount of intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. intangible assets, net of accumulated amortization, were $311 million at june 30, 2016.
goodwill recognized in connection with a business acquisition represents the excess of the aggregate purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired. goodwill is tested for impairment annually or more frequently if changes in circumstance or the occurrence of events suggest impairment exists. assessing the impairment of goodwill requires the company to make judgments regarding the fair value of the net assets of its reporting units and the allocation of the carrying amount of shared assets to the reporting units. the company's annual assessment included a qualitative assessment of whether it is more-likely-than-not that a reporting unit's fair value is less than its carrying value. a significant change in the company's market capitalization or in the carrying amount of net assets of a reporting unit could result in an impairment charge in future periods. the company completed its annual impairment testing of goodwill and concluded that no impairment existed as of june 30, 2016, as the fair values of the company's reporting units exceeded their carrying values. goodwill at june 30, 2016 was $431 million.
valuation of investments the company has made equity investments in several start-up and early development stage companies, including cyvek in fiscal 2014. the accounting treatment of each investment (cost method or equity method) is dependent upon a number of factors, including, but not limited to, the company's share in the equity of the investee and the company's ability to exercise significant influence over the operating and financial policies of the investee. in determining which accounting treatment to apply, the company must make judgments based upon the quantitative and qualitative aspects of the investment.
the company periodically assesses its equity investments for impairment. development stage companies of the type the company has invested in are dependent on their ability to raise additional funds to continue research and development efforts and on receiving patent protection and/or fda clearance to market their products. if such funding were unavailable or inadequate to fund operations or if patent protection or fda clearance were not received, the company would potentially recognize an impairment loss to the extent of its remaining net investment.

management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (md&a)
presentation the consolidated financial statements of general electric company (the company) combine the industrial manufacturing and services businesses of general electric company (ge) with the financial services businesses of ge capital global holdings, llc (ge capital or financial services) and its predecessor, general electric capital corporation.
we believe that investors will gain a better understanding of our company if they understand how we measure and talk about our results. because of the diversity in our businesses, we present our financial statements in a three-column format, which allows investors to see our industrial operations separately from our financial services operations. we believe that this provides useful information to investors. when used in this report, unless otherwise indicated by the context, we use the terms to mean the following:
·   general electric or the company - the parent company, general electric company.

·   ge - the adding together of all affiliates except ge capital, whose continuing operations are presented on a one-line basis, giving effect to the elimination of transactions among such affiliates. transactions between ge and ge capital have not been eliminated at the ge level. we present the results of ge in the center column of our consolidated statements of earnings, financial position and cash flows. an example of a ge metric is ge cash from operating activities (ge cfoa).

·   general electric capital corporation or gecc - predecessor to ge capital global holdings, llc.

·   ge capital global holdings, llc or gecgh - the adding together of all affiliates of gecgh, giving effect to the elimination of transactions among such affiliates.

·   ge capital or financial services - refers to gecgh, or its predecessor gecc, and is the adding together of all affiliates of ge capital giving effect to the elimination of transactions among such affiliates. we present the results of ge capital in the right-side column of our consolidated statements of earnings, financial position and cash flows.

·   ge consolidated - the adding together of ge and ge capital, giving effect to the elimination of transactions between the two. we present the results of ge consolidated in the left-side column of our consolidated statements of earnings, financial position and cash flows.

·   industrial - ge excluding the continuing operations of ge capital. we believe that this provides investors with a view as to the results of our industrial businesses and corporate items. an example of an industrial metric is industrial cfoa (non-gaap), which is ge cfoa excluding the effects of dividends from ge capital.

·   industrial segment - the sum of our seven industrial reporting segments, without giving effect to the elimination of transactions among such segments and between these segments and our financial services segment. this provides investors with a view as to the results of our industrial segments, without inter-segment eliminations and corporate items. an example of an industrial segment metric is industrial segment revenue growth.

·   total segment - the sum of our seven industrial segments and one financial services segment, without giving effect to the elimination of transactions between such segments. this provides investors with a view as to the results of all of our segments, without inter-segment eliminations and corporate items.

·   verticals or ge capital verticals - the adding together of ge capital businesses that we expect to retain, principally its vertical financing businesses-ge capital aviation services (gecas), energy financial services (efs) and industrial finance (which includes healthcare equipment finance, working capital solutions and industrial financing solutions)-that relate to the company's core industrial domain and other operations, including our run-off insurance activities, and allocated corporate costs.

we integrate acquisitions as quickly as possible. revenues and earnings from the date we complete the acquisition through the end of the fourth quarter following the acquisition are considered the acquisition effect of such businesses.
discussion of ge capital's total assets includes deferred income tax liabilities, which are presented within assets for purposes of our consolidated statement of financial position presentations for this filing.
amounts reported in billions in graphs within this report are computed based on the amounts in millions. as a result, the sum of the components reported in billions may not equal the total amount reported in billions due to rounding.  certain columns and rows within the tables may not add due to the use of rounded numbers. percentages presented are calculated from the underlying numbers in millions.
discussions throughout this md&a are based on continuing operations unless otherwise noted.
the md&a should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes to the consolidated financial statements.

consolidated revenues increased $6.3 billion, or 5%, primarily driven by increased industrial revenues of $6.6 billion and increased financial services revenues of $0.1 billion, partially offset by an increase in eliminations between industrial and financial services of $0.4 billion. the overall foreign currency impact on consolidated revenues was a decrease of $1.3 billion.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                consolidated continuing earnings increased $7.5 billion, primarily driven by decreased financial services losses of $6.7 billion, increased industrial continuing earnings of $0.5 billion and a net decrease of $0.2 billion resulting from income taxes, and interest and other financial charges. the overall foreign currency impact on consolidated earnings was a decrease of $0.3 billion.
· industrial revenues increased $6.6 billion, or 6% due to increased industrial segment revenues of $4.4 billion, or 4%, as increases at power, renewable energy, aviation and healthcare were partially offset by decreases at oil &amp; gas, transportation and energy connections &amp; lighting. this increase in industrial segment revenues was primarily driven by the net effects of acquisitions of $11.2 billion, offset by the net effects of dispositions of $5.6 billion and the effects of a stronger u.s. dollar of $0.8 billion. excluding the effects of acquisitions, dispositions and translational currency exchange, industrial segment organic revenues* decreased $0.5 billion.   · industrial earnings increased $0.5 billion due to increased earnings at corporate of $0.8 billion, or 17%, as current year gains were $1.9 billion higher and pension costs were $0.7 billion lower than 2015. these increases to earnings were partially offset by $1.8 billion of higher restructuring and other charges.
industrial revenues increased an additional $2.2 billion at corporate as current year gains were $1.9 billion higher than 2015 gains.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    industrial earnings decreased due to decreased industrial segment earnings of $0.4 billion, or 2%, as decreases at oil &amp; gas, energy connections &amp; lighting, and transportation were partially offset by increases at aviation, power, healthcare and renewable energy. this decrease in industrial segment earnings, was primarily driven by decreases in organic operating profit* of $0.8 billion and the net effect of dispositions of $0.5 billion, partially offset by the net effect of acquisitions of $0.9 billion.
· financial services revenues increased $0.1 billion, or 1%, primarily due to lower impairments, higher gains and the effects of acquisitions, partially offset by organic revenue declines, the effects of dispositions and the effects of translational currency exchange.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             · financial services losses decreased $6.7 billion, or 84%, primarily due to the absence of the 2015 charges associated with the ge capital exit plan.
· in addition to the effects on net earnings described above, earnings per share amounts were also positively impacted by the reduction in number of outstanding common shares compared to 2015. the average number of shares outstanding used to calculate 2016 earnings per share amounts was 9% lower than 2015, primarily due to the 2015 synchrony financial share exchange and ongoing share buyback activities funded in large part by dividends from ge capital.

consolidated revenues increased $0.2 billion, primarily driven by increased industrial revenues of $0.4 billion and a decrease in eliminations between industrial and financial services of $0.4 billion, partially offset by decreased financial services revenues of $0.5 billion. the overall foreign currency impact on consolidated revenues was a decrease of $4.9 billion.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  consolidated continuing earnings decreased $7.9 billion, or 83%, primarily driven by decreased financial services net earnings of $9.2 billion, partially offset by an increase in industrial continuing earnings of $1.3 billion. the overall foreign currency impact on consolidated earnings was a decrease of $0.6 billion.
· industrial revenues increased $0.4 billion due an increase at corporate of $1.3 billion, or 75%, as 2015 gains were $1.4 billion higher than 2014 year gains.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    · industrial earnings increased 1.3 billion, or 11%, due to increased industrial segment earnings of $0.2 billion, or 1%, as increases at aviation, energy connections &amp; lighting, transportation and power were partially offset by decreases at oil &amp; gas, renewable energy and healthcare. this increase in industrial segment earnings was primarily driven by increases in organic operating profit* of $1.2 billion, partially offset by the translational currency exchange effects of a stronger u.s. dollar of $0.7 billion, net acquisitions of $0.1 billion and net dispositions of $0.2 billion.
this was offset by decreases in industrial segment revenues of $0.9 billion, or 1%, as decreases at oil &amp; gas, healthcare and renewable energy were partially offset by increases at power, aviation, energy connections &amp; lighting and transportation. the $0.9 billion decrease in industrial segment revenues was primarily driven by the translational effects of a stronger u.s. dollar of $4.8 billion and the net effects of dispositions of $1.1 billion, partially offset by the net effects of acquisitions of $2.2 billion. excluding the effects of acquisitions, dispositions and currency exchange, industrial segment organic revenues* increased by $2.8 billion, or 3%.   industrial earnings at corporate increased an additional $1.1 billion, or 18%, as 2015 gains were $1.4 billion higher than 2014 gains, partially offset by $0.5 billion of higher principal retirement plan costs in 2015.
· financial services revenues decreased $0.5 billion, or 5%, primarily due to organic revenue declines, primarily resulting from lower ending net investment (eni), lower gains and higher impairments, partially offset by the effects of acquisitions and dispositions.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          · financial services net earnings decreased $9.2 billion, primarily due to 2015 charges associated with the ge capital exit plan.

ge capital ge capital results include continuing operations, which are reported in the capital segment (see segment discussion), and discontinued operations (see discontinued operations section and note 2).
the ge capital exit plan on april 10, 2015, the company announced a plan (the ge capital exit plan) to create a simple, more valuable company by reducing the size of its financial services businesses through the sale of most of the assets of ge capital over the following 24 months and aligning a smaller ge capital with ge's industrial businesses.
under the ge capital exit plan, the company is retaining certain ge capital businesses, principally its vertical financing businesses-ge capital aviation services (gecas), energy financial services (efs) and industrial finance (which includes healthcare equipment finance, working capital solutions and industrial financing solutions)-that relate to the company's core industrial domain and other operations, including our run-off insurance activities, and allocated corporate costs (together referred to as ge capital verticals or verticals).
as a result of the ge capital exit plan dispositions, ge capital has paid $24.4 billion in dividends to ge in 2015 and 2016 ($4.3 billion and $20.1 billion, respectively). we expect ge capital to release additional dividends of up to approximately $10 billion through the remainder of the plan. in january 2017, ge received an additional $2.0 billion of common dividends from ge capital. as of december 31, 2016, we are ahead of our plan, having signed agreements with buyers for $197 billion of ending net investment (eni), excluding liquidity (as originally reported at december 31, 2014), of which $190 billion has closed. as of december 31, 2016, we have substantially completed the dispositions related to the ge capital exit plan. in addition, as part of our initiative to reduce the size of our financial services businesses, we completed the split-off of our remaining interest in ge capital's north american retail finance business, synchrony financial, to holders of ge common stock, which resulted in a $20.4 billion buyback of ge common stock (671.4 million shares) in 2015. in connection with the ge capital exit plan, we completed a legal reorganization of ge capital that included a merger of ge capital into ge, a guarantee by ge of ge capital debt, and an exchange of $36 billion of ge capital debt for new notes guaranteed by ge. the result of all these actions reduced ge capital's total assets by 63% from $500 billion at december 31, 2014 to $183 billion at december 31, 2016. from inception of plan through december 31, 2016, we incurred charges of $22.0 billion. due to anticipated tax benefits and gains, we do not expect total after-tax charges through the completion of the ge capital exit plan to exceed our initial $23 billion estimate.
on march 31, 2016, ge filed its request to the financial stability oversight council (fsoc) for rescission of ge capital's designation as a nonbank systemically important financial institution (sifi). on june 28, 2016, the fsoc rescinded ge capital's designation as a nonbank sifi.
sales agreements during 2016, ge signed agreements to sell approximately $40 billion of eni, excluding liquidity (as originally reported at december 31, 2014), of which approximately $19 billion, $21 billion and less than $1 billion related to our commercial lending and leasing (cll), consumer and real estate businesses, respectively.
sales representing approximately $86 billion of eni, excluding liquidity (as originally reported at december 31, 2014) closed during 2016, including approximately $70 billion, $16 billion and less than $1 billion related to our cll, consumer and real estate businesses, respectively.

after-tax charges related to the ge capital exit plan during 2016, ge recorded less than $0.1 billion of after-tax charges related to the ge capital exit plan of which $0.7 billion of net benefits were recorded in continuing operations and $0.7 billion of after-tax charges were recorded in discontinued operations. a description of these after-tax charges for 2016 is provided below.
·   $1.3 billion of net loss primarily related to the completed and planned dispositions of consumer and most of the cll businesses, which was recorded in discontinued operations under the caption "earnings (loss) from discontinued operations, net of taxes" in the statement of earnings.

·   $0.3 billion of charges associated with the preferred equity exchange that was completed in january 2016, which was recorded in continuing operations and reported in ge capital's corporate component under the caption "preferred stock dividends" in the statement of earnings.

·   these charges were offset by tax benefits of $1.4 billion primarily related to increased tax efficiency of planned cash repatriations through increased foreign tax credit utilization of $0.8 billion and an irs tax settlement of $0.6 billion. of these benefits $1.1 billion was recorded in continuing operations and reported in ge capital's corporate component under the caption "benefit (provision) for income taxes" in the statement of earnings and $0.2 billion was recorded in discontinued operations under the caption "earnings (loss) from discontinued operations, net of taxes" in the statement of earnings.

for additional information about the ge capital exit plan 2015 sales agreements and after-tax charges, refer to our form 8-k filed on june 3, 2016 related to the annual report on form 10-k for the year ended december 31, 2015.
in addition to the above charges, during the year ended december 31, 2016, we have incurred other costs related to our ongoing liability management actions, including $0.6 billion of pre-tax losses related to the repurchase of $12.5 billion of long-term unsecured debt and subordinated debentures which were recorded in continuing operations.

segment operations segment changes
·   beginning in the third quarter of 2016, the former energy connections and appliances &amp; lighting segments are presented as one reporting segment called energy connections &amp; lighting. this segment includes historical results of the appliances business prior to its sale in june 2016.

revenues and profit segment revenues include revenues and other income related to the segment.
segment profit is determined based on internal performance measures used by the chief executive officer (ceo) to assess the performance of each business in a given period. in connection with that assessment, the ceo may exclude matters such as charges for restructuring; rationalization and other similar expenses; acquisition costs and other related charges; technology and product development costs; certain gains and losses from acquisitions or dispositions; and litigation settlements or other charges, for which responsibility preceded the current management team. for additional information about costs excluded from segment profit, see corporate items and eliminations section within this md&a.
segment profit excludes results reported as discontinued operations and material accounting changes. segment profit also excludes the portion of earnings or loss attributable to noncontrolling interests of consolidated subsidiaries, and as such only includes the portion of earnings or loss attributable to our share of the consolidated earnings or loss of consolidated subsidiaries.
segment profit excludes or includes interest and other financial charges and income taxes according to how a particular segment's management is measured:
·   interest and other financial charges, income taxes and ge preferred stock dividends are excluded in determining segment profit (which we sometimes refer to as "operating profit") for the industrial segments.

·   interest and other financial charges, income taxes and ge capital preferred stock dividends are included in determining segment profit (which we sometimes refer to as "net earnings") for the capital segment.

certain corporate costs, such as shared services, employee benefits and information technology are allocated to our segments based on usage. a portion of the remaining corporate costs is allocated based on each segment's relative net cost of operations.
with respect to the segment revenue and profit walks, the overall effect of foreign exchange is included within multiple captions as follows:
·   the translational foreign exchange impact is included within foreign exchange.

·   the transactional impact of foreign exchange hedging is included in operating cost within productivity and in other income within other.

significant segment developments alstom acquisition on november 2, 2015, we completed the acquisition of alstom's thermal, renewables and grid businesses, resulting in two months of activity in 2015 results and a full year of activity in 2016 results. the completion of the transaction followed the regulatory approval of the deal in over 20 countries and regions including the eu, u.s., china, india, japan and brazil. the cash purchase price was €9.2 billion (approximately $10.1 billion), net of cash acquired. the acquisition and alliances with alstom affected our power, energy connections & lighting and renewable energy segments, and to a lesser extent our oil & gas segment.
at year-end 2015, our preliminary allocation of purchase price resulted in recognition of approximately $13.5 billion of goodwill, $5.2 billion of intangible assets, and $1.1 billion of unfavorable customer contract liabilities. the preliminary fair value of the associated noncontrolling interest was approximately $3.6 billion. as of the end of 2016, the amount of goodwill, intangible assets and unfavorable customer contract liabilities recognized was adjusted to approximately $17.3 billion, $4.4 billion, and $2.7 billion, respectively. the adjustments reflected revisions in estimates primarily related to cash flows and other valuation assumptions for customer contracts, increases to legal reserves, and other fair value adjustments related to acquired assets and liabilities. deferred taxes, unrecognized tax benefits and other tax uncertainties were also adjusted under applicable accounting rules. we finalized our purchase accounting analysis in the fourth quarter of 2016. see note 8 to the consolidated financial statements for further information.
for the year ended december 31, 2016, alstom contributed revenues of $13.0 billion and an operating loss of $0.3 billion, of which $0.8 billion of profit is included in the segment results and $1.0 billion of charges is included in corporate, primarily related to purchase accounting and acquisition related charges. including the effects of tax benefits of $0.8 billion, net earnings were $0.4 billion for the year ended december 31, 2016. in addition, alstom used cash flows from operating activities of $0.3 billion for the year ended december 31, 2016. alstom related revenues and operating profit are presented separately in the segment revenues and profit walks that follow.
sale of appliances on january 15, 2016, we announced the signing of an agreement to sell our appliances business to haier. on june 6, 2016, we completed the sale for proceeds of $5.6 billion (including $0.8 billion from the sale of receivables originated in our appliances business and sold from ge capital to haier) and recognized an after-tax gain of $1.8 billion in 2016.

2016 - 2015 commentary
· industrial segment revenues increased $4.4 billion, or 4%, primarily driven by increases at power and renewable energy, mainly due to the effects of the alstom acquisition, and an organic increase at renewable energy. this increase in industrial segment revenues was partially offset by lower revenues at oil &amp; gas and transportation, including the effects of foreign currency exchange of $0.3 billion at oil &amp; gas.
· industrial segment acquisition revenues, driven by alstom, also positively affected energy connections &amp; lighting, however, this was mostly offset by the effects of disposition revenues related to the sale of appliances in the second quarter of 2016 and sales of meters, intelligent platforms embedded systems products and signaling businesses in 2015.
· industrial segment profit decreased $0.4 billion, or 2%, mainly driven by lower earnings organically at oil &amp; gas and energy connections &amp; lighting, as well as an unfavorable impact of foreign exchange, partially offset by higher earnings at aviation, power, healthcare and renewable energy.
· industrial segment operating profit margin decreased 90 bps to 15.6%, primarily driven by the effects of alstom results. excluding alstom*, industrial segment operating profit margin was 16.8%, compared with 17.0% in 2015, reflecting core decreases at power, oil &amp; gas and energy connections &amp; lighting, that more than offset increases at aviation, healthcare and transportation.
2015 - 2014 commentary

· industrial segment revenues decreased $0.9 billion, or 1%, primarily driven by decreases at oil &amp; gas, mainly related to the effects of foreign currency exchange and a decrease at oil &amp; gas organically. this decrease was partially offset by higher revenues at power, energy connections &amp; lighting, and aviation, mainly as a result of organic increases, as well as the effects of the alstom acquisition at power and energy connections &amp; lighting, partially offset by the effects of dispositions related to the sale of intelligent platforms embedded systems products and wayne in 2015.
· industrial segment profit increased $0.2 billion, or 1%, mainly driven by higher earnings at aviation, energy connections &amp; lighting and transportation, partially offset by lower earnings at oil &amp; gas and renewable energy, as well as an unfavorable impact of foreign exchange.
· industrial segment operating profit margin increased 30 bps to 16.5% primarily driven by aviation and transportation, partially offset by the effects of the alstom acquisition. excluding alstom*, industrial segment operating profit margin was 17.0%, compared with 16.2% in 2014, reflecting core increases at power and energy connections &amp; lighting.

·   renewable energy has experienced a surge of development in the last decade. renewable energy capacity additions account for approximately half of all power plant additions worldwide.

·   the market to "repower" existing wind turbines - i.e., upgrade units that have been in service for a number of years to increase their efficiency and performance - is growing as the existing onshore wind turbine fleet is aging. repowering allows customers to increase the annual energy output of their installed base, provide more competitively priced energy, and extend the life of their assets.

·   new product introductions continue to be a key lever as our customers show a willingness to invest in new technology that decreases the levelized cost of energy.

·   the $1.7 billion planned acquisition of lm wind power will bolster the ability of the ge onshore and offshore wind businesses to add value for customers while in-sourcing production and also better serve the customers of lm wind power.

·   in 2016, we introduced new software applications suite for the digital wind farm. the new apps, which streamline wind farm operations, are compatible with the company's latest 2 and 3 mw wind turbine platforms and ge's broader predix software and diagnostics platform. the new applications can reduce maintenance costs by up to 10 percent and deliver one-to-three percent of additional revenue per site.

·   the offshore wind business supported its customer, deepwater wind, in bringing the first ever offshore wind farm - the 30mw block island wind farm near rhode island - into commercial operation in the u.s.

·   continued competitive pressure from other wind turbine producers, as well as from other energy sources such as primarily solar photovoltaic, reinforced by a general move to auction mechanisms, increases price pressure and the need for innovation in the wind market.

segment revenues up $2.8 billion (44%);
segment profit up $0.1 billion (34%) as a result of:
· the increase in revenues was due to higher volume, mainly driven by higher core equipment sales at onshore wind as a result of shipping 420 more onshore wind turbines than in the prior year, as well as higher sales at hydro, driven by the effects of the alstom acquisition. the increase was partially offset by lower other income, including negative foreign exchange transactional hedge impacts, and lower prices.
· the increase in profit was due to material deflation and higher volume, driven primarily by onshore wind, partially offset by lower other income, including negative foreign exchange transactional hedge impacts, lower prices and an unfavorable business mix, driven by low margin projects with higher services margins.

significant trends &amp; developments

energy connections
·   we are continuing to see growth in renewable energy industries, specifically wind &amp; solar industries, which is driving demand in our power conversion business for equipment and services. this growth is offset by the decline in the oil &amp; gas industry.

·   we see soft demand in the north american and european electrical distribution market, and continued soft demand in other parts of the developed world. there are signs of market improvements in china, but the asia pacific region has mixed results.

·   the u.s. electrical grid capacity is high and load growth is expected to be slow in the near term; spending by utilities in the u.s. continues to be focused more heavily on sustaining operations versus capital investment.

·   integrating large shares of renewables will require strengthening of the grid and ensuring the availability of power plants to dispatch at short notice; these system integration tools may present further business opportunities, and will be needed to pave the way for further decarbonization.

·   in december 2016, we announced our plan to sell our industrial solutions business.

·   the intelligent platforms embedded systems products business of automation &amp; control was sold in december 2015 for approximately $0.5 billion and the electricity meters business of grid solutions was sold in december 2015 for approximately $0.2 billion.

lighting
·   in the last decade, the lighting industry has seen a major technology pivot away from traditional lighting products, including incandescent, halogen and specialty linear fluorescent lamps to energy-saving leds. that shift has been supported by the u.s. government phasing out incandescent bulbs and declining prices overall for leds. we estimate half of all residential sockets in the u.s. will convert to led by 2020. this shift aligns with our led focus.

·   in 2016, ge lighting and current both made strategic organizational changes to help reduce costs, focus on key markets and simplify the businesses.

appliances
·   in june 2016, we completed the sale of our appliances business to haier for $5.6 billion (including $0.8 billion from the sale of receivables originated in our appliances business and sold from ge capital to haier), on which we recognized an after-tax gain of $1.8 billion, which is reported in corporate.

segment revenues down $1.2 billion (7%);
segment profit down $0.6 billion (67%) as a result of:
· energy connections revenues increased driven by the effects of alstom, including higher equipment sales at grid, partially offset by core decreases at industrial solutions and power conversion. the increase in revenues was partially offset by lower prices, the effects of a stronger u.s. dollar, and lower other income, including the negative foreign exchange transactional hedge impacts. lighting revenues decreased primarily due to lower traditional lighting sales and were partially offset by increases in led revenues and non-lighting product sales in current, as well as lower prices. revenues also decreased as a result of the sale of appliances in june 2016.
· energy connections profit decreased primarily as a result of lower cost productivity, driven by core volume decreases, as well as lower other income, including negative foreign exchange transactional hedge impacts, and an unfavorable business mix, partially offset by the effects of alstom. lighting profit decreased as a result of the investment in current, lower other income and lower prices, partially offset by material deflation. profit also decreased due to the sale of appliances in june 2016.

segment revenues up $0.6 billion (4%);
segment profit up $0.3 billion (39%) as a result of:
· energy connections revenues increased primarily due to higher sales at grid solutions, driven by the effects of the alstom acquisition, and a gain on the sale of a meters business, partially offset by the impact of a stronger u.s. dollar and lower volume at industrial solutions. appliance revenues increased as a result of higher volume, partially offset by lower prices. lighting revenues decreased as lower traditional lighting sales were partially offset by increases in led revenues, lower prices and the impact of a stronger u.s. dollar, partially offset by gains on asset sales.
· energy connections profit increased primarily due to higher productivity, including a reduction in sg&amp;a, partially offset by the impact of a stronger u.s. dollar. appliances profit increased due to improved productivity, including the effects of classifying appliances as a business held for sale, partially offset by lower prices. lighting profit decreased as a result of lower prices, partially offset by material deflation.

products &amp; services capital is the financial services division of ge focused on customers and markets aligned with ge's industrial businesses, whether in developed economies or emerging markets. we provide financial products and services around the globe that are geared to utilize ge's industry specific expertise in aviation, energy, infrastructure, and healthcare to capitalize on market-specific opportunities. in addition, we continue to operate our run-off insurance activities as part of our continuing operations. our expertise, domain knowledge, and deep relationships create an environment for new hospitals to obtain necessary equipment, cities to function more safely, and transportation networks to deliver people, goods, and services on time. we are the capital in the ge store. products and services include:
·   industrial finance (if) - provides exclusive equipment financing solutions globally for the ge industrial businesses. in addition, its working capital solutions business provides critical working capital services to ge to help optimize cash management.

·   energy financial services (efs) - a global energy investor that provides world class financial solutions and underwriting capabilities for power, renewable energy, and oil &amp; gas to meet rising demand and sustainability imperatives. efs invests in long-lived, capital intensive energy projects and companies by providing structured equity, debt, leasing, partnership financing, project finance and broad-based commercial finance.

·   ge capital aviation services (gecas) - offers commercial aircraft leasing, financing, services, and consulting with the industry's broadest range of business solutions.

as a result of the ge capital exit plan, ge capital's real estate business, consumer business and most of its commercial lending and leasing (cll) business are classified as discontinued operations and are no longer reported as part of the capital segment. as such, all comparative prior period information has been reclassified to reflect real estate, consumer and most of cll as discontinued operations. as of december 31, 2016, we have substantially completed the dispositions related to the ge capital exit plan.
competition &amp; regulation

the businesses in which we engage are subject to competition from various types of financial institutions, including commercial banks, investment banks, leasing companies, independent finance companies, finance companies associated with manufacturers and insurance and reinsurance companies.
with the rescission of its designation as a nonbank sifi in june 2016, ge capital's activities are no longer subject to the consolidated supervision of the federal reserve or subject to the enhanced prudential standards set forth in the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act and its implementing regulations, including minimum regulatory capital and liquidity requirements, submission of annual resolution plans, the volcker rule and regulatory reporting requirements.
ge capital's international operations are consolidated under ge capital international holdings limited, a wholly owned subsidiary of ge capital. ge capital international holdings limited continues to maintain its own capital structure and is supervised on a consolidated basis by the u.k. prudential regulation authority (pra). the pra's supervision includes capital and liquidity standards that could impact ge capital's ability to pay dividends to ge. we expect to exit the pra's consolidated supervision in 2017.

2016 - 2015 commentary revenues and other income increased $1.8 billion, primarily a result of:
·   $2.4 billion of higher net gains from disposed and held for sale businesses, which included a $3.1 billion gain from the sale of our appliances business to haier and a $0.4 billion gain from the sale of ge asset management to state street corporation in 2016, partially offset by a $0.1 billion impairment charge related to a potential sale of a non-strategic platform in our aviation business in 2016. gains on disposed or held for sale businesses in 2015 included a $0.6 billion gain from the sale of our signaling business, and a $0.2 billion break-up fee paid by electrolux ab due to the termination of the agreement to acquire the ge appliances business.

these increases to revenues and other income was partially offset by the following:
·   $0.5 billion lower other income from a settlement related to the nbcu transaction in 2015, and

·   $0.4 billion of higher inter-segment eliminations.

operating costs decreased $0.9 billion, primarily as a result of:
·   $2.4 billion of higher net gains from disposed and held for sale businesses, which included a $3.1 billion gain from the sale of our appliances business to haier and a $0.4 billion gain from the sale of ge asset management to state street corporation in 2016, partially offset by a $0.1 billion impairment charge related to a potential sale of a non-strategic platform in our aviation business in 2016. gains in 2015 included a $0.6 billion gain from the sale of our signaling business, and a $0.2 billion break-up fee paid by electrolux ab due to the termination of the agreement to acquire the ge appliances business, and

·   $0.7 billion of lower costs associated with our principal retirement plans including the effects of higher discount rates.

these decreases to operating costs were partially offset by the following:
·   $1.8 billion higher restructuring and other charges, which included $0.7 billion of higher restructuring and other charges associated with the alstom acquisition, and

·   $0.5 billion lower other income due to a non-repeat of a settlement related to the nbcu transaction in the second quarter of 2015.

2015 - 2014 commentary revenues and other income increased $1.7 billion, primarily a result of:
·   $1.0 billion of higher gains from disposed or held for sale businesses, which included a $0.2 billion break-up fee paid by electrolux ab due to the termination of the agreement to acquire the ge appliances business,

·   $0.5 billion higher other income from a settlement related to the nbcu transaction in 2015, and

·   $0.2 billion of lower eliminations and other, which was driven by $0.4 billion of lower inter-segment eliminations, partially offset by $0.2 billion lower licensing, ge asset management fees and other income.

operating costs decreased $1.1 billion, primarily as a result of:
·   $1.0 billion of higher gains from disposed businesses, which included a $0.2 billion break-up fee paid by electrolux ab due to termination of the agreement to acquire the ge appliances business,

·   $0.5 billion higher other income from a settlement related to the nbcu transaction in 2015, and

·   lower headquarter functional costs offset by higher investment in information technology (it) growth initiatives.

these decreases to operating costs were partially offset by $0.4 billion of higher costs associated with our principal retirement plans including the effects of lower discount rates and updated mortality assumptions.

restructuring restructuring actions are an essential component of our cost improvement efforts to both existing operations and those recently acquired. restructuring and other charges relate primarily to workforce reductions, facility exit costs associated with the consolidation of sales, service and manufacturing facilities, the integration of recent acquisitions, including alstom, and other asset write-downs. we continue to closely monitor the economic environment and may undertake further restructuring actions to more closely align our cost structure with earnings goals.

discontinued operations discontinued operations primarily relate to our financial services businesses as a result of the ge capital exit plan and include our consumer business, most of our cll business, our real estate business and u.s. mortgage business (wmc). all of these operations were previously reported in the capital segment.
we have entered into transitional service agreements (tsa) with and provided certain indemnifications to buyers of ge capital's assets. under the tsas, ge capital provides various services for terms generally between 12 and 24 months and receives a level of cost reimbursement from the buyers.
at december 31, 2016, we provided specific indemnifications to buyers of ge capital's assets that amounted to $2.6 billion, for which we have recognized related liabilities of $0.3 billion. in addition, in connection with the 2015 public offering and sale of synchrony financial, ge capital indemnified synchrony financial and its directors, officers, and employees against the liabilities of gecc's businesses other than historical liabilities of the businesses that are part of synchrony financial's ongoing operations.
as part of the ge capital exit plan, we entered into hedges (on an after-tax basis) of our net investment in businesses that we plan to dispose. these derivatives are treated as standalone hedges and the mark-to-market valuation changes on the derivatives are recorded in earnings of discontinued operations.
results of operations, financial position and cash flows for these businesses are separately reported as discontinued operations for all periods presented.

the 2016 loss from discontinued operations, net of taxes, primarily reflected the following:
·   $1.1 billion after-tax loss at our cll business (including $0.9 billion after-tax loss on planned disposals), and

·   $0.1 billion after-tax loss at our consumer business (including $0.3 billion after-tax loss on planned disposals).

·   2016 losses were partially offset by a $0.2 billion tax benefit related to an irs tax settlement in our discontinued insurance operations.

the 2015 loss from discontinued operations, net of taxes, primarily reflected the following:
·   $7.9 billion after-tax loss at our cll business (including $8.7 billion after-tax loss on planned disposals),

·   $2.0 billion after-tax loss at our real estate business (including $2.0 billion after-tax loss on planned disposals), and

·   $0.1 billion after-tax effect of incremental reserves related to retained representation and warranty obligations to repurchase previously sold loans on the 2007 sale of wmc.

·   2015 losses were partially offset by $2.5 billion after-tax earnings at our consumer business, primarily $3.4 billion after-tax gain on the split-off of synchrony financial, $0.5 billion after-tax gain on other transactions closed, partially offset by $0.8 billion after-tax loss on disposals and $0.6 billion after-tax loss from operations.

the 2014 earnings from discontinued operations, net of taxes, primarily reflected the following:
·   $3.2 billion of after-tax earnings from operations at our consumer business,

·   $1.8 billion of after-tax earnings from operations at our cll business,

·   $1.0 billion of after-tax earnings from operations at our real estate business, and

·   $0.1 billion tax benefit related to the extinguishment of our loss-sharing arrangement for excess interest claims associated with the 2008 sale of ge money japan.

·   2014 earnings were partially offset by a $0.2 billion after-tax loss on incremental reserves related to retained representation and warranty obligations to repurchase previously sold loans on the 2007 sale of wmc.

see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information related to discontinued operations.

other consolidated information interest and other financial charges interest on borrowings and other financial charges amounted to $5.0 billion, $3.5 billion and $2.7 billion in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.  the majority of our borrowings are in financial services, where interest expense was $3.8 billion, $2.3 billion and $1.6 billion in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.  included in interest expense were $0.6 billion, $0.2 billion and an insignificant amount of debt extinguishment costs in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.  ge capital average borrowings were $145.0 billion, $216.8 billion and $266.7 billion in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. the ge capital average composite effective interest rate (including interest allocated to discontinued operations) was 3.0% in 2016, 2.6% in 2015 and 2.6% in 2014.  the rate increase from 2015 to 2016 was primarily driven by debt extinguishment costs. excluding the effect of debt extinguishment costs, the ge capital average composite effective interest rate (including interest allocated to discontinued operations) was 2.6% in 2016, 2015 and 2014. in 2016, ge capital average assets continued to decrease in line with the ge capital exit plan. see the liquidity and borrowings section within the md&a for a discussion of liquidity, borrowings and interest rate risk management.
it is our policy to allocate capital interest expense that is either directly attributable or related to discontinued operations. the allocation is based on a market based leverage ratio, taking into consideration the underlying characteristics of the assets for the specific discontinued operations. interest expense that is associated with debt that is not assumed by the buyer or required to be repaid as a result of the disposal transaction is reflected in other continuing operations after the disposal occurs.

benefit plans cost   discount rates (december 31)             expected rate of return
2016 - 2015 commentary
·   postretirement benefit plans cost decreased $0.9 billion, primarily because of the effects of higher discount rates, lower service cost resulting from fewer active principal pension plans participants and lower loss amortization related to our principal pension plans.

·   we updated our mortality assumptions at december 31, 2016 based on guidance issued by the society of actuaries to reflect updated rates and methodology for future mortality improvements. the new mortality assumptions decreased our principal pension plans obligations by $0.6 billion at year-end 2016.

2015 - 2014 commentary
·   postretirement benefit plans cost increased $0.2 billion, primarily because of the effects of lower discount rates and new mortality assumptions, which were partially offset by lower loss amortization related to our principal pension plans and by changes to principal retiree benefit plans.

·   in 2015, we amended our principal retiree benefit plans affecting post-65 retiree health and retiree life insurance for certain production participants. these plan amendments reduced our principal postretirement benefit obligations by approximately $3.3 billion.

looking forward, our key assumptions affecting 2017 postretirement benefits costs are as follows:
·   discount rate at 4.11% for our principal pension plans, reflecting current long-term interest rates.

·   assumed long-term return on our principal pension plan assets of 7.5%.

we expect 2017 postretirement benefit plans cost to be about the same as 2016.

2016 - 2015 commentary
·   the ge pension plan deficit increased in 2016 primarily due to the growth in pension liabilities and lower discount rates, partially offset by investment performance and changes in mortality assumptions.

·   the increase in the underfunding of our other pension plans was primarily attributable to lower discount rates and liability growth, partially offset by investment performance and employer contributions.

·   the decrease in principal retiree benefit plans deficit was primarily attributable to employer contributions and lower costs from new healthcare supplier contracts, partially offset by the growth in retiree benefit liabilities.

the employee retirement income security act (erisa) determines minimum pension funding requirements in the u.s. we made a $0.3 billion contribution to the ge pension plan in 2016. we did not contribute to the ge pension plan in 2015. on an erisa basis, our preliminary estimate is that the ge pension plan was approximately 95% funded at january 1, 2017. the erisa funded status is higher than the gaap funded status (71% funded) primarily because the erisa prescribed interest rate is calculated using an average interest rate. as a result, the erisa interest rate is higher than the year-end gaap discount rate. the higher erisa interest rate lowers pension liabilities for erisa funding purposes. our current estimate projects $1.7 billion of pension funding contributions to the ge pension plan in 2017 and approximately $1.6 billion in 2018.

we expect to contribute $0.9 billion to our other pension plans in 2017, as compared to $0.8 billion in 2016 and $0.5 billion in 2015. ge capital is a member of certain ge pension plans. as a result of the ge capital exit plan, ge capital will have additional funding obligations for these pension plans. these obligations do not relate to the verticals and are recognized as an expense in ge capital's other continuing operations when they become probable and estimable. see the intercompany transactions between ge and ge capital section within the md&a for further information.
we also expect to contribute $0.5 billion to our principal retiree benefit plans in 2017 as compared to $0.4 billion in 2016 and $0.5 billion in 2015.
the funded status of our postretirement benefit plans and future effects on operating results depend on economic conditions, interest rates and investment performance. see the critical accounting estimates section within the md&a and notes 12 and 29 to the consolidated financial statements for further information about our benefit plans and the effects of this activity on our financial statements.
income taxes ge pays the income taxes it owes in every country in which it does business.  while ge and ge capital file a consolidated u.s. federal income tax return, many factors impact our income tax expense and cash tax payments.  the most significant factor is that we conduct business in approximately 180 countries and more than half of our revenue is earned outside the u.s., often in countries with lower tax rates than in the u.s.  we reinvest most of our foreign earnings overseas to be able to fund our active non-u.s. business operations.  our tax liability is also affected by u.s. and foreign tax incentives designed to encourage certain investments, like research and development; and by acquisitions, dispositions and tax law changes.  finally, our tax returns are routinely audited, and settlements of issues raised in these audits sometimes affect our tax rates.
ge and ge capital file a consolidated u.s. federal income tax return. this enables ge and ge capital to use tax deductions and credits of one member of the group to reduce the tax that otherwise would have been payable by another member of the group. the effective tax rate reflects the benefit of these tax reductions in the consolidated return. ge makes cash payments to ge capital for tax reductions and ge capital pays for tax increases at the time ge's tax payments are due.

2016 - 2015 commentary
·   the consolidated income tax rate for 2016 was (5.1)%. the effective tax rate was negative largely because of increased tax benefits from global operations including benefits from the repatriation of ge non-u.s. earnings, benefits of integrating our existing services business with alstom's services business and foreign tax credit planning at ge capital to reduce the tax cost of anticipated repatriations of foreign cash.

·   the decrease in the consolidated provision for income tax was attributable to the increased benefit from global operations and the non-repeat of the 2015 charges associated with the ge capital exit plan.

·   as discussed in note 14 to the consolidated financial statements, in 2015 in conjunction with the ge capital exit plan, we incurred tax expense of $6.3 billion related to expected repatriation of foreign earnings and write-off of deferred tax assets.

·   the consolidated tax provision includes $1.5 billion and $1.0 billion for ge (excluding ge capital) for 2015 and 2016, respectively.

2015 - 2014 commentary
·   the consolidated income tax rate for 2015 was greater than 35% due to charges associated with the ge capital exit plan.

·   the increase in the income tax expense is primarily due to the tax expense incurred as part of the ge capital exit plan.

·   the consolidated tax provision includes $1.6 billion and $1.5 billion for ge (excluding ge capital) for 2014 and 2015, respectively.

benefits from global operations absent the effects of the ge capital exit plan, our consolidated income tax provision is lower because of the benefits of lower-taxed global operations. there is a benefit from global operations as non-u.s. income is subject to local country tax rates that are significantly below the 35% u.s. statutory rate. these non-u.s. earnings have been indefinitely reinvested outside the u.s. and are not subject to current u.s. income tax. most of these earnings have been reinvested in active non-u.s. business operations and we do not intend to repatriate these earnings to fund u.s. operations. the rate of tax on our indefinitely reinvested non-u.s. earnings is below the 35% u.s. statutory tax rate because we have significant business operations subject to tax in countries where the tax on that income is lower than the u.s. statutory rate and because ge funds certain non-u.s. operations through foreign companies that are subject to low foreign taxes.
a substantial portion of the benefit related to business operations subject to tax in countries where the tax on that income is lower than the u.s. statutory rate is derived from our gecas aircraft leasing operations located in ireland, from our power operations located in switzerland and hungary, and our healthcare operations in europe.
we expect our ability to benefit from non-u.s. income taxed at less than the u.s. rate to continue, subject to changes in u.s. or foreign law. in addition, since this benefit depends on management's intention to indefinitely reinvest amounts outside the u.s., our tax provision will increase to the extent we no longer indefinitely reinvest foreign earnings.

2016 - 2015 commentary our benefit from lower-taxed global operations increased in 2016 because of the non-repeat of the 2015 tax expense associated with the ge capital exit plan and because of benefits from the repatriation of ge non-u.s. earnings, benefits of integrating our existing services business with alstom's services business and foreign tax credit planning at ge capital to reduce the tax cost of anticipated repatriations of foreign cash, all of which are included in "other" in the table above.

2015 - 2014 commentary our benefits from lower-taxed global operations decreased in 2015 because of the tax expense associated with the ge capital exit plan.
other information to the extent non-u.s. operating income increases, we would expect tax benefits to increase, subject to management's intention to indefinitely reinvest those earnings. included in 2015 is a tax expense of $6.1 billion related to the expected repatriation of foreign earnings and write-off of deferred tax assets in conjunction with the ge capital exit plan.
the tax benefit from non-u.s. income taxed at a local country rate rather than the u.s. statutory tax rate is reported in the caption "tax on global activities including exports" in the effective tax rate reconciliation in note 14 to the consolidated financial statements.
a more detailed analysis of differences between the u.s. federal statutory rate and the consolidated effective rate, as well as other information about our income tax provisions, is provided in the critical accounting estimates section within the md&a and note 14 to the consolidated financial statements. the nature of business activities and associated income taxes differ for ge and for ge capital; therefore, a separate analysis of each is presented in the paragraphs that follow.
ge effective tax rate (excluding ge capital earnings)
(dollars in billions)
we believe that the ge effective tax rate and provision for income taxes are best analyzed in relation to ge earnings before income taxes excluding the ge capital net earnings from continuing operations, as ge tax expense does not include taxes on ge capital earnings. for further information on this calculation, see the supplemental information section within the md&a.

2016 - 2015 commentary
·   the ge provision for income taxes decreased in 2016 because of increased benefits from lower-taxed global operations ($0.3 billion), including benefits from the repatriation of ge non-u.s. earnings and benefits of integrating our existing services business with alstom's services business.

·   the ge provision for income taxes also decreased due to increases in the benefit from deductible stock losses ($0.4 billion).

·   partially offsetting these decreases was a lower benefit of audit resolutions ($0.1 billion) shown below.

2015 - 2014 commentary
·   the ge provision for income taxes decreased in 2015 because of increased benefits from lower-taxed global operations ($0.2 billion), including benefits from integrating our existing services business with alstom's services business.

·   the ge provision for income taxes also decreased due to increases in the benefit of audit resolutions ($0.2 billion) shown below and deductible stock losses ($0.2 billion).

·   partially offsetting these decreases was an increase in income taxed at rates above the average tax rate ($0.5 billion).

resolution of audit matters reduced the ge provision for income taxes by $0.2 billion, $0.3 billion and $0.1 billion in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. the effects of such resolutions are included in the following captions in note 14 to the consolidated financial statements.

2016 - 2015 commentary
·   the decrease in the income tax expense for ge capital from an expense of $5.0 billion to a benefit of $1.4 billion is primarily due to the non-recurrence of the $6.3 billion tax expense, discussed in note 14 to the consolidated financial statements, related to the ge capital exit plan.

·   the ge capital tax expense also decreased in 2016 due to higher benefits from global operations including foreign tax credit planning to reduce the tax cost of anticipated repatriations of foreign cash.

2015 - 2014 commentary
·   the increase in the income tax expense from a benefit of $0.9 billion for 2014 to an expense of $5.0 billion for 2015 is primarily due to the tax expense, discussed in note 14 to the consolidated financial statements, related to the ge capital exit plan.

geographic data our global activities span all geographic regions and primarily encompass manufacturing for local and export markets, import and sale of products produced in other regions, leasing of aircraft, sourcing for our plants domiciled in other global regions and provision of financial services within these regional economies. thus, when countries or regions experience currency and/or economic stress, we often have increased exposure to certain risks, but also often have new opportunities that include, among other things, expansion of industrial activities through purchases of companies or assets at reduced prices and lower u.s. debt financing costs.
financial results of our non-u.s. activities reported in u.s. dollars are affected by currency exchange. we use a number of techniques to manage the effects of currency exchange, including selective borrowings in local currencies and selective hedging of significant cross-currency transactions. such principal currencies are the euro, the pound sterling, the brazilian real and the chinese renminbi.

revenues revenues are classified according to the region to which products and services are sold. for purposes of this analysis, the u.s. is presented separately from the remainder of the americas.

·   decreased revenues by $4.9 billion in 2015, primarily driven by the euro ($2.6 billion), the brazilian real ($0.9 billion) and the canadian dollar ($0.2 billion).

the effects of foreign currency fluctuations decreased earnings by $0.3 billion in 2016. the effects of foreign currency fluctuations decreased earnings in 2015 by $0.7 billion.

the decrease in total assets of non-u.s. operations on a continuing basis reflected a decrease primarily in europe driven by the strengthening of the u.s. dollar against the euro and pound sterling, coupled with a decrease in time deposits in line with debt maturities at ge capital.

foreign currency exposure as a result of our global operations, we generate and incur a significant portion of our revenues and expenses in currencies other than the u.s. dollar. such principal currencies are the euro, the pound sterling, the brazilian real and the chinese renminbi. the results of operating entities reported in currencies other than u.s. dollar are translated to the u.s. dollar at the applicable exchange rate for inclusion in the financial statements. we use a number of techniques to manage the effects of currency exchange, including selective borrowings in local currencies and selective hedging of significant cross-currency transactions. the foreign currency effect arising from operating activities outside of the u.s., including the remeasurement of derivatives, can result in significant transactional foreign currency fluctuations at points in time, but will generally be offset as the underlying hedged item is recognized in earnings. the effects of foreign currency fluctuations, excluding the earnings impact of the underlying hedged item, decreased net earnings for the year ended december 31, 2016 by $0.3 billion.
on june 23, 2016, a referendum in the united kingdom (u.k.) was approved to withdraw from the european union
. the referendum was advisory and the terms of any withdrawal are subject to a negotiation period that could last for two years after the u.k. government initiates the withdrawal process. the approval of the referendum had, and may continue to have, an impact on foreign currency exchange rates, among other things. we actively manage our exposure to the u.k. and do not anticipate a material economic impact from our currency exposure as a result of the recent decision by the u.k. to exit the european union.
see notes 20 and 29 to the consolidated financial statements for further information about our risk exposures, our use of derivatives, and the effects of this activity on our financial statements.

statement of financial position because ge and ge capital share certain significant elements of their statements of financial position, the following discussion addresses significant captions in the consolidated statement. within the following discussions, however, we distinguish between ge and ge capital activities in order to permit meaningful analysis of each individual consolidating statement.
major changes in our financial position during 2016
·   cash and equivalents decreased $22.4 billion. ge cash and equivalents increased $0.2 billion due to continuing cash flows from operating activities of $30.0 billion (including common dividends from ge capital of $20.1 billion), proceeds from the sale of our appliances business of $4.8 billion and a short-term loan from ge capital of $1.3 billion. this is partially offset by treasury stock net purchases of $21.4 billion (cash basis), including $11.4 billion paid under asr agreements, common dividends of $8.5 billion, net pp&amp;e additions of $2.7 billion, business acquisitions of $2.3 billion and software spend of $0.7 billion. ge capital cash and equivalents decreased $22.5 billion primarily driven by $58.8 billion net repayments of debt, $20.4 billion in payments of dividends to shareowners and a short-term loan to ge of $1.3 billion, partially offset by $59.9 billion in proceeds from business dispositions and $0.8 billion in proceeds from the sale of receivables originated in our appliances business and sold to haier. see the statement of cash flows section of md&amp;a for additional information.

·   investment securities increased $12.3 billion, primarily driven by investing excess cash in longer term investments to achieve higher yield at ge capital. see note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.

·   all other assets decreased $9.6 billion, primarily due to maturities of time deposits in line with debt maturities at ge capital. see note 9 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.

·   assets of discontinued operations decreased $106.1 billion, primarily due to the disposition of cll businesses of $89.2 billion at ge capital. see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.

·   borrowings decreased $61.4 billion, primarily due to net repayment of debt at ge capital. see note 10 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.

·   liabilities of discontinued operations decreased $42.3 billion, primarily driven by the disposition of cll businesses of $34.7 billion at ge capital. see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.

·   common stock held in treasury increased $19.5 billion, primarily due to treasury stock purchases of $22.0 billion (book basis), including $11.4 billion repurchased under asr agreements. this was partially offset by treasury stock issuances of $2.6 billion. see note 15 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.

financial resources and liquidity liquidity and borrowings we maintain a strong focus on liquidity. at both ge and ge capital we manage our liquidity to help provide access to sufficient funding to meet our business needs and financial obligations throughout business cycles.
our liquidity and borrowing plans for ge and ge capital are established within the context of our annual financial and strategic planning processes. at ge, our liquidity and funding plans take into account the liquidity necessary to fund our operating commitments, which include primarily purchase obligations for inventory and equipment, payroll and general expenses (including pension funding). we also take into account our capital allocation and growth objectives, including paying dividends, repurchasing shares, investing in research and development and acquiring industrial businesses. at ge, we rely primarily on cash generated through our operating activities, any dividend payments from ge capital, and also have historically maintained a commercial paper program that we regularly use to fund operations in the u.s., principally within the quarters.
during 2017, ge plans to incur new long-term debt to refinance existing unsecured term debt, finance the baker hughes transaction, and for other corporate purposes.  this new debt may consist of new unsecured term debt issued by ge or intercompany arrangements between ge and ge capital utilizing ge capital's excess unsecured term debt.  ge maintains a commercial paper program with a balance of $1.5 billion at december 31, 2016.
based on asset and liability management actions we have taken, ge capital does not plan to issue any incremental ge capital senior unsecured term debt until 2019. ge capital's global commercial paper issuances total $5.0 billion at december 31, 2016. ge capital mainly relies on excess cash positions, cash generated through dispositions, and the cash flow from our verticals to fund our debt maturities, including current portion of long-term debt ($18.2 billion at december 31, 2016), and our operating and interest costs. ge capital's liquidity position is targeted to meet its obligations under both normal and stressed conditions. we expect to maintain an elevated liquidity position as we generate cash from asset sales, returning to more normalized levels in 2019. during this period we expect to continue to have excess interest costs as asset sales have outpaced our debt maturities. while we maintain elevated liquidity levels, we may engage in liability management actions, such as buying back debt, based on market and economic conditions in order to reduce our excess interest costs. in 2016, we repurchased $6.7 billion of long-term unsecured debt and $5.8 billion of subordinated debentures, resulting in a pre-tax loss of $0.6 billion.
we maintain a detailed liquidity policy for ge capital that defines ge capital's liquidity risk tolerance under stress based on its liquidity sources, and a comprehensive framework for managing liquidity risk including metrics to identify and monitor liquidity risk and procedures to escalate and address potential issues.
on december 2, 2015, $87.7 billion of senior unsecured notes and $4.9 billion of commercial paper was assumed by ge upon its merger with ge capital. on the ge balance sheet, assumed debt is presented in borrowings with an offsetting receivable from ge capital.  on the ge capital balance sheet, assumed debt is reflected as an intercompany payable to ge presented in borrowings (see note 10 for additional information). the following table illustrates total ge and ge capital external debt and debt assumed by ge as of december 31, 2016.

liquidity sources in addition to ge cash of $10.5 billion at december 31, 2016, ge capital maintained liquidity sources of $50.5 billion that consisted of cash and equivalents of $37.6 billion, high-quality investments of $11.5 billion and cash and equivalents of $1.4 billion classified as discontinued operations. additionally, at december 31, 2016, we have $20.0 billion of committed unused credit lines extended by 36 banks in a syndicated credit facility agreement.  ge capital has the right to compel ge to borrow under such credit lines and transfer the proceeds as loans to ge capital.

(a)   at december 31, 2016, $3.5 billion of ge cash and equivalents was held in countries with currency controls that may restrict the transfer of funds to the u.s. or limit our ability to transfer funds to the u.s. without incurring substantial costs. these funds are available to fund operations and growth in these countries and we do not currently anticipate a need to transfer these funds to the u.s.

(b)   at december 31, 2016, ge capital cash and equivalents of about $0.5 billion was primarily in insurance entities and was subject to regulatory restrictions.

(c)   of this amount at december 31, 2016, $3.3 billion is held outside of the u.s. and is available to fund operations and other growth of non-u.s. subsidiaries; it is also available to fund our needs in the u.s. on a short-term basis through short-term loans, without being subject to u.s. tax. under the internal revenue code, these loans are permitted to be outstanding for 30 days or less and the total of all such loans is required to be outstanding for less than 60 days during the year. if we were to repatriate this cash, we would be subject to additional u.s. income taxes and foreign withholding taxes.

there were no new senior unsecured debt issuances in 2016.

we securitize financial assets as an alternative source of funding. at december 31, 2016, consolidated non-recourse securitization borrowings were $0.4 billion.
we have two deposit-taking banks outside of the u.s., which are classified as discontinued operations, and neither deposit-taking platform will be retained after the planned completion of the remaining ge capital exit plan dispositions in europe in 2017. on april 18, 2016, we completed the sale of the deposit-taking bank in the u.s., ge capital bank, an industrial bank.
exchange rate and interest rate risks exchange rate and interest rate risks are managed with a variety of techniques, including match funding and selective use of derivatives. we use derivatives to mitigate or eliminate certain financial and market risks because we conduct business in diverse markets around the world and local funding is not always efficient. in addition, we use derivatives to adjust the debt we are issuing to match the fixed or floating nature of the assets we are originating. we apply strict policies to manage each of these risks, including prohibitions on speculative activities. following is an analysis of the potential effects of changes in interest rates and currency exchange rates using so-called "shock" tests that seek to model the effects of shifts in rates. such tests are inherently limited based on the assumptions used (described further below) and should not be viewed as a forecast; actual effects would depend on many variables, including market factors and the composition of the company's assets and liabilities at that time.

·   it is our policy to minimize exposure to interest rate changes. we fund our financial investments using debt or a combination of debt and hedging instruments so that the interest rates of our borrowings match the expected interest rate profile on our assets. to test the effectiveness of our hedging actions, we assumed that, on january 1, 2016, interest rates decreased by 100 basis points across the yield curve (a "parallel shift" in that curve) and further assumed that the decrease remained in place for the next 12 months. based on the year-end 2016 portfolio and holding all other assumptions constant, we estimated that our consolidated net earnings for the next 12 months, starting in january 2016, would decline by less than $0.1 billion as a result of this parallel shift in the yield curve.

·   it is our policy to minimize currency exposures and to conduct operations either within functional currencies or using the protection of hedge strategies. we analyzed year-end 2016 consolidated currency exposures, including derivatives designated and effective as hedges, to identify assets and liabilities denominated in other than their relevant functional currencies. for such assets and liabilities, we then evaluated the effects of a 10% shift in exchange rates between those currencies and the u.s. dollar, holding all other assumptions constant. this analysis indicated that our 2016 consolidated net earnings would decline by less than $0.3 billion as a result of such a shift in exchange rates. this analysis excludes any translation impact from changes in exchange rates on our financial results and any offsetting effect from the forecasted future transactions that are economically hedged.

debt and derivative instruments, guarantees and covenants credit ratings we have relied, and may continue to rely, on the short-term and long-term debt capital markets to fund, among other things, a significant portion of our operations and significant acquisitions. the cost and availability of debt financing is influenced by our credit ratings.
on september 23, 2016, standard and poor's global ratings (s&p) lowered ge's and ge capital's long-term unsecured debt ratings to aa- from aa+.  the a-1+ short-term funding rating from s&p remained unchanged.   on october 31, 2016, ge announced an agreement with baker hughes as previously discussed in the consolidated results section of md&a. moody's, s&p and fitch ratings (fitch) affirmed ge's credit ratings following the announcement.  fitch has published credit ratings for ge and ge capital since august 2, 2016.
we are disclosing these ratings to enhance understanding of our sources of liquidity and the effects of our ratings on our costs of funds. although we currently do not expect a downgrade in the credit ratings, our ratings may be subject to a revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating organization, and each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating.  for a description of some of the potential consequences of a reduction in our credit ratings, see "risk factors - financial risks - funding access/costs - failure to maintain our credit ratings, or conditions in the financial and credit markets, could adversely affect our access to capital markets, funding costs and related margins, liquidity and competitive position."
ge's and ge capital's ratings are set forth in the table below.

principal debt and derivative conditions certain of our derivative instruments can be terminated if specified credit ratings are not maintained and certain debt and derivatives agreements of other consolidated entities have provisions that are affected by these credit ratings.
fair values of our derivatives can change significantly from period to period based on, among other factors, market movements and changes in our positions. we manage counterparty credit risk (the risk that counterparties will default and not make payments to us according to the terms of our standard master agreements) on an individual counterparty basis. where we have agreed to netting of derivative exposures with a counterparty, we offset our exposures with that counterparty and apply the value of collateral posted to us to determine the net exposure. we actively monitor these net exposures against defined limits and take appropriate actions in response, including requiring additional collateral.
swap, forward and option contracts are executed under standard master agreements that typically contain mutual downgrade provisions that provide the ability of the counterparty to require termination if the long-term credit ratings of the applicable ge entity were to fall below a-/a3 or other ratings levels agreed upon with the counterparty. in certain of these master agreements, the counterparty also has the ability to require termination if the short-term ratings of the applicable ge entity were to fall below a-1/p-1. the net derivative liability after consideration of netting arrangements, outstanding interest payments and collateral posted by us under these master agreements was estimated to be $0.4 billion at december 31, 2016.
see notes 20 and 29 to the consolidated financial statements for further information about our risk exposures, our use of derivatives, and the effects of this activity on our financial statements.
ge guarantee of certain ge capital debt ge provides implicit and explicit support to ge capital through commitments, capital contributions and operating support. at december 31, 2016, ge debt assumed from ge capital in connection with the merger of ge capital into ge was $58.8 billion, and ge guaranteed $47.5 billion of ge capital debt. see note 28 to the consolidated financial statements for further information on the guarantor financial statements.
accelerated share repurchase agreement during 2016, we repurchased $22.0 billion of our common stock, including $11.4 billion repurchased under accelerated share repurchase (asr) agreements.
in december 2016, we entered into an asr agreement with a financial institution that allowed us to repurchase ge common stock at a price below its volume weighted-average price during a given period. during the fourth quarter, we paid $2.2 billion and received and classified as treasury shares an initial delivery of 59,177,215 shares based on then-current market prices. the payment was recorded as a reduction to shareowners' equity, consisting of a $1.9 billion increase in treasury stock, which reflects the value of the shares received upon initial delivery, and a $0.3 billion decrease in other capital, which reflects the value of the stock held back pending final delivery.
we accounted for the asr as two separate transactions: (i) 59,177,215 shares of common stock initially delivered to ge and $1.9 billion was accounted for as a treasury stock transaction and (ii) the unsettled contract of $0.3 billion was determined to be a forward contract indexed to ge's own common stock. the initial delivery of 59,177,215 shares resulted in an immediate reduction of the outstanding shares used to calculate the weighted-average common shares outstanding for basic and diluted earnings per share. ge has determined that the forward contract, indexed to its own common stock, met all the criteria for equity classification.
in the first quarter of 2017, we received the remaining 10,773,050 shares based on the final volume weighted-average price less the negotiated discount.

with respect to ge cfoa, we believe that it is useful to supplement our ge statement of cash flows and to examine in a broader context the business activities that provide and require cash.
the most significant source of cash in ge cfoa is customer-related activities, the largest of which is collecting cash resulting from product or services sales. the most significant operating use of cash is to pay our suppliers, employees, tax authorities and others for a wide range of material and services. dividends from ge capital represent the distribution of a portion of ge capital retained earnings, and are distinct from cash from continuing operations within the ge capital businesses.
all other operating activities reflect cash sources and uses as well as non-cash adjustments to net income including those related to taxes, interest, pension, contract assets and gains (losses) on principal business dispositions. see note 26 to the consolidated financial statements for further information.
see the intercompany transactions between ge and ge capital section within the md&a and notes 4, 22 and 24 to the consolidated financial statements for further information regarding certain transactions affecting our consolidated statement of cash flows.

2016 - 2015 commentary - continuing operations:
ge cash from operating activities-continuing operations increased $13.6 billion, primarily due to the following:
·   ge capital paid common dividends totaling $20.1 billion and $4.3 billion to ge in 2016 and 2015, respectively.

·   improvement of working capital of $3.6 billion, primarily due to increases in progress collections and accounts payable, partially offset by an increase in inventory build.

·   these increases were partially offset by the following decreases:

·   $1.0 billion increase in income tax payments, including $1.4 billion in taxes related to the 2016 sale of our appliances business to haier.

·   higher restructuring and interest payments of $0.6 billion and $0.4 billion, respectively, when compared to 2015.

ge cash used for financing activities-continuing operations increased $19.2 billion, primarily due to the following:
·   net purchases of ge treasury shares of $21.4 billion, including $11.4 billion paid under asr agreements compared to $1.1 billion in 2015.

·   this increase in cash usage was partially offset by the following decreases:

·   a net increase in borrowings of $0.8 billion, primarily driven by a short-term loan from ge capital to ge with remaining principal of $1.3 billion in 2016 (the loan was fully repaid in january 2017).

·   lower dividends paid to shareowners of $0.8 billion due to lower shares outstanding in 2016 because of on-going repurchases of ge treasury shares.

2015 - 2014 commentary - continuing operations:
ge cash from operating activities-continuing operations increased $1.2 billion, primarily due to the following:
·   ge capital paid common dividends totaling $4.3 billion and $3.0 billion to ge in 2015 and 2014, respectively.

·   settlements related to the nbcu transaction of $0.5 billion and an electrolux break-up fee of $0.2 billion received in 2015.

·   these increases were partially offset by a $0.3 billion increase in income tax payments.

·   see note 26 to the consolidated financial statements for further information regarding cash sources and uses as well as non-cash adjustments to net income reported as all other operating activities.

ge cash used for investing activities-continuing operations increased $6.9 billion, primarily due to the following:
·   higher business acquisition activity of $8.3 billion primarily driven by the 2015 acquisition of alstom for $10.1 billion. this compares to the 2014 acquisitions of certain thermo fisher scientific inc. life-sciences business for $1.1 billion, cameron's reciprocating compression division for $0.6 billion and api healthcare (api) for $0.3 billion. partially offset by;

·   higher proceeds from principal business dispositions of $1.1 billion in 2015, primarily relating to signaling of $0.8 billion and intelligent platforms embedded systems products of $0.5 billion in 2015, compared to $0.6 billion of proceeds from principal business dispositions in 2014.

ge cash used for financing activities-continuing operations increased $1.5 billion, primarily due to the following:
·   the 2015 repayment of $2.0 billion of ge unsecured notes, partially offset by;

intercompany transactions between ge and ge capital we are repositioning ge to be the world's best infrastructure and technology company, with a smaller financial services division. our focus is on driving infrastructure leadership, investing in innovation and achieving a culture of simplification to better serve our customers around the world. over the last decade, we have made significant strides in transforming our portfolio and focusing on our industrial leadership. we have grown our infrastructure platforms with major portfolio moves, investing in adjacencies and pursuing opportunities that are closely related to our core.
in parallel, we have made a concentrated effort to reduce the size of our ge capital business and align its growth with industrial earnings. as a result, ge capital vertical businesses are now focused on investing financial, human and intellectual capital to promote growth for our industrial businesses and their customers. ge capital accomplishes this in part through related party transactions with ge that are made on an arms-length basis and are reported in the ge and ge capital columns of our financial statements, but are eliminated in deriving our consolidated financial statements. these transactions include, but are not limited to, the following:
·   ge capital dividends to ge,

·   ge capital working capital solutions to optimize ge cash management,

·   ge capital enabled ge industrial orders, and

·   aircraft engines, power equipment and healthcare equipment manufactured by ge that are installed on ge capital investments, including leased equipment.

in addition to the above transactions that primarily enable growth for the ge businesses, there are routine related party transactions, which include, but are not limited to, the following:
·   expenses related to parent-subsidiary pension plans,

·   buildings and equipment leased between ge and ge capital, including sale-leaseback transactions,

·   information technology (it) and other services sold to ge capital by ge, and

·   various investments, loans and allocations of ge corporate overhead costs.

cash flows ge capital paid $20.1 billion, $4.3 billion and $3.0 billion of common dividends to ge in the years ended december 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. in january 2017, ge received an additional $2.0 billion of common dividends from ge capital.
in order to manage credit exposure, ge sells current receivables to ge capital and other third parties in part to fund the growth of our industrial businesses. these transactions can result in cash generation or cash use. during any given period, ge receives cash from the sale of receivables to ge capital and other third parties. ge also leverages ge capital for its expertise in receivables collection services and sales of receivables to ge capital are made on an arm's length basis. the incremental amount of cash received from sales of receivables represents the cash generated or used in the period relating to this activity. the incremental cash generated in ge cfoa from current receivables sold to ge capital, including current receivables subsequently sold to third parties, increased ge's cfoa by $2.1 billion, $2.1 billion and $1.6 billion in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.
as of december 31, 2016, ge capital had approximately $12.3 billion recorded on its balance sheet related to current receivables purchased from ge. of these amounts, approximately half had been sold by ge to ge capital with recourse (i.e., the ge business retains the risk of default). the evaluation of whether recourse transactions qualify for accounting derecognition is based, in part, upon the legal jurisdiction of the sale; as such, the majority of recourse transactions outside the u.s. qualify for sale treatment. claims by ge capital on receivables sold with recourse to ge have not been significant for the years ended december 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014.

in december 2016, ge capital entered into a receivables facility with members of a bank group, designed to provide extra liquidity to ge. the receivables facility allows us to sell eligible current receivables on a non-recourse basis for cash and a deferred purchase price to members of the bank group. the purchase commitment of the bank group at december 31, 2016 was $3.0 billion. see note 22 to the consolidated financial statements for further information.
enabled orders enabled orders represent the act of introducing, elevating and influencing customers and prospects that result in an industrial sale, potentially coupled with programmatic captive financing or driving incremental products or services across the ge store. during the year ended december 31, 2016, ge capital enabled $13.4 billion of ge industrial orders, primarily with our power ($6.9 billion), renewable energy ($4.8 billion) and healthcare ($0.9 billion) businesses.
aviation during the years ended december 31, 2016 and 2015, ge capital acquired 44 aircraft (list price totaling $6.5 billion) and 56 aircraft (list price totaling $6.4 billion), respectively, from third parties that will be leased to others, which are powered by engines that were manufactured by ge aviation and affiliates. additionally, ge capital had $1.5 billion and $1.1 billion of net book value of engines, originally manufactured by ge aviation and affiliates and subsequently leased back to ge aviation and affiliates at december 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
pensions ge capital is a member of certain ge pension plans.  as a result of the ge capital exit plan, ge capital will have additional funding obligations for these pension plans. these obligations do not relate to the verticals and are recognized as an expense in ge capital's other continuing operations when they become probable and estimable.  the additional funding obligations recognized by ge capital were $0.6 billion and $0.2 billion for the years ended december 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
certain of this additional funding is recorded as a contra expense for ge and ge's related future pension obligations will be paid by ge capital. for certain other pension plan funding obligations triggered by the ge capital exit plan, ge agreed to assume the funding obligation that would have been triggered by ge capital at the date of exit from the plan in exchange for an assumption fee that ge recorded as other income. the total cash transferred to ge for the assumption of these ge capital funding obligations was $0.2 billion and $0.1 billion for the years ended december 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
on a consolidated basis, the additional required pension funding and any related assumption fees do not affect current period earnings.  any additional required pension funding will be reflected as a reduction of the pension liability when paid.
ge guarantee of ge capital third-party transactions in certain instances, ge provides guarantees to ge capital transactions with third parties primarily in connection with enabled orders. in order to meet its underwriting criteria, ge capital may obtain a direct guarantee from ge related to the performance of the third party. ge guarantees can take many forms and may include, but not be limited to, direct performance or payment guarantees, return on investment guarantees, asset value guarantees and loss pool arrangements. as of december 31, 2016, ge had outstanding guarantees to ge capital on $1.8 billion of funded exposure and $0.5 billion of unfunded commitments. the recorded amount of these contingent liabilities was $0.1 billion as of december 31, 2016 and is dependent upon individual transaction level defaults, losses and/or returns.
ge guarantee of certain ge capital debt ge provides implicit and explicit support to ge capital through commitments, capital contributions and operating support. as previously discussed, ge debt assumed from ge capital in connection with the merger of ge capital into ge was $58.8 billion, and ge guaranteed $47.5 billion of ge capital debt at december 31, 2016. see note 24 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information about the eliminations of intercompany transactions between ge and ge capital.

critical accounting estimates accounting estimates and assumptions discussed in this section are those that we consider to be the most critical to an understanding of our financial statements because they involve significant judgments and uncertainties. many of these estimates include determining fair value. all of these estimates reflect our best judgment about current, and for some estimates future, economic and market conditions and their potential effects based on information available as of the date of these financial statements. if these conditions change from those expected, it is reasonably possible that the judgments and estimates described below could change, which may result in future impairments of investment securities, goodwill, intangibles and long-lived assets, incremental losses on financing receivables, increases in reserves for contingencies, establishment of valuation allowances on deferred tax assets and increased tax liabilities, among other effects. also see note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, which discusses our most significant accounting policies.
revenue recognition on long-term product services agreements revenue recognition on long-term product services agreements requires estimates of profits over the multiple-year terms of such agreements, considering factors such as the frequency and extent of future monitoring, maintenance and overhaul events; the amount of personnel, spare parts and other resources required to perform the services; and future billing rate, cost changes and customers' utilization of assets. we routinely review estimates under product services agreements and regularly revise them to adjust for changes in outlook.
we also regularly assess customer credit risk inherent in the carrying amounts of receivables and contract costs and estimated earnings, including the risk that contractual penalties may not be sufficient to offset our accumulated investment in the event of customer termination. we gain insight into future utilization and cost trends, as well as credit risk, through our knowledge of the installed base of equipment and the close interaction with our customers that comes with supplying critical services and parts over extended periods. revisions may affect a product services agreement's total estimated profitability resulting in an adjustment of earnings; such adjustments increased earnings by $2.2 billion, $1.4 billion and $1.0 billion in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. we provide for probable losses when they become evident.
see notes 1 and 9 to the consolidated financial statements for further information.
asset impairment asset impairment assessment involves various estimates and assumptions as follows:
investments we regularly review investment securities for impairment using both quantitative and qualitative criteria. for debt securities, if we do not intend to sell the security and it is not more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery of our amortized cost, we evaluate other qualitative criteria to determine whether a credit loss exists, such as the financial health of and specific prospects for the issuer, including whether the issuer is in compliance with the terms and covenants of the security. quantitative criteria include determining whether there has been an adverse change in expected future cash flows. for equity securities, our criteria include the length of time and magnitude of the amount that each security is in an unrealized loss position. our other-than-temporary impairment reviews involve our finance, risk and asset management functions as well as the portfolio management and research capabilities of our internal and third-party asset managers. see note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, which discusses the determination of fair value of investment securities.
see notes 1 and 3 to the consolidated financial statements for further information about actual and potential impairment losses.

long-lived assets we review long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the related carrying amounts may not be recoverable. determining whether an impairment has occurred typically requires various estimates and assumptions, including determining which undiscounted cash flows are directly related to the potentially impaired asset, the useful life over which cash flows will occur, their amount, and the asset's residual value, if any. in turn, measurement of an impairment loss requires a determination of fair value, which is based on the best information available. we derive the required undiscounted cash flow estimates from our historical experience and our internal business plans. to determine fair value, we use quoted market prices when available, our internal cash flow estimates discounted at an appropriate discount rate and independent appraisals, as appropriate.
our operating lease portfolio of commercial aircraft is a significant concentration of assets in capital, and is particularly subject to market fluctuations. therefore, we test recoverability of each aircraft in our operating lease portfolio at least annually. additionally, we perform quarterly evaluations in circumstances such as when aircraft are re-leased, current lease terms have changed or a specific lessee's credit standing changes. we consider market conditions, such as global demand for commercial aircraft. estimates of future rentals and residual values are based on historical experience and information received routinely from independent appraisers. estimated cash flows from future leases are reduced for expected downtime between leases and for estimated costs required to prepare aircraft to be redeployed. fair value used to measure impairment is based on management's best estimates which are benchmarked against third-party appraiser current market values for aircraft of similar type and age.
see notes 7 and 23 to the consolidated financial statements for further information on impairment losses and our exposure to the commercial aviation industry.
goodwill and other identified intangible assets we test goodwill for impairment annually in the third quarter of each year using data as of july 1 of that year. the impairment test consists of two steps: in step one, the carrying value of the reporting unit is compared with its fair value; in step two, which is applied when the carrying value is more than its fair value, the amount of goodwill impairment, if any, is derived by deducting the fair value of the reporting unit's assets and liabilities from the fair value of its equity, and comparing that amount with the carrying amount of goodwill. we determined fair values for each of the reporting units using the market approach, when available and appropriate, or the income approach, or a combination of both. we assess the valuation methodology based upon the relevance and availability of the data at the time we perform the valuation. if multiple valuation methodologies are used, the results are weighted appropriately.
valuations using the market approach are derived from metrics of publicly traded companies or historically completed transactions of comparable businesses. the selection of comparable businesses is based on the markets in which the reporting units operate giving consideration to risk profiles, size, geography, and diversity of products and services. a market approach is limited to reporting units for which there are publicly traded companies that have the characteristics similar to our businesses.
under the income approach, fair value is determined based on the present value of estimated future cash flows, discounted at an appropriate risk-adjusted rate. we use our internal forecasts to estimate future cash flows and include an estimate of long-term future growth rates based on our most recent views of the long-term outlook for each business. actual results may differ from those assumed in our forecasts. we derive our discount rates using a capital asset pricing model and analyzing published rates for industries relevant to our reporting units to estimate the cost of equity financing. we use discount rates that are commensurate with the risks and uncertainty inherent in the respective businesses and in our internally developed forecasts. discount rates used in our reporting unit valuations ranged from 9.5% to 16.5%.
estimating the fair value of reporting units requires the use of estimates and significant judgments that are based on a number of factors including actual operating results. it is reasonably possible that the judgments and estimates described above could change in future periods.
during the third quarter of 2016, we performed our annual impairment test of goodwill for all of our reporting units. based on the results of our step one testing, the fair values of each of the ge reporting units exceeded their carrying values; therefore, the second step of the impairment test was not required to be performed for any of our reporting units and no goodwill impairment was recognized.

we review identified intangible assets with defined useful lives and subject to amortization for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the related carrying amounts may not be recoverable. determining whether an impairment loss occurred requires comparing the carrying amount to the sum of undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. we test intangible assets with indefinite lives annually for impairment using a fair value method such as discounted cash flows. for our insurance activities remaining in continuing operations, we periodically test for impairment our deferred acquisition costs and present value of future profits.
see notes 1 and 8 to the consolidated financial statements for further information.
businesses and assets held for sale businesses and assets held for sale represent components that meet the accounting requirements to be classified as held for sale and are presented as single asset and liability amounts in our financial statements with a valuation allowance, if necessary, to recognize the net carrying amount at the lower of cost or fair value, less cost to sell. financing receivables that no longer qualify to be presented as held for investment must be classified as assets held for sale and recognized in our financial statements at the lower of cost or fair value, less cost to sell, with that amount representing a new cost basis at the date of transfer.
the determination of fair value for businesses and assets held for sale involves significant judgments and assumptions. development of estimates of fair values in this circumstance is complex and is dependent upon, among other factors, the nature of the potential sales transaction (for example, asset sale versus sale of legal entity), composition of assets and/or businesses in the disposal group, the comparability of the disposal group to market transactions, negotiations with third party purchasers, etc. such factors bear directly on the range of potential fair values and the selection of the best estimates. key assumptions were developed based on market observable data and, in the absence of such data, internal information that is consistent with what market participants would use in a hypothetical transaction.
we review all businesses and assets held for sale each reporting period to determine whether the existing carrying amounts are fully recoverable in comparison to estimated fair values.
pension assumptions pension assumptions are significant inputs to the actuarial models that measure pension benefit obligations and related effects on operations. two assumptions - discount rate and expected return on assets - are important elements of plan expense and asset/liability measurement. we evaluate these critical assumptions at least annually on a plan and country-specific basis. we periodically evaluate other assumptions involving demographic factors such as retirement age, mortality and turnover, and update them to reflect our experience and expectations for the future. actual results in any given year will often differ from actuarial assumptions because of economic and other factors.
projected benefit obligations are measured as the present value of expected payments. we discount those cash payments using the weighted average of market-observed yields for high-quality fixed-income securities with maturities that correspond to the payment of benefits. lower discount rates increase present values and subsequent-year pension expense; higher discount rates decrease present values and subsequent-year pension expense.
our discount rates for principal pension plans at december 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 were 4.11%, 4.38% and 4.02%, respectively, reflecting market interest rates.

to determine the expected long-term rate of return on pension plan assets, we consider current and target asset allocations, as well as historical and expected returns on various categories of plan assets. in developing future long-term return expectations for our principal benefit plans' assets, we formulate views on the future economic environment, both in the u.s. and abroad. we evaluate general market trends and historical relationships among a number of key variables that impact asset class returns such as expected earnings growth, inflation, valuations, yields and spreads, using both internal and external sources. we also take into account expected volatility by asset class and diversification across classes to determine expected overall portfolio results given current and target allocations. assets in our principal pension plans earned 6.5% in 2016, and had average annual returns of 7.8%, 4.0%, and 8.0% per year in the 5-, 10- and 25-year periods ended december 31, 2016, respectively. the average historical 10- and 25- year returns were significantly affected by investment losses in 2008. based on our analysis of future expectations of asset performance, past return results, and our current and target asset allocations, we have assumed a 7.5% long-term expected return on those assets for cost recognition in 2017 the same as 2016 and 2015.
changes in key assumptions for our principal pension plans would have the following effects.
·   discount rate - a 25 basis point increase in discount rate would decrease pension cost in the following year by $0.2 billion and would decrease the pension benefit obligation at year-end by about $2.2 billion.

·   expected return on assets - a 50 basis point decrease in the expected return on assets would increase pension cost in the following year by $0.2 billion.

see other consolidated information - postretirement benefit plans section within the md&a and notes 12 and 29 to the consolidated financial statements for further information on our pension plans.
income taxes our annual tax rate is based on our income, statutory tax rates and tax planning opportunities available to us in the various jurisdictions in which we operate. tax laws are complex and subject to different interpretations by the taxpayer and respective governmental taxing authorities. significant judgment is required in determining our tax expense and in evaluating our tax positions, including evaluating uncertainties. we review our tax positions quarterly and adjust the balances as new information becomes available. our income tax rate is significantly affected by the tax rate on our global operations. in addition to local country tax laws and regulations, this rate depends on the extent earnings are indefinitely reinvested outside the united states. indefinite reinvestment is determined by management's judgment about and intentions concerning the future operations of the company. at december 31, 2016 and 2015, approximately $82 billion and $104 billion of earnings, respectively, have been indefinitely reinvested outside the united states. most of these earnings have been reinvested in active non-u.s. business operations, and we do not intend to repatriate these earnings to fund u.s. operations. because of the availability of u.s. foreign tax credits, it is not practicable to determine the u.s. federal income tax liability that would be payable if such earnings were not reinvested indefinitely outside the united states.
deferred income tax assets represent amounts available to reduce income taxes payable on taxable income in future years. such assets arise because of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, as well as from net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. we evaluate the recoverability of these future tax deductions and credits by assessing the adequacy of future expected taxable income from all sources, including reversal of taxable temporary differences, forecasted operating earnings and available tax planning strategies. these sources of income rely heavily on estimates. we use our historical experience and our short- and long-range business forecasts to provide insight. further, our global and diversified business portfolio gives us the opportunity to employ various prudent and feasible tax planning strategies to facilitate the recoverability of future deductions. amounts recorded for deferred tax assets related to non-u.s. net operating losses, net of valuation allowances, were $3.1 billion and $5.1 billion at december 31, 2016 and 2015, including $0.3 billion and $0.8 billion at december 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, of deferred tax assets, net of valuation allowances, associated with losses reported in discontinued operations, primarily related to our real estate and consumer businesses and our loss on the sale of ge money japan. such year-end 2016 amounts are expected to be fully recoverable within the applicable statutory expiration periods. to the extent we do not consider it more likely than not that a deferred tax asset will be recovered, a valuation allowance is established.
see other consolidated information - income taxes section within the md&a and note 14 to the consolidated financial statements for further information on income taxes.

derivatives and hedging we use derivatives to manage a variety of risks, including risks related to interest rates, foreign exchange and commodity prices. accounting for derivatives as hedges requires that, at inception and over the term of the arrangement, the hedged item and related derivative meet the requirements for hedge accounting. the rules and interpretations related to derivatives accounting are complex. failure to apply this complex guidance correctly will result in all changes in the fair value of the derivative being reported in earnings, without regard to the offsetting changes in the fair value of the hedged item.
in evaluating whether a particular relationship qualifies for hedge accounting, we test effectiveness at inception and each reporting period thereafter by determining whether changes in the fair value of the derivative offset, within a specified range, changes in the fair value of the hedged item. if fair value changes fail this test, we discontinue applying hedge accounting to that relationship prospectively. fair values of both the derivative instrument and the hedged item are calculated using internal valuation models incorporating market-based assumptions, subject to third-party confirmation, as applicable.
see notes 1, 9, 20 and 29 to the consolidated financial statements for further information about our use of derivatives.
fair value measurements assets and liabilities measured at fair value every reporting period include investments in debt and equity securities and derivatives. other assets and liabilities are subject to fair value measurements only in certain circumstances, including purchase accounting applied to assets and liabilities acquired in a business combination, impaired loans that have been reduced based on the fair value of the underlying collateral, cost and equity method investments and long-lived assets that are written down to fair value when they are impaired. upon closing an acquisition, we estimate the fair values of assets and liabilities acquired and integrate the acquisition as soon as practicable. the size, scope and complexity of an acquisition will affect the time it takes to obtain the necessary information to record the acquired assets and liabilities at fair value. it may take up to one year to finalize the initial fair value estimates used in the preliminary purchase accounting. accordingly, it is reasonably likely that our initial estimates will be subsequently revised, which could affect carrying amounts of goodwill, intangibles and potentially other assets and liabilities in our financial statements. assets that are written down to fair value when impaired are not subsequently adjusted to fair value unless further impairment occurs.
a fair value measurement is determined as the price we would receive to sell an asset or pay to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. in the absence of active markets for the identical assets or liabilities, such measurements involve developing assumptions based on market observable data and, in the absence of such data, internal information that is consistent with what market participants would use in a hypothetical transaction that occurs at the measurement date. the determination of fair value often involves significant judgments about assumptions such as determining an appropriate discount rate that factors in both risk and liquidity premiums, identifying the similarities and differences in market transactions, weighting those differences accordingly and then making the appropriate adjustments to those market transactions to reflect the risks specific to our asset being valued.
see notes 1, 3, 8, 19, 20 and 29 to the consolidated financial statements for further information on fair value measurements and related matters.

other loss contingencies other loss contingencies are uncertain and unresolved matters that arise in the ordinary course of business and result from events or actions by others that have the potential to result in a future loss. such contingencies include, but are not limited to environmental obligations, litigation, regulatory proceedings, product quality and losses resulting from other events and developments.
when a loss is considered probable and reasonably estimable, we record a liability in the amount of our best estimate for the ultimate loss. when there appears to be a range of possible costs with equal likelihood, liabilities are based on the low-end of such range. however, the likelihood of a loss with respect to a particular contingency is often difficult to predict and determining a meaningful estimate of the loss or a range of loss may not be practicable based on the information available and the potential effect of future events and decisions by third parties that will determine the ultimate resolution of the contingency. moreover, it is not uncommon for such matters to be resolved over many years, during which time relevant developments and new information must be continuously evaluated to determine both the likelihood of potential loss and whether it is possible to reasonably estimate a range of possible loss. when a loss is probable but a reasonable estimate cannot be made, disclosure is provided.
disclosure also is provided when it is reasonably possible that a loss will be incurred or when it is reasonably possible that the amount of a loss will exceed the recorded provision. we regularly review all contingencies to determine whether the likelihood of loss has changed and to assess whether a reasonable estimate of the loss or range of loss can be made. as discussed above, development of a meaningful estimate of loss or a range of potential loss is complex when the outcome is directly dependent on negotiations with or decisions by third parties, such as regulatory agencies, the court system and other interested parties. such factors bear directly on whether it is possible to reasonably estimate a range of potential loss and boundaries of high and low estimates.
see note 23 to the consolidated financial statements for further information.

other items new accounting standards asu no. 2016-16, accounting for income taxes: intra-entity asset transfers of assets other than inventory in october 2016, the financial accounting standards board (fasb) issued accounting standards update (asu) no. 2016-16, accounting for income taxes: intra-entity asset transfers of assets other than inventory. the asu eliminates the deferral of the tax effects of intra-entity asset transfers other than inventory. as a result, the tax expense from the intercompany sale of assets, other than inventory, and associated changes to deferred taxes will be recognized when the sale occurs even though the pre-tax effects of the transaction have not been recognized. the effect of the adoption of the standard will depend on the nature and amount of future transactions.
asu no. 2016-02, leases in february 2016, the fasb issued asu no. 2016-02, leases. the new standard establishes a right-of-use (rou) model that requires a lessee to record a rou asset and a lease liability on the balance sheet for all leases with terms longer than 12 months. leases will be classified as either finance or operating, with classification affecting the pattern of expense recognition. similarly, lessors will be required to classify leases as sales-type, finance or operating, with classification affecting the pattern of income recognition. classification for both lessees and lessors will be based on an assessment of whether risks and rewards as well as substantive control have been transferred through a lease contract. the new standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after december 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years, with early adoption permitted. a modified retrospective transition approach is required for leases existing at, or entered into after, the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented in the financial statements, with certain practical expedients available. while we continue to evaluate the effect of the standard on our ongoing financial reporting, we anticipate that the adoption of the asu may materially affect our statement of financial position.
asu no. 2014-09, revenue from contracts with customers background in may 2014, the fasb issued a new comprehensive set of revenue recognition principles (asu no. 2014-09, revenue from contracts with customers) that supersedes most existing u.s. gaap revenue recognition guidance (including asc 605-35, revenue recognition - construction-type and production-type contracts). the new standard will become effective for annual reporting periods beginning after december 15, 2017. we will adopt the standard on january 1, 2018, will apply it retrospectively to all periods presented and will elect the practical expedient for contract modifications. since the issuance of the new standard by the fasb, we have engaged in a collaborative process with our industry peers and worked with standard setters on important interpretive matters with the objective of ensuring consistency in the application of the standard.
transition method for applying the new standard companies can use either a full retrospective or modified retrospective method to adopt the standard. under the full retrospective method, all periods presented will be updated upon adoption to conform to the new standard and a cumulative adjustment for effects on periods prior to 2016 will be recorded to retained earnings as of january 1, 2016. under the modified retrospective approach, prior periods are not updated to be presented on an accounting basis that is consistent with 2018. rather, a cumulative adjustment for effects of applying the new standard to periods prior to 2018 is recorded to retained earnings as of january 1, 2018. because only 2018 revenues reflect application of the new standard, incremental disclosures are required to present the 2018 revenues under the prior standard.    as noted above, we have elected to apply the full retrospective approach. we chose that approach because we believe that it is the most helpful to our investors.  first and foremost, when we adopt the standard in 2018 we will provide investors with a consistent view of historical trends, as 2016 and 2017 will be on a basis consistent with 2018.

change in timing and presentation, no impact to cash or economics the new standard requires companies to identify contractual performance obligations and determine whether revenue should be recognized at a point in time or over time based on when control of goods and services transfer to a customer. as a result, we expect significant changes in the presentation of our financial statements, including: (1) timing of revenue recognition, and (2) changes in classification between revenue and costs. the new standard will have no cash impact and, as such, does not affect the economics of our underlying customer contracts. the effect of applying the new guidance to our existing book of contracts will result in lower reported earnings in 2018 (and comparative periods previously reported) and in the early years after adoption. however, we expect to experience an increase in reported earnings, on that existing book of contracts, as they mature. the new standard will provide for a better alignment of cash and earnings for the affected long-term customer contracts and we expect that it will enhance comparability across industry peers.
specific effect on ge businesses power and aviation service agreements - for our long-term product service agreements, primarily in our power and aviation businesses, we expect to continue to recognize revenue based on costs incurred plus an estimated margin rate (over time model).  however, the new standard provides prescriptive guidance tied to several factors for determining what constitutes the proper scope of a customer contract for accounting purposes. these factors include optional purchases, contract modifications, and termination clauses. for example, under the new standard contract modifications will be accounted for prospectively by recognizing the financial effect of the modification over the remaining life of the contract. under existing accounting guidance revisions to estimated margin rates resulting from modifications were reflected as cumulative effect adjustments to earnings in the current period.
aviation commercial engines - consistent with industry peers, the financial presentation of our aviation commercial engines business will be significantly affected as they will be accounted for as of a point in time, which is a change from our current long-term contract accounting process. our current process applies contract-specific estimated margin rates, which include the effect of estimated cost improvements, to costs incurred. this change is required because our commercial engine contracts do not transfer control to the customer during the manufacturing process. each install and spare engine will be accounted for as a separate performance obligation, reflecting the actual price and manufacturing costs of such engines. we expect that the most significant effect of this change will be reflected when we have new engine launches, where the cost of earlier production units is higher than the cost of later production units because of cost improvements.
all other large equipment - for the remainder of our equipment businesses, the new revenue standard requires emphasis on transfer of control rather than risks and rewards, which may accelerate timing of revenue recognition versus our current practices. for example, in our renewable energy business we wait for risk of loss to be assumed by the customer before recognizing revenue, which generally occurs later than when control is transferred.
current range of financial statement effect we will adopt the new standard as of january 1, 2018. when we report our 2018 results, the comparative results for 2017 and 2016 will be updated to reflect the application of the requirements of the new standard to these periods.  based on our assessment and best estimates to date, we expect a non-cash charge to our january 1, 2016 retained earnings balance of approximately $4 billion. we estimate that the charge will comprise approximately $1 billion related to commercial aircraft engines and $3 billion related primarily to our services businesses (predominately in power and aviation). beyond those effects, we expect application of the new guidance will result in increases and decreases in revenue within our segments, which will largely offset overall and will be immaterial at a total company level. we estimate that our 2016 restated earnings per share will be lower by approximately $0.10. we anticipate that 2018 earnings per share will be lower by approximately $0.05 compared to what our results would be under existing revenue recognition guidance. these amounts include significant estimates and will remain subject to change as we complete our evaluation of the new standard and reflect actual activity for 2017.
to summarize, we will adopt the new standard in 2018, at which time we will update prior periods to be presented on a consistent basis. as discussed above, we anticipate the dilutive effect of the new standard in the year of adoption to be approximately $0.05 eps and the effect will be less dilutive for years after initial adoption. however, this expectation is based on many variables, which are subject to change. importantly, application of the new guidance has no effect on the cash we expect to receive nor the economics of these contracts. rather, it will simply more closely align revenue with cash, which we believe will be helpful to our investors.

ge digital in late 2015, we created ge digital, whose activities are focused on assisting in the market development of our digital product offerings through software design, fulfillment and product management, while also interfacing with our customers. digital revenues include internally developed software (including predix) and associated hardware, and software solutions that improve our customers' asset performance. these revenues are largely generated from our operating businesses and are included in their segment results.
ge digital revenues of $3.6 billion increased $0.5 billion, or 16%, in 2016 and were principally driven by expansion of our digital offerings in ge's power, energy connections & lighting and oil & gas segments.
ge digital orders of $4.0 billion increased $0.7 billion, or 22%, in 2016 principally driven by expansion of our digital offerings in ge's power, energy connections & lighting, oil & gas segments and in digital core, partially offset by a market-driven slowdown in transportation.
one aspect of our digital transformation includes an initiative to digitize the operations of ge. these investments include applications and analytics that improve the productivity of our internal processes across engineering, services, sourcing, and commercial - collectively referred to as the digital thread. during 2016, we internally invested $0.4 billion through various digitally-driven productivity initiatives, yielding $0.7 billion of gross productivity, principally related to our services businesses. costs associated with revenue-generating activities are recorded within the results of our segments and at corporate and are reflected in their respective margin rates.
in addition, we made several acquisitions to further enhance and expand our digital capabilities:
·   on january 10, 2017, we completed the acquisition of servicemax, a leader in cloud-based field service management (fsm) solutions, for $0.9 billion. this acquisition is expected to provide enhanced capabilities to advance our industrial internet vision, enabling customers to immediately gain more value from their assets and find greater efficiency in their field service processes.

·   on november 9, 2016, we acquired the remaining 89% of bit stew, a software company specializing in gathering data from connected devices in complex industrial systems to help companies plan predictive maintenance and optimize productivity, for $0.1 billion.

·   on october 26, 2016, we acquired wise.io, a leading machine learning and intelligent systems company, for less than $0.1 billion. this acquisition is expected to further accelerate development of advanced machine learning and data science offerings in the predix platform.

·   on september 14, 2016, we acquired the remaining 74% of the software developer meridium inc. for $0.4 billion. the acquisition is expected to enhance and accelerate our asset performance management capabilities across our industrial businesses.

iran threat reduction and syria human rights act of 2012
the company is making the following disclosure pursuant to section 13(r) of the securities exchange act of 1934.
under section 13(r) of the securities exchange act of 1934, enacted in 2012, ge is required to disclose in its periodic reports if it or any of its affiliates knowingly engaged in business activities relating to iran, even if those activities are conducted in accordance with authorizations subsequently issued by the u.s. government. reportable activities include investments that significantly enhance iran's ability to develop petroleum resources valued at $20 million or more in the aggregate during a twelve-month period. reporting is also required for transactions related to iran's domestic production of refined petroleum products or iran's ability to import refined petroleum products valued at $5 million or more in the aggregate during a twelve-month period.
in january 2016, the u.s. department of treasury's office of foreign assets control (ofac) issued general license h authorizing u.s.-owned or controlled foreign entities to engage in transactions with iran if these entities meet the requirements of the general license. pursuant to this authorization, a non-u.s. affiliate of ge's power business received a purchase order during the third quarter of 2016 for the sale of spare parts to an iranian entity to provide electricity and steam to an area of iran that includes certain oil refineries. during the fourth quarter of 2016, the non-u.s. affiliate received purchase orders directly from one of the end users for €7.1 million ($7.9 million) of the work contemplated under the original purchase order. as a result, the original purchase order will be revised. as of december 31, 2016, gross revenues attributable to these purchase orders was €0.9 million ($1.0 million), and net profits attributable to these transactions was €0.5 million ($0.6 million). the non-u.s. affiliate intends to continue this activity.
another non-u.s. affiliate of ge's oil & gas business received four purchase orders during the fourth quarter of 2016 for the sale of goods pursuant to general license h that could potentially enhance iran's ability to develop petroleum resources. the purchase orders cover the sale of spare parts for gas turbine equipment for ultimate end use by an iranian company in gas production projects in iran and have a total value of €16.8 million ($17.6 million). the non-u.s. affiliate has also begun operational activities related to previously reported contracts. a second non-u.s. affiliate of ge's oil & gas business received a purchase order pursuant to general license h valued at €0.2 million ($0.2 million) during the fourth quarter of 2016 for the sale of services associated with the commissioning of gas compressors in iran. as of december 31, 2016, these non-us affiliates have not recognized any revenue, but have incurred €2.7 million ($2.9 million) in costs. the non-u.s. affiliates intend to continue this activity.
for additional information on business activities related to iran, please refer to the other items section within md&a of our form 10-q for the quarter ended september 30, 2016.

environmental matters our operations, like operations of other companies engaged in similar businesses, involve the use, disposal and cleanup of substances regulated under environmental protection laws. we are involved in a number of remediation actions to clean up hazardous wastes as required by federal and state laws. such statutes require that responsible parties fund remediation actions regardless of fault, legality of original disposal or ownership of a disposal site. expenditures for site remediation actions amounted to approximately $0.2 billion, $0.3 billion and $0.4 billion for the years 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. we presently expect that such remediation actions will require average annual expenditures of about $0.2 billion in 2017 and about $0.1 billion in 2018.
as previously reported, in 2000, ge and the environmental protection agency (epa) entered into a consent decree relating to pcb cleanup of the housatonic river in massachusetts. following epa's release in september 2015 of an intended final remediation decision, ge and epa engaged in mediation and the first step of the dispute resolution process contemplated by the consent decree. in october 2016, epa issued its final remediation decision pursuant to the consent decree. ge and several other interested parties have appealed that decision to epa's environmental appeals board. a decision of the board can ultimately be appealed to the united states court of appeals for the first circuit. epa may not implement any remedy until all appeals are exhausted. as of december 31, 2016, and based on its assessment of current facts and circumstances and its defenses, ge believes that it has recorded adequate reserves to cover future obligations associated with an expected final remedy.

supplemental information financial measures that supplement u.s. generally accepted accounting principles measures (non-gaap financial measures)
we sometimes use information derived from consolidated financial information but not presented in our financial statements prepared in accordance with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles (gaap). certain of these data are considered "non-gaap financial measures" under u.s. securities and exchange commission rules. specifically, we have referred, in various sections of this report, to:
·   industrial segment organic revenues and industrial segment organic revenues excluding oil &amp; gas

·   industrial segment organic operating profit

·   oil &amp; gas organic revenue and operating profit growth

·   operating and non-operating pension cost

·   adjusted corporate costs (operating)

·   ge pre-tax earnings from continuing operations, excluding ge capital earnings (loss) from continuing operations and the corresponding effective tax rates, and the reconciliation of the u.s. federal statutory income tax rate to ge effective tax rate, excluding ge capital earnings

·   industrial operating earnings and ge capital earnings (loss) from continuing operations and eps

·   industrial operating + verticals earnings and eps

·   industrial operating profit and operating profit margin (excluding certain items)

·   industrial operating profit + verticals

·   industrial segment gross margin (excluding alstom)

·   industrial segment operating profit and operating margin (excluding alstom)

·   average ge shareowners' equity, excluding effects of discontinued operations

·   average ge capital shareowners' equity, excluding effects of discontinued operations

·   industrial return on total capital (industrial rotc)

·   industrial cash flows from operating activities (industrial cfoa) and industrial cfoa excluding taxes related to business sales and principal pension plan funding

·   ge cash flows from operating activities (ge cfoa) excluding taxes related to business sales and principal pension plan funding

·   free cash flow (fcf) and fcf plus dispositions

·   ratio of adjusted debt to equity at ge capital, net of liquidity

·   capital ending net investment (eni), excluding liquidity

·   2017 operating framework including 2017 industrial operating + verticals eps target

the reasons we use these non-gaap financial measures and the reconciliations to their most directly comparable gaap financial measures follow.

(a)   alstom was acquired in november 2015. this adjustment results in the inclusion of alstom revenues from november and december of both 2015 and 2016 in the adjusted organic revenue growth measure as described below.

organic revenue growth measures revenue growth excluding the effects of acquisitions, business dispositions and currency exchange rates. we believe that this measure provides management and investors with a more complete understanding of underlying operating results and trends of established, ongoing operations by excluding the effect of acquisitions, dispositions and currency exchange, which activities are subject to volatility and can obscure underlying trends. we also believe that presenting organic revenue growth separately for our industrial businesses provides management and investors with useful information about the trends of our industrial businesses and enables a more direct comparison to other non-financial businesses and companies. management recognizes that the term "organic revenue growth" may be interpreted differently by other companies and under different circumstances. although this may have an effect on comparability of absolute percentage growth from company to company, we believe that these measures are useful in assessing trends of the respective businesses or companies and may therefore be a useful tool in assessing period-to-period performance trends.
we integrate acquisitions as soon as possible.  revenues from the date we complete the acquisition through the end of the fourth quarter following the acquisition are considered the acquisition effect of such business for purposes of calculating organic revenue.  as such, organic revenue excludes alstom revenues from november 3, 2015 through december 31, 2016.  however, because of the significance of alstom to our results and the exclusion of alstom revenues for more than 12 months in calculating organic revenue growth, we believe investors would also find it helpful to see the revenue growth of the industrial segments adjusted to include alstom's november and december revenues in an organic measure. as a result, we have also presented an adjusted organic revenue growth measure on that basis.
we also believe that variability in the revenue of our oil & gas business may obscure underlying trends of our other industrial businesses. as a result, we have also presented our organic revenue growth measure excluding the revenues of our oil & gas business.

industrial segment organic operating profit growth measures industrial segment profit excluding the effects of acquisitions, business dispositions and currency exchange rates. we believe that this measure provides management and investors with a more complete understanding of underlying operating results and trends of established, ongoing operations by excluding the effect of acquisitions, dispositions and currency exchange, which activities are subject to volatility and can obscure underlying trends. we also believe that presenting industrial segment organic operating profit growth separately for our industrial businesses provides management and investors with useful information about the trends of our industrial businesses and enables a more direct comparison to other non-financial businesses and companies. management recognizes that the term "industrial segment organic operating profit growth" may be interpreted differently by other companies and under different circumstances. although this may have an effect on comparability of absolute percentage growth from company to company, we believe that these measures are useful in assessing trends of the respective businesses or companies and may therefore be a useful tool in assessing period-to-period performance trends.

operating corporate costs exclude non-service-related pension costs of our principal pension plans, which comprise interest costs, expected return on plan assets and amortization of actuarial gains/losses. service cost, prior service cost and curtailment loss components of our principal pension plans are included in operating corporate costs. we believe that these components of pension cost better reflect the ongoing service-related costs of providing pension benefits to our employees. accordingly, we believe that our measure of operating corporate costs provides management and investors with a useful measure of the operational costs incurred outside of our businesses. we believe that this measure, considered along with the corresponding gaap measure, provides management and investors with additional information for comparison of our operating corporate costs to the operating corporate costs of other companies.
we also believe that adjusting operating corporate costs to exclude the effects of items that are not closely associated with ongoing corporate operations, such as earnings of previously divested businesses, gains and losses on disposed and held for sale businesses, restructuring and other charges, a settlement and nbcu llc provides management and investors with a meaningful measure that increases the period-to-period comparability of our ongoing corporate costs.

operating earnings excludes non-service-related pension costs of our principal pension plans comprising interest cost, expected return on plan assets and amortization of actuarial gains/losses. the service cost, prior service cost and curtailment loss components of our principal pension plans are included in operating earnings. we believe that these components of pension cost better reflect the ongoing service-related costs of providing pension benefits to our employees. as such, we believe that our measure of operating earnings provides management and investors with a useful measure of the operational results of our business. other components of gaap pension cost are mainly driven by capital allocation decisions and market performance, and we manage these separately from the operational performance of our businesses. neither gaap nor operating pension costs are necessarily indicative of the current or future cash flow requirements related to our pension plans. we also believe that this measure, considered along with the corresponding gaap measure, provides management and investors with additional information for comparison of our operating results to the operating results of other companies. we believe that presenting operating earnings separately for our industrial businesses also provides management and investors with useful information about the relative size of our industrial and financial services businesses in relation to the total company.

we have presented our measure of industrial operating profit and vertical earnings, which is the sum of the industrial operating profit used in measuring the operating margins of our industrial businesses and the net earnings of our verticals businesses. see the reconciliations for these measures for additional information about the basis for the measures and explanation of why we believe these individual measures are helpful to management and our investors. we also believe that this measure, which combines an industrial business measure with the results of our vertical financial services business provides management and investors with a measure that is aligned with the way in which we manage these businesses.

(b)   used for computing industrial return on total capital (rotc).

our industrial rotc calculation excludes earnings (losses) of discontinued operations from the numerator because gaap requires us to display those earnings (losses) in the statement of earnings. those earnings (losses) from discontinued operations include an allocation of interest expense either directly attributable or related to discontinued operations. net investment in discontinued operations is calculated as assets of discontinued operations less liabilities of discontinued operations, including an allocation of ge capital debt. our calculation of average ge shareowners' equity may not be directly comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. we believe that it is a clearer way to measure the ongoing trend in return on total capital for the continuing operations of our businesses given the extent that discontinued operations have affected our reported results. we believe that this results in a more relevant measure for management and investors to evaluate performance of our continuing operations, on a consistent basis, and to evaluate and compare the performance of our continuing operations with the ongoing operations of other businesses and companies.

our industrial rotc calculation excludes earnings (losses) of discontinued operations from the numerator. we believe that this is a clearer way to measure the ongoing trend in return on industrial capital for the continuing operations of the business to the extent that discontinued operations have affected our reported results. our industrial shareowners' equity used in the denominator is adjusted for debt, redeemable noncontrolling interests and noncontrolling interests. we believe that these adjustments provide a more meaningful denominator in measuring the return on our industrial businesses. industrial rotc was 15.4% in 2016 versus 16.9% in 2015 and 14.0% in 2014. in 2016, an 8.6% increase in the adjusted industrial return was combined with a 19.5% increase in the adjusted industrial capital. this increase in capital was principally driven by increased debt and effects from alstom redeemable noncontrolling interests. our calculation of the return on industrial capital may not be directly comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. we believe that the adjustments described above result in a more relevant measure for management and investors to evaluate performance of our industrial continuing operations, on a consistent basis, and to evaluate and compare the performance of our industrial continuing operations with the continuing operations of other businesses and companies.

we define "industrial cfoa" as ge's cash from operating activities (continuing operations) less the amount of dividends received by ge from ge capital. this reflects the effects of intercompany transactions, which include, but are not limited to, the following: ge capital working capital solutions to optimize ge cash management; ge capital enabled ge industrial orders; aircraft engines, power equipment and healthcare equipment manufactured by ge that are installed on ge capital investments, including leased equipment; expenses related to parent-subsidiary pension plans; buildings and equipment leased between ge and ge capital, including sale-leaseback transactions; information technology (it) and other services sold to ge capital by ge; and various investments, loans and allocations of ge corporate overhead costs.
we believe that investors may find it useful to compare ge's operating cash flows without the effect of ge capital dividends, since these dividends are not representative of the operating cash flows of our industrial businesses and can vary from period to period based upon the results of the financial services businesses. we also believe that investors may find it useful to compare industrial cfoa and ge cfoa excluding the effects of taxes paid related to the sales of the appliances, signaling and nbcu llc businesses and contributions to our principal pension plans. management recognizes that these measures may not be comparable to cash flow results of companies which contain both industrial and financial services businesses, but believes that this comparison is aided by the provision of additional information about the amounts of dividends paid by our financial services business and the separate presentation in our financial statements of the ge capital cash flows. we believe that our measure of industrial cfoa, and both industrial cfoa and ge cfoa excluding such sale-related taxes and pension contributions (representing net sale proceeds associated with the july 1, 2016 sale of geam to state street corporation) provides management and investors with useful measures to compare the capacity of our industrial operations to generate operating cash flow with the operating cash flow of other non-financial businesses and companies and as such provides useful measures to supplement the reported gaap cfoa measure.

we define free cash flow as ge's cash from operating activities (continuing operations) less ge additions to property, plant and equipment and plus ge dispositions of property, plant and equipment, which are included in cash flows from investing activities. we believe that free cash flow is a useful financial metric to assess our ability to pursue opportunities to enhance our growth. we also believe that presenting free cash flow plus proceeds from business dispositions provides investors with useful information about the company's actual performance against performance targets. management recognizes that the term free cash flow may be interpreted differently by other companies and under different circumstances. although this may have an effect on comparability of absolute percentage growth from company to company, we believe that these measures are useful in assessing trends of the respective businesses or companies and may therefore be a useful tool in assessing period-to-period performance trends.

we have provided the ge capital ratio of debt to equity on a basis that reflects the use of liquidity as a reduction of debt. for purposes of this ratio, we have also adjusted cash and debt balances to include amounts classified as assets and liabilities of businesses held for sale and discontinued operations. we believe that this is a useful comparison to a gaap-based ratio of debt to equity because liquidity balances may be used to reduce debt. the usefulness of this supplemental measure may be limited, however, as the total amount of liquidity at any point in time may be different than the amount that could practically be applied to reduce outstanding debt. despite this potential limitation, we believe that this measure, considered along with the corresponding gaap measure, provides investors with additional information that may be more comparable to other financial institutions and businesses.

(a)   as originally reported.

(b)   liquidity includes cash and equivalents and $11.5 billion of high quality investments at december 31, 2016.

we use eni to measure the size of our capital segment. we believe that this measure is a useful indicator of the capital (debt or equity) required to fund a business as it adjusts for non-interest bearing current liabilities generated in the normal course of business that do not require a capital outlay. we also believe that by excluding liquidity, we provide a meaningful measure of assets requiring capital to fund our capital segment as a substantial amount of liquidity resulted from debt issuances to pre-fund future debt maturities and will not be used to fund additional assets. liquidity consists of cash and equivalents and certain high quality investments. as a general matter, investments included in liquidity are expected to be highly liquid, giving us the ability to readily convert them to cash. providing this measure will help investors measure how we are performing against our previously communicated goal to reduce the size of our financial services segment.
2017 operating framework including 2017 industrial operating + verticals eps target

2017 industrial operating + verticals eps target $1.60-1.70
items not included in non-gaap metric:
1) non-operating pension cost, which we estimate to be approximately $(0.16) - (0.17) per share.
2) capital other continuing earnings (excluding verticals), which we estimate to be approximately $(0.03) - (0.12) per share. this amount is affected by, among other things:
• the timing of when, and the amount by which, the company pays down ge capital's outstanding debt; and
• the timing and magnitude of the remaining costs associated with ge capital's exit plan.
note: the company cannot provide an equivalent gaap eps guidance range without unreasonable effort because of the uncertainty of the amount and timing of events affecting earnings as we execute the ge capital exit plan. although we have attempted to estimate ge capital's other continuing earnings for the purpose of explaining the probable significance of this component, as described under number 2, this calculation involves a number of unknown variables, resulting in a gaap range that we believe is too large and variable to be meaningful.
it is also impractical to provide a reconciliation for our organic revenue, industrial operating margin expansion and free cash flow plus dispositions targets as these involve a number of unknown variables including the effects of future acquisitions, dispositions, restructuring activities, property plant and equipment purchases and dispositions and currency exchange.

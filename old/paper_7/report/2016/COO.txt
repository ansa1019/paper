item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations.
note numbers refer to "notes to consolidated financial statements" in item 8. financial statements and supplementary data.
results of operations we discuss below the results of our operations for fiscal 2016 compared with fiscal 2015 and the results of our operations for fiscal 2015 compared with fiscal 2014. we discuss our cash flows and current financial condition under "capital resources and liquidity." certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current period's presentation. within the tables presented, percentages are calculated based on the underlying whole-dollar amounts and, therefore, may not recalculate from the rounded numbers used for disclosure purposes.
outlook overall, we remain optimistic about the long-term prospects for the worldwide contact lens and health care markets. however, events affecting the economy as a whole, including the uncertainty and instability of global markets driven by foreign currency volatility, european debt concerns, the uncertainty caused by the united kingdom's election to withdraw from the european union, and the trend of consolidation within the health care industry, impact our current performance and continue to represent a risk to our performance for fiscal year 2017.
coopervision - we compete in the worldwide contact lens market with our spherical, toric and multifocal contact lenses offered in a variety of materials including using silicone hydrogel aquaform® technology and phosphorylcholine technology (pc) technologytm. we believe that there will be lower contact lens wearer dropout rates as technology improves and enhances the wearing experience through a combination of improved designs and materials and the growth of preferred modalities such as single-use and monthly wearing options. coopervision is focused on greater worldwide market penetration of recently introduced products and we continue to expand our presence in existing and emerging markets, including through acquisitions.
on august 6, 2014, we acquired sauflon pharmaceuticals limited (sauflon), a privately-held european manufacturer and distributor of soft contact lenses and aftercare solutions. the acquisition of sauflon expanded our contact lens product portfolio particularly with sauflon's clariti® 1day brand of single-use silicone hydrogel spherical, toric and multifocal lenses. on september 6, 2016, we acquired soflex, a privately-held isreali manufacturer and distributor of soft contact lenses and aftercare solutions. the acquisition of soflex expanded our market presence in israel.
sales of contact lenses utilizing silicone hydrogel materials continue to grow and this product material represents about half of the industry. our ability to compete successfully with a full range of silicone hydrogel products is an important factor to achieving our desired future levels of sales growth and profitability. coopervision markets monthly and two-week silicone hydrogel spherical and toric lens products under our biofinity®, clariti® and avaira® brands and a monthly silicone hydrogel multifocal lens under biofinity. coopervision markets single-use silicone hydrogel spherical, toric and multifocal lenses under our clariti 1day brand and a single-use silicone hydrogel spherical and toric lenses under myday®.
we believe that the global market for single-use contact lenses will continue to grow and our single-use silicone hydrogel products represent an opportunity for our business. our clariti 1day brand provides the only single-use silicone hydrogel lenses in the marketplace with a complete line of spherical, toric and

the cooper companies, inc. and subsidiaries management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations multifocal contact lenses. we forecast increasing aggregate demand for clariti 1day and myday products, as well as future single-use products.
coopersurgical - our coopersurgical business competes in the general health care market with a focus on advancing the health of families through a diversified portfolio of products and services focusing on women's health, fertility and diagnostics. coopersurgical has established its market presence and distribution system by developing products and acquiring companies and products that complement its business model. coopersurgical product sales are categorized based on the point of health care delivery including products used in medical office and surgical procedures primarily by obstetricians and gynecologists (ob/gyns) that represented 55% of coopersurgical's net sales in the fiscal 2016 compared to 66% in the prior year. coopersurgical's remaining sales are highly specialized products and services that target the in vitro fertilization (ivf) process used in fertility that now represent 45% of coopersurgical's net sales compared to 34% in fiscal 2015. this change in product mix is primarily attributable to recent acquisitions discussed below.
we have continued to invest in coopersurgical's business through the acquisition of companies and product lines for new or complementary products and services for the ivf process. subsequent to our year end, in november 2016, we acquired wallace, the ivf segment of smiths medical international, ltd. in our fiscal third quarter of 2016, we acquired the commercial assets of recombine inc., a clinical genetic testing company specializing in carrier screening; kivex biotec a/s, a manufacturer and distributor of equipment for ivf clinics, and reprogenetics uk, a genetics laboratory specializing in service offerings of preimplantation genetic screening (pgs) and preimplantation genetic diagnosis (pgd) used during the ivf process. in our fiscal second quarter of 2016, coopersurgical acquired genesis genetics, inc., a genetics laboratory specializing in pgs and pgd used during the ivf process, and the pipette company, a manufacturer and distributor of micro pipettes for the assisted reproductive technology (art) market. in our first quarter of fiscal 2016, coopersurgical acquired research instruments limited, a manufacturer and supplier of ivf medical devices and systems. in our fiscal fourth quarter of 2015, coopersurgical acquired reprogenetics us, a genetics laboratory specializing in service offerings of pgs and pgd used during the ivf process. we intend to continue investing in coopersurgical's business with the goal of expanding our integrated solutions model within the areas of women's health, fertility and diagnostics.
capital resources - at october 31, 2016, we had $100.8 million in cash, primarily outside the united states, and $999.8 million available under our new syndicated revolving credit agreement. the $830.0 million term loan entered on march 1, 2016, $207.0 million of the $700.0 million term loan originally entered into on august 4, 2014, and $285.0 million of the $300.0 million term loan originally entered into on september 12, 2013, remain outstanding as of october 31, 2016.
on march 1, 2016, we entered into a new syndicated revolving credit and term loan agreement with keybank as administrative agent. this agreement, maturing on march 1, 2021, replaced our previous revolving credit agreement, entered into on january, 12, 2011 and provides for a multi-currency revolving credit facility in an aggregate principal amount of $1.0 billion and a term loan facility in the aggregate principal amount of $830.0 million. concurrently, we used funds from the new term loan to repay the $200.0 million outstanding principal amount of the two uncommitted revolving lines of credit, entered into on march 24, 2015 and the outstanding amounts under the previous credit agreement. we also used funds from the new term loan to partially repay outstanding amounts under the term loans entered into on august 4, 2014 and september 12, 2013, and for general corporate purposes. see note 5. debt for additional information.
on july 14, 2015, coopervision made a one-time lump sum payment to jjvc of $17.0 million to settle our existing patent disputes. as discussed in note 12 of the notes to consolidated financial statements, the settlement was royalty-free and neither party admitted any liability. on april 7, 2015, we paid all of the outstanding loan notes issued to previous holders of sauflon shares for the sauflon acquisition in the amount of $51.2 million that had been recorded in short-term debt. our current cash balance and availability under

coopervision net sales the contact lens market has two major product categories:
•   spherical lenses including lenses that correct near- and farsightedness uncomplicated by more complex visual defects.
•   toric and multifocal lenses including lenses that, in addition to correcting near- and farsightedness, address more complex visual defects such as astigmatism and presbyopia by adding optical properties of cylinder and axis, which correct for irregularities in the shape of the cornea.

the cooper companies, inc. and subsidiaries management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in order to achieve comfortable and healthy contact lens wear, products are sold with recommended replacement schedules, often defined as modalities, with the primary modalities being single-use, two-week and monthly. coopervision offers spherical, aspherical, toric, multifocal and toric multifocal lens products in most modalities.
single-use lenses are designed for daily replacement and frequently replaced lenses are designed for two-week or monthly replacement. significantly, the market for spherical lenses is growing with value-added spherical lenses to alleviate dry eye symptoms, to reduce eye fatigue from use of digital devices, to add aspherical optical properties, and/or higher oxygen permeable lenses such as silicone hydrogels.
coopervision's silicone hydrogel biofinity brand spherical, toric and multifocal contact lenses, avaira brand spherical and toric lenses and myday brand spherical and toric lenses, are manufactured using proprietary aquaform technology to increase oxygen transmissibility for longer wear. our silicone hydrogel clariti brand spherical, toric and multifocal contact lenses are available in monthly and single-use modalities. we believe the clariti single-use silicone hydrogel lens products provide a competitive advantage in approved markets as clariti is the only single-use silicone hydrogel lens available in all vision correction categories - spherical, toric and multifocal.
coopervision's proclear brand aspheric, toric and multifocal contact lenses, manufactured using pc technologytm, help enhance tissue/device compatibility and offer improved lens comfort.
coopervision fiscal 2016 net sales increased 6% from fiscal 2015 to $1.58 billion. net sales growth included increases in total sphere lenses up 6%, representing 55% of net sales, the same as in the prior year, primarily on sales of biofinity, clariti, and myday lenses, offset by declines in older products. total toric lenses grew 9%, representing 30% of net sales, the same as in the prior year, predominantly on sales of biofinity and clariti products. total multifocal lenses grew 5%, representing 11% of net sales, the same as in the prior year, primarily from growth in sales of biofinity and clariti products. total silicone hydrogel products, including biofinity, clariti, myday and avaira, grew 15%, representing 60% of net sales up from 55% in the prior year.
coopervision competes in the worldwide soft contact lens market and services three primary regions: the americas, emea (europe, middle east and africa) and asia pacific.

coopervision fiscal 2015 net sales growth was partially offset by foreign exchange rate fluctuations, which decreased net sales by $138.4 million. americas net sales growth was primarily due to market gains of silicone hydrogel contact lenses including biofinity, clariti and myday partially offset by a decrease in sales of older hydrogel lens products. emea net sales growth was primarily driven by sales of clariti and myday silicone hydrogel lenses. the increase in emea net sales was partially offset by the negative impact from the weakening of foreign currencies compared to the united states dollar. net sales to the asia pacific region decreased due to the negative impact from the weakening of foreign currencies, primarily the japanese yen, compared to the united states dollar. excluding the impact of currency, sales in the asia pacific region grew on market gains of silicone hydrogel lenses, including biofinity, clariti and myday, along with growth in sales of proclear 1 day lenses.
coopervision's net sales growth was driven primarily by increases in the volume of lenses sold, including recently introduced silicone hydrogel products and products from the acquisition of sauflon. while unit growth and product mix have influenced coopervision's sales growth, average realized prices by product have not materially influenced sales growth.
coopersurgical net sales coopersurgical supplies the market for family health care with a diversified portfolio of products and services for use in surgical and other medical procedures that are performed primarily by obstetricians and gynecologists in hospitals, surgical centers, fertility clinics and in the medical office. fertility offerings include highly specialized products and services that target the in vitro fertilization (ivf) process with a goal to make fertility treatment safer, more efficient and convenient.

coopersurgical's net sales of medical office and surgical procedures in fiscal 2015 decreased compared to the prior year due to declines in sales of medical equipment partially offset by growth in sales of disposable products. the net sales decline in fertility products was primarily due to the negative impact from the weakening of foreign currencies compared to the united states dollar. excluding the impact of currency, sales grew on market gains of products and services recently acquired with reprogenetics and sales of our existing fertility products were flat compared to the prior year.
unit growth and product mix, primarily sales of fertility products, along with increased average realized prices on disposable products also influenced sales growth.

coopervision's gross margin in fiscal 2016 remained flat compared to fiscal 2015. gross margin was impacted positively from an increase in sales of higher margin products including biofinity, offset by the negative effects of foreign currency changes that unfavorably impacted gross margin as we reported lower net sales due to the weakening of foreign currencies as compared to the united states dollar. fiscal 2016 and 2015 gross margins were negatively impacted by product and equipment rationalization charges and the related severance costs, arising from our review of sauflon's products, materials and manufacturing processes, and facility start-up costs of $65.2 million and $69.6 million, respectively.
the decrease in coopervision's gross margin in fiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2014 is primarily attributable to the negative effects of foreign currency changes, product and equipment rationalization costs and facility start-up costs. foreign currency unfavorably impacted gross margin as we reported lower net sales due to the weakening of the foreign currencies compared to the united states dollar. gross margin was negatively impacted by product and equipment rationalization charges and the related severance costs, arising from our review of sauflon's products, materials and manufacturing processes. in addition, gross margin was negatively impacted by costs associated with the start-up of new manufacturing facilities. the decrease in gross margin was partially offset by the increase in sales of higher margin products including biofinity.
coopersurgical's decrease in gross margin in fiscal 2016, compared to fiscal 2015 is primarily due to a change in product mix arising from sales of recently acquired lower margin products and services.
coopersurgical's gross margin remained flat in fiscal 2015 compared fiscal 2014, primarily due to an improved mix of higher margin products offset by the unfavorable impact of foreign currency as we reported lower net sales partially due to the weakening of foreign currencies compared to the united states dollar.

the decrease in coopervision's sga in fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015 in absolute dollars is primarily due to lower litigation settlement, legal and related lobbying costs consisting of $2.9 million in the current year compared to $19.8 million in the prior year. the litigation, legal and related lobbying costs were related to the class action complaints filed against coopervision and other contact lens manufacturers, distributors and retailers relating to upp, as well as a $17.0 million settlement made to jjvc in the third quarter of fiscal 2015. the reduction in sga expense is also due to lower sauflon restructuring and integration activities of approximately $9.0 million in fiscal 2016, compared to $24.5 million in the prior year. coopervision's sga excluding legal, restructuring and integration activities discussed above, increased due to investment in sales and marketing, including headcount, to promote our silicone hydrogel products and to reach new customers and support geographic expansion.

the cooper companies, inc. and subsidiaries management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the increase in coopervision's sga in fiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2014 in absolute dollars is primarily due to operating expenses of sauflon. coopervision's sga also included approximately $24.5 million primarily for restructuring and integration costs, largely made up of professional fees and personnel related costs for transitional employees related to sauflon restructuring and integration activities. fiscal 2015 sga expenses also include $19.8 million of litigation settlement and legal costs, of which $17.0 million relates to the settlement to intellectual property claims by jjvc, as well as litigation costs relating to the class action complaints filed against coopervision and other contact lens manufacturers, distributors and retailers relating to upp.
the increase in coopersurgical's sga in fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015 in absolute dollars is primarily due to the inclusion of operating expenses of recently acquired companies as well as $11.3 million of acquisition and integration expenses in fiscal 2016 compared to $4.9 million in the prior year. coopersurgical continues to invest in sales activities to promote our products and to reach new customers.
the decrease in coopersurgical's sga in fiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2014 in absolute dollars is primarily due to efficiencies as a result of cost control measures partially offset by approximately $4.9 million primarily for integration costs and costs related to the acquisition of reprogenetics in our fiscal fourth quarter of 2015. the increase in coopersurgical's sga in fiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2014 as a percentage of net sales reflects the acquisition and acquisition costs along with lower net sales in the current year. coopersurgical continues to invest in sales activities to promote our products and to reach new customers.
the decrease in corporate sga in fiscal 2016 compared to the prior year in absolute dollars is primarily due to lower share-based compensation costs and efficiencies achieved as a result of cost control measures. the decrease in corporate sga in fiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2014 in absolute dollars is due to lower share-based compensation costs, mainly attributable to the timing of grants.

the sequential increases in amortization are due primarily to amortization of intangible assets acquired in recent acquisitions by coopersurgical, the recent acquisition of soflex by coopervision in september 2016, and the acquisition of sauflon by coopervision in august 2014. the increase in coopervision's amortization expense in fiscal 2016 compared to 2015 was also due to a charge of $2.3 million in the fiscal first quarter of 2016 to write off acquired in-process research and development. we expect amortization in fiscal 2017 to be approximately $14.6 million in each of the fiscal first through fourth quarters primarily due to intangible assets acquired through our acquisitions, offset by intangible assets which we forecast to become fully amortized.

the cooper companies, inc. and subsidiaries management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations restructuring and integration costs during the fiscal fourth quarter of 2014, in connection with the sauflon acquisition, our coopervision business unit initiated restructuring and integration activities to optimize operational synergies of the combined companies. the 2014 sauflon integration plan activities included workforce reductions, consolidation of duplicative facilities and product rationalization. as of october 31, 2016, our activities related to this restructuring and integration plan were complete. the total restructuring costs under this plan were $148.3 million, as discussed in our notes to consolidated financial statements.
in fiscal 2016, we recorded in cost of sales $56.4 million of expense, arising from production-related asset disposals, accelerated depreciation on equipment, and inventory rationalization, primarily related to older lens products, based on our review of products, materials and manufacturing processes of sauflon. we recorded in cost of sales $1.1 million of employee termination costs. we recorded in selling, general and administrative expense a reduction of $1.1 million due to a decrease in expected employee termination payments; and we recorded $0.2 million of expense for lease termination costs. in addition, coopervision incurred $10.0 million of integration costs in fiscal 2016, included in operating expenses.
in fiscal 2015, we recorded in cost of sales $57.7 million of expense, arising from production-related asset disposals and accelerated depreciation on equipment, primarily related to our hydrogel lenses, based on our review of products, materials and manufacturing processes of sauflon. we recorded in cost of sales $4.0 million of employee termination costs. we recorded in selling, general and administrative expense a reduction of $7.2 million, as a result of decreased estimates in expected employee termination costs and voluntary terminations; and we recorded $0.4 million of expense for lease termination costs. we recorded in research and development expense $0.7 million of employee termination costs. in addition, coopervision incurred $35.2 million of integration costs in fiscal 2015, included in operating expenses. see note 3. restructuring and integration costs for additional information.
we may, from time to time, decide to pursue additional restructuring activities that involve charges in future periods.

interest expense increased in absolute dollars in fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015 reflecting higher average debt as a result of debt incurred in connection with recent acquisitions. interest expense increased in absolute dollars and as a percentage of net sales in fiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2014 reflecting higher average debt as a result of debt incurred in connection with the august 2014 acquisition of sauflon as well as higher interest rates on our revolving credit agreement as such interest rates vary based on leverage. total debt was $1.33 billion, $1.35 billion and $1.38 billion at october 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. current period debt outstanding includes the $830.0 million term loan entered on march 1, 2016, $207.0 million of the $700.0 million term loan entered into on august 4, 2014, and $285.0 million of the $300.0 million term loan entered into on september 12, 2013.

provision for income taxes we recorded income tax expense of $20.7 million in fiscal 2016 compared to $10.3 million in fiscal 2015. our effective tax rate (etr) (provision for income taxes divided by pretax income) was 7.0% for fiscal 2016, 4.8% for fiscal 2015 and 8.3% for fiscal 2014. the etr in fiscal 2016 increased in comparison to fiscal 2015 due to an increase in foreign non-deductible integration and transaction expenses, partially offset by renewal of the r&d tax credit and lower state income taxes. the etr in fiscal 2015 decreased in comparison to fiscal 2014 partially due to discrete items and integration activities.
the etr is below the united states statutory rate as a majority of our taxable income is earned in foreign jurisdictions with lower tax rates. the ratio of domestic taxable income to worldwide taxable income has decreased over recent fiscal years effectively lowering the overall tax rate due to the fact that the tax rates in the majority of foreign jurisdictions where we operate are significantly lower than the statutory rate in the united states.
56
the cooper companies, inc. and subsidiaries management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the impact on our provision for income taxes of income earned in foreign jurisdictions being taxed at rates different than the united states federal statutory rate was a benefit of approximately $81.2 million and a foreign effective tax rate of approximately 3.5% in our fiscal year 2016 compared to $72.6 million and a foreign effective tax rate of approximately 5.6% in our fiscal year 2015. the foreign jurisdictions with lower tax rates compared to the united states federal statutory rate that had the most significant impact on our provision for foreign income taxes in the fiscal years presented include the united kingdom, barbados and puerto rico. see the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information.
share repurchases in december 2011, our board of directors authorized a share repurchase program and subsequently amended the total repurchase authorization to $500.0 million. the program has no expiration date and may be discontinued at any time. we did not repurchase any shares during fiscal 2016. during fiscal 2015, we repurchased 468 thousand shares of our common stock for $67.3 million at an average purchase price of $139.60 per share. at october 31, 2016, we had remaining authorization to repurchase about $118.4 million of our common stock. see the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information.
share-based compensation plans we grant various share-based compensation awards, including stock options, performance shares, restricted stock and restricted stock units. the share-based compensation and related income tax benefit recognized in the consolidated financial statements in fiscal 2016 was $29.9 million and $9.0 million, respectively, compared to $32.9 million and $10.2 million, respectively, in fiscal 2015. as of october 31, 2016, there was $72.7 million of total unrecognized share-based compensation cost related to non-vested awards: $11.3 million for stock options; $52.3 million for restricted stock units; and $9.1 million for performance shares. the unrecognized compensation is expected to be recognized over weighted average remaining vesting periods of 3.5 years for nonvested stock options, 3.2 years for restricted stock units and 1.7 years for performance shares. net proceeds (payments) related to share-based compensation awards for the fiscal years ended october 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 were approximately $7.2 million, $(4.8) million and $8.6 million, respectively.
we estimate the fair value of each stock option award on the date of grant using the black-scholes valuation model, which requires management to make estimates regarding expected option life, stock price volatility and other assumptions. the use of different assumptions could lead to a different estimate of fair value. the expected life of the stock option is based on the observed and expected time to post-vesting forfeiture and/or exercise. groups of employees that have similar historical exercise behavior are considered separately for valuation purposes. if our assumption for the expected life increased by one year, the fair value of an individual option granted in fiscal 2016 would have increased by approximately $3.50. to determine the stock price volatility, management considers implied volatility from publicly-traded options on the company's stock at the date of grant, historical volatility and other factors. if our assumption for stock price volatility increased by one percentage point, the fair value of an individual option granted in fiscal 2016 would have increased by approximately $1.06.
we estimate stock option forfeitures based on historical data for each employee grouping and adjust the rate of expected forfeitures periodically. the adjustment of the forfeiture rate will result in a cumulative catch-up adjustment in the period the forfeiture estimate is changed.
we grant performance units that provide for the issuance of common stock to certain executive officers and other key employees if the company achieves specified long-term performance goals over a three-year period. we estimate the fair value of each award on the date of grant based on the current market price of our common stock. the total amount of compensation expense recognized reflects our initial assumptions
57
the cooper companies, inc. and subsidiaries management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations of the achievement of the performance goals and the estimated forfeiture rates. we review our assessment of the probability of the achievement of the performance goals each fiscal quarter. if the goals are not achieved or it is determined that achievement of the goals is not probable, previously recognized compensation expense is adjusted to reflect the expected achievement. if we determine that achievement of the goals will exceed the original assessment, additional compensation expense is recognized.

working capital the increase in working capital at the end of fiscal 2016 from the end of fiscal 2015 was primarily due to the increase in cash balance generated from operations, increases in accounts receivable and other current assets offset by decreases in inventories, decreases in accounts payable and other current liabilities, and net decrease in short-term debt of $17.5 million.
the $2.0 million decrease in inventories was primarily related to decreases in inventories from sales and write-offs of older products, partially offset by increased production to support product launches of single-use lenses including clariti and myday, and acquired inventories from coopersurgical acquisitions. our inventory months on hand (moh) were 5.6 and 6.2 at october 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. our inventory moh after adjusting for product rationalization costs related to sauflon and facility start-up costs were 6.7 at october 31, 2016, representing a decrease from october 31, 2015 of 7.5 that was adjusted for product rationalization costs related to sauflon and facility start-up costs. our days sales outstanding (dso) decreased to 53 days at october 31, 2016, compared to 57 days at october 31, 2015 primarily due to increased revenue and timing of collections.
we have reviewed our needs in the united states for possible repatriation of undistributed earnings or cash of our foreign subsidiaries. we presently intend to continue to indefinitely invest all earnings and cash outside of the united states of all foreign subsidiaries to fund foreign investments or meet foreign working capital and property, plant and equipment requirements.
operating cash flow cash flow provided by operating activities in fiscal 2016 continued to be our major source of liquidity, at $509.6 million compared to $391.0 million in fiscal 2015 and $454.8 million in fiscal 2014. fiscal 2016 results include $274.9 million of net income and non-cash items primarily made up of $198.3 million related to depreciation and amortization, $29.9 million of share-based compensation and $30.6 million of charges
59
the cooper companies, inc. and subsidiaries management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations primarily for write-off of property, plant and equipment related to sauflon restructuring, partially offset by $19.8 million related to excess tax benefits from share-based compensation. results also include changes in operating assets and liabilities, which primarily reflects the decrease in inventories of $12.2 million mainly due to product sales and older products rationalization excluding the increases related to recently acquired companies, increase in accounts receivables and other assets of $3.5 million, increase in accounts payable and other liabilities of $4.1 million, and decrease in income tax payable of $8.9 million. the $118.7 million increase in cash flows provided by operating activities in fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015 is primarily due to the increase in net income, favorable changes in working capital, and the negative impact in fiscal 2015 due to the $17.0 million settlement with jjvc.
fiscal 2015 results include $205.1 million of net income and non-cash items primarily made up of $191.4 million related to depreciation and amortization, $32.9 million of expense and $17.3 million of excess tax benefits both related to share-based compensation, $10.3 million related to net gains in currency translation, $42.4 million related to loss on retirement of property, plant and equipment. results also include changes in operating assets and liabilities, which primarily reflect the increases in inventories and other assets of $46.8 million, the increases in trade and other receivables of $7.3 million, and the increase of $1.2 million relating to taxes. the $63.9 million decrease in cash flows provided by operating activities in fiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2014 is primarily due to the decrease in net income, the $17.0 million settlement with jjvc in the fiscal third quarter of 2015, and unfavorable changes in working capital.
for fiscal 2016, our primary source of cash flows provided by operating activities was cash collections from our customers for purchase of our products. our primary uses of cash flows from operating activities were for personnel and material costs along with cash payments of $23.7 million for interest.
for fiscal 2015, our primary source of cash flows provided by operating activities was cash collections from our customers for purchase of our products. our primary uses of cash flows from operating activities were for personnel and material costs along with cash payments of $14.0 million for interest, and $17.0 million settlement with jjvc.
investing cash flow cash used in investing activities of $418.8 million in fiscal 2016 was for capital expenditures of $152.6 million primarily to increase manufacturing capacity and payments of $266.1 million primarily related to coopersurgical acquisitions in fiscal 2016.
cash used in investing activities of $287.9 million in fiscal 2015 was for capital expenditures of $243.0 million primarily to increase manufacturing capacity and payments of $44.9 million related to acquisitions, primarily the acquisition of reprogenetics in the fiscal fourth quarter of 2015.

the cooper companies, inc. and subsidiaries management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations financing cash flow the changes in cash flows from financing activities primarily relate to borrowings and payments of debt as well as share repurchases and share-based compensation awards.
cash used in financing activities of $1.4 million in fiscal 2016 was driven by $15.0 million net repayment of debt, $12.6 million for debt acquisition costs, $3.4 million mainly related to the purchase of noncontrolling interests, $2.9 million for dividends, offset by $27.0 million in excess tax benefits and proceeds from share-based compensation awards, and $5.5 million of proceeds from construction allowance.
cash used in financing activities of $106.7 million in fiscal 2015 was driven by $67.3 million in payments for share repurchases under our existing share repurchase plan, $37.3 million from net repayments of debt, $8.1 million for purchases of noncontrolling interests, net payments of $4.8 million related to vested share-based compensation awards, a $3.2 million payment for contingent consideration, $2.9 million for dividends, and distributions of $1.1 million to noncontrolling interests. cash used in financing activities was partially offset by $17.3 million in excess tax benefits from share-based compensation awards and $0.7 million of proceeds from a construction allowance. net repayment of debt in the period includes the payment of $51.2 million to settle all the outstanding loan notes issued for the sauflon acquisition.
at october 31, 2016, we had $100.8 million in cash, predominantly outside the united states, and $999.8 million available under our 2016 credit agreement. the $830.0 million term loan entered into on march 1, 2016, $207.0 million of the $700.0 million term loan entered into on august 4, 2014, $285.0 million of the $300.0 million term loan entered into on september 12, 2013, were outstanding as of october 31, 2016. we are in compliance with our financial covenants including the interest coverage ratio at 24.27 to 1.00 and the total leverage ratio at 1.95 to 1.00. as defined in both the 2016 credit agreement and our term loan agreements, we are required to maintain an interest coverage ratio of at least 3.00 to 1.00, and a total leverage ratio of no higher than 3.75 to 1.00.

the expected future benefit payments for pension plans through 2026 are disclosed in note 10. employee benefits.
we are unable to reliably estimate the timing of future payments related to uncertain tax positions; therefore, about $30.4 million of our long-term income taxes payable have been excluded from the table above. however, other long-term liabilities, included in our consolidated balance sheet, include these uncertain tax positions. see note 6. income taxes for additional information.
inflation and changing prices inflation has had no appreciable effect on our operations in the last three fiscal years.
accounting pronouncements issued and not yet adopted in october 2016, the fasb issued accounting standards update ("asu") 2016-16, income taxes (topic 740): intra-entity transfers of assets other than inventory, which requires entities to recognize the income tax consequences on an intra-entity transfer of an asset other than inventory when the transfer occurs. the asu changes the timing of the recognition of the income tax consequences of non-inventory transfers which under current guidance defers the income tax consequences until the asset is sold to an outside party or otherwise recognized. the guidance for the amendments of asu 2016-16 requires companies to apply a modified retrospective approach with a cumulative catch-up adjustment to opening retained earnings in the period of adoption. we are currently evaluating the impact of asu 2016-16 which is effective for the company in our fiscal year and interim periods beginning on november 1, 2018.
in march 2016, the fasb issued asu 2016-09, stock compensation (topic 718): improvements to employee share-based payment accounting, which is intended to improve the accounting for share-based payment transactions as part of the fasb's simplification initiative. the asu changes the following aspects of the accounting for share-based payment award transactions, including: accounting for income taxes; classification of excess tax benefits on the statement of cash flows; forfeitures; minimum statutory tax withholding requirements; and classification of employee taxes paid on the statement of cash flows when an employer withholds shares for tax-withholding purposes. we are currently evaluating the impact of asu 2016-09, which is effective for the company in our fiscal year and interim periods beginning on november 1, 2017.
62
the cooper companies, inc. and subsidiaries management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in february 2016, the fasb issued asu 2016-02, leases (topic 842). asu 2016-02 requires that a lessee recognize the assets and liabilities that arise from operating leases. a lessee should recognize in the statement of financial position a liability to make lease payments (the lease liability) and a right-of-use asset representing its right to use the underlying asset for the lease term. for leases with a term of 12 months or less, a lessee is permitted to make an accounting policy election by class of underlying asset not to recognize lease assets and lease liabilities. in transition, lessees and lessors are required to recognize and measure leases at the beginning of the earliest period presented using a modified retrospective approach. we are currently evaluating the impact of asu 2016-02, which is effective for the company in our fiscal year and interim periods beginning on november 1, 2019.
in november 2015, the fasb issued asu 2015-17, balance sheet classification of deferred taxes, which requires entities to present all deferred tax assets and liabilities as noncurrent. the amendments in the asu are effective for the company in our fiscal year and interim periods beginning on november 1, 2017. the company does not expect the new guidance to have a material impact on the company's consolidated financial statements.
in may 2014, the fasb issued asu 2014-09, revenue from contracts with customers (topic 606). asu 2014-09 requires revenue recognition to depict the transfer of goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. asu 2014-09 sets forth a new revenue recognition model that requires identifying the contract, identifying the performance obligations, determining the transaction price, allocating the transaction price to performance obligations and recognizing the revenue upon satisfaction of performance obligations. the amendments in the asu can be applied either retrospectively to each prior reporting period presented or retrospectively with the cumulative effect of initially applying the update recognized at the date of the initial application along with additional disclosures. we are currently evaluating the impact of asu 2014-09, which is effective for the company in our fiscal year beginning on november 1, 2018.
accounting pronouncements recently adopted in september 2015, the fasb issued asu 2015-16, business combinations: simplifying the accounting for measurement-period adjustments (topic 850). asu 2015-16 requires that an acquirer recognizes adjustments to provisional amounts that are identified during the measurement period in the reporting period in which the adjustment amounts are determined. the effect on earnings as a result of the change to the provisional amounts, calculated as if the accounting had been completed as of the acquisition date, must be recorded in the reporting period in which the adjustment amounts are determined rather than retrospectively. asu 2015-16 is effective for fiscal years beginning after december 15, 2015, including interim periods within those fiscal years. the amendment should be applied prospectively to adjustments to provisional amounts that occur after the effective date of the guidance, with early adoption permitted for financial statements that have not been issued. we elected to early adopt this guidance on a prospective basis for the quarter ended july 31, 2016.  such adoption did not have a material impact to our consolidated financial position.
in april 2015, the fasb issued accounting standards update (asu) 2015-03, interest - imputation of interest (subtopic 835-30) simplifying the presentation of debt issuance costs. the amendments in this update require that debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability, consistent with debt discounts. asu 2015-03 is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after december 15, 2016. early adoption is permitted. we elected to early adopt this guidance as a change in accounting principle on a retrospective basis in the fiscal first quarter ended january 31, 2016. as of january 31, 2016 and october
63
the cooper companies, inc. and subsidiaries management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations
31, 2015, we have presented debt issuance costs related to our term loans, previously reported in other assets, as direct deductions from the carrying amount of the debt liability. we also presented the debt issuance costs related to our revolving credit facility as a deferred asset within other assets, as permitted by asu 2015-15, imputation of interest, which was issued in august 2015. such adoption did not have a material impact to our consolidated financial position.
estimates and critical accounting policies management estimates and judgments are an integral part of financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america (gaap). we believe that the critical accounting policies described in this section address the more significant estimates required of management when preparing our consolidated financial statements in accordance with gaap. we consider an accounting estimate critical if changes in the estimate may have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations. we believe that the accounting estimates employed are appropriate and resulting balances are reasonable; however, actual results could differ from the original estimates, requiring adjustment to these balances in future periods.
•   revenue recognition - we recognize product net sales, net of discounts, returns and rebates in accordance with related accounting standards and sec staff accounting bulletins. as required by these standards, we recognize revenue when it is realized or realizable and earned, based on terms of sale with the customer, where persuasive evidence of an agreement exists, delivery has occurred, the seller's price is fixed and determinable and collectability is reasonably assured. for contact lenses as well as coopersurgical medical devices, surgical instruments, accessories, diagnostic products and services, this primarily occurs when title and risk of ownership transfers to our customers, and/or when services are rendered. we believe our revenue recognition policies are appropriate in all circumstances, and that our policies are reflective of our customer arrangements. we record, based on historical statistics, estimated reductions to revenue for customer incentive programs offered including cash discounts, promotional and advertising allowances, volume discounts, contractual pricing allowances, rebates and specifically established customer product return programs. we record taxes collected from customers on a net basis, as these taxes are not included in net sales.
•   net realizable value of inventory - in assessing the value of inventories, we make estimates and judgments regarding aging of inventories and other relevant issues potentially affecting the saleable condition of products and estimated prices at which those products will sell. on an ongoing basis, we review the carrying value of our inventory, measuring number of months on hand and other indications of saleability. we reduce the value of inventory if there are indications that the carrying value is greater than market, resulting in a new, lower-cost basis for that inventory. subsequent changes in facts and circumstances do not result in the restoration or increase in that newly established cost basis. while estimates are involved, historically, obsolescence has not been a significant factor due to long product dating and lengthy product life cycles. we target to keep, on average, five to seven months of inventory on hand to maintain high customer service levels given the complexity of our contact lens and women's health care product portfolios.
•   valuation of goodwill - we account for goodwill and evaluate our goodwill balances and test them for impairment annually during the fiscal third quarter and when an event occurs or circumstances change such that it is reasonably possible that impairment may exist in accordance with related accounting standards. we performed our annual impairment test in our fiscal third quarter of 2016, and our analysis indicated that we had no impairment of goodwill. we performed our annual impairment test in our fiscal third quarter of 2015 and concluded that we had no impairment of goodwill in that year.
64
the cooper companies, inc. and subsidiaries management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in fiscal 2016 and 2015, we performed qualitative assessments to test each reporting unit's goodwill for impairment. qualitative factors considered in this assessment include industry and market considerations, overall financial performance and other relevant events and factors affecting each reporting unit. based on our qualitative assessment, if we determine that the fair value of a reporting unit is more likely than not to be less than its carrying amount, the two-step impairment test will be performed.
initially, we compare the book value of net assets to the fair value of each reporting unit that has goodwill assigned to it. if the fair value is determined to be less than the book value, a second step is performed to compute the amount of the impairment. a reporting unit is the level of reporting at which goodwill is tested for impairment. our reporting units are the same as our business segments - coopervision and coopersurgical - reflecting the way that we manage our business.
goodwill impairment analysis and measurement is a process that requires significant judgment. if our common stock price trades below book value per share, there are changes in market conditions or a future downturn in our business, or a future annual goodwill impairment test indicates an impairment of our goodwill, we may have to recognize a non-cash impairment of our goodwill that could be material, and could adversely affect our results of operations in the period recognized and also adversely affect our total assets, stockholders' equity and financial condition.
•   business combinations - we routinely consummate business combinations. results of operations for acquired companies are included in our consolidated results of operations from the date of acquisition. we recognize separately from goodwill, the identifiable assets acquired, including acquired in-process research and development, the liabilities assumed, and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree at the acquisition date fair values as defined by accounting standards related to fair value measurements. as of the acquisition date, goodwill is measured as the excess of consideration given, generally measured at fair value, and the net of the acquisition date fair values of the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed. direct acquisition costs are expensed as incurred.
•   income taxes - we account for income taxes under the asset and liability method. deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases, and for tax losses and tax credit carryforwards. deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. in assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.
as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements, we must estimate our income tax expense for each of the jurisdictions in which we operate. this process requires significant management judgments and involves estimating our current tax exposures in each jurisdiction including the impact, if any, of additional taxes resulting from tax examinations as well as judging the recoverability of deferred tax assets. to the extent recovery of deferred tax assets is not likely based on our estimation of future taxable income in each jurisdiction, a valuation allowance is established. tax exposures can involve complex issues and may require an extended period to resolve. frequent changes in tax laws in each jurisdiction complicate future estimates. to determine the tax rate, we are required to estimate full-year income and the related income tax expense in each jurisdiction. we update the estimated effective tax rate for the effect of significant unusual items as

regarding accounting for uncertainty in income taxes, we recognize the benefit from a tax position only if it is more likely than not that the position would be sustained upon audit based solely on the technical merits of the tax position. we measure the income tax benefits from the tax positions that are recognized, assess the timing of the derecognition of previously recognized tax benefits and classify and disclose the liabilities within the consolidated financial statements for any unrecognized tax benefits based on the guidance in the interpretation of related accounting guidance for income taxes. the interpretation also provides guidance on how the interest and penalties related to tax positions may be recorded and classified within our consolidated statement of income and presented in the consolidated balance sheet. we classify interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions as additional income tax expense.
•   share-based compensation - we grant various share-based compensation awards, including stock options, performance unit shares, restricted stock and restricted stock units. under fair value recognition provisions, share-based compensation expense is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense over the vesting period. determining the fair value of share-based awards at the grant date requires judgment, including estimating cooper's stock price volatility, employee exercise behaviors and related employee forfeiture rates.
the expected life of the share-based awards is based on the observed and expected time to post-vesting forfeiture and/or exercise. groups of employees that have similar historical exercise behavior are considered separately for valuation purposes. in determining the expected volatility, management considers implied volatility from publicly-traded options on cooper's common stock at the date of grant, historical volatility and other factors. the risk-free interest rate is based on the continuous rates provided by the united states treasury with a term equal to the expected life of the award. the dividend yield is based on the projected annual dividend payment per share, divided by the stock price at the date of grant.
as share-based compensation expense recognized in our consolidated statement of income is based on awards ultimately expected to vest, the amount of expense has been reduced for estimated forfeitures. forfeitures are estimated at the time of grant, based on historical experience, and revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates.
if factors change and we employ different assumptions in the application of the fair value recognition provisions, the compensation expense that we record in future periods may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the current period.

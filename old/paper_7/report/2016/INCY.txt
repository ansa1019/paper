item 7.  management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with "selected consolidated financial data" and the consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this report. overview incyte is a biopharmaceutical company focused on the discovery, development and commercialization of proprietary therapeutics. our global headquarters is located in wilmington, delaware and we conduct our european clinical development operations from our offices in geneva, switzerland and lausanne, switzerland.
jakafi (ruxolitinib) is our first product to be approved for sale in the united states. it is an oral jak1 and jak2 inhibitor and was approved by the u.s. food and drug administration (fda) in november 2011 for the treatment of patients with intermediate or high‐risk myelofibrosis and in december 2014 for the treatment of patients with polycythemia vera who have had an inadequate response to or are intolerant of hydroxyurea. myelofibrosis and polycythemia vera are both rare blood cancers.
under our collaboration agreement with novartis international pharmaceutical ltd., novartis received exclusive development and commercialization rights to ruxolitinib outside of the united states for all hematologic and oncologic indications and sells ruxolitinib outside of the united states under the name jakavi.  in april 2016, we amended this agreement to provide that novartis has exclusive research, development and commercialization rights outside of the united states to ruxolitinib (excluding topical formulations) in the graft-versus-host-disease field.
we have a second oral jak1 and jak2 inhibitor, baricitinib, which is subject to a collaboration agreement with eli lilly and company in which lilly received exclusive worldwide development and commercialization rights for the compound for inflammatory and autoimmune diseases. in january 2016, lilly submitted a new drug application (nda) to the fda and a marketing authorization application (maa) to the european medicines agency for baricitinib as treatment for mild-to-moderately severe rheumatoid arthritis. in march 2016, we entered into an amendment to the agreement with lilly that amended the non-compete provision of the agreement to allow us to engage in the development and commercialization of ruxolitinib in the graft-versus-host-disease field.  in january 2017, the fda extended the review period for the new drug application (nda) for baricitinib by three months. in february 2017, the european commission approved baricitinib, which will be marketed as olumiant®, for the treatment of moderate to severe active rheumatoid arthritis in adult patients who have responded inadequately to, or who are intolerant to, one or more disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs.
in june 2016, we acquired (the "acquisition") from ariad pharmaceuticals, inc. all of the outstanding shares of ariad pharmaceuticals (luxembourg) s.a.r.l., the parent company of ariad's european subsidiaries responsible for the development and commercialization of iclusig in the european union and other countries, including switzerland, norway, turkey, israel and russia.  we obtained an exclusive license to develop and commercialize iclusig in those countries. iclusig is approved in the european union for the treatment of patients with chronic myeloid leukemia and
54
philadelphia-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia who are resistant to or intolerant of certain second generation bcr-abl inhibitors and all patients who have the t3151 mutation.
since we began our drug-discovery and development activities in early 2002, we have filed investigational new drug (ind) applications and progressed multiple internally developed proprietary compounds into clinical development. as of february 14, 2017, our development portfolio, including ruxolitinib, was comprised of 17 candidates against 13 molecular targets.
license agreements and business relationships as part of our business strategy, we establish business relationships, including collaborative arrangements with other companies and medical research institutions to assist in the clinical development and/or commercialization of certain of our drugs and drug candidates and to provide support for our research programs. we also evaluate opportunities for acquiring products or rights to products and technologies that are complementary to our business from other companies and medical research institutions.
below is a brief description of our significant business relationships and collaborations and related license agreements that expand our pipeline and provide us with certain rights to existing and potential new products and technologies.
novartis in november 2009, we entered into a collaboration and license agreement with novartis. under the terms of the agreement, novartis received exclusive development and commercialization rights outside of the united states to our jak inhibitor ruxolitinib and certain back‐up compounds for hematologic and oncology indications, including all hematological malignancies, solid tumors and myeloproliferative diseases. we retained exclusive development and commercialization rights to jakafi (ruxolitinib) in the united states and in certain other indications. novartis also received worldwide exclusive development and commercialization rights to our c‐met inhibitor compound capmatinib and certain back‐up compounds in all indications. we retained options to co‐develop and to co‐promote capmatinib in the united states.
under this agreement, we received an upfront payment and immediate milestone payment totaling $210.0 million and were initially eligible to receive additional payments of up to approximately $1.2 billion if defined development and commercialization milestones are achieved. in 2016, 2015, and 2014, we received $45.0 million, $65.0 million, and $92.0 million, respectively, in milestone payments under this agreement. we are also eligible to receive tiered, double‐digit royalties ranging from the upper‐teens to the mid‐twenties on future ruxolitinib net sales outside of the united states, and tiered, worldwide royalties on future capmatinib net sales that range from 12% to 14%. in addition, novartis has received reimbursement and pricing approval for ruxolitinib in a specified number of countries, and we are now obligated to pay to novartis tiered royalties in the low single digits on future ruxolitinib net sales within the united states. during the years ended december 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, such royalties payable to novartis on net sales within the united states totaled $36.8 million, $24.4 million and $2.2 million, respectively, and are reflected in cost of product revenues on the consolidated statements of operations. each company is responsible for costs relating to the development and commercialization of ruxolitinib in its respective territories, with costs of collaborative studies shared equally. novartis is also responsible for all costs relating to the development and commercialization of capmatinib. jakafi is sold outside of the united states by novartis under the name jakavi. for the years ended december 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, we recorded $110.7 million, $74.8 million and $49.0 million, respectively, of product royalty revenues related to novartis net sales of jakavi.
in april 2016, we amended this agreement to provide that novartis has exclusive research, development and commercialization rights outside of the united states to ruxolitinib (excluding topical formulations) in the graft-versus-host-disease ("gvhd") field. under this amendment, we received a $5.0 million payment in exchange for the development and commercialization rights to ruxolitinib in gvhd outside of the united states and became eligible to receive up to $75.0 million of additional potential development and regulatory milestones relating to gvhd.

agenus in january 2015, we entered into a license, development and commercialization agreement with agenus inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiary, 4-antibody ag (now known as agenus switzerland inc.), which we collectively refer to as agenus. under this agreement, the parties have agreed to collaborate on the discovery of novel immuno-therapeutics using agenus' antibody discovery platforms. in february 2017, we and agenus amended this agreement.
under the terms of this agreement, as amended, we received exclusive worldwide development and commercialization rights to four checkpoint modulators directed against gitr, ox40, lag-3 and tim-3. in addition to the initial four program targets, we and agenus have the option to jointly nominate and pursue additional targets within the framework of the collaboration, and in november 2015, three more targets were added. targets may be designated profit-share programs, where all costs and profits are shared equally by us and agenus, or royalty-bearing programs, where we are responsible for all costs associated with discovery, preclinical, clinical development and commercialization activities. the programs relating to gitr and ox40 and two of the undisclosed targets were profit-share programs until february 2017, while the other targets currently under collaboration are royalty-bearing programs.  the february 2017 amendment converted the programs relating to gitr and ox40 to royalty-bearing programs and removed from the collaboration the profit-share programs relating to the two undisclosed targets, with one reverting to us and one reverting to agenus.  should any of those removed programs be successfully developed by a party, the other party will be eligible to receive the same milestone payments as the royalty-bearing programs and royalties at a 15% rate on global net sales.  there are currently no profit-share programs.  for each royalty-bearing product other than gitr and ox40, agenus will be eligible to receive tiered royalties on global net sales ranging from 6% to 12%.  for gitr and ox40, agenus will be eligible to receive 15% royalties on global net sales. under the february 2017 amendment, we paid agenus $20 million in accelerated milestones relating to the clinical development of the gitr and ox40 programs.  agenus is eligible to receive up to an additional $510 million in future contingent development, regulatory and commercialization milestones across all programs in the collaboration.  the agreement may be terminated by us for convenience upon 12 months' notice and may also be terminated under certain other circumstances, including material breach.
in connection with entering into the agenus agreement, in january 2015, we purchased approximately 7.76 million shares of agenus inc. common stock for an aggregate purchase price of $35.0 million in cash, or approximately $4.51 per share.  we agreed to certain standstill provisions under the license agreement as described in note 6 of notes to consolidated financial statements. in february 2017, in connection with amending the agenus agreement, we purchased 10.0 million shares of agenus inc. common stock for an aggregate purchase price of $60.0 million in cash, or $6.00 per share.
hengrui in september 2015, we entered into a license and collaboration agreement with jiangsu hengrui medicine co., ltd.  under the terms of this agreement, we received exclusive development and commercialization rights worldwide, with the exception of mainland china, hong kong, macau and taiwan, to incshr1210, an investigational pd-1 monoclonal antibody, and certain back-up compounds.  we paid to hengrui an upfront payment of $25.0 million. hengrui is also eligible to receive potential milestone payments of up to $770.0 million, consisting of $90.0 million for regulatory approval milestones, $530.0 million for commercial performance milestones, and $150.0 million for a clinical superiority milestone.  also, hengrui may be eligible to receive tiered royalties in the high-single digits to mid-double digits based on net sales in our territories. each company will be responsible for costs relating to the development and commercialization of the pd-1 monoclonal antibody in its respective territories.  the dose-escalation portion of the proof-of-concept clinical trial of incshr1210 in patients with advanced solid tumors has been completed. enrollment of new subjects into the trial has been suspended in order to perform a thorough assessment of the compound's profile before proceeding to enroll any additional subjects.
the agreement will continue on a country-by-country basis until we have no royalty payment obligations with respect to such country or, if earlier, the termination of the agreement in accordance with its terms. the agreement may be terminated in its entirety by us for convenience, and may also be terminated under certain other circumstances, including material breach.

critical accounting policies and significant estimates the preparation of financial statements requires us to make estimates, assumptions and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. on an on‐going basis, we evaluate our estimates. we base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form our basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. actual results may differ from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements:
·   revenue recognition;

·   research and development costs;

·   stock compensation;

·   convertible debt accounting;

·   income taxes;

·   business combinations; and

·   contingent consideration.

revenue recognition. revenues are recognized when (1) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, (2) delivery has occurred or services have been rendered, (3) the price is fixed or determinable and (4) collectability is reasonably assured. revenues are deferred for fees received before earned or until no further obligations exist. we exercise judgment in determining that collectability is reasonably assured or that services have been delivered in accordance with the arrangement. we assess whether the fee is fixed or determinable based on the payment terms associated with the transaction and whether the sales price is subject to refund or adjustment. we assess collectability based primarily on the customer's payment history and on the creditworthiness of the customer.
60
product revenues our product revenues consist of u.s. sales of jakafi and european sales of iclusig.  product revenues are recognized once we meet all four revenue recognition criteria described above. in november 2011, we began shipping jakafi to our customers in the u.s., which include specialty pharmacies and wholesalers. in june 2016, we acquired the right to and began shipping iclusig to our customers in the european union and certain other jurisdictions, which include retail pharmacies, hospital pharmacies and distributors.
we recognize revenues for product received by our customers net of allowances for customer credits, including estimated rebates, chargebacks, discounts, returns, distribution service fees, patient assistance programs, and government rebates, such as medicare part d coverage gap reimbursements in the u.s. product shipping and handling costs are included in cost of product revenues.
customer credits: our customers are offered various forms of consideration, including allowances, service fees and prompt payment discounts. we expect our customers will earn prompt payment discounts and, therefore, we deduct the full amount of these discounts from total product sales when revenues are recognized. service fees are also deducted from total product sales as they are earned.
rebates and discounts: allowances for rebates include mandated discounts under the medicaid drug rebate program in the u.s. and mandated discounts in europe in markets where government-sponsored healthcare systems are the primary payers for healthcare. rebate amounts are based upon contractual agreements or legal requirements with public sector benefit providers. rebates are amounts owed after the final dispensing of the product to a benefit plan participant and are based upon contractual agreements or legal requirements with public sector benefit providers. the accrual for rebates is based on statutory discount rates and expected utilization as well as historical data we have accumulated since product launch. our estimates for expected utilization of rebates are based on data received from our customers. rebates are generally invoiced and paid in arrears so that the accrual balance consists of an estimate of the amount expected to be incurred for the current quarter's activity, plus an accrual balance for known prior quarters' unpaid rebates. if actual future rebates vary from estimates, we may need to adjust prior period accruals, which would affect revenue in the period of adjustment.
chargebacks: chargebacks are discounts that occur when certain contracted customers, which currently consist primarily of group purchasing organizations, public health service institutions, non‐profit clinics, and federal government entities purchasing via the federal supply schedule, purchase directly from our wholesalers. contracted customers generally purchase the product at a discounted price. the wholesalers, in turn, charges back to us the difference between the price initially paid by the wholesalers and the discounted price paid by the contracted customers. in addition to actual chargebacks received, we maintain an accrual for chargebacks based on the estimated contractual discounts on the inventory levels on hand in our distribution channel.  if actual future chargebacks vary from these estimates, we may need to adjust prior period accruals, which would affect revenue in the period of adjustment.
medicare part d coverage gap: medicare part d prescription drug benefit mandates manufacturers to fund 50% of the medicare part d insurance coverage gap for prescription drugs sold to eligible patients. our estimates for the expected medicare part d coverage gap are based on historical invoices received and in part from data received from our customers. funding of the coverage gap is generally invoiced and paid in arrears so that the accrual balance consists of an estimate of the amount expected to be incurred for the current quarter's activity, plus an accrual balance for known prior quarters. if actual future funding varies from estimates, we may need to adjust prior period accruals, which would affect revenue in the period of adjustment.
co‐payment assistance: patients who have commercial insurance and meet certain eligibility requirements may receive co‐payment assistance. we accrue a liability for co‐payment assistance based on actual program participation and estimates of program redemption using data provided by third‐party administrators.

product royalty revenues royalty revenues on commercial sales for jakavi by novartis are estimated based on information provided by novartis. we exercise judgment in determining whether the information provided is sufficiently reliable for us to base our royalty revenue recognition thereon. if actual royalties vary from estimates, we may need to adjust the prior period which would affect royalty revenue in the period of adjustment. cost of product revenues cost of product revenues includes all jakafi related product as well as iclusig related product costs. the acquired iclusig inventories were recorded at fair value less costs to sell in connection with the acquisition, and will result in a higher cost of iclusig product revenues over the period in which this inventory is sold, which is expected to be over a one year period from the acquisition date.  in addition, cost of product revenues include low single digit royalties under our collaboration and license agreement to novartis on all future sales of jakafi in the united states. subsequent to the acquisition on june 1, 2016, cost of product revenues also includes the amortization of our licensed intellectual property for iclusig using the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of 12.5 years.      contract and license revenues under agreements involving multiple deliverables, services and/or rights to use assets that we entered into prior to january 1, 2011, the multiple elements are divided into separate units of accounting when certain criteria are met, including whether the delivered items have stand‐alone value to the customer and whether there is objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of the undelivered items. when separate units of accounting exist, consideration is allocated among the separate elements based on their respective fair values. the determination of fair value of each element is based on objective evidence from historical sales of the individual elements by us to other customers. if such evidence of fair value for each undelivered element of the arrangement does not exist, all revenue from the arrangement is deferred until such time that evidence of fair value for each undelivered element does exist or until all elements of the arrangement are delivered. when elements are specifically tied to a separate earnings process, revenue is recognized when the specific performance obligation tied to the element is completed. when revenues for an element are not specifically tied to a separate earnings process, they are recognized ratably over the term of the agreement. we assess whether a substantive milestone exists at the inception of our agreements. for all milestones within our arrangements that are considered substantive, we recognize revenue upon the achievement of the associated milestone. if a milestone is not considered substantive, we would recognize the applicable milestone payment over the remaining period of performance under the arrangement. as of december 31, 2016, all remaining potential milestones under our collaborative arrangements are considered substantive.
on january 1, 2011, updated guidance on the recognition of revenues for agreements with multiple deliverables became effective and applies to any agreements we may enter into on or after january 1, 2011. this updated guidance (i) relates to whether multiple deliverables exist, how the deliverables in a revenue arrangement should be separated and how the consideration should be allocated; (ii) requires companies to allocate revenues in an arrangement using estimated selling prices of deliverables if a vendor does not have vendor‐specific objective evidence or third‐party evidence of selling price; and (iii) eliminates the use of the residual method and requires companies to allocate revenues using the relative selling price method. during the years ended december 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014, we did not enter into any agreements that are subject to this updated guidance. if we enter into an agreement with multiple deliverables after january 1, 2011 or amend existing agreements, this updated guidance could have a material effect on our financial statements.
our collaborations often include contractual milestones, which typically relate to the achievement of pre‐specified development, regulatory and commercialization events. these three categories of milestone events reflect the three stages of the life‐cycle of our drugs, which we describe in more detail in the following paragraphs.
the regulatory review and approval process, which includes preclinical testing and clinical trials of each drug candidate, is lengthy, expensive and uncertain. securing approval by the u.s. food and drug administration (fda) requires the submission of extensive preclinical and clinical data and supporting information to the fda for each indication to establish a drug candidate's safety and efficacy. the approval process takes many years, requires the expenditure of
62
substantial resources, involves post‐marketing surveillance and may involve ongoing requirements for post‐marketing studies. before commencing clinical investigations of a drug candidate in humans, we must submit an investigational new drug application (ind), which must be reviewed by the fda.
the steps generally required before a drug may be marketed in the united states include preclinical laboratory tests, animal studies and formulation studies, submission to the fda of an ind for human clinical testing, performance of adequate and well‐controlled clinical trials in three phases, as described below, to establish the safety and efficacy of the drug for each indication, submission of a new drug application (nda) or biologics license application (bla) to the fda for review and fda approval of the nda or bla.
similar requirements exist within foreign regulatory agencies as well. the time required satisfying the fda requirements or similar requirements of foreign regulatory agencies may vary substantially based on the type, complexity and novelty of the product or the targeted disease.
preclinical testing includes laboratory evaluation of product pharmacology, drug metabolism, and toxicity, which includes animal studies, to assess potential safety and efficacy as well as product chemistry, stability, formulation, development, and testing. the results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information and analytical data, are submitted to the fda as part of an ind. the fda may raise safety concerns or questions about the conduct of the clinical trials included in the ind, and any of these concerns or questions must be resolved before clinical trials can proceed. we cannot be sure that submission of an ind will result in the fda allowing clinical trials to commence. clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational drug or the marketed drug to human subjects under the supervision of qualified investigators and in accordance with good clinical practices regulations covering the protection of human subjects. clinical trials typically are conducted in three sequential phases, but the phases may overlap or be combined. phase i usually involves the initial introduction of the investigational drug into healthy volunteers to evaluate its safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution and excretion. phase ii usually involves clinical trials in a limited patient population to evaluate dosage tolerance and optimal dosage, identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, and evaluate and gain preliminary evidence of the efficacy of the drug for specific indications. phase iii clinical trials usually further evaluate clinical efficacy and safety by testing the drug in its final form in an expanded patient population, providing statistical evidence of efficacy and safety, and providing an adequate basis for labeling. we cannot guarantee that phase i, phase ii or phase iii testing will be completed successfully within any specified period of time, if at all. furthermore, we, the institutional review board for a trial, or the fda may suspend clinical trials at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk.
generally, the milestone events contained in our collaboration agreements coincide with the progression of our drugs from development, to regulatory approval and then to commercialization. the process of successfully discovering a new development candidate, having it approved and successfully commercialized is highly uncertain. as such, the milestone payments we may earn from our partners involve a significant degree of risk to achieve. therefore, as a drug candidate progresses through the stages of its life‐cycle, the value of the drug candidate generally increases.
research and development costs. our policy is to expense research and development costs as incurred. we often contract with clinical research organizations (cros) to facilitate, coordinate and perform agreed upon research and development of a new drug. to ensure that research and development costs are expensed as incurred, we record monthly accruals for clinical trials and preclinical testing costs based on the work performed under the contract.
these cro contracts typically call for the payment of fees for services at the initiation of the contract and/or upon the achievement of certain clinical trial milestones. in the event that we prepay cro fees, we record the prepayment as a prepaid asset and amortize the asset into research and development expense over the period of time the contracted research and development services are performed. most professional fees, including project and clinical management, data management, monitoring, and medical writing fees are incurred throughout the contract period. these professional fees are expensed based on their percentage of completion at a particular date. our cro contracts generally include pass through fees. pass through fees include, but are not limited to, regulatory expenses, investigator fees, travel costs, and other miscellaneous costs, including shipping and printing fees. we expense the costs of pass through fees under our cro contracts as they are incurred, based on the best information available to us at the time. the estimates of the pass through fees incurred are based on the amount of work completed for the clinical trial and are monitored through correspondence
63
with the cros, internal reviews and a review of contractual terms. the factors utilized to derive the estimates include the number of patients enrolled, duration of the clinical trial, estimated patient attrition, screening rate and length of the dosing regimen. cro fees incurred to set up the clinical trial are expensed during the setup period.
under our clinical trial collaboration agreements, we may be reimbursed for certain development costs incurred. such costs are recorded as a reduction of research and development expense in the period in which the related expense is incurred.
stock compensation. share-based payment transactions with employees, which include stock options, restricted stock units (rsus) and performance shares (psus), are recognized as compensation expense over the requisite service period based on their estimated fair values as well as expected forfeiture rates.  the stock compensation process requires significant judgment and the use of estimates, particularly surrounding black-scholes assumptions such as stock price volatility over the option term and expected option lives, as well as expected forfeiture rates and the probability of psus vesting.  the fair value of stock options, which are subject to graded vesting, are recognized as compensation expense over the requisite service period using the accelerated attribution method.  the fair value of rsus that are subject to cliff vesting are recognized as compensation expense over the requisite service period using the straight line attribution method, and the fair value of rsus that are subject to graded vesting are recognized as compensation expense over the requisite service period using the accelerated attribution method.  the fair value of psus are recognized as compensation expense beginning at the time in which the performance conditions are deemed probable of achievement, over the remaining requisite service period. we recorded $96.2 million, $69.9 million and $62.2 million of stock compensation expense for the years ended december 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.
convertible debt accounting. we perform an assessment of all embedded features of a debt instrument to determine if (1) such features should be bifurcated and separately accounted for, and (2) if bifurcation requirements are met, whether such features should be classified and accounted for as equity or liability instruments. if the embedded feature meets the requirements to be bifurcated and accounted for as a liability, the fair value of the embedded feature is measured initially, included as a liability on the consolidated balance sheets, and re‐measured to fair value at each reporting period. any changes in fair value are recorded in the consolidated statement of operations. we monitor, on an ongoing basis, whether events or circumstances could give rise to a change in our classification of embedded features.
we determined the embedded conversion options in the 0.375% convertible senior notes due 2018 (the 2018 notes) and the 1.25% convertible senior notes due 2020 (the 2020 notes) are not required to be separately accounted for as derivatives. however, since the 2018 notes and the 2020 notes can be settled in cash or common shares or a combination of cash and common shares at our option, we are required to separate the 2018 notes and 2020 notes into a liability and equity component. the carrying amount of the liability component is calculated by measuring the fair value of a similar liability that does not have an associated equity component. the carrying amount of the equity component representing the embedded conversion option is determined by deducting the fair value of the liability component from the initial proceeds. the excess of the principal amount of the liability component over its carrying amount is amortized to interest expense over the expected life of the 2018 notes and 2020 notes using the effective interest method. the equity component is not re‐measured as long as it continues to meet the conditions for equity classification for contracts in an entity's own equity.
the fair value of the liability component of the 2018 notes was estimated at $299.4 million at issuance. therefore, the difference between the $375.0 million face value of the 2018 notes at issuance and the $299.4 million estimated fair value of the liability component will be amortized to interest expense over the term of the 2018 notes through november 15, 2018 using the effective interest method.
the fair value of the liability component of the 2020 notes was estimated at $274.8 million at issuance. therefore, the difference between the $375.0 million face value of the 2020 notes at issuance and the $274.8 million estimated fair value of the liability component will be amortized to interest expense over the term of the 2020 notes through november 15, 2020 using the effective interest method.
the estimated fair value of the liability components at the date of issuance for the 2018 notes and 2020 notes were determined using valuation models and are complex and subject to judgment. significant assumptions within the
64
valuation models included an implied credit spread, the expected volatility and dividend yield of our common stock and the risk free interest rate for notes with a similar term.
prior to may 14, 2014, the 2018 notes and 2020 notes were not convertible except in connection with a make‐whole fundamental change, as defined in the respective indentures. beginning on, and including, may 15, 2014, the 2018 notes and 2020 notes are convertible prior to the close of business on the business day immediately preceding may 15, 2018, in the case of the 2018 notes, and may 15, 2020, in the case of the 2020 notes, only under the following circumstances: (1) during any calendar quarter commencing after the calendar quarter ending on march 31, 2014 (and only during such calendar quarter), if the last reported sale price of our common stock for at least 20 trading days (whether or not consecutive) during a period of 30 consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of the immediately preceding calendar quarter is greater than or equal to 130% of the conversion price for the 2018 notes or 2020 notes, as applicable, on each applicable trading day; (2) during the five business day period after any five consecutive trading day period (the measurement period) in which the trading price per $1,000 principal amount of 2018 notes or 2020 notes, as applicable, for each trading day of the measurement period was less than 98% of the product of the last reported sale price of our common stock and the conversion rate for the 2018 notes or 2020 notes, as applicable, on each such trading day; or (3) upon the occurrence of specified corporate events. on or after may 15, 2018, in the case of the 2018 notes, and may 15, 2020, in the case of the 2020 notes, until the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding the relevant maturity date, the notes are convertible at any time, regardless of the foregoing circumstances. upon conversion we will pay or deliver, as the case may be, cash, shares of common stock or a combination of cash and shares of common stock, at our election.
on a quarterly basis, we perform an assessment in order to determine whether the 2018 notes or 2020 notes have become convertible at the option of the holder, based on meeting any of the conversion criteria described above. should either the 2018 notes or the 2020 notes become convertible, we then assess our intent and ability to settle the 2018 notes or the 2020 notes in cash, shares of common stock, or a combination of cash and shares of common stock, in order to determine the appropriate classification of the 2018 notes and the 2020 notes at the balance sheet date. on january 1, 2017, the 2018 notes and 2020 notes became convertible through at least march 31, 2017, based on meeting the conversion criteria related to the sale price of our common stock during the calendar quarter ended december 31, 2016 as described above. management's intent is to settle any conversions of 2018 notes or 2020 notes in common shares and, therefore, the 2018 and 2020 notes are reflected in long term liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet as of december 31, 2016.
income taxes. we account for income taxes using an asset and liability approach to financial accounting for income taxes.  under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statement carrying amounts and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for years in which the basis differences are expected to reverse. we periodically assess the likelihood of the realization of deferred tax assets, and reduce the carrying amount of these deferred tax assets to an amount that is considered to be more-likely-than-not realizable.  our assessment considers recent cumulative earnings experience, projections of future taxable income (losses) and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies.  when performing our assessment on projections of future taxable income (losses), we consider factors such as the likelihood of regulatory approval and commercial success of products currently under development, among other factors.   significant judgment is required in making this assessment and, to the extent that a reversal of any portion of our valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets is deemed appropriate, a tax benefit will be recognized against our income tax provision in the period of such reversal.
we do not recognize a tax benefit for an uncertain tax position unless it is more-likely-than-not that the position will be sustained upon examination based on the technical merits of the position. the tax benefit that is recorded for these positions is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement.  we adjust the level of the liability to reflect any subsequent changes in the relevant facts surrounding the uncertain positions.   any interest and penalties on uncertain tax positions are included within the tax provision.
all tax effects associated with intercompany transfers of assets within our consolidated group are recorded as a prepaid tax or deferred charge and recognized through the consolidated statement of operations when the asset is sold to a third party or otherwise recovered through amortization of the asset's remaining economic life.
65
business combinations. acquired businesses are accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting, which requires that assets acquired and liabilities assumed be recorded at fair value, with limited exceptions.  any excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill.  transaction costs are expensed as incurred.  the operating results of the acquired business are reflected in our consolidated financial statements after the date of acquisition. acquired in-process research and development ("ipr&d") is recognized at fair value and initially characterized as an indefinite-lived intangible asset, irrespective of whether the acquired ipr&d has an alternative future use.  when the related research and development is completed, the asset will be assigned a useful life and amortized.  acquired intellectual property rights are recognized at fair value and amortized over the estimated useful life.
the fair value of an ipr&d intangible asset acquired in the acquisition was determined using an income approach.  the assumptions used to estimate the cash flows of the ipr&d (which relates to the potential approval of iclusig as a second line treatment) included a probability of technical success ("pts") of 25%, discount rate of 16%, estimated gross margins of 98%, income tax rates ranging from 7.8% in periods in which we have established tax holidays to 13.8% thereafter, and operating expenses consisting of direct costs based on the anticipated level of revenues as well as probability weighted milestone payments estimated for 2020 related to the clinical results and potential approval of iclusig in second line.
the fair value of licensed intellectual property rights acquired in the acquisition was determined using an income approach. the assumptions used to estimate the cash flows of the licensed intellectual property from the acquisition included a discount rate of 15%, estimated gross margins of 98%, income tax rates ranging from 7.8% in periods in which we have established tax holidays to 13.8% thereafter, and operating expenses consisting of direct costs based on the anticipated level of revenues as well as the $7.0 million of research and development cost sharing payments we have agreed to fund in 2016 and 2017.
indefinite-lived intangible assets, including ipr&d, are tested for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances between annual tests indicate that the asset may be impaired.  impairment losses on indefinite-lived intangible assets are recognized based solely on a comparison of the fair value of the asset to its carrying value.
long-lived assets, including licensed intellectual property rights, with finite lives are tested for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable.  if indicators of impairment are present, the asset is tested for recoverability by comparing the carrying value of the asset to the related estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be derived from the asset.  if the expected cash flows are less than the carrying value of the asset, then the asset is considered to be impaired and its carrying value is written down to fair value, based on the related estimated discounted future cash flows.
goodwill is calculated as the difference between the acquisition date fair value of the consideration transferred and the values assigned to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed.  goodwill is not amortized but is tested for impairment at least annually at the reporting unit level.  a reporting unit is the same as, or one level below, an operating segment. our operations are currently comprised of a single, entity wide reporting unit.
acquisition-related contingent consideration.  acquisition-related contingent consideration, which consists of our future royalty and certain potential milestone obligations to ariad, is recorded on the acquisition date at the estimated fair value of the obligation, in accordance with the acquisition method of accounting.  the fair value measurement is based on significant inputs that are unobservable in the market and thus represents a level 3 measurement.
the preliminary fair value of contingent consideration was determined using an income approach based on estimated iclusig revenues in our licensed territory for both the approved third line treatment, as well as the second line treatment which is currently under development and is therefore contingent on future clinical results and european medicines agency approval. the pts of the second line indication was estimated at 25% based on the early stage of development and competitive market landscape, and the estimated future cash flows for the second line indication were probability weighted accordingly. the total projected cash flows of the third line and second line indications were estimated over 18 years, and discounted to present value using a discount rate of 10%. in addition, based on the believed limited effectiveness of iclusig beyond the existing oncology indications, the fact that no development is currently
66
ongoing for any new oncology or any non-oncology indications, and the lack of intention by us and ariad to develop iclusig in additional oncology or non-oncology indications, the fair value of any cash flows for any new oncology or non-oncology was determined to be nil.
the fair value of the acquisition-related contingent consideration is remeasured each reporting period, with changes in fair value recorded in the consolidated statements of operations.  changes in the fair value of the acquisition-related contingent consideration can result from changes to one or multiple inputs including projected revenues, discount rates and the pts of the second line indication for iclusig.   these inputs are analyzed on a quarterly basis as changes to the inputs could have a material impact on the amount of acquisition-related contingent consideration recorded during the reporting period.

government rebates and chargebacks are the most significant component of our sales allowances. increases in certain government reimbursement rates are limited to a measure of inflation, and when the price of a drug increases faster than this measure of inflation it will result in a penalty adjustment factor that causes a larger sales allowance to those government related entities. we expect government rebates and chargebacks as a percentage of our gross product sales will continue to increase in connection with any future jakafi price increases greater than the rate of inflation, and any such increase in these government rebates and chargebacks will have a negative impact on our reported product revenues, net. we adjust our estimates for government rebates and chargebacks based on new information regarding actual rebates as it becomes available.  claims by third-party payors for rebates and chargebacks are frequently submitted after the period in which the related sales occurred, which may result in adjustments to prior period accrual balances in the period in which the new information becomes available.  we also adjust our allowance for product returns based on new information regarding actual returns as it becomes available.
we expect our sales allowances to fluctuate from quarter to quarter as a result of the medicare part d coverage gap, the volume of purchases eligible for government mandated discounts and rebates as well as changes in discount percentages which are impacted by potential future price increases, rate of inflation, and other factors.
product royalty revenues on commercial sales of jakavi by novartis are based on net sales of licensed products in licensed territories as provided by novartis. our net product royalty revenues for the years ended december 31, 2016 and 2015, were $110.7 million and $74.8 million, respectively.
our contract revenues were $112.5 million and $77.9 million for the years ended december 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. for the years ended december 31, 2016 and 2015, contract revenues were derived from the straight line recognition of revenue associated with the lilly upfront fees over the estimated performance period as well as milestone payments from lilly and novartis earned during the periods. the upfront fees related to the lilly agreement consisted of a $90.0 million upfront payment received in 2010. the increase in contract revenues from 2015 to 2016 primarily relates to the recognition of $65.0 million in milestone payments from novartis in 2015 compared to the recognition of $45.0 million in milestone payments from novartis and $55.0 million in milestone payments from lilly in 2016.

we began capitalizing inventory in mid‐november 2011 once the fda approved jakafi as the related costs were expected to be recoverable through the commercialization of the product. costs incurred prior to fda approval of $9.6 million were recorded as research and development expenses in our statements of operations prior to commercialization of jakafi. at december 31, 2016, inventory with $0.8 million of product costs incurred prior to fda approval had not yet been sold. we expect to sell the pre‐commercialization inventory over the next 3 to 6 months. as a result, cost of product revenues for the next 3 to 6 months will reflect a lower average per unit cost of materials. the acquired iclusig inventories were recorded at fair value less costs to sell in connection with the acquisition, and will result in a higher cost of iclusig product revenues over the period in which this inventory is sold, which is expected to be over a one year period from the acquisition date.  in addition, cost of product revenues includes low single digit royalties to novartis on all sales of jakafi in the united states. subsequent to the acquisition on june 1, 2016 of ariad's european operations, cost of product revenues also includes the amortization of our licensed intellectual property for iclusig using the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of 12.5 years.
cost of product revenues was $58.2 million and $27.0 million for the years ended december 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. cost of product revenues increased from 2015 to 2016 due primarily to an increase of $12.4 million in royalties to novartis on all jakafi sales in the united states and amortization of $12.6 million of our licensed intellectual property acquired on june 1, 2016.

we currently account for research and development costs by natural expense line and not costs by project. salary and benefits related expense increased from 2015 to 2016 due primarily to increased development headcount to sustain our development pipeline. stock compensation expense may fluctuate from period to period based on the number of awards granted, stock price volatility and expected award lives, as well as expected award forfeiture rates which are used to value equity‐based compensation.
the increase in clinical research and outside services expense from 2015 to 2016 was primarily the result of increased development costs to advance our clinical pipeline and the $35.0 million payment to acquire the rights from lilly to develop ruxolitinib for the treatment of patients with graft-versus-host-disease, as well as an additional $27.3 million of research and development costs incurred under the agenus and hengrui arrangements through december 31, 2016.  research and development expenses for the years ended december 31, 2016 and 2015 were net of $13.4 million and $6.8 million, respectively, of costs reimbursed by our collaborative partners. research and development expenses may fluctuate from period to period depending upon the stage of certain projects and the level of pre‐clinical and clinical trial related activities. many factors can affect the cost and timing of our clinical trials, including requests by regulatory agencies for more information, inconclusive results requiring additional clinical trials, slow patient enrollment, adverse side effects among patients, insufficient supplies for our clinical trials and real or perceived lack of effectiveness or safety of our investigational drugs in our clinical trials. in addition, the development of all of our products will be subject to extensive governmental regulation. these factors make it difficult for us to predict the timing and costs of the further development and approval of our products.
in july 2010, we elected to co‐develop baricitinib with lilly in rheumatoid arthritis and we are responsible for funding 30% of the associated future global development costs for this indication from the initiation of the phase iib trial
69
through regulatory approval. research and development expenses recorded under the lilly agreement representing 30% of the global development costs for baricitinib for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis were $27.3 million and $36.0 million for the years ended december 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. we have retained certain mechanisms to give us cost protection as baricitinib advances in clinical development. we can defer our portion of co-development study costs by indication if they exceed a predetermined level. this deferment would be credited against future milestones or royalties and we would still be eligible for the full incremental royalties related to the co-development option. in addition, even if we have started co-development funding for any indication, we can at any time opt out, which will stop future co-development cost sharing. if we elect to do this we would still be eligible for our base royalties plus an incremental pro-rated royalty commensurate with our contribution to the total co-development cost for those indications for which we contributed funding.

salary and benefits related expense increased from 2015 to 2016 due to increased headcount. this increased headcount was due primarily to the ongoing commercialization efforts related to jakafi for intermediate or high‐risk myelofibrosis and uncontrolled polycythemia vera, as well as increased headcount related to the acquisition on june 1, 2016. stock compensation expense may fluctuate from period to period based on the number of awards granted, stock price volatility and expected award lives, as well as expected award forfeiture rates which are used to value equity‐based compensation. the increase in other contract services and outside costs was primarily the result of marketing activities for jakafi for intermediate or high‐risk myelofibrosis and uncontrolled polycythemia vera in addition to an increase in donations to independent non-profit patient assistance organizations in the united states.  selling, general and administrative expenses for the year ended december 31, 2016 includes expenses related to the acquisition on june 1, 2016.
change in fair value of acquisition-related contingent consideration acquisition-related contingent consideration, which consists of our future royalty and certain potential milestone obligations to ariad, was recorded on the acquisition date, june 1, 2016, at the estimated fair value of the obligation, in accordance with the acquisition method of accounting. the fair value of the acquisition-related contingent consideration was remeasured as of december 31, 2016, resulting in a change in fair value of $17.4 million which is recorded in change in fair value of acquisition-related contingent consideration on the consolidated statements of operations.  the change in fair value of the contingent consideration as of december 31, 2016 is primarily due to the time value of money as there were no other significant changes in the key assumptions used in the fair value calculation at the date of acquisition, including the discount rate utilized and the estimated future projections of iclusig revenues.
other income (expense)
interest and other income, net. interest and other income, net, for the years ended december 31, 2016 and 2015 was $4.4 million and $7.1 million, respectively.

unrealized loss on long term investment. the unrealized loss on our long term investment in agenus for the years ended december 31, 2016 and 2015, was $3.3 million and $4.6 million, respectively. the unrealized loss on long term investment is based on the change in fair value of agenus' common stock during the period.
provision for income taxes. the provision for income taxes for the years ended december 31, 2016 and 2015, was $3.2 million and $1.0 million, respectively. the increase in provision for income taxes primarily relates to an increase in state taxes due to higher income in 2016 sourced to certain states and foreign tax expense on acquired ariad operations.
years ended december 31, 2015 and 2014
we recorded net income for the year ended december 31, 2015 of $6.5 million and net loss for the year ended december, 31 2014 of $48.5 million. on a per share basis, basic net income was $0.04 and diluted net income was $0.03 for the year ended december 31, 2015 and basic and diluted net loss was $0.29 for the year ended 2014. revenues for the year ended, december 31,

government rebates and chargebacks are the most significant component of our sales allowances. increases in certain government reimbursement rates are limited to a measure of inflation, and when the price of a drug increases faster than this measure of inflation it will result in a penalty adjustment factor that causes a larger sales allowance to those government related entities.
product royalty revenues on commercial sales of jakavi by novartis are based on net sales of licensed products in licensed territories as provided by novartis. our net product royalty revenues for the years ended december 31, 2015 and 2014, were $74.8 million and $49.0 million, respectively.
our contract revenues were $77.9 million and $104.8 million for the years ended december 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. for the years ended december 31, 2015 and 2014, contract revenues were derived from the straight line recognition of revenue associated with the lilly upfront fees over the estimated performance period as well as milestone
71
payments earned during the periods. the upfront fees related to the lilly agreement consisted of a $90.0 million upfront payment received in 2010. the decrease in contract revenues from 2014 to 2015 primarily relates to the recognition of $92.0 million in milestone payments from novartis in 2014 compared to the recognition of $65.0 million in milestone payments from novartis in 2015.
cost of product revenues we began capitalizing inventory in mid‐november 2011 once the fda approved jakafi as the related costs were expected to be recoverable through the commercialization of the product. costs incurred prior to fda approval of $9.6 million were recorded as research and development expenses in our statements of operations prior to commercialization of jakafi. at december 31, 2015, inventory with $1.5 million of product costs incurred prior to fda approval had not yet been sold.  commencing in october 2014, we became obligated to pay tiered, low‐single digit royalties to novartis on all sales of jakafi in the united states, which is included in cost of product revenues.
cost of product revenues was $27.0 million and $3.0 million for the years ended december 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. cost of product revenues increased from 2014 to 2015 due to an increase of $22.2 million for our obligation that commenced in october 2014 to pay royalties to novartis on all jakafi sales in the united states and an increase of $1.8 million related to manufacturing costs for jakafi sales.

sources and uses of cash.
we had net losses from inception in 1991 through 1996 and in 1999 through december 31, 2014. because of those losses, we had an accumulated deficit of $1.7 billion as of december 31, 2016. we have funded our research and development operations through sales of equity securities, the issuance of convertible notes, cash received from customers, and collaborative arrangements. at december 31, 2016, we had available cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of $808.5 million. our cash and marketable securities balances are held in a variety of interest‐bearing instruments,
73
including money market accounts, corporate debt securities and u.s. government securities. available cash is invested in accordance with our investment policy's primary objectives of liquidity, safety of principal and diversity of investments.
cash provided by operating activities. the $218.3 million increase in cash provided by operating activities from 2015 to 2016 was due primarily to net income in 2016 which was driven in part by the recognition of milestones from novartis of $45.0 million and eli lilly of $55.0 million, increased non‐cash depreciation and amortization and changes in working capital. the $60.2 million increase in cash provided by operating activities from 2014 to 2015 was due primarily to net income and changes in working capital.
cash used in investing activities. our investing activities, other than purchases, sales and maturities of marketable securities, have consisted predominantly of capital expenditures, cash used to acquire the ariad business and sales and purchases of long‐term investments. during 2016, net cash used in investing activities was $232.5 million, which represents purchases of marketable securities of $57.4 million, capital expenditures of $120.3 million, and acquisition of ariad pharmaceuticals (luxembourg) s.a.r.l. for net cash of $142.9 million, offset in part by the sale and maturity of marketable securities of $88.0 million.  during 2015, net cash used in investing activities was $105.0 million, which represents purchases of marketable securities of $108.2 million, capital expenditures of $26.0 million, and our long term investment in agenus of $39.8 million offset in part by the sale and maturity of marketable securities of $69.0 million.  during 2014, net cash used in investing activities was $138.4 million, which represents purchases of marketable securities of $134.1 million and capital expenditures of $27.9 million offset in part by sale and maturities of marketable securities of $23.5 million.  in the future, net cash used by investing activities may fluctuate significantly from period to period due to the timing of strategic equity investments, acquisitions, capital expenditures and maturities/sales and purchases of marketable securities.
cash provided by financing activities. during 2016, net cash provided by financing activities was $58.6 million, consisting primarily of proceeds from issuance of common stock under our stock plans and employee stock purchase plan. during 2015, net cash provided by financing activities was $87.6 million, consisting primarily of proceeds from issuance of common stock under our stock plans and employee stock purchase plan. during 2014, net cash provided by financing activities was $93.1 million, consisting primarily of proceeds from issuance of common stock under our stock plans and employee stock purchase plan.

we have entered into and may in the future seek to license additional rights relating to technologies or drug development candidates in connection with our drug discovery and development programs. under these licenses, we may be required to pay up‐front fees, milestone payments, and royalties on sales of future products, which are not reflected in the table above.
in september 2016, we entered into two agreements to purchase land and two buildings in wilmington, delaware for approximately $7.9 million. pursuant to the terms of the agreements, we have up to a 120-day due diligence period to review specified documents and perform building inspections prior to closing.  the closing date is to be no later than 30 days after the due diligence period.
we believe that our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities will be adequate to satisfy our capital needs for at least the next twelve months. our cash requirements depend on numerous factors, including our expenditures in connection with our drug discovery and development programs and commercialization operations; expenditures in connection with litigation or other legal proceedings; competing technological and market developments; the cost of filing,
74
prosecuting, defending and enforcing patent claims and other intellectual property rights; costs for future facility requirements; our receipt of any milestone or other payments under any collaborative agreements we may enter into, including the agreements with novartis and lilly; expenditures in connection with potential exchanges of our outstanding convertible senior notes; and expenditures in connection with strategic relationships and license agreements, including our agreements with agenus, ariad, calithera, hengrui and merus, strategic equity investments or potential acquisitions. changes in our research and development or commercialization plans or other changes affecting our operating expenses may result in changes in the timing and amount of expenditures of our capital resources.
off balance sheet arrangements we have no off‐balance sheet arrangements other than those that are discussed above.

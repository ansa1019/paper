item 7.   management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations

(dollars in millions, except per share amounts)
the following management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is intended to help the reader understand the results of operations and financial condition of honeywell international inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries (honeywell or the company) for the three years ended december 31, 2016. all references to notes relate to notes to financial statements in item 8. financial statements and supplementary data.
in july 2016, the company announced the realignment of the business units comprising its automation and control solutions reporting segment by forming two new reportable operating segments: home and building technologies and safety and productivity solutions. home and building technologies includes environmental & energy solutions, security and fire, and building solutions and distribution. additionally, the industrial combustion/thermal business, previously part of environmental & energy solutions in automation and control solutions, became part of performance materials and technologies. safety and productivity solutions includes sensing & productivity solutions and industrial safety, as well as the intelligrated business. under the realigned segment reporting structure, the company has four reportable operating segments: aerospace, home and building technologies, performance materials and technologies, and safety and productivity solutions. the company has reported its financial performance based on this realignment for all periods presented.
these realignments have no impact on the company's historical consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to current period segment presentation.
on september 16, 2016, the company completed the sale of the aerospace government services business, honeywell technology solutions inc. the assets and liabilities associated with honeywell technology solutions inc. have been removed from the company's consolidated balance sheet as of the effective date of the sale. the results of operations for honeywell technology solutions are included in the consolidated statement of operations through the effective date of the sale.
on october 1, 2016, the company completed the tax-free spin-off of its resins and chemicals business, part of performance materials and technologies, into a standalone, publicly-traded company (named advansix) to honeywell shareowners. the assets and liabilities associated with advansix have been removed from the company's consolidated balance sheet as of the effective date of the spin-off. the results of operations for advansix are included in the consolidated statement of operations through the effective date of the spin-off.
executive summary in 2016, honeywell successfully navigated a challenging macro-economic environment. we grew net sales 2% to $39,302 million, grew earnings per share of common stock - assuming dilution 3% to $6.20 and grew net income attributable to honeywell 1% to $4,809 million. we executed on cost reduction activities, accelerated our capital deployment strategy and improved the growth portfolio through acquisitions and divestitures, including the divestiture of honeywell technology solutions inc. and the tax-free spin-off of advansix. we also announced the realignment of the business units comprising our automation and control solutions segment to two new reportable operating segments, as previously mentioned. the company also announced a leadership succession plan for our chief executive officer and successfully executed leadership transitions in three of our four reportable operating segments.
we continued our balanced long-term focus on enhancing shareowner value without sacrificing growth investment, including maintaining r&d spending at 5% of sales, new product introductions aligned with global macroeconomic trends in energy, safety, security, productivity and global urbanization, over $300 million of new repositioning investments to improve our operations and increased investment in high growth regions. we also continued to enhance our software capabilities through the creation of a software center in the united states to staff more than 730 full-time product software engineers, who are in addition to the more than 11,000 software engineers already part of honeywell.

in 2016 we deployed capital of over $7.5 billion, including the following:
·                                                        mergers and acquisitions-we deployed over $2.5 billion during 2016, acquiring businesses that will be integrated into each of our four operating segments.
these acquisitions all share a software and technology focus and increase our existing deep alignment with enduring macro trends such as energy efficiency, clean energy generation, safety, security, productivity and global urbanization.

·   dividend-after a 15%
dividend rate increase in 2015, we increased our annual dividend rate by 12% in 2016, as we seek to continue to grow the dividend faster than earnings, marking the 12th dividend increase in the past 11 years.
·   share repurchases-we continue to opportunistically repurchase our shares with the goal of generally keeping share count flat and seeking to offset the dilutive impact of employee stock based compensation and savings plans. in 2016, we repurchased 19.3 million shares for $2.1 billion.
·   capital investment in facilities-we invested over $1 billion in capital expenditures focused on high return investments such as the expansion of facilities to manufacture our solstice® low global-warming potential refrigerant products and building new production facilities to make uop catalyst and absorbent products.
honeywell also completed refinancing of long-term debt through the issuance of €4,000 million senior notes in february and an additional $4,500 million senior notes in october. the proceeds from the offerings of senior notes were used to repurchase $2,200 million of senior notes outstanding, as well as repay outstanding commercial paper. we expect these refinancing activities will reduce our ongoing annual interest expense.

cost of products and services sold increased in 2016 compared with 2015 principally due to increased direct material costs of approximately $380 million (driven primarily by acquisitions, net of divestitures, partially offset by the favorable impact of productivity, net of inflation, and foreign currency translation), higher depreciation and amortization attributable to acquisitions of approximately $135 million and increased pension mark-to-market expense allocated to cost of products and services sold of $70 million, partially offset by higher pension and other postretirement benefits income allocated to cost of products and services sold of $200 million.
gross margin percentage increased in 2016 compared with 2015 principally due to higher gross margin in performance materials and technologies (approximately 0.6 percentage point impact) and higher pension and other postretirement benefits income allocated to cost of products and services sold (approximately 0.5 percentage point impact), partially offset by lower gross margin in aerospace, home and building solutions and safety and productivity solutions (approximately 0.7 percentage point impact collectively) and increased pension mark-to-market expense allocated to cost of products and services sold (approximately 0.2 percentage point impact).
cost of products and services sold decreased in 2015 compared with 2014 principally due to a decrease in direct and indirect material costs of approximately $1,460 million (driven primarily by the favorable impact of foreign currency translation, productivity, lower raw materials pass-through pricing and the absence of the friction materials business, partially offset by higher sales volume), a decrease in labor costs of approximately $450 million and higher pension income allocated to cost of products and services sold of approximately $230 million.
gross margin percentage increased in 2015 compared with 2014 principally due to higher gross margin in all of our business segments (approximately 2.0 percentage point impact collectively) and increased pension income allocated to cost of products and services sold (approximately 0.5 percentage point impact).
selling, general and administrative expenses
2016                2015                2014

for discussion of changes in the effective tax rate, see note 5 income taxes in the notes to financial statements.
the effective tax rates for 2016, 2015 and 2014 are lower than the u.s. statutory rate of 35% primarily due to lower tax rates on non-u.s. earnings, the vast majority of which we intend to permanently reinvest outside the united states.
the company currently expects the effective tax rate for 2017 to be approximately 25%. the effective tax rate can vary from quarter to quarter due to unusual or infrequently occurring items, the resolution of income tax audits, changes in tax laws or other items such as pension mark-to-market adjustments and the tax impact from employee share-based payments.
net income attributable to honeywell
2016                2015                2014

net income attributable to honeywell                            $4,809              $4,768              $4,239
earnings per share of common stock - assuming dilution           $6.20               $6.04               $5.33
earnings per share of common stock - assuming dilution increased in 2016 compared with 2015 primarily driven by increased pension and other postretirement income, higher segment profit in home and building technologies and performance materials and technologies, the gain related to the honeywell technology solutions, inc. divestiture, a decrease in the weighted average shares outstanding and the tax benefit from adoption of the fasb's accounting standard related to employee share-based payment accounting, partially offset by lower segment profit in aerospace and safety and productivity solutions, increased pension mark-to-market expense and higher repositioning and other charges.
earnings per share of common stock - assuming dilution increased in 2015 compared with 2014 primarily driven by increased segment profit in each of our business segments and lower pension and other postretirement expense, partially offset by increased tax expense and lower other income (principally due to the absence of a realized gain related to the prior year sale of marketable equity securities).
business overview our consolidated results are principally impacted by:

·                                                  change in global economic growth rates and industry conditions and demand in our key end markets;
·                                                  ability of recently acquired businesses to integrate and continue to operate and grow in accordance with the assumptions utilized in determining the acquisition purchase price;
·                                                  the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates (in particular the euro), relative to the u.s. dollar;
·                                                  the extent to which cost savings from productivity actions are able to offset or exceed the impact of material and non-material inflation; and
·                                                  the impact of the pension discount rate and asset returns on pension expense, including mark-to-market adjustments, and funding requirements.
our 2017 areas of focus which are generally applicable to each of our operating segments include:
·                                                  ensuring the successful completion of the leadership transition, which includes the chief executive officer and leaders for three of our operating segments, and continuing to execute on the realignment of our home and building technologies and safety and productivity solutions operating segments;
19

·   driving profitable organic growth through r&amp;d and technological excellence to deliver innovative products that customers value and expansion and localization of our footprint in high growth regions;

·   executing on our strategy to become a software-industrial company, which for us means products and services that facilitate the connected plane, home, building and factory;
·   executing disciplined, rigorous m&amp;a and integration processes to deliver growth through previously announced acquisitions;
·   expanding margins by maintaining and improving the company's cost structure through manufacturing and administrative process improvements, repositioning, and other productivity actions;
·   controlling corporate and other non-operating costs, including costs incurred for asbestos and environmental matters, pension and other post-retirement and income tax expense;
·   increasing availability of capital through strong cash flow conversion from effective working capital management and proactively managing debt levels to enable the company to smartly deploy capital for strategic acquisitions, dividends, share repurchases and capital expenditures.

2016 compared with 2015
aerospace sales decreased primarily due to higher incentives to original equipment manufacturers (oem incentives), a decrease in organic sales volumes and the honeywell technology solutions inc. divestiture, which was partially offset by growth from acquisitions.
·                                                                                                                                                      commercial original equipment sales decreased by 13% (decreased 12% organic) primarily due to higher oem incentives and decreased demand from business and general aviation original equipment manufacturers (oems), partially offset by higher shipments to air transport oems. consistent with broader aerospace industry trends, we expect the continuation of lower business and general aviation oem sales volumes.

·   commercial aftermarket sales increased by 3% (increased 3% organic) primarily driven by higher repair and overhaul activities and increased spares shipments.
·   defense and space sales decreased by 7% (decreased 6% organic) primarily due to declines in u.s. space and international defense programs, lower u.s. government services revenue, largely attributable to the impact of divestitures, and decreased demand from commercial helicopter oems, partially offset by sales from acquisitions.

liquidity each of our businesses is focused on implementing strategies to increase operating cash flows through revenue growth, margin expansion and improved working capital turnover. considering the current economic environment in which each of the businesses operate and their business plans and strategies, including the focus on growth, cost reduction and productivity initiatives, we believe that cash balances and operating cash flow will continue to be our principal source of liquidity. in addition to the available cash and operating cash flows, additional sources of liquidity include committed credit lines, short-term debt from the commercial paper markets, long-term borrowings, and access to the public debt and equity markets. at december 31, 2016, a substantial portion of the company's cash and cash equivalents were held by foreign subsidiaries. if the amounts held outside of the u.s. were to be repatriated, under current law, they would be subject to u.s. federal income taxes, less applicable foreign tax credits. however, our intent is to permanently reinvest the vast majority of these funds outside of the u.s. it is not practicable to estimate the amount of tax that might be payable if some or all of such earnings were to be repatriated, and the amount of foreign tax credits that would be available to reduce or eliminate the resulting u.s. income tax liability.

we monitor the third-party depository institutions that hold our cash and cash equivalents on a daily basis. our emphasis is primarily safety of principal and secondarily maximizing yield of those funds. we diversify our cash and cash equivalents among counterparties to minimize exposure to any one of these entities.
a source of liquidity is our ability to issue short-term debt in the commercial paper market. commercial paper notes are sold at a discount and have a maturity of not more than 365 days from date of issuance. borrowings under the commercial paper program are available for general corporate purposes as well as for financing acquisitions. the weighted average interest rate on short-term borrowings and commercial paper outstanding as of december 31, 2016 was (0.13%) and as of december 31, 2015 was 0.26%.
our ability to access the commercial paper market, and the related cost of these borrowings, is affected by the strength of our credit rating and market conditions. our credit ratings are periodically reviewed by the major independent debt-rating agencies. as of december 31, 2016, standard and poor's (s&p), fitch, and moody's have ratings on our long-term debt of a, a and a2 and short-term debt of a-1, f1 and p1. s&p, fitch and moody's have honeywell's rating outlook as "stable." to date, the company has not experienced any limitations in our ability to access these sources of liquidity.
we also have a current shelf registration statement filed with the securities and exchange commission under which we may issue additional debt securities, common stock and preferred stock that may be offered in one or more offerings on terms to be determined at the time of the offering. net proceeds of any offering would be used for general corporate purposes, including repayment of existing indebtedness, share repurchases, capital expenditures and acquisitions.
see note 2 acquisitions and divestitures and note 12 long-term debt and credit agreements of notes to financial statements for additional discussion of items impacting our liquidity.
in 2016, the company repurchased $2,079 million of outstanding shares to offset the dilutive impact of employee stock based compensation plans, including option exercises, restricted unit vesting and matching contributions under our savings plans. in april 2016, the board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to a total of $5 billion of honeywell common stock, of which $4.1 billion remained available as of december 31, 2016 for additional share repurchases. honeywell presently expects to repurchase outstanding shares from time to time to generally offset the dilutive impact of employee stock based compensation plans, including option exercises, restricted unit vesting and matching contributions under our savings plans.
in addition to our normal operating cash requirements, our principal future cash requirements will be to fund capital expenditures, dividends, strategic acquisitions, share repurchases, employee benefit obligations, environmental remediation costs, asbestos claims, severance and exit costs related to repositioning actions and debt repayments.
specifically, we expect our primary cash requirements in 2017 to be as follows:
§                                                 capital expenditures-we expect to spend approximately $1.1 billion for capital expenditures in 2017 primarily for growth, production and capacity expansion, cost reduction, maintenance, and replacement.

§                                                    share repurchases- under the company's share repurchase program, $4.1 billion is available as of december 31, 2016 for additional share repurchases. honeywell presently expects to repurchase outstanding shares from time to time to generally offset the dilutive impact of employee stock-based compensation plans, including option exercises, restricted unit vesting and matching contributions under our savings plans. the amount and timing of future repurchases may vary depending on market conditions and our level of operating, financing and other investing activities.

§                                                 dividends-we increased our quarterly dividend rate by 12% to $.6650 per share of common stock effective with the fourth quarter 2016 dividend. the company intends to continue to pay quarterly dividends in 2017.

§                                                    asbestos claims-we expect our cash spending for asbestos claims and our cash receipts for related insurance recoveries to be approximately $546 million and $23 million in 2017.

§                                                pension contributions-in 2017, we are not required to make contributions to our u.s. pension plans. we plan to make contributions of cash and/or marketable securities of approximately $130 million ($89 million of marketable securities were contributed in january 2017) to our non-u.s. plans to

27

satisfy regulatory funding standards. the timing and amount of contributions to both our u.s. and non-u.s. plans may be impacted by a number of factors, including the funded status of the plans.
§                                                  repositioning actions-we expect that cash spending for severance and other exit costs necessary to execute repositioning actions will approximate $225 million in 2017.

§                                     environmental remediation costs-we expect to spend approximately $250 million in 2017 for remedial response and voluntary clean-up costs.

we continuously assess the relative strength of each business in our portfolio as to strategic fit, market position, profit and cash flow contribution in order to upgrade our combined portfolio and identify business units that will most benefit from increased investment. we identify acquisition candidates that will further our strategic plan and strengthen our existing core businesses. we also identify businesses that do not fit into our long-term strategic plan based on their market position, relative profitability or growth potential. these businesses are considered for potential divestiture, restructuring or other repositioning actions subject to regulatory constraints. in 2016 and 2015, we realized $565 million and $1 million in cash proceeds from sales and a spin-off of non-strategic businesses.
based on past performance and current expectations, we believe that our operating cash flows will be sufficient to meet our future operating cash needs. our available cash, committed credit lines and access to the public debt and equity markets, provide additional sources of short-term and long-term liquidity to fund current operations, debt maturities, and future investment opportunities.

environmental matters accruals for environmental matters deemed probable and reasonably estimable were $195 million, $194 million and $268 million in 2016, 2015 and 2014. in addition, in 2016 and 2015 we incurred operating costs for ongoing businesses of approximately $83 million and $90 million relating to compliance with environmental regulations.
spending related to known environmental matters was $228 million, $273 million and $321 million in 2016, 2015 and 2014 and is estimated to be approximately $250 million in 2017. we expect to fund expenditures for these environmental matters from operating cash flow. the timing of cash expenditures depends on several factors, including the timing of litigation and settlements of remediation liability, personal injury and property damage claims, regulatory approval of cleanup projects, execution timeframe of projects, remedial techniques to be utilized and agreement with other parties.
see note 19 commitments and contingencies of notes to financial statements for further discussion of our environmental matters.

critical accounting policies the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles is based on the selection and application of accounting policies that require us to make significant estimates and assumptions about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain. we consider the accounting policies discussed below to be critical to the understanding of our financial statements. actual results could differ from our estimates and assumptions, and any such differences could be material to our consolidated financial statements.
contingent liabilities-we are subject to a number of lawsuits, investigations and claims (some of which involve substantial dollar amounts) that arise out of the conduct of our global business operations or those of previously owned entities, including matters relating to commercial transactions, government contracts, product liability (including asbestos), prior acquisitions and divestitures, employee benefit plans, intellectual property, legal and environmental, health and safety matters. we continually assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to our contingencies, as well as potential amounts or ranges of probable losses, and recognize a liability, if any, for these contingencies based on a careful analysis of each matter with the assistance of outside legal counsel and, if applicable, other experts. such analysis includes making judgments concerning matters such as the costs associated with environmental matters, the outcome of negotiations, the number and cost of pending and future asbestos claims, and the impact of evidentiary requirements. because most contingencies are resolved over long periods of time, liabilities may change in the future due to new developments (including new discovery of facts, changes in legislation and outcomes of similar cases through the judicial system), changes in assumptions or changes in our settlement strategy. see note 19 commitments and contingencies of notes to financial statements for a discussion of management's judgment applied in the recognition and measurement of our environmental and asbestos liabilities which represent our most significant contingencies.
asbestos related contingencies and insurance recoveries-honeywell's involvement in asbestos related personal injury actions relates to two predecessor companies. regarding north american refractories company (narco) asbestos related claims, we accrued for pending claims based on terms and conditions in agreements with narco, its former parent company, and certain asbestos claimants, and an estimate of the unsettled claims pending as of the time narco filed for bankruptcy protection. we also accrued for the estimated value of future narco asbestos related claims expected to be asserted against the narco trust. the estimate of future narco claims is based on a commonly accepted methodology used by numerous bankruptcy courts addressing 524(g) trusts and also reflects disputes concerning implementation of the trust distribution procedures by the narco trust, a lack of sufficient trust claims processing experience, as well as the stay of all narco asbestos claims which remained in place throughout narco's chapter 11 case. some critical assumptions underlying this commonly accepted methodology include claims filing rates, disease criteria and payment values contained in the trust distribution procedures, estimated approval rates of claims submitted to the narco trust and epidemiological studies estimating disease instances. the estimated value of future narco claims was originally established at the time of the narco chapter 11 filing reflecting claims expected to be asserted against narco over a fifteen year period. this projection resulted in a range of estimated liability of $743 million to $961 million. we believe that no amount within this range is a better estimate than any other amount and accordingly, we have recorded the minimum amount in the range. regarding bendix asbestos related claims, we accrued for the estimated value of pending claims using average resolution values for the previous five years. we also accrued for the estimated value of future anticipated claims related to bendix for the next five years based on historic claims filing experience and dismissal rates, disease classifications, and average resolution values in the tort system for the previous five years. in light of the uncertainties inherent in making long-term projections, as well as certain factors unique to friction product asbestos claims, we do not believe that we have a reasonable basis for estimating asbestos claims beyond the next five years.
in connection with the recognition of liabilities for asbestos related matters, we record asbestos related insurance recoveries that are deemed probable. in assessing the probability of insurance recovery, we make judgments concerning insurance coverage that we believe are reasonable and consistent with our historical dealings and our knowledge of any pertinent solvency issues surrounding insurers. while the substantial majority of our insurance carriers are solvent, some of our individual carriers are insolvent, which has been considered in our analysis of probable recoveries. projecting future events is subject to various uncertainties that could cause the insurance recovery on asbestos related liabilities to be higher or lower than that projected and recorded. given the inherent uncertainty in making future projections, we reevaluate our projections concerning our probable insurance recoveries in light of any changes to the projected liability, our recovery experience or other relevant factors that may impact future insurance recoveries.

defined benefit pension plans-we sponsor both funded and unfunded u.s. and non-u.s. defined benefit pension plans. for financial reporting purposes, net periodic pension (income) expense is calculated annually based upon a number of actuarial assumptions, including a discount rate for plan obligations and an expected long-term rate of return on plan assets. changes in the discount rate and expected long-term rate of return on plan assets could materially affect the annual pension (income) expense amount. annual pension (income) expense is comprised of a potential mark-to-market adjustment (mtm adjustment) and service and interest cost, assumed return on plan assets and prior service amortization (pension ongoing (income) expense).
the key assumptions used in developing our 2016, 2015 and 2014 net periodic pension (income) expense for our u.s. plans included the following:
2016              2015               2014

discount rate:
projected benefit obligation                                     4.46   %           4.08   %           4.89   %
service cost (1)                                                 4.69   %            n/a                n/a interest cost (1)                                                3.59   %            n/a                n/a assets:
expected rate of return                                          7.75   %           7.75   %           7.75   %
actual rate of return                                              10   %              2   %              8   %
actual 10 year average annual compounded rate of return             6   %              7   %              8   %
(1) n/a in 2015 and 2014 as the discount rate methodology was changed in fourth quarter of 2015. see note 20 pension and other postretirement benefits of notes to financial statements.

the mtm adjustment represents the recognition of net actuarial gains or losses in excess of the corridor. net actuarial gains and losses occur when the actual experience differs from any of the various assumptions used to value our pension plans or when assumptions change. the primary factors contributing to actuarial gains and losses are changes in the discount rate used to value pension obligations as of the measurement date each year and the difference between expected and actual returns on plan assets. the mark-to-market accounting method results in the potential for volatile and difficult to forecast mtm adjustments. mtm charges were $273 million, $67 million and $249 million in 2016, 2015 and 2014.
we determine the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets utilizing historical plan asset returns over varying long-term periods combined with our expectations of future market conditions and asset mix considerations (see note 20 pension and other postretirement benefits of notes to financial statements for details on the actual various asset classes and targeted asset allocation percentages for our pension plans). we plan to continue to use an expected rate of return on plan assets of 7.75% for 2017 as this is a long-term rate based on historical plan asset returns over varying long term periods combined with our expectations of future market conditions and the asset mix of the plan's investments.
the discount rate reflects the market rate on december 31 (measurement date) for high-quality fixed-income investments with maturities corresponding to our benefit obligations and is subject to change each year. the discount rate can be volatile from year to year as it is determined based upon prevailing interest rates as of the measurement date. we used a 4.20% discount rate to determine benefit obligations as of december 31, 2016, reflecting the decrease in the market interest rate environment since the prior year-end.
in addition to the potential for mtm adjustments, changes in our expected rate of return on plan assets and discount rate resulting from economic events also affects future pension ongoing (income) expense. the following table highlights the sensitivity of our u.s. pension obligations and ongoing (income) expense to changes in these assumptions, assuming all other assumptions remain constant. these estimates exclude any potential mtm adjustment:
31

impact on 2017

pension change in assumption   ongoing expense        impact on pbo
0.25 percentage point decrease in discount rate   decrease $20 million   increase $500 million
0.25 percentage point increase in discount rate   increase $18 million   decrease $460 million
0.25 percentage point decrease in expected rate of return on assets   increase $40 million   -
0.25 percentage point increase in expected rate of return on assets   decrease $40 million   -
pension ongoing income for all of our pension plans is expected to be approximately $715 million in 2017 compared with pension ongoing income of $601 million in 2016. the expected increase is primarily due to higher asset returns in 2016 and lower interest costs due to a decline in discount rates, mainly in our u.s. and uk plans. also, if required, an mtm adjustment will be recorded in the fourth quarter of 2017 in accordance with our pension accounting method as previously described. it is difficult to reliably forecast or predict whether there will be a mtm adjustment in 2017, and if one is required what the magnitude of such adjustment will be. mtm adjustments are primarily driven by events and circumstances beyond the control of the company such as changes in interest rates and the performance of the financial markets.
long-lived assets (including tangible and finite-lived intangible assets)-the determination of useful lives (for depreciation/amortization purposes) and whether or not tangible and intangible assets are impaired involves the use of accounting estimates and assumptions, changes in which could materially impact our financial condition or operating performance if actual results differ from such estimates and assumptions. we evaluate the recoverability of the carrying amount of our long-lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of a long-lived asset group may not be fully recoverable. the principal factors in considering when to perform an impairment review are as follows:
•     significant under-performance (i.e., declines in sales, earnings or cash flows) of a business or product line in relation to expectations;

•   annual operating plans or five-year strategic plans that indicate an unfavorable trend in operating performance of a business or product line;
•   significant negative industry or economic trends; or
•   significant changes or planned changes in our use of the assets.
once it is determined that an impairment review is necessary, recoverability of assets is measured by comparing the carrying amount of the asset grouping to the estimated future undiscounted cash flows. if the carrying amount exceeds the estimated future undiscounted cash flows, the asset grouping is considered to be impaired. the impairment is then measured as the difference between the carrying amount of the asset grouping and its fair value. we endeavor to utilize the best information available to measure fair value, which is usually either market prices (if available), level 1 or level 2 of the fair value hierarchy, or an estimate of the future discounted cash flow, level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. the key estimates in our discounted cash flow analysis include assumptions as to expected industry growth rates, sales volume, selling prices and costs, and the discount rate selected. these estimates are subject to changes in the economic environment, including market interest rates and expected volatility. management believes the estimates of future cash flows and fair values are reasonable; however, changes in estimates due to variance from assumptions could materially affect the valuations.
goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets impairment testing- goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are not amortized, but are subject to annual, or more frequent if necessary, impairment testing. in testing goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, the fair value is estimated utilizing a discounted cash flow approach utilizing cash flow forecasts in our five year strategic and annual operating plans adjusted for terminal value assumptions. these impairment tests involve the use of accounting estimates and assumptions, changes in which could materially impact our financial condition or operating performance if actual results differ from such estimates and assumptions. to address this uncertainty we perform sensitivity analysis on key estimates and assumptions.
income taxes-on a recurring basis, we assess the need for a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets by considering all available positive and negative evidence, such as past operating results, projections
32

of future taxable income, enacted tax law changes and the feasibility and impact of tax planning initiatives. our projections of future taxable income include a number of estimates and assumptions regarding our volume, pricing and costs, as well as the timing and amount of reversals of taxable temporary differences.
sales recognition on long-term contracts-in 2016, we recognized approximately 13% of our total net sales using the percentage-of-completion method for long-term contracts. these long-term contracts are measured on the cost-to-cost basis for engineering-type contracts and the units-of-delivery basis for production-type contracts. accounting for these contracts involves management judgment in estimating total contract revenue and cost. contract revenues are largely determined by negotiated contract prices and quantities, modified by our assumptions regarding contract options, change orders, incentive and award provisions associated with technical performance and price adjustment clauses (such as inflation or index-based clauses). contract costs are incurred over a period of time, which can be several years, and the estimation of these costs requires management judgment. cost estimates are largely based on negotiated or estimated purchase contract terms, historical performance trends and other economic projections. significant factors that influence these estimates include inflationary trends, technical and schedule risk, internal and subcontractor performance trends, business volume assumptions, asset utilization, and anticipated labor agreements. revenue and cost estimates are regularly monitored and revised based on changes in circumstances. anticipated losses on long-term contracts are recognized when such losses become evident. we maintain financial controls over the customer qualification, contract pricing and estimation processes to reduce the risk of contract losses.

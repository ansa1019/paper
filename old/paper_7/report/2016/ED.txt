(a)   under the revenue decoupling mechanisms in the utilities' new york electric and gas rate plans and the weather-normalization clause applicable to their gas businesses, revenues are generally not affected by changes in delivery volumes from levels assumed when rates were approved. in general, the utilities recover on a current basis the fuel, gas purchased for resale and purchased power costs they incur in supplying energy to their full-service customers (see "recoverable energy costs" in note a and "rate plans" in note b to the financial statements in item 8). accordingly, such costs do not generally affect the companies' results of operations.

operating revenues decreased $66 million in 2016 compared with 2015 due primarily to lower purchased power expenses ($151 million) and lower fuel expenses ($14 million), offset in part by higher revenues from the electric rate plan ($122 million) and changes in regulatory charges ($20 million).
purchased power expenses decreased $151 million in 2016 compared with 2015 due to lower unit costs ($111 million) and purchased volumes ($40 million).
50
fuel expenses decreased $14 million in 2016 compared with 2015 due to lower unit costs ($19 million), offset by higher sendout volumes from the company's electric generating facilities ($5 million).
other operations and maintenance expenses decreased $49 million in 2016 compared with 2015 due primarily to a decrease in the surcharges for assessments and fees that are collected in revenues from customers ($52 million) and lower uncollectible expense ($12 million), offset in part by higher costs for municipal infrastructure support ($8 million).
depreciation and amortization increased $45 million in 2016 compared with 2015 due primarily to higher electric utility plant balances.
taxes, other than income taxes increased $54 million in 2016 compared with 2015 due primarily to higher property taxes ($66 million), offset in part by lower state and local revenue taxes ($4 million), a favorable state audit settlement ($3 million), lower sales and use tax reserve based on a favorable audit settlement ($3 million) and lower payroll taxes ($2 million).

(a)   o&amp;r's new york electric delivery revenues are subject to a revenue decoupling mechanism, as a result of which, delivery revenues are generally not affected by changes in delivery volumes from levels assumed when rates were approved. o&amp;r's electric sales in new jersey are not subject to a decoupling mechanism, and as a result, changes in such volumes do impact revenues.
(b)   "residential/religious" generally includes single-family dwellings, individual apartments in multi-family dwellings, religious organizations and certain other not-for-profit organizations.
(c)   other electric operating revenues generally reflect changes in regulatory assets and liabilities in accordance with the company's electric rate plan. see note b to the financial statements in item 8.
(d)   after adjusting for weather and other variations, electric delivery volumes in o&amp;r's service area decreased 0.9 percent in 2016 compared with 2015.
operating revenues decreased $26 million in 2016 compared with 2015 due primarily to lower purchased power expenses ($13 million) and lower revenues from the new york electric rate plan (which includes the reconciliation of certain expenses, see note b to the financial statements in item 8) ($7 million).
purchased power expenses decreased $13 million in 2016 compared with 2015 due to a decrease in unit costs ($18 million), offset by an increase in purchased volumes ($5 million).
other operations and maintenance expenses decreased $12 million in 2016 compared with 2015 due primarily to regulatory accounting effects of pension costs ($11 million) and the charge-off of certain regulatory assets in 2015 ($4 million), offset by higher operating costs ($3 million).
depreciation and amortization decreased $1 million in 2016 compared with 2015 due primarily to lower average depreciation rates.
taxes, other than income taxes increased $8 million in 2016 compared with 2015 due primarily to higher property taxes.

(a)   revenues from gas sales are subject to a weather normalization clause and a revenue decoupling mechanism, as a result of which, delivery revenues are generally not affected by changes in delivery volumes from levels assumed when rates were approved.
(b)   after adjusting for variations, principally weather and billing days, firm gas sales and transportation volumes in the company's service area increased 6.7 percent in 2015 compared with 2014, reflecting primarily increased volumes attributable to additional customers that have converted from oil-to-gas as heating fuel for their buildings.
(c)   includes 1,229 and 6,057 thousands of dt for 2015 and 2014, respectively, which are also reflected in firm transportation and other.
(d)   other gas operating revenues generally reflect changes in regulatory assets and liabilities in accordance with the company's rate plans. see note b to the financial statements in item 8.
operating revenues decreased $194 million in 2015 compared with 2014 due primarily to a decrease in gas purchased for resale expenses ($272 million), offset in part by higher revenues from the gas rate plan ($77 million) reflecting primarily higher delivery volumes attributable to oil-to-gas conversions.
gas purchased for resale decreased $272 million in 2015 compared with 2014 due to lower unit costs ($274 million), offset by higher sendout volumes ($2 million).
59
other operations and maintenance expenses increased $22 million in 2015 compared with 2014 due primarily to higher operating costs attributable to emergency response ($45 million), offset in part by lower pension costs ($12 million) and a decrease in the surcharges for assessments and fees that are collected in revenues from customers ($10 million). other operations and maintenance expenses for emergency response activities in 2015 and 2014 were above amounts for such costs reflected in the company's gas rate plan. the company has requested nyspsc authorization to defer for recovery as a regulatory asset $29 million and $35 million of such incremental costs incurred in 2014 and 2015, respectively. the company anticipates requesting deferral of 2016 incremental costs in 2017. at december 31, 2015, the company had not deferred any such incremental costs.
depreciation and amortization increased $10 million in 2015 compared with 2014 due primarily to higher gas utility plant balances.
taxes, other than income taxes increased $4 million in 2015 compared with 2014 due primarily to higher property taxes ($8 million) and a sales and use tax refund received in 2014 ($2 million), offset in part by lower state and local revenue taxes ($6 million).

(a)   o&amp;r's new york electric delivery revenues are subject to a revenue decoupling mechanism, as a result of which, delivery revenues are generally not affected by changes in delivery volumes from levels assumed when rates were approved. o&amp;r's electric sales in new jersey are not subject to a decoupling mechanism, and as a result, changes in such volumes do impact revenues.
(b)   "residential/religious" generally includes single-family dwellings, individual apartments in multi-family dwellings, religious organizations and certain other not-for-profit organizations.
(c)   other electric operating revenues generally reflect changes in regulatory assets and liabilities in accordance with the company's electric rate plan. see note b to the financial statements in item 8.
(d)   after adjusting for weather and other variations, electric delivery volumes in o&amp;r's service area decreased.0.9 percent in 2015 compared with 2014.
operating revenues decreased $17 million in 2015 compared with 2014 due primarily to lower purchased power expenses ($28 million), offset in part by higher revenues from the new york electric rate plan ($19 million).
purchased power expenses decreased $28 million in 2015 compared with 2014 due to a decrease in unit costs ($24 million) and purchased volumes ($4 million).
other operations and maintenance expenses increased $5 million in 2015 compared with 2014 due primarily to the charge-off of certain regulatory assets ($4 million) and an increase in surcharges for assessments and fees that are collected in revenues from customers ($1 million).
depreciation and amortization increased $4 million in 2015 compared with 2014 due primarily to higher electric utility plant balances.
taxes, other than income taxes increased $1 million in 2015 compared with 2014 due primarily to higher property taxes and state and local revenue taxes.

liquidity and capital resources the companies' liquidity reflects cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities, as shown on their respective consolidated statement of cash flows and as discussed below.
the principal factors affecting con edison's liquidity are its investments in the utilities, the clean energy businesses and con edison transmission, the dividends it pays to its shareholders and the dividends it receives from the utilities and cash flows from financing activities discussed below.
the principal factors affecting cecony's liquidity are its cash flows from operating activities, cash used in investing activities (including construction expenditures), the dividends it pays to con edison and cash flows from financing activities discussed below.
the companies generally maintain minimal cash balances and use short-term borrowings to meet their working capital needs and other cash requirements. the companies repay their short-term borrowings using funds from long-term financings and operating activities. the utilities' cost of capital, including working capital, is reflected in the rates they charge to their customers.
each of the companies believes that it will be able to meet its reasonably likely short-term and long-term cash requirements. see "the companies require access to capital markets to satisfy funding requirements" and "the companies also face other risks that are beyond their control" in item 1a, and "capital requirements and resources" in item 1.

cash flows from operating activities the utilities' cash flows from operating activities reflect principally their energy sales and deliveries and cost of operations. the volume of energy sales and deliveries is affected primarily by factors external to the utilities, such as growth of customer demand, weather, market prices for energy and economic conditions. measures that promote distributed energy resources, such as distributed generation, demand reduction and energy efficiency, also affect the volume of energy sales and deliveries. see "utility regulation - state utility regulation - new york utility industry - reforming the energy vision," "competition" and "environmental matters - climate change" in item 1. under the revenue decoupling mechanisms in the utilities' new york electric and gas rate plans, changes in delivery volumes from levels assumed when rates were approved may affect the timing of cash flows but generally not net

income. see note b to the financial statements in item 8. the prices at which the utilities provide energy to their customers are determined in accordance with their rate plans. in general, changes in the utilities' cost of purchased power, fuel and gas may affect the timing of cash flows but not net income because the costs are recovered in accordance with rate plans. see "recoverable energy costs" in note a to the financial statements in item 8.
net income is the result of cash and non-cash (or accrual) transactions. only cash transactions affect the companies' cash flows from operating activities. principal non-cash charges or credits include depreciation, deferred income tax expense and amortizations of certain regulatory assets and liabilities. non-cash charges or credits may also be accrued under the revenue decoupling and cost reconciliation mechanisms in the utilities' new york electric and gas rate plans. see "rate plans - cecony- electric and gas and o&r - electric and gas" in note b to the financial statements in item 8.
net cash flows from operating activities in 2016 for con edison and cecony were $182 million and $219 million higher, respectively, than in 2015. the increase in net cash flows for con edison and cecony reflects primarily lower income taxes paid, net of refunds received in 2016 as compared with 2015 ($144 million and $325 million, respectively), offset by higher interest payments ($67 million and $27 million, respectively) in 2016. the amount and timing of income tax payments and refunds received reflect, among other things, the extension of bonus depreciation tax provisions. see note l to the financial statements in item 8.
net cash flows from operating activities in 2015 for con edison and cecony were $446 million and $389 million higher, respectively, than in 2014. the increase in net cash flows for con edison and cecony reflects primarily lower income taxes paid, net of refunds received in 2015 ($669 million and $585 million, respectively), offset in part by increased pension contributions ($172 million and $159 million, respectively) in 2015. the amount and timing of income tax payments and refunds received reflect, among other things, the extension of bonus depreciation tax provisions. see note l to the financial statements in item 8. for information about the companies' pension contributions, see note e to the financial statements in item 8.
the change in net cash flows also reflects the timing of payments for and recovery of energy costs. this timing is reflected within changes to accounts receivable - customers, recoverable energy costs and accounts payable balances.
the changes in regulatory assets principally reflect changes in deferred pension costs in accordance with the accounting rules for retirement benefits. see notes a, b and e to the financial statements in item 8.
cash flows used in investing activities net cash flows used in investing activities for con edison and cecony were $1,319 million and $101 million higher, respectively, in 2016 than in 2015. the change for con edison reflects primarily increased investments in/acquisitions of electric and gas transmission projects ($1,076 million), increased utility construction expenditures in 2016 ($273 million) and increased non-utility construction expenditures related to development of renewable electric production projects ($353 million), offset in part by the proceeds from the sale and transfer of assets ($374 million). the change for cecony reflects primarily increased utility construction expenditures in 2016 ($262 million), offset in part by the proceeds from the transfer of assets to ny transco ($122 million).
net cash flows used in investing activities for con edison and cecony were $898 million and $334 million higher, respectively, in 2015 than in 2014. the changes for con edison and cecony reflect increased utility construction expenditures in 2015 ($323 million and $316 million, respectively). in addition, the change for con edison reflects primarily increased non-utility construction expenditures related to renewable electric production projects ($312 million), the proceeds from sale relating to its solar electric production projects in 2014 ($108 million, see note q to the financial statements in item 8) and increased other investing activities ($82 million, representing primarily a note receivable related to panoche valley, see note q to the financial statements in item 8).

non-utility property, less accumulated depreciation the increase in non-utility property, less accumulated depreciation, for con edison reflects the purchase of interests in, and construction expenditures for, renewable electric production projects. see "clean energy businesses - con edison development" and "capital requirements and resources - capital requirements" in item 1.
investments the increase in investments for con edison reflects primarily the purchase of a 50 percent equity interest in a gas pipeline and storage joint venture. see "con edison transmission" in item 1 and "investments" in note a and note u to the financial statements in item 8.
regulatory asset for unrecognized pension and other postretirement costs and liability for pension and retiree benefits the decrease in the regulatory asset for unrecognized pension and other postretirement costs and the liability for pension and retiree benefits reflects the final actuarial valuation of the pension and other retiree benefit plans as measured at december 31, 2016, in accordance with the accounting rules for retirement benefits. the change in the regulatory asset also reflects the year's amortization of accounting costs. the change in the liability for pension and retiree benefits reflects in part contributions to the plans made by the utilities in 2016. see notes b, e and f to the financial statements in item 8.
deferred income taxes and investment tax credits the increase in the liability for deferred income taxes and investment tax credits for con edison and cecony reflects primarily bonus depreciation in 2016, partially offset by the increase in deferred income tax assets associated with the federal tax attribute carryforwards related to the net operating loss and general business tax credits. see note l to the financial statements in item 8.
system benefit charge the increase in the liability for the system benefit charge reflects amounts collected by the utilities from their customers that will be required to be paid to nyserda. see "environmental matters - climate change" in item 1.
off-balance sheet arrangements none of the companies' interests in variable interest entities (vies) meet the sec definition of off-balance sheet arrangements. for information regarding the companies' vies, see note q to the financial statements in item 8.
regulatory matters for information about the utilities' rate plans and other regulatory matters affecting the companies, see "utility regulation" in item 1 and note b to the financial statements in item 8.
risk factors the companies' businesses are influenced by many factors that are difficult to predict, and that involve uncertainties that may materially affect actual operating results, cash flows and financial condition. see "risk factors" in item 1a.
application of critical accounting policies the companies' financial statements reflect the application of their accounting policies, which conform to accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america. the companies' critical accounting policies include industry-specific accounting applicable to regulated public utilities and accounting for pensions and other postretirement benefits, contingencies, long-lived assets, goodwill and derivative instruments.
accounting for regulated public utilities the utilities are subject to the accounting rules for regulated operations and the accounting requirements of the ferc and the state public utility regulatory commissions having jurisdiction.
the accounting rules for regulated operations specify the economic effects that result from the causal relationship of costs and revenues in the rate-regulated environment and how these effects are to be accounted for by a regulated enterprise. revenues intended to cover some costs may be recorded either before or after the costs are incurred. if regulation provides assurance that incurred costs will be recovered in the future, these costs would be recorded as deferred charges or "regulatory assets" under the accounting rules for regulated operations. if revenues are recorded for costs that are expected to be incurred in the future, these revenues would be recorded as deferred credits or "regulatory liabilities" under the accounting rules for regulated operations.
69
the utilities' principal regulatory assets and liabilities are listed in note b to the financial statements in item 8. the utilities are each receiving or being credited with a return on all regulatory assets for which a cash outflow has been made. the utilities are each paying or being charged with a return on all regulatory liabilities for which a cash inflow has been received. the regulatory assets and liabilities will be recovered from customers, or applied for customer benefit, in accordance with rate provisions approved by the applicable public utility regulatory commission.
in the event that regulatory assets of the utilities were no longer probable of recovery, as required by the accounting rules for regulated operations, these regulatory assets would be charged to earnings. at december 31, 2016, the regulatory assets for con edison and cecony were $7,124 million and $6,563 million, respectively.
accounting for pensions and other postretirement benefits the utilities provide pensions and other postretirement benefits to substantially all of their employees and retirees. the clean energy businesses also provide such benefits to certain of their employees. the companies account for these benefits in accordance with the accounting rules for retirement benefits. in addition, the utilities apply the accounting rules for regulated operations to account for the regulatory treatment of these obligations (which, as described in note b to the financial statements in item 8, reconciles the amounts reflected in rates for the costs of the benefit to the costs actually incurred). in applying these accounting policies, the companies have made critical estimates related to actuarial assumptions, including assumptions of expected returns on plan assets, discount rates, health care cost trends and future compensation. see notes a, e and f to the financial statements in item 8 for information about the companies' pension and other postretirement benefits, the actuarial assumptions, actual performance, amortization of investment and other actuarial gains and losses and calculated plan costs for 2016, 2015 and 2014.
the discount rate for determining the present value of future period benefit payments is determined using a model to match the durations of highly-rated (aa or higher by either moody's or s&p) corporate bonds with the projected stream of benefit payments.
in determining the health care cost trend rate, the companies review actual recent cost trends and projected future trends.
the cost of pension and other postretirement benefits in future periods will depend on actual returns on plan assets, assumptions for future periods, contributions and benefit experience. con edison's and cecony's current estimates for 2017 are decreases, compared with 2016, in their pension and other postretirement benefits costs of $85 million and $84 million, respectively.
the following table illustrates the effect on 2017 pension and other postretirement costs of changing the critical actuarial assumptions, while holding all other actuarial assumptions constant:

a 5.0 percentage point variation in the actual annual return in 2017, as compared with the expected annual asset return of 7.50 percent, would change pension and other postretirement benefit costs for con edison and cecony by approximately $34 million and $32 million, respectively, in 2018.
pension benefits are provided through a pension plan maintained by con edison to which cecony, o&r and the clean energy businesses make contributions for their participating employees. pension accounting by the utilities includes an allocation of plan assets.
the companies' policy is to fund their pension and other postretirement benefit accounting costs to the extent tax deductible, and for the utilities, to the extent these costs are recovered under their rate plans. the companies were not required to make cash contributions to the pension plan in 2016 under funding regulations and tax laws. however, cecony and o&r made discretionary contributions to the pension plan in 2016 of $469 million and $39 million, respectively. in 2017, cecony and o&r expect to make contributions to the pension plan of $388 million and $35 million, respectively. see "expected contributions" in notes e and f to the financial statements in item 8.
accounting for contingencies the accounting rules for contingencies apply to an existing condition, situation or set of circumstances involving uncertainty as to possible loss that will ultimately be resolved when one or more future events occur or fail to occur. known material contingencies, which are described in the notes to the financial statements, include certain regulatory matters (note b), the utilities' responsibility for hazardous substances, such as asbestos, pcbs and coal tar that have been used or generated in the course of operations (note g), and other contingencies (note h). in accordance with the accounting rules, the companies have accrued estimates of losses relating to the contingencies as to which loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated and no liability has been accrued for contingencies as to which loss is not probable or cannot be reasonably estimated.
the utilities recover costs for asbestos lawsuits, workers' compensation and environmental remediation pursuant to their current rate plans. generally, changes during the terms of the rate plans to the amounts accrued for these contingencies would not impact earnings.

accounting for long-lived and intangible assets the accounting rules for certain long-lived assets and intangible assets with definite lives require testing for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate their carrying amounts may not be recoverable. the carrying amount of a long-lived asset or intangible asset with a definite life is deemed not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset. under the accounting rules, an impairment loss is recognized if the carrying amount is not recoverable from such cash flows, and exceeds its fair value, which approximates market value. in 2015, con edison recorded a $5 million impairment charge on pike assets held for sale. see note u to the financial statements in item 8. no impairment charges on long-lived assets were recognized in 2016 or 2014. no impairment charges on intangible assets with definite lives were recognized in 2016, 2015 or 2014. for information about the companies' intangible assets, see note k to the financial statements in item 8.
accounting for goodwill in accordance with the accounting rules for goodwill and intangible assets, con edison is required to test goodwill for impairment annually or whenever there is a triggering event. see note k to the financial statements in item 8. goodwill is tested for impairment using a two-step quantitative approach. the first step of the goodwill impairment test compares the estimated fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying value, including goodwill. if the estimated fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, goodwill of the reporting unit is considered not impaired. if the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value of the reporting unit, the second step is performed to measure the amount of impairment loss, if any. the second step requires a calculation of the implied fair value of goodwill.
goodwill was $428 million at december 31, 2016, which consists of $406 million related to the o&r merger, $14 million related to a residential solar company owned by con edison solutions and $8 million related to a gas storage company owned by con edison development. the most recent tests, which were performed during 2016, required a second-step assessment to be performed on goodwill of $15 million related to two energy service companies owned by con edison solutions. based on the results of step two of the impairment test, con edison solutions recorded an impairment charge of $15 million ($12 million, net of tax). a second-step assessment of the goodwill related to the o&r merger, residential solar company and gas storage company was not required. con edison's most significant assumptions for the goodwill impairment tests relate to the estimates of reporting unit fair values. the company estimated fair values using primarily discounted cash flows and market valuations for a proxy group of companies. estimates of future cash flows, projected growth rates and discount rates inherent in the cash flow estimates for the gas storage and residential solar companies may vary significantly from actual results, which could result in a future impairment of goodwill.
accounting for derivative instruments the companies apply the accounting rules for derivatives and hedging to their derivative financial instruments. the companies use derivative financial instruments to hedge market price fluctuations in related underlying transactions for the physical purchase and sale of electricity and gas. the utilities are permitted by their respective regulators to reflect in rates all reasonably incurred gains and losses on these instruments. the clean energy businesses have also hedged interest rate risk on certain debt securities. see "financial and commodity market risks" below and note o to the financial statements in item 8.
where the companies are required to make mark-to-market estimates pursuant to the accounting rules, the estimates of gains and losses at a particular period end do not reflect the end results of particular transactions, and will most likely not reflect the actual gain or loss at the conclusion of a transaction. substantially all of the estimated gains or losses are based on prices supplied by external sources such as the fair value of exchange-traded futures and options and the fair value of positions for which price quotations are available through or derived from brokers or other market sources.
financial and commodity market risks the companies are subject to various risks and uncertainties associated with financial and commodity markets. the most significant market risks include interest rate risk, commodity price risk, credit risk and investment risk.
72
interest rate risk the companies' interest rate risk relates primarily to variable rate debt and to new debt financing needed to fund capital requirements, including the construction expenditures of the utilities and maturing debt securities. con edison and its businesses manage interest rate risk through the issuance of mostly fixed-rate debt with varying maturities and through opportunistic refinancing of debt. con edison and cecony estimate that at december 31, 2016, a 10 percent increase in interest rates applicable to its variable rate debt would result in an increase in annual interest expense of $3 million. under cecony's current electric, gas and steam rate plans, variations in actual variable rate tax-exempt debt interest expense are reconciled to levels reflected in rates.
commodity price risk con edison's commodity price risk relates primarily to the purchase and sale of electricity, gas and related derivative instruments. the utilities and the clean energy businesses apply risk management strategies to mitigate their related exposures. see note o to the financial statements in item 8.
con edison estimates that, as of december 31, 2016, a 10 percent decline in market prices would result in a decline in fair value of $68 million for the derivative instruments used by the utilities to hedge purchases of electricity and gas, of which $60 million is for cecony and $8 million is for o&r. con edison expects that any such change in fair value would be largely offset by directionally opposite changes in the cost of the electricity and gas purchased. in accordance with provisions approved by state regulators, the utilities generally recover from customers the costs they incur for energy purchased for their customers, including gains and losses on certain derivative instruments used to hedge energy purchased and related costs. see "recoverable energy costs" in note a to the financial statements in item 8.
the clean energy businesses use a value-at-risk (var) model to assess the market price risk of their portfolio of electricity and gas commodity fixed-price purchase and sales commitments, physical forward contracts, generating assets and commodity derivative instruments. var represents the potential change in fair value of the portfolio due to changes in market prices, for a specified time period and confidence level. these businesses estimate var across their portfolio using a delta-normal variance/covariance model with a 95 percent confidence level and compare the measured var results against performance due to actual prices and stress test the portfolio each quarter using an assumed 30 percent price change from forecast. since the var calculation involves complex methodologies and estimates and assumptions that are based on past experience, it is not necessarily indicative of future results. var for the portfolio, assuming a one-day holding period, for the years ended december 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, was as follows:
95% confidence level, one-day holding period      2016                2015
(millions of dollars)
average for the period                              $2                  $1
high                                                 4                   2
low                                                  1         -
credit risk the companies are exposed to credit risk related to transactions entered into primarily for the various energy supply and hedging activities by the utilities and the clean energy businesses. see "credit exposure" in note o to the financial statements in item 8.
investment risk the companies' investment risk relates to the investment of plan assets for their pension and other postretirement benefit plans and to the investments of the clean energy businesses and con edison transmission that are accounted for under the equity method. see "application of critical accounting policies - accounting for pensions and other postretirement benefits" above and notes a, e and f to the financial statements in item 8.
the companies' current investment policy for pension plan assets includes investment targets of 52 to 64 percent equities and 35 to 49 percent fixed income and other securities. at december 31, 2016, the pension plan investments consisted of 58 percent equity and 42 percent fixed income and other securities.

environmental matters for information concerning climate change, environmental sustainability, potential liabilities arising from laws and regulations protecting the environment and other environmental matters, see "environmental matters" in item 1 and note g to the financial statements in item 8.
impact of inflation the companies are affected by the decline in the purchasing power of the dollar caused by inflation. regulation permits the utilities to recover through depreciation only the historical cost of their plant assets even though in an inflationary economy the cost to replace the assets upon their retirement will substantially exceed historical costs. the impact is, however, partially offset by the repayment of the companies' long-term debt in dollars of lesser value than the dollars originally borrowed.
material contingencies for information concerning potential liabilities arising from the companies' material contingencies, see "application of critical accounting policies - accounting for contingencies," above, and notes b, g and h to the financial statements in item 8.

item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations pending merger with equity one, inc.
on november 14, 2016, regency centers corporation entered into an agreement and plan of merger (the "merger agreement") with equity one, inc. ("equity one"), pursuant to which, subject to the satisfaction or waiver of certain conditions, equity one will merge with and into the regency centers corporation, with regency centers corporation being the surviving corporation (the "merger"). the combined company will retain the regency name and continue to trade under the ticker symbol "reg" on the new york stock exchange (the "nyse").
on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the merger agreement, which has been unanimously approved by the boards of directors of regency centers corporation and equity one, at the effective time of the merger (the "effective time"), each share of the common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of equity one issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time (other than shares of equity one owned directly by equity one or the regency centers corporation and in each case not held on behalf of third parties) will be converted into the right to receive 0.45 of a newly issued share of the common stock of regency centers corporation.
the closing of the merger is subject to certain conditions, including the requisite approvals from the stockholders of each of regency centers corporation and equity one (which approvals were received at special meetings of the stockholders of each company held on february 24, 2017), the receipt of certain tax opinions by regency centers corporation and equity one, and other customary closing conditions. the merger is expected to close on march 1, 2017. however, the company cannot predict with certainty when, or if, the merger will be completed because completion of the merger is subject to conditions beyond the control of the company.
for more information about the merger, the merger agreement and related agreements, see note 16 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 herein.
executing on our strategy during 2016, we executed on our strategic objectives to further solidify regency's position as a leader among shopping center reits:
sustain average annual 3% same property noi growth from a high-quality, growing portfolio of thriving community and neighborhood shopping centers.
we earn revenues and generate cash flow by leasing space in our shopping centers to grocery stores, major retail anchors, restaurants, side-shop retailers, and service providers, as well as ground leasing or selling out-parcels to these same types of tenants. we experience growth in revenues by increasing occupancy and rental rates in our existing shopping centers, by acquiring and developing new shopping centers, and by redeveloping shopping centers within our portfolio. noteworthy milestones and achievements during 2016 include:
•   we achieved pro-rata same property noi growth, excluding termination fees, of 3.5%.
•   pro-rata same property percent leased remained high at 96.2% at december 31, 2016.
•   we grew rental rates 11.3% on comparable spaces for new and renewal leases.
•   we acquired three operating properties for a gross purchase price of $333.8 million.
develop new, high quality shopping centers and redevelop existing centers at attractive returns on investment from a disciplined development program.
we capitalize on our development capabilities, market presence, and anchor relationships by investing in new developments and redevelopments of existing centers.
•   during 2016, we started $221.4 million of development and redevelopment projects, net of partner funding requirements, with a weighted average projected return of 7.8% upon completion.
•   at december 31, 2016, we have six ground-up developments in process, with total expected net development costs of $209.3 million, net of partner funding requirements, and have $97.7 million of net costs to complete. these developments are projected to return 7.4% on capital upon completion and are currently 78.6% leased.
41
•   we also have 15 redevelopments of existing centers in process with total expected net redevelopment costs of $88.4 million, with $59.3 million of costs to complete, and projected incremental returns ranging from 7.0% - 10.0% upon completion.
cost-effectively enhance our balance sheet to reduce our cost of capital, provide financial flexibility and weather economic downturns.
we fund acquisitions and development activities from various capital sources including operating cash flows, the sale of operating properties that no longer meet our investment standards, equity offerings, new debt financing, and capital from our co-investment partners.
•   at december 31, 2016, our net debt-to-core ebitda ratio on a pro-rata basis for the trailing twelve months was 4.4x versus 5.2x at december 31, 2015. we had $13.3 million of cash and $779.2 million available on our line of credit.
•   in june 2016, we settled 1.85 million of the 3.1 million shares of the forward equity offering resulting in net proceeds of $137.5 million, which were used to partially repay the line of credit balance.
•   in july 2016, we amended our existing term loan, which increased the facility size by $100.0 million to $265.0 million, extended the maturity date to january 5, 2022 and fixed the interest rate at 2.0%.
•   in july 2016, we issued 5.0 million shares of common stock resulting in net proceeds of $400.1 million, used to (i) repay in full our $300.0 million 5.875% senior unsecured notes due june 2017 ("$300 million note"), including a make-whole payment, (ii) settle the forward interest rate swaps, and (iii) fund investment activities and general corporate purposes.
•   in january 2017, we completed a combined $650 million public offering of two tranches of senior unsecured notes:
•   $350.0 million of 3.6% notes due february 1, 2027, which priced at 99.741%. the company intends to use the net proceeds in connection with the consummation of the previously announced pending merger with equity one, inc., including (i) to repay approximately $285.0 million in aggregate principal amount of debt of equity one, and any related interest, fees and expenses and (ii) to pay transaction expenses related to the pending merger with equity one. in the event that the merger agreement is not consummated, we will be required to redeem these notes then outstanding at a redemption price equal to 101% of the principal amount to be redeemed plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any.
•   $300.0 million of 4.4% notes due february 1, 2047, which priced at 99.110%. the company used a portion of the net proceeds to redeem all of the outstanding shares of its 6.625% series 6 preferred shares on february 16, 2017 and intends to use the balance to fund investment activities and for general corporate purposes.
leasing activity and significant tenants we believe our high-quality, grocery anchored shopping centers located in densely populated, desirable infill trade areas create attractive spaces for retail tenants. improvements in the economy, combined with historically low levels of new supply and robust tenant demand, allow us to focus on merchandising of our centers to ensure the right mix of operators and unique retailers, which draws more retail customers to our centers.
pro-rata occupancy for the purpose of the following disclosures of occupancy and leasing activity, "anchor space" is considered space greater than or equal to 10,000 sf and "shop space" is less than 10,000 sf. the following table summarizes pro-rata occupancy rates of our combined consolidated and unconsolidated shopping center portfolio:
december 31, 2016   december 31, 2015
% leased - operating (1)               96.0%               95.9%
anchor space                           97.8%               98.5%
shop space                             93.1%               91.7%
(1) excludes properties in development.
the decline in anchor percent leased is due, in part, to the bankruptcy of sports authority and its rejection of two leases at our shopping centers. see additional discussion below about bankruptcies.

bankruptcies and credit concerns our management team devotes significant time to researching and monitoring consumer preferences, customer shopping behaviors, alternative retail methods accessible via the internet, and demographics in order to anticipate the challenges and opportunities impacting the retail industry.  we closely monitor the operating performance and rent collections of the tenants in our shopping centers, but also those retailers experiencing significant changes to their business models as a result of reduced customer traffic in their stores and increased competition from internet sales. retailers who are unable to withstand these and other business pressures, such as operating and financing their business, may approach us to modify their lease agreement or file bankruptcy.  although base rent is supported by long-term lease contracts, tenants who file bankruptcy generally have the legal right to reject any or all of their leases and close related stores. in the event that a tenant with a significant number of leases in our shopping centers files bankruptcy and cancels its leases, we could experience a significant reduction in our revenues. currently, no tenant represents more than 5% of our annual base rent on a pro-rata basis.  also, as a result of our research and findings, we may reduce new leasing, suspend leasing, or curtail the allowance for the construction of leasehold improvements within a certain retail category or to a specific retailer in order to reduce our risk from bankruptcies and store closings.
during march 2016, sports authority filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, at which time we had three leases in our portfolio. one of those leases has been assumed by another retailer and the remaining two have been rejected and the stores closed. those two rejected leases represented $2.1 million, or 0.4%, of total annualized base rent on a pro-rata basis; however, we have since executed leases to re-tenant these spaces.
during 2016, sears holdings announced that it planned to accelerate the closing of a number of stores. sears continues to report significant declines in operating revenues and performance, and its ability to continue operating stores in our shopping centers is uncertain. we have five sears or kmart leases in our portfolio, which currently represent $3.1 million, or 0.6%, of total annualized base rent on a pro-rata basis. none of the announced store closures, as of this filing, are within our shopping centers. however, we are currently working to opportunistically re-tenant the spaces as the lease terms permit.

the $11.9 million decrease in total interest expense is due to:
•   $17.2 million decrease in interest on notes payable due to lower interest rates from refinancing and deleveraging activities during 2016 and the early redemption of our $300 million notes in august 2016; offset by
•   $2.1 million increase in interest on unsecured credit facilities related to higher average balances on our line and a $100 million increase on our term loan during 2016; and
•   $3.3 million increase due to lower interest capitalization on our development and redevelopment projects based on the status and cumulative spend on the projects in process.
during 2016, we recognized $4.2 million of impairment losses on two operating properties and two land parcels. one of the operating properties and both land parcels have since been sold. we did not recognize any impairments during 2015.

we redeemed all of our outstanding $400 million notes in two tranches occurring in 2016 and 2015. during 2016, we recognized a $14.2 million charge when redeeming the $300 million notes. during 2015, we early redeemed $100 million of those same notes, which included an $8.2 million make-whole premium charge.
net investment income increased $1.0 million, driven by realized and unrealized gains on investments held within the non-qualified deferred compensation plan during 2016.
we recognized a $40.6 million charge to settle $220 million of forward starting interest rate swaps related to new debt previously expected to be issued in 2017. as a result of our july 2016 equity offering and the early redemption of the $300 million notes in august 2016, the company believed that the issuance of new fixed rate debt within the remaining period of the forward starting swaps was probable to no longer occur. accordingly, we ceased hedge accounting and reclassified the $40.6 million paid to settle the forward starting swaps from accumulated other comprehensive loss to earnings.

the $34.0 million increase in our equity in income in investments in real estate partnerships is largely attributed to (i) our share of gains on the sale of real estate within our grir, columbia i, columbia ii, and other investments in real estate partnerships; (ii) interest expense savings within grir resulting from decreased debt balances and refinancing activity at lower interest rates; and (iii) and a decrease in depreciation expense within grir from fully depreciated land improvement assets.

the $6.9 million decrease in interest expense, net is mainly due to lower interest rates from refinancing our long-term debt during 2014 and 2015 and lower outstanding balances on notes payable.
we had no impairment losses during 2015. however, during the year ended december 31, 2014, we recognized a $1.1 million loss on the disposal of one operating property and one land parcel and a $175,000 impairment on two parcels of land held.
during november 2015, we incurred an $8.2 million charge from a make-whole premium on our $100.0 million early redemption of the $400.0 million outstanding 5.875% senior unsecured notes that are due in 2017.
net investment income decreased $8.8 million, largely driven by an $8.1 million gain realized on the sale of available-for-sale securities in 2014 and a $1.1 million decrease in the fair value of plan assets in the non-qualified deferred compensation plan during 2015, which is consistent with the change in plan liabilities included in general and administrative expenses above.
during the year ended december 31, 2014, we acquired the remaining 50% interest and gained control of a previously unconsolidated investment in a real estate partnership that owns a single operating property. as the operating property constitutes a business, acquisition of control was accounted for as a step acquisition, and the net assets acquired were recognized at fair value. the gain of $18.3 million was recognized as the difference between the fair value and carrying value of the company's previously held equity interest, using an income approach to measure fair value.

the $8.8 million net decrease is largely attributed to:
grir:  $4.4 million increase driven by:
•   $1.3 million increase in base rent from occupancy and rental rate growth,
•   $1.8 million decrease in depreciation due to higher depreciation expense in 2014 relating to redevelopment activity,
•   reduced interest expense approximately $800,000 by paying off or refinancing property debt at better rates in 2014 and 2015.
columbia i: $1.8 million decrease from impairment loss upon the sale of one operating property during 2015;

we recognized $35.6 million of gains on the sale of real estate, net of taxes, in 2015 attributable to the sale of five operating properties and two land parcels as compared to $55.1 million of gains on the sale of real estate, net of taxes, in 2014 attributable to the sale of eleven operating properties and six land parcels.
income attributable to noncontrolling interests increased $1.0 million due to to the 2014 acquisition of a portfolio held within a consolidated partnership, coupled with new operating activity from a development beginning operations, and a recent redevelopment completion within our consolidated partnerships.

supplemental earnings information we use certain non-gaap performance measures, in addition to the required gaap presentations, as we believe these measures improve the understanding of the company's operating results. we manage our entire real estate portfolio without regard to ownership structure, although certain decisions impacting properties owned through partnerships require partner approval. therefore, we believe presenting our pro-rata share of operating results regardless of ownership structure, along with other non-gaap measures, may assist in comparing the company's operating results to other reits'. we continually evaluate the usefulness, relevance, limitations, and calculation of our reported non-gaap performance measures to determine how best to provide relevant information to the public, and thus such reported measures could change.

we operate our business such that we expect net cash flow from operating activities will provide the necessary funds to pay our distributions to our common and preferred stock and unit holders, which were $222.4 million and $202.8 million for the years ended december 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. our dividend distribution policy is set by our board of directors, who monitors our financial position. our board of directors recently declared a common stock dividend of $0.51 per share, payable on march 1, 2017. future dividends will be declared at the discretion of our board of directors and will be subject to capital requirements and availability. we plan to continue paying an aggregate amount of distributions to our stock and unit holders that, at a minimum, meet the requirements to continue qualifying as a reit for federal income tax purposes.
during the next twelve months, we estimate that we will require approximately $240.2 million of cash, including $149.9 million to complete in-process developments and redevelopments, $86.3 million to repay maturing debt, and $4.0 million to fund our pro-rata share of estimated capital contributions to our co-investment partnerships for repayment of maturing debt. if we start new developments, redevelop additional shopping centers, or commit to new acquisitions, our cash requirements will increase. if we refinance maturing debt, our cash requirements will decrease. to meet our cash requirements, we may utilize cash generated from operations, proceeds from the sale of real estate, available borrowings from our line, and when the capital markets are favorable, proceeds from the sale of equity and the issuance of new long-term debt. these estimated needs reflect regency's needs as a stand-alone entity and is not meant to reflect or give effect to the pending merger with equity one.
we endeavor to maintain a high percentage of unencumbered assets. as of december 31, 2016, 83.0% of our wholly-owned real estate assets were unencumbered. such assets allow us to access the secured and unsecured debt markets and to
55
maintain availability on the line. our coverage ratio, including our pro-rata share of our partnerships, was 3.3 and 2.8 times for the trailing four quarters ended december 31, 2016 and december 31, 2015, respectively. we define our coverage ratio as earnings before interest, taxes, investment transaction profits net of deal costs, depreciation and amortization ("core ebitda") divided by the sum of the gross interest and scheduled mortgage principal paid to our lenders plus dividends paid to our preferred stockholders.
our line, term loan, and unsecured loans require that we remain in compliance with various covenants, which are described in note 6 to the consolidated financial statements. we are in compliance with these covenants at december 31, 2016 and expect to remain in compliance.
subsequent events subsequent to december 31, 2016, the company priced a public offering of two tranches of senior unsecured notes:
•   $350.0 million of 3.6% notes due february 1, 2027, which priced at 99.741%. the company intends to use the net proceeds in connection with the consummation of the previously announced pending merger with equity one, inc., including (i) to repay approximately $285.0 million in aggregate principal amount of debt of equity one, and any related interest, fees and expenses and (ii) to pay transaction expenses related to the pending merger with equity one. in the event that the merger agreement is not consummated, we will be required to redeem these notes then outstanding at a redemption price equal to 101% of the principal amount to be redeemed plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any.
•   $300.0 million of 4.4% notes due february 1, 2047, which priced at 99.110%. the company used a portion of the net proceeds to redeem all of the outstanding shares of its 6.625% series 6 preferred shares on february 16, 2017 and intends to use the balance to fund investment activities and for general corporate purposes.
in connection with the pending merger, the company has commitments to (i) amend its line by increasing the borrowing capacity to $1.0 billion and (ii) enter a new $300.0 million term loan facility.  both of these transactions are contingent upon the consummation of the merger and are scheduled to close simultaneously with the merger.  the company plans to use the proceeds from the new term loan to repay existing term loans held by equity one.  the additional line capacity will accommodate the company's increased property operations and development / redevelopment programs from the merger.

net cash provided by operating activities:
net cash provided by operating activities increased by $13.7 million due to:
•   $32.4 million increase in cash from operating income;
•   $3.7 million increase in operating cash flow distributions received from our unconsolidated real estate partnerships as several redevelopment projects were completed and began generating operating cash flows; and,
•   $11.0 million net increase in cash due to timing of cash receipts and payments related to operating activities; offset by
•   $40.6 million and $7.3 million paid during 2016 and 2015, respectively, to settle forward starting interest rate swaps put in place to hedge changes in interest rates on expected issuance of ten year fixed rate debt. the $40.6 million paid in 2016 was recognized through net income since the previously forecasted debt transaction was probable to no longer occur. the $7.3 million paid in 2015 was recognized in other comprehensive income and is being reclassified to earnings over the period of the ten year debt issued in 2015.

significant investing and divesting activities included:
•   we acquired three shopping centers, with 569,000 sf of gla in 2016, compared to one shopping center with 180,000 sf of gla during 2015.
•   we invested $29.5 million more in 2016 than 2015 on real estate development and capital improvements, as further detailed in a table below.
•   we received proceeds of $135.3 million from the sale of eleven shopping centers and sixteen land parcels in 2016, compared to $108.8 million for five shopping centers and two land parcels in 2015.
•   we invested $17.8 million more in our unconsolidated partnerships during 2016 than 2015 due to the acquisition of an operating property in 2016. contributions were made each year to fund our share of maturing mortgage debt and redevelopment activities.
•   distributions received from our unconsolidated partnerships include return of capital from sales or financing proceeds. the $58.8 million received in 2016 includes proceeds from the sales of ten shopping centers with co-investment partners. distributions in 2015 include $12.8 million of proceeds from the sale of one shopping center with a co-investment partner and $11.0 million of financing proceeds.
•   acquisition of securities and proceeds from sale of securities pertain to equity and debt securities held by our captive insurance company and our deferred compensation plan. the majority of our investing activity during 2016 relates to reallocation of plan assets. during 2015, we invested $7.9 million of funds held in our captive insurance subsidiary in available-for-sale marketable securities. our insurance subsidiary is required to maintain statutory minimum capital and surplus, and therefore, access to these securities may be limited.

we plan to continue developing and redeveloping shopping centers for long-term investment purposes. we deployed capital of $234.6 million for the development, redevelopment, and improvement of our real estate properties as comprised of the following:

•   during 2016 we acquired four land parcels for new development projects as compared to two in 2015.
•   building and tenant improvements increased $2.8 million during the year ended december 31, 2016 primarily related to timing of capital projects.
•   redevelopment expenditures were slightly higher during 2016 due to the timing, magnitude, and number of projects currently in process. we intend to continuously improve our portfolio of shopping centers through redevelopment which can include adjacent land acquisition, existing building expansion, new out-parcel building construction, and tenant improvement costs. the size and scope of each redevelopment project varies with each redevelopment plan.
•   the $7.2 million increase in our development project expenditures was due to the size of and progress on developments. see the table below for a detail of current and recently completed development projects.
•   interest is capitalized on our development and redevelopment projects and is based on cumulative actual development costs expended. we cease interest capitalization when the property is no longer being developed or is available for occupancy upon substantial completion of tenant improvements, but in no event would we capitalize interest on the project beyond 12 months after the anchor opens for business. capitalized interest decreased in 2016 as compared to 2015 as our development or redevelopment projects neared substantial completion and we commenced fewer new projects during the first half of 2016.
•   we have a staff of employees who directly support our development and redevelopment program. internal compensation costs directly attributable to these activities are capitalized as part of each project. changes in the level of future development and redevelopment activity could adversely impact results of operations by reducing the amount of internal costs for development and redevelopment projects that may be capitalized. a
10% reduction in development and redevelopment activity without a corresponding reduction in the compensation costs directly related to our development and redevelopment activities could result in an additional charge to net income of $1.4 million per year.

•   we received proceeds of $100.0 million upon expanding our term loan during 2016 which were used to partially fund the acquisition of market common clarendon, and repay $15.0 million, net on the line as compared to $90.0 million borrowed on from our term loan during 2015.
•   we received $53.4 million of mortgage proceeds in 2016 upon the encumbrance of two operating properties. during 2015, we issued $250.0 million of new fixed rate ten-year unsecured public debt.
•   during 2016, we used $392.8 million to repay debt, including:
◦   $300.0 million for the early redemption of our $300 million notes due 2017,
◦   $14.1 million paid for debt extinguishment costs, including a make-whole premium to redeem the $300 million notes, and
◦   $78.7 million for scheduled principal payments and four mortgage repayments.
during 2015, we used $540.1 million to repay debt, including:

contractual obligations we have debt obligations related to our mortgage loans, unsecured notes, unsecured credit facilities and interest rate swap obligations as described further below and in note 6 and note 7 to the consolidated financial statements. we have shopping centers that are subject to non-cancelable long-term ground leases where a third party owns and has leased the underlying land to us to construct and/or operate a shopping center. in addition, we have non-cancelable operating leases pertaining to office space from which we conduct our business.
the following table of contractual obligations summarizes our debt maturities, including our pro-rata share of obligations within co-investment partnerships as of december 31, 2016, and excludes the following:
•   recorded debt premiums or discounts that are not obligations;
•   obligations related to construction or development contracts, since payments are only due upon satisfactory performance under the contracts;
•   letters of credit of $5.8 million issued to cover our captive insurance program and performance obligations on certain development projects, which the latter will be satisfied upon completion of the development projects; and
•   obligations for retirement savings plans due to uncertainty around timing of participant withdrawals, which are solely within the control of the participant, and are further discussed in note 11 to the consolidated financial statements.

(1) includes interest payments.
(2) we are obligated to contribute our pro-rata share to fund maturities if they are not refinanced. we believe that our partners are financially sound and have sufficient capital or access thereto to fund future capital requirements.  in the event that a co-investment partner was unable to fund its share of the capital requirements of the co-investment partnership, we would have the right, but not the obligation, to loan the defaulting partner the amount of its capital call.
critical accounting estimates knowledge about our accounting policies is necessary for a complete understanding of our financial statements. the preparation of our financial statements requires that we make certain estimates that impact the balance of assets and liabilities as of a financial statement date and the reported amount of income and expenses during a financial reporting period. these accounting estimates are based upon, but not limited to, our judgments about historical and expected future results, current market conditions, and interpretation of industry accounting standards. they are considered to be critical because of their significance to the financial statements and the possibility that future events may differ from those judgments, or that the use of different assumptions could result in materially different estimates. we review these estimates on a periodic basis to ensure reasonableness; however, the amounts we may ultimately realize could differ from such estimates.

accounts receivable and straight line rent minimum rent, percentage rent, and expense recoveries from tenants for common area maintenance costs, insurance and real estate taxes are the company's principal source of revenue. as a result of generating this revenue, we will routinely have accounts receivable due from tenants. we are subject to tenant defaults and bankruptcies that may affect the collection of outstanding receivables. to address the collectability of these receivables, we analyze historical tenant collection rates, write-off experience, tenant credit-worthiness and current economic trends when evaluating the adequacy of our allowance for doubtful accounts and straight line rent reserve. although we estimate uncollectible receivables and provide for them through charges against income, actual experience may differ from those estimates.
real estate investments acquisition of real estate investments upon acquisition of real estate operating properties, the company estimates the fair value of acquired tangible assets (consisting of land, building, building improvements and tenant improvements) and identified intangible assets and liabilities (consisting of above and below-market leases and in-place leases), assumed debt, and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree at the date of acquisition, based on evaluation of information and estimates available at that date. based on these estimates, the company allocates the estimated fair value to the applicable assets and liabilities. fair value is determined based on an exit price approach, which contemplates the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. if, up to one year from the acquisition date, information regarding fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed is received and estimates are refined, appropriate adjustments are made to the purchase price allocation on a retrospective basis. the company expenses transaction costs associated with business combinations in the period incurred.
we strategically co-invest with partners to own, manage, acquire, develop and redevelop operating properties. we analyze our investments in real estate partnerships in order to determine whether the entity should be consolidated. if it is determined that these investments do not require consolidation because the entities are not variable interest entities ("vies"), we are not considered the primary beneficiary of the entities determined to be vies, we do not have voting control, and/or the limited partners (or non-managing members) have substantive kick-out or participation rights, then the selection of the accounting method used to account for our investments in real estate partnerships is generally determined by our voting interests and the degree of influence we have over the entity. management uses its judgment when making these determinations. we use the equity method of accounting for investments in real estate partnerships when we own 20% or more of the voting interests and have significant influence but do not have a controlling financial interest, or if we own less than 20% of the voting interests but have determined that we have significant influence. under the equity method, we record our investments in and advances to these entities as investments in real estate partnerships in our consolidated balance sheets, and our proportionate share of earnings or losses earned by the joint venture is recognized in equity in income (loss) of investments in real estate partnerships in our consolidated statements of operations.
development of real estate assets and cost capitalization we capitalize the acquisition of land, the construction of buildings, and other specifically identifiable development costs incurred by recording them in properties in development in our accompanying consolidated balance sheets. other specifically identifiable development costs include pre-development costs essential to the development process, as well as, interest, real estate taxes, and direct employee costs incurred during the development period. once a development property is substantially complete and held available for occupancy, these indirect costs are no longer capitalized.
•   pre-development costs are incurred prior to land acquisition during the due diligence phase and include contract deposits, legal, engineering, and other professional fees related to evaluating the feasibility of developing a shopping center. if we determine it is probable that a specific project undergoing due diligence will not be developed, we immediately expense all related capitalized pre-development costs not considered recoverable.
•   interest costs are capitalized to each development project based on applying our weighted average borrowing rate to that portion of the actual development costs expended. we cease interest cost capitalization when the property is no longer being developed or is available for occupancy upon substantial completion of tenant improvements, but in no event would we capitalize interest on the project beyond 12 months after the anchor opens for business. during the years ended december 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014, we capitalized interest of $3.5 million, $6.7 million, and $7.1 million, respectively, on our development projects.
•   real estate taxes are capitalized to each development project over the same period as we capitalize interest.
•   we have a staff of employees who directly support our development program. all direct internal costs attributable to these development activities are capitalized as part of each development project. the capitalization of costs is directly
62
related to the actual level of development activity occurring. during the years ended december 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014, we capitalized $13.0 million, $13.8 million, and $16.1 million, respectively, of direct internal costs incurred to support our development program.
valuation of real estate investments we evaluate whether there are any indicators that have occurred, including property operating performance and general market conditions, that would result in us determining that the carrying value of our real estate properties (including any related amortizable intangible assets or liabilities) may not be recoverable. if such indicators occur, we compare the current carrying value of the asset to the estimated undiscounted cash flows that are directly associated with the use and ultimate disposition of the asset. our estimated cash flows are based on several key assumptions, including rental rates, costs of tenant improvements, leasing commissions, anticipated hold period, and assumptions regarding the residual value upon disposition, including the exit capitalization rate. these key assumptions are subjective in nature and the resulting impairment, if any, could differ from the actual gain or loss recognized upon ultimate sale in an arm's length transaction. if the carrying value of the asset exceeds the estimated undiscounted cash flows, an impairment loss is recognized equal to the excess of carrying value over fair value. changes in our disposition strategy or changes in the marketplace may alter the hold period of an asset or asset group, which may result in an impairment loss and such loss could be material to the company's financial condition or operating performance.
we evaluate our investments in real estate partnerships for impairment whenever there are indicators, including underlying property operating performance and general market conditions, that the value of our investments in real estate partnerships may be impaired. an investment in a real estate partnerships is considered impaired only if we determine that its fair value is less than the net carrying value of the investment in that real estate partnerships on an other-than-temporary basis. cash flow projections for the investments consider property level factors, such as expected future operating income, trends and prospects, as well as the effects of demand, competition and other factors. we consider various qualitative factors to determine if a decrease in the value of our investment is other-than-temporary. these factors include the age of the real estate partnerships, our intent and ability to retain our investment in the entity, the financial condition and long-term prospects of the entity and relationships with our partners and banks. if we believe that the decline in the fair value of the investment is temporary, no impairment charge is recorded. if our analysis indicates that there is an other-than-temporary impairment related to the investment in a particular real estate partnership, the carrying value of the investment will be adjusted to an amount that reflects the estimated fair value of the investment.
the fair value of real estate investments is subjective and is determined through comparable sales information and other market data if available, or through use of an income approach such as the direct capitalization or the traditional discounted cash flow methods. such cash flow projections consider factors such as expected future operating income, trends and prospects, as well as the effects of demand, competition and other factors, and therefore are subject to management judgment and changes in those factors could impact the determination of fair value. in estimating the fair value of undeveloped land, we generally use market data and comparable sales information.
derivative instruments the company utilizes financial derivative instruments to manage risks associated with changing interest rates. specifically, the company enters into derivative financial instruments to manage exposures that arise from business activities that result in the receipt or future payment of known and uncertain cash amounts, the amount of which are determined by interest rates.  the company's derivative financial instruments are used to manage differences in the amount, timing, and duration of the company's known or expected cash payments principally related to the company's borrowings.  for additional information on the company's use and accounting for derivatives, see notes 1 and 7 to the consolidated financial statements.
the company assesses effectiveness of our cash flow hedges both at inception and on an ongoing basis. the effective portion of changes in fair value of the interest rate swaps associated with our cash flow hedges is recorded in other comprehensive income which is included in accumulated other comprehensive loss on our consolidated balance sheet and our consolidated statement of equity. our cash flow hedges become ineffective if critical terms of the hedging instrument and the debt instrument do not perfectly match such as notional amounts, settlement dates, reset dates, calculation period and libor rate.  if a cash flow hedge is deemed ineffective, the ineffective portion of changes in fair value of the interest rate swaps associated with our cash flow hedges is recognized in earnings in the period affected.
the fair value of the company's interest rate derivatives is determined using widely accepted valuation techniques including discounted cash flow analysis on the expected cash flows of each derivative.  this analysis reflects the contractual terms of the derivatives, including the period to maturity, and uses observable market-based inputs, including interest rate curves and implied volatilities.  the company incorporates credit valuation adjustments to appropriately reflect both its own nonperformance risk and the respective counterparty's nonperformance risk in the fair value measurements.

recent accounting pronouncements see note 1 to consolidated financial statements.
environmental matters we are subject to numerous environmental laws and regulations as they apply to our shopping centers pertaining to chemicals used by the dry cleaning industry, the existence of asbestos in older shopping centers, and underground petroleum storage tanks. we believe that the tenants who currently operate dry cleaning plants or gas stations do so in accordance with current laws and regulations. generally, we use all legal means to cause tenants to remove dry cleaning plants from our shopping centers or convert them to more environmentally friendly systems. where available, we have applied and been accepted into state-sponsored environmental programs. we have a blanket environmental insurance policy for third-party liabilities and remediation costs on shopping centers that currently have no known environmental contamination. we have also placed environmental insurance, where possible, on specific properties with known contamination, in order to mitigate our environmental risk. we monitor the shopping centers containing environmental issues and in certain cases voluntarily remediate the sites. we also have legal obligations to remediate certain sites and we are in the process of doing so.
as of december 31, 2016 we and our investments in real estate partnerships had accrued liabilities of $8.9 million for our pro-rata share of environmental remediation. we believe that the ultimate disposition of currently known environmental matters will not have a material effect on our financial position, liquidity, or results of operations; however, we can give no assurance that existing environmental studies on our shopping centers have revealed all potential environmental liabilities; that any previous owner, occupant or tenant did not create any material environmental condition not known to us; that the current environmental condition of the shopping centers will not be affected by tenants and occupants, by the condition of nearby properties, or by unrelated third parties; or that changes in applicable environmental laws and regulations or their interpretation will not result in additional environmental liability to us.
off-balance sheet arrangements we do not have off-balance sheet arrangements, financings, or other relationships with other unconsolidated entities (other than our unconsolidated investment partnerships) or other persons, also known as variable interest entities, not previously discussed. our unconsolidated investment partnership properties have been financed with non-recourse loans. we have no guarantees related to these loans.
inflation/deflation inflation has been historically low and has had a minimal impact on the operating performance of our shopping centers; however, inflation may become a greater concern in the future. substantially all of our long-term leases contain provisions designed to mitigate the adverse impact of inflation. most of our leases require tenants to pay their pro-rata share of operating expenses, including common-area maintenance, real estate taxes, insurance and utilities, thereby reducing our exposure to increases in costs and operating expenses resulting from inflation. in addition, many of our leases are for terms of less than ten years, which permits us to seek increased rents upon re-rental at market rates. however, during deflationary periods or periods of economic weakness, minimum rents and percentage rents will decline as the supply of available retail space exceeds demand and consumer spending declines. occupancy declines resulting from a weak economic period will also likely result in lower recovery rates of our operating expenses.

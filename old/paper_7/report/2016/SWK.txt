item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the financial and business analysis below provides information which the company believes is relevant to an assessment and understanding of its consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows. this financial and business analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes. all references to "notes" in this item 7 refer to the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this annual report.
the following discussion and certain other sections of this annual report on form 10-k contain statements reflecting the company's views about its future performance that constitute "forward-looking statements" under the private securities litigation reform act of 1995. these forward-looking statements are based on current expectations, estimates, forecasts and projections about the industry and markets in which the company operates as well as management's beliefs and assumptions. any statements contained herein (including without limitation statements to the effect that stanley black & decker, inc. or its management "believes", "expects", "anticipates", "plans" and similar expressions) that are not statements of historical fact should be considered forward-looking statements. these statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve certain risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict. there are a number of important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated by such forward-looking statements. these factors include, without limitation, those set forth, or incorporated by reference, below under the heading "cautionary statements." the company does not intend to update publicly any forward-looking statements whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.
strategic objectives the company continues to employ the following strategic framework:
•   continue organic growth momentum by utilizing the stanley fulfillment system ("sfs"), a now expanded program ("sfs 2.0") as a catalyst, diversifying toward higher growth, higher margin businesses, and increasing the relative weighting of emerging markets;
•   be selective and operate in markets where brand is meaningful, the value proposition is definable and sustainable through innovation and global cost leadership is achievable; and
•   pursue acquisitive growth on multiple fronts by building upon its existing global tools platform, expanding the industrial platform in engineered fastening and infrastructure, and consolidating the commercial electronic security industry.
the company is continuing to pursue a growth and acquisition strategy that involves industry, geographic and customer diversification to foster sustainable revenue, earnings and cash flow growth. the company also remains focused on growing organically, including increasing its presence in emerging markets, with a goal of generating greater than 20% of annual revenues from those markets over time, and leveraging sfs 2.0 focused on upgrading innovation and digital capabilities while maintaining commercial and supply chain excellence, and funding required investments, in part, through functional transformation. strategic acquisitions, combined with strong organic growth performance, will help enable the company to reach its objective of doubling its size to $22 billion in revenue by 2022 while expanding the margin rate. furthermore, the company's strategic framework, including its focus on diversification, has driven continued improvements in financial performance. sales outside the u.s. represented 48% of total net sales in 2016, up from 29% in 2002, while sales to u.s. and international home centers and mass merchants have decreased to 28% of total sales in 2016 compared to 31% in 2010.
execution of the above strategy has resulted in approximately $6.3 billion of acquisitions since 2002 (excluding the black & decker merger and recently announced acquisitions discussed below), several divestitures, improved efficiency in the supply chain and manufacturing operations, and enhanced investments in organic growth, enabled by cash flow generation and increased debt capacity.
21
the company's long-term financial objectives are as follows:
•   4-6% organic revenue growth;
•   10-12% total revenue growth;
•   10-12% earnings per share growth including acquisitions (6-8% organic earnings per share growth);
•   free cash flow equal to, or exceeding, net income; and
•   sustain 10+ working capital turns.
in terms of capital allocation, the company remains committed, over time, to returning approximately 50% of free cash flow to shareholders through a strong and growing dividend as well as opportunistically repurchasing shares. the remaining free cash flow (approximately 50%) will be deployed towards acquisitions.
the following represents recent examples of the company executing its strategic objectives:
pending acquisitions of newell tools and craftsman brand on october 12, 2016, the company announced that it had entered into a definitive agreement to acquire the tools business of newell brands ("newell tools"), which includes the highly attractive industrial cutting, hand tool and power tool accessory brands irwin® and lenox®, for $1.95 billion in cash. this acquisition will enhance the company's position within the global tools & storage industry and broadens the company's product offerings and solutions to customers and end-users, particularly within power tool accessories. the acquisition of newell tools is expected to be approximately $0.20 to $0.25 accretive to the company's diluted earnings per share in 2017 (increasing to approximately $0.60 per diluted share by the third year), excluding approximately $125 to $140 million of restructuring and other deal related costs and approximately $40 million of non-cash inventory step-up charges, which in the aggregate will largely be incurred in the first two years. the transaction, which has received antitrust clearance under the hart-scott-rodino act in the u.s., is expected to close in the first quarter of 2017.
on january 5, 2017, the company announced that it had entered into a definitive agreement to purchase the craftsman® brand from sears holdings, which provides the company with the rights to develop, manufacture and sell craftsman®-branded products in non-sears holdings channels. the agreement consists of cash payments of $525 million at closing and $250 million at the end of year three, and future payments to sears holdings of between 2.5% and 3.5% on new stanley black & decker sales of craftsman® products through year 15. the company plans to significantly increase the availability of craftsman®-branded products to consumers in previously underpenetrated channels, enhance innovation, and add manufacturing jobs in the u.s. to support growth. the transaction is expected to be accretive to earnings, excluding charges, by approximately $0.10 to $0.15 per share in year one, increasing to approximately $0.35 to $0.45 by year five and to approximately $0.70 to $0.80 by year ten. the transaction, which is subject to customary closing conditions, including regulatory approvals, is expected to close during 2017.
refer to note e, acquisitions, for further discussion of the company's acquisitions.
pending sale of majority of mechanical security businesses in december 2016, the company announced the sale of the majority of its mechanical security businesses to dormakaba for $725 million in cash. the sale, which includes the commercial hardware brands of best access, phi precision and gmt, will allow the company to sharpen its focus on the more strategically attractive commercial electronic security and automatic doors businesses, and to deploy capital in a more accretive and growth-oriented manner. this tax-efficient sale transaction is expected to generate net after-tax cash proceeds of approximately $700 million. the company expects the 2017 diluted earnings per share impact of this transaction to be approximately $0.15 to $0.20 dilutive. the transaction is expected to close in the first quarter of 2017. the assets and liabilities expected to be included in the sale have been classified as held for sale on the company's consolidated balance sheets as of december 31, 2016.
refer to note t, divestitures, for further discussion of the company's divestitures.
conclusion of previously announced security portfolio assessment concurrent with the announcement of the sale above, the company announced its intent to retain its commercial electronic security and automatic doors businesses. the commercial electronic security business, with its inherent linkage to the digital world, provides both a stable recurring revenue stream and an opportunity to develop and market high-value, high-growth customer solutions, while the automatic doors business represents an attractive growth opportunity for market expansion through both core and breakthrough innovation.

driving further profitable growth by fully leveraging existing franchises each of the company's franchises share common attributes: they have world-class brands and attractive growth characteristics, they are scalable and defensible, and they can differentiate through innovation.
•   the tools &amp; storage business is the tool company to own with its strong brands, proven innovation machine, global scale, and broad offering of power and hand tools across many channels in both developed and developing markets.
•   the engineered fastening business is a highly profitable, gdp+ growth business offering highly engineered, value-added innovative solutions with recurring revenue attributes and global scale.
•   the convergent security solutions ("css") business, with its value-add vertical market offerings and attractive recurring revenue, presents a significant margin accretion opportunity over the longer term. the security business, which has historically provided a stable revenue stream through economic cycles, is a gateway into the digital world and an avenue to capitalize on rapid digital changes.
while diversifying the business portfolio through strategic acquisitions remains important, management recognizes that the existing franchises described above are important foundations that continue to provide strong cash flow and growth prospects. management is committed to growing these businesses through innovative product development via sfs 2.0, brand support via innovative and customer centric digital experience, continued investment in emerging markets and a sharp focus on global cost-competitiveness.
continuing to invest in the stanley black & decker brands the company has a strong portfolio of brands associated with high-quality products including stanley®, black+decker®, dewalt®, porter-cable®, bostitch®, proto®, mac®, facom®, aeroscout®, powers®, lista®, sidchrome®, vidmar®, sonitrol®, diyz® and gq®. the stanley®, black+decker® and dewalt® brands are recognized as three of the world's great brands and are amongst the company's most valuable assets. the recently announced acquisitions above will further bolster the company's portfolio with the addition of the irwin®, lenox® and craftsman® brands.
during 2016, the stanley® and dewalt® brands had prominent signage at eight major league baseball stadiums and 27% of all major league baseball games. the company has also maintained long-standing nascar and nhra racing sponsorships, which provided brand exposure during 53 events in 2016. the company has continued its ten-year alliance agreement with the walt disney world resort® whereby stanley® logos are displayed on construction walls throughout the theme parks. brand logos and/or products are featured in various attractions where they are seen by approximately 44 million visitors each year. in 2009, the company also began advertising in the english premier league, which is the number one soccer league in the world, watched weekly by approximately 648 million people. starting in 2014, the company became a sponsor for one of the world's most popular football clubs, fc barcelona, including player image rights, hospitality assets and stadium signage. the company advertises in televised professional bull riding events, as well as sponsoring 3 riders in 'the built ford tough series,' which is broadcast in 129 territories and to more than 400 million households globally. additionally, the company sponsors moto gp, the world's premiere motorcycle racing series reaching 150 million fans per race and airing in over 200 countries, and the monster yamaha tech3 team. the company also has a partnership with the chinese basketball association (cba), the most popular sport in china with over 800 million fans. in 2016, stanley®, black+decker® and dewalt®, partnered with three of the fastest growing and thrilling extreme sports categories - bmx, freeride mountain biking (mtb) and skateboarding - supporting 18 athletes from grass-roots to professional level, to drive the company's millennial marketing objectives.
the above marketing initiatives highlight the company's strong emphasis on brand building and support, which has resulted in more than 200 billion brand impressions annually and a steady improvement across the spectrum of brand awareness measures. the company will continue allocating its brand and advertising spend wisely to capture the emerging digital landscape, whilst continuing to evolve proven marketing programs.
the stanley fulfillment system and sfs 2.0
the core stanley fulfillment system ("sfs") employs continuous improvement techniques to streamline operations (front end & back office) and drive efficiency throughout the supply chain. sfs has five core principles that work in concert: sales and operations planning ("s&op"), operational lean, complexity reduction, global supply management, and order-to-cash excellence. s&op is a dynamic and continuous unified process that links and balances supply and demand in a manner that produces world-class fill rates while minimizing dsi (days sales of inventory). operational lean is the systemic application of lean principles in progressive steps throughout the enterprise to optimize flow toward a pre-defined end state by eliminating
23
waste, increasing efficiency and driving value. complexity reduction is a focused and overt effort to eradicate costly and unnecessary complexity from the company's products, supply chain and back room process and organizations. complexity reduction enables all other sfs elements and, when successfully deployed, results in world-class cost, speed of execution and customer satisfaction. global supply management focuses on strategically leveraging the company's scale to achieve the best possible price and payment terms with the best possible quality, service and delivery among all categories of spend. order-to-cash excellence is a methodical, process-based approach that provides a user-friendly, automated and error-proof customer experience from intent-to-purchase to shipping and billing to payment, while minimizing cash collection cycle time and dso (days sales outstanding). other benefits of sfs include reductions in lead times, rapid realization of synergies during acquisition integrations, and focus on employee safety. the core sfs principles also help to mitigate the impact of material and energy price inflation.
sfs is also instrumental in the reduction of working capital as evidenced by the 80% improvement in the company's working capital turns from 5.9 at the end of 2010 (directly after the merger) to 10.6 at the end of 2016, ahead of the company's top-quartile goal of 10 turns. the continued efforts to deploy sfs across the entire company and increase turns have created significant opportunities to generate incremental free cash flow. going forward, the company plans to further leverage the core sfs principles to generate ongoing improvements both in its existing businesses and future acquisitions in working capital turns, cycle times, complexity reduction and customer service levels, with a long-term goal of sustaining 10+ working capital turns.
in late 2014, the company embarked on an initiative to drive from a more programmatic growth mentality to a true organic growth culture by more deeply embedding breakthrough innovation and commercial excellence into its businesses, and at the same time, becoming a significantly more digitally-enabled enterprise. to that end, the company spent considerable time and effort developing the next iteration of the successful sfs program, which has driven working capital turns to world-class levels and vastly improved the supply chain and customer-facing metrics. entitled "sfs 2.0" this refreshed and revitalized business system continues the progress on core sfs, but importantly, provide resources and added focus into functional transformation, digital excellence, commercial excellence and breakthrough innovation.
sfs 2.0 was launched in 2015 and immediately created a positive impact by driving organic growth, improving margins and reaching new levels of innovation and digitization across the entire organization. the positive impacts of sfs 2.0 continued into 2016, as evidenced by the launch of the dewalt flexvolttm battery system in june 2016. this new battery technology, which is the first major output of the sfs 2.0 breakthrough innovation initiative, changes voltages as the user changes tools allowing for 20v - 60v - 120v (when two batteries are combined) power all within the same battery system and is fully backward compatible with the company's existing 20v line of cordless tools.
the company has made a significant commitment to sfs 2.0 and management believes that its success will be characterized by more consistent organic growth in the 4-6% range as well as expanded operating margin rates over the next 3 to 5 years as the company leverages the growth and reduces structural sg&a levels.
sfs 2.0 is transforming the company by focusing its employees on the following five key pillars:
•   core sfs, which targets asset efficiency, remains as the foundation for the company's operating system and has yielded significant advances in improving working capital turns and free cash flow generation. the company plans to continue leveraging the core sfs principles to further enhance the company's already strong asset efficiency performance.
•   functional transformation takes a clean-sheet approach to redesigning the company's key support functions such as finance, hr, it and others, which although highly effective, after almost a hundred acquisitions are not as efficient as they can be, based on external benchmarks. this presents the company with an opportunity to reduce its sg&amp;a as a percent of sales and becomes a cost effectiveness enabler with the side benefit of helping to fund the following other aspects of sfs 2.0, which together act as enablers for outsized organic growth and margin expansion.
•   digital excellence uses the power of digital to be disruptive and more effective and far reaching through the company's products, solutions and analytics. digital excellence means leveraging the power of emerging technologies across the company's businesses to connected devices, the internet of things, and big data, as well as social and mobile, even more than what is being done today. digital will touch all aspects of the organization and feeds into and supports the other elements of sfs 2.0 - enabling better asset efficiency through core sfs, greater cost effectiveness via the company's support functions, and improving revenues and margins via customer-facing opportunities.
•   commercial excellence is about how the company becomes more effective and efficient in its customer-facing processes resulting in continued share gains and margin expansion throughout its businesses. the company views
24
commercial excellence as world-class execution across seven areas: customer insights, innovation and portfolio management, pricing and promotion, brand and marketing, sales force deployment and effectiveness, channel programs, and the customer experience.
•   breakthrough innovation is aimed at developing a breakthrough innovation culture to identify market disruptive technologies. the company's focus remains on coming up with the next major breakthrough in the industries in which the company operates which, when combined with its existing strong core innovation machine, will drive outsized share gains and margin expansion.
these five pillars will serve as a powerful value driver in the years ahead, feeding the company's new product innovation machine, embracing outstanding commercial and supply chain excellence, embedding digital into the various business models, and funding it with world-class functional efficiency. taken together, these pillars will directly support achievement of the company's long-term financial objectives and further enable its shareholder-friendly capital allocation approach, which has served the company well in the past and will continue to do so in the future.
outlook for 2017
this outlook discussion is intended to provide broad insight into the company's near-term earnings and cash flow generation prospects. the company expects 2017 diluted earnings per share to approximate $6.85 to $7.05 (excluding the estimated earnings per share impacts of the pending acquisitions and divestiture discussed previously), up approximately 7% at the mid-point compared to 2016, with free cash flow conversion, defined as free cash flow divided by net income, approximating 100%. the 2017 outlook assumes organic sales growth of 4% resulting in approximately $0.45 to $0.55 of diluted earnings per share accretion. the net impact of cost and productivity actions, partially offset by higher share count, is expected to result in approximately $0.45 to $0.50 of diluted earnings per share accretion. commodity inflation, approximating $50 to $55 million, and foreign exchange headwinds, approximating $50 million, are expected to negatively impact diluted earnings per share by $0.50 to $0.55. core restructuring charges and the tax rate are expected to be relatively consistent with 2016 levels.
results of operations below is a summary of the company's operating results at the consolidated level, followed by an overview of business segment performance.
terminology: the term "organic" is utilized to describe results aside from the impacts of foreign currency fluctuations and acquisitions during their initial 12 months of ownership. this ensures appropriate comparability to operating results of prior periods.
net sales: net sales were $11.407 billion in 2016, up 2%, compared to $11.172 billion in 2015. organic sales volume and pricing provided increases of 3% and 1%, respectively, partially offset by a 2% decrease due to negative impacts from foreign currency. in the tools & storage segment, net sales increased 5% compared to 2015 due to strong organic growth of 7%, driven by solid growth across all regions, bolstered by the launch of the dewalt flexvolttm battery system, partially offset by foreign currency pressures of 2%. net sales in the security segment were relatively flat compared to 2015 as organic growth of 1% and small bolt-on electronic acquisitions of 1% were offset by foreign currency headwinds of 2%. industrial net sales declined 5% relative to 2015 primarily due to a 4% decrease in organic sales volume, which was mainly driven by weaker electronics volumes attributable to a major customer and pressured industrial volumes in the engineered fastening business as well as fewer off-shore pipeline projects and an ongoing difficult scrap steel market in the infrastructure business. excluding the impact of the electronics customer, the industrial segment's organic growth was relatively flat in 2016.
net sales were $11.172 billion in 2015, down 1% compared to $11.339 billion in 2014. organic sales volume and pricing provided increases of 5% and 1%, respectively, but were more than offset by a 7% decrease due to negative impacts from foreign currency. in the tools & storage segment, organic sales increased 8% compared to 2014 as a result of strong growth across all regions primarily due to share gains from innovative new products and an expanded retail footprint. net sales in the security segment decreased 7% compared to 2014 primarily due to foreign currency declines of 7% and lower volumes in north america and emerging markets, which more than offset organic growth in europe. in the industrial segment, organic sales grew 2% relative to 2014 due to strong organic growth in the engineered fastening business primarily as a result of strong global automotive revenues.
gross profit: the company reported gross profit of $4.267 billion, or 37.4% of net sales, in 2016 compared to $4.072 billion, or 36.4% of net sales, in 2015. the increase in the profit rate reflects favorable impacts from price, productivity, cost actions and commodity deflation, which more than offset unfavorable foreign currency.
25
the company reported gross profit of $4.072 billion, or 36.4% of net sales, in 2015 compared to $4.103 billion, or 36.2% of net sales, in 2014. the increase in the profit rate reflects favorable impacts from volume leverage, price, productivity, cost actions and commodity deflation, which more than offset significant unfavorable foreign currency fluctuations.
sg&a expense: selling, general and administrative expenses, inclusive of the provision for doubtful accounts ("sg&a"), were $2.624 billion, or 23.0% of net sales, in 2016 compared to $2.486 billion, or 22.3% of net sales, in 2015. the increase in the sg&a rate was driven by investments in key sfs 2.0 initiatives moderated by continued tight management of costs.
sg&a expenses were $2.486 billion, or 22.3% of net sales, in 2015 compared to $2.596 billion, or 22.9% of net sales in 2014. the decrease in the sg&a rate reflects the positive impacts of volume leverage and cost controls.
distribution center costs (i.e. warehousing and fulfillment facility and associated labor costs) are classified within sg&a. this classification may differ from other companies who may report such expenses within cost of sales. due to diversity in practice, to the extent the classification of these distribution costs differs from other companies, the company's gross margins may not be comparable. such distribution costs classified in sg&a amounted to $235.6 million in 2016, $229.3 million in 2015 and $243.2 million in 2014.
corporate overhead: the corporate overhead element of sg&a and gross profit, which is not allocated to the business segments, amounted to $197.2 million in 2016, $164.0 million in 2015 and $177.4 million in 2014. the increase in 2016 compared to 2015 was primarily due to investments in sfs 2.0 initiatives and higher employee-related costs. the decrease in 2015 compared to 2014 reflects positive impacts from the company's effort to reduce certain indirect expenses. corporate overhead represented 1.7%, 1.5%, and 1.6% of net sales in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.
other-net: other-net totaled $196.9 million in 2016, $222.0 million in 2015 and $239.6 million in 2014. the decrease in 2016 compared to 2015 was primarily driven by lower unfavorable impacts of foreign currency and lower amortization expense, partially offset by higher acquisition-related costs. the decrease in 2015 compared to 2014 was primarily driven by lower amortization expense partially offset by negative impacts of foreign currency.
interest, net: net interest expense in 2016 was $171.3 million compared to $165.2 million in 2015 and $163.6 million in 2014. the increase in net interest expense in 2016 versus 2015 was primarily due to amortization of debt issuance costs partially offset by an increase in interest income as a result of higher average cash balances during 2016. the increase in net interest expense in 2015 versus 2014 was primarily attributable to the termination of interest rate swaps in 2014 hedging the company's $400 million 5.20% notes due 2040.
income taxes: the company's effective tax rate was 21.3% in 2016, 21.6% in 2015, and 20.9% in 2014. the effective tax rate in both 2016 and 2015 differed from the u.s. statutory rate primarily due to a portion of the company's earnings being realized in lower-taxed foreign jurisdictions, adjustments to tax positions relating to undistributed foreign earnings, and reversals of valuation allowances for certain foreign and u.s. state net operating losses, which have become realizable. the effective tax rate in 2014 differed from the u.s. statutory rate primarily due to a portion of the company's earnings being realized in lower-taxed foreign jurisdictions, the passage of u.s. tax legislation, settlement of various income tax audits and the reversal of valuation allowances for certain foreign net operating losses which had become realizable.
business segment results the company's reportable segments are aggregations of businesses that have similar products, services and end markets, among other factors. the company utilizes segment profit which is defined as net sales minus cost of sales and sg&a inclusive of the provision for doubtful accounts (aside from corporate overhead expense), and segment profit as a percentage of net sales to assess the profitability of each segment. segment profit excludes the corporate overhead expense element of sg&a, other-net (inclusive of intangible asset amortization expense), restructuring charges, interest income, interest expense, and income tax expense. corporate overhead is comprised of world headquarters facility expense, cost for the executive management team and the expense pertaining to certain centralized functions that benefit the entire company but are not directly attributable to the businesses, such as legal and corporate finance functions. refer to note o, restructuring charges and asset impairments, and note f, goodwill and intangible assets, for the amount of net restructuring charges and intangibles amortization expense, respectively, attributable to each segment.
as previously discussed, in the first quarter of 2015, the company combined the construction & do-it-yourself ("cdiy") business with certain complementary elements of the industrial and automotive repair ("iar") and healthcare businesses (formerly part of the industrial and security segments, respectively) to form one tools & storage business. the company recast segment net sales and profit for all periods presented to align with this change in organizational structure. there was no impact to the consolidated financial statements of the company as a result of this change.
26
the company classifies its business into three reportable segments, which also represent its operating segments: tools & storage, security and industrial.
tools & storage:
the tools & storage segment is comprised of the power tools and hand tools, accessories & storage ("htas") businesses. the power tools business includes both professional and consumer products. professional products include professional grade corded and cordless electric power tools and equipment including drills, impact wrenches and drivers, grinders, saws, routers and sanders, as well as pneumatic tools and fasteners including nail guns, nails, staplers, and staples, concrete and masonry anchors. consumer products include corded and cordless electric power tools sold primarily under the black+decker brand, lawn and garden products including hedge trimmers, string trimmers, lawn mowers, edgers, and related accessories and home products such as hand held vacuums, paint tools and cleaning appliances. the htas business sells measuring, leveling and layout tools, planes, hammers, demolition tools, knives, saws, chisels and industrial and automotive tools. power tool accessories include drill bits, router bits, abrasives and saw blades. storage products include tool boxes, sawhorses, medical cabinets and engineered storage solution products.

tools & storage net sales increased $328.5 million, or 5%, in 2016 compared to 2015. organic sales increased 7% primarily due to organic growth of 7% in north america, 8% in europe, and 5% in emerging markets, while unfavorable effects of foreign currency decreased net sales by 2%. north america growth was fueled by share gains from the successful launch of the dewalt flexvolt system, core product innovation and strong commercial execution. europe achieved above-market organic growth leveraging the benefits of new products, growth investments and an expanded retail footprint. growth in emerging markets, led by latin america and asia, was driven by successful commercial execution surrounding mid-price point products and regional pricing actions.
segment profit amounted to $1,266.9 million, or 17.0% of net sales, in 2016 compared to $1,170.1 million, or 16.4% of net sales, in 2015. the increase in segment profit year-over-year was primarily driven by volume leverage, price, productivity, cost management and lower commodity prices, which more than offset currency and growth investments.
tools & storage net sales increased $107.7 million, or 2%, in 2015 compared to 2014. organic sales increased 8% primarily due to organic growth of 11% in north america, 7% in europe, and 3% in emerging markets, while unfavorable effects of foreign currency decreased net sales by 6%. share gains from innovative new products and brand extensions combined with a healthy underlying u.s. tool market fueled growth in north america despite downward pressure in the industrial channels and canada. europe achieved above-market organic growth due to share gains from new products, an expanded retail footprint and solid commercial momentum. organic growth within the emerging markets was driven by favorable impacts of pricing and successful mid-price-point product releases, which more than offset weakness in certain markets, particularly russia and china.
segment profit amounted to $1,170.1 million, or 16.4% of net sales, in 2015 compared to $1,074.4 million, or 15.3% of net sales, in 2014. the increase in segment profit year-over-year was primarily driven by volume leverage, price, productivity, cost management and lower commodity prices, which more than offset significant foreign currency headwinds.
security:
the security segment is comprised of the convergent security solutions ("css") and the mechanical access solutions ("mas") businesses. the css business designs, supplies and installs electronic security systems and provides electronic security services, including alarm monitoring, video surveillance, fire alarm monitoring, systems integration and system maintenance. purchasers of these systems typically contract for ongoing security systems monitoring and maintenance at the time of initial equipment installation. the business also sells healthcare solutions, which include asset tracking solutions, infant protection, pediatric protection, patient protection, wander management, fall management, and emergency call products. the mas business sells automatic doors, commercial hardware, locking mechanisms, electronic keyless entry systems, keying systems, tubular and mortise door locksets.

security net sales increased $4.5 million in 2016 compared to 2015. organic sales and small bolt-on electronic acquisitions each provided increases of 1%, while foreign currency decreased net sales by 2%. europe posted positive organic growth of 2% on higher installation revenues, while north america declined 1% organically primarily due to lower sales volume within the commercial electronic security business partially offset by higher prices and volumes in the automatic doors business. the security segment's organic growth in 2016 was also bolstered by double-digit growth within the emerging markets on easing comparables.
segment profit amounted to $269.2 million, or 12.8% of net sales, in 2016 compared to $239.6 million, or 11.4% of net sales, in 2015. the increase in segment profit year-over-year was mainly due to improved operating performance in both north america and europe, driven by a more disciplined assessment of new commercial opportunities, improved field productivity, and cost actions, which in the aggregate more than offset currency headwinds.
security net sales decreased $168.3 million, or 7%, in 2015 compared to 2014. organic sales were relatively flat year-over-year while foreign currency fluctuations resulted in a 7% decrease in net sales. organic growth of 3% in europe was primarily driven by higher installation revenues in a number of countries and a stable recurring revenue portfolio. north america organic sales were relatively flat year-over-year as modest price increases were offset by lower sales volume within the commercial electronics business as 2014 benefited from a large retail installation. organic sales declined in emerging markets due to relatively weak market conditions in china.
segment profit amounted to $239.6 million, or 11.4% of net sales, in 2015 compared to $259.2 million, or 11.5% of net sales, in 2014. the segment profit rate was relatively flat year-over-year as improved operating performance within europe was offset by field cost inefficiencies within the north america electronics business and the deleveraging impact of lower volumes in emerging markets.

industrial net sales decreased $97.9 million, or 5%, in 2016 compared with 2015, due to a 4% decline in organic sales and a 1% decrease from foreign currency. engineered fastening organic revenues declined 4% primarily due to weaker electronics volumes attributable to a major customer and pressured industrial volumes, which more than offset higher automotive growth. excluding the impact of the major electronics customer, engineered fastening's organic sales were slightly positive in 2016. infrastructure organic revenues decreased 5% due to a slowdown in oil & gas off-shore project activity as well as ongoing difficult scrap steel market conditions in the hydraulics business.
segment profit totaled $304.4 million, or 16.5% of net sales, in 2016 compared to $339.9 million, or 17.5% of net sales, in 2015. the year-over-year decrease in segment profit rate was primarily driven by lower volumes and currency, which more than offset productivity gains and cost control actions.
industrial net sales decreased $106.2 million, or 5%, in 2015 compared with 2014 as organic growth of 2% was more than offset by unfavorable foreign currency of 7%. engineered fastening achieved organic growth of 4% during 2015, which was mainly attributable to strong global automotive revenues. infrastructure organic sales decreased 4% primarily due to lower

hydraulics volumes as a result of difficult scrap steel market conditions, which more than offset modest organic growth in oil & gas.
segment profit totaled $339.9 million, or 17.5% of net sales, in 2015 compared to $350.6 million, or 17.1% of net sales, in 2014. the year-over-year increase in segment profit rate was primarily due to favorable volume leverage from engineered fastening, productivity gains and cost controls, which more than offset negative impacts from foreign currency and lower hydraulics volumes.

financial condition liquidity, sources and uses of capital: the company's primary sources of liquidity are cash flows generated from operations and available lines of credit under various credit facilities. the company's cash flows are presented on a consolidated basis and include cash flows from discontinued operations in 2015 and 2014.
operating activities: cash flows from operations were $1.485 billion in 2016 compared to $1.182 billion in 2015, representing a $303 million increase. the year-over-year increase was primarily due to higher earnings and cash flows from working capital (accounts receivable, inventory, accounts payable and deferred revenue). as discussed previously, working capital turns increased to 10.6 as of december 31, 2016, an improvement of 1.4 turns over the prior year, demonstrating the company's continued commitment to its core sfs principles.
in 2015, cash flows from operations were $1.182 billion, a $114 million decrease compared to $1.296 billion in 2014. the year-over-year decrease was primarily due to higher outflows from working capital as a result of lower than expected sales volumes in the fourth quarter of 2015.
in 2014, cash flows from operations were $1.296 billion, a $428 million increase compared to $868 million in 2013. the year-over-year increase was primarily driven by an increase in earnings and lower one-time restructuring and related payments,
29
partially offset by higher employee benefit plan contributions. furthermore, operating cash flows in 2014 were positively impacted by an increase in working capital turns from 8.1 at december 28, 2013 to 9.2 at january 3, 2015, demonstrating the continued success of sfs.
free cash flow: management considers free cash flow an important indicator of its liquidity, as well as its ability to fund future growth and provide dividends to shareowners. free cash flow does not include deductions for mandatory debt service, other borrowing activity, discretionary dividends on the company's common stock and business acquisitions, among other items.

investing activities: cash flows used in investing activities were $284 million in 2016, primarily due to capital and software expenditures of $347 million and business acquisitions of $59 million, partially offset by $105 million of cash proceeds related to net investment hedge settlements, which were primarily driven by the significant fluctuations in foreign currency rates during 2016 associated with foreign exchange contracts hedging a portion of the company's pound sterling, canadian dollar, and euro denominated net investments.
cash flows used in investing activities in 2015 totaled $205 million, which primarily consisted of capital and software expenditures of $311 million partially offset by $137 million of cash proceeds related to net investment hedge settlements, which were primarily driven by the significant fluctuations in foreign currency rates during 2015 associated with foreign exchange contracts hedging a portion of the company's pound sterling and canadian dollar denominated net investments.
cash flows used in investing activities in 2014 totaled $382 million, which primarily consisted of capital and software expenditures of $291 million and payments related to net investment hedge settlements of $61 million. the lower capital expenditures in 2014 was driven by management's continued focus to control spend in this area as well as lower integration-related capital expenditures. the payments related to net investment hedge settlements were mainly driven by the significant fluctuations in foreign currency rates during 2014 associated with foreign exchange contracts hedging a portion of the company's pound sterling denominated net investment.
financing activities: cash flows used in financing activities were $433 million in 2016 primarily due to share repurchases of $374 million, cash payments for dividends of $331 million, and the settlement of the october 2014 forward share purchase contract for $147 million, partially offset by proceeds from issuances of common stock of $419 million, which mainly related to the issuance of 3.5 million shares associated with the settlement of the 2013 equity purchase contracts. the higher dividend payments in 2016 were driven by the increase in quarterly dividends per common share to $0.58. the dividend paid in december 2016 to shareholders of record extended the company's record for the longest consecutive annual and quarterly dividend payments among industrial companies listed on the new york stock exchange. the company also paid approximately $13 million in december 2016 to purchase the remaining 30% interest in gmt, which is included in the pending sale of the majority of the company's mechanical security businesses, as discussed previously.
cash flows used in financing activities in 2015 were $876 million, primarily due to the repurchase of 6.6 million common shares for $650 million and cash payments for dividends of $320 million, partially offset by proceeds from issuances of common stock of $164 million, which mainly related to the exercises of stock options. the company also paid approximately $34 million in december 2015 to purchase the remaining 40% interest in gq.
cash flows used in financing activities in 2014 were $766 million, primarily due to net repayments of short-term borrowings of $391 million, cash payments for dividends of $321 million, and payments on long-term debt of $47 million related to the repurchase of $46 million of 2022 term notes. in 2014, the company also terminated $400 million of interest rate swaps hedging the company's $400 million, 5.20% notes due 2053, which resulted in cash payments of $33.4 million. proceeds from issuances of common stock totaled $71 million, which was primarily related to stock option exercises.
fluctuations in foreign currency rates negatively impacted cash by $102 million, $133 million and $147 million in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. these negative impacts were primarily driven by the continued strengthening of the u.s. dollar, against the company's other currencies.

credit ratings and liquidity:
the company maintains strong investment grade credit ratings from the major u.s. rating agencies on its senior unsecured debt (s&p a, fitch a-, moody's baa1), as well as its commercial paper program (s&p a-1, fitch f2, moody's p-2). there have been no changes to any of the ratings during 2016.  failure to maintain strong investment grade rating levels could adversely affect the company's cost of funds, liquidity and access to capital markets, but would not have an adverse effect on the company's ability to access its existing committed credit facilities.
cash and cash equivalents totaled $1.132 billion as of december 31, 2016, which was predominantly held in foreign jurisdictions. as of january 2, 2016 cash and cash equivalents totaled $465 million, comprised of $131 million in the u.s. and $334 million in foreign jurisdictions. concurrent with the black & decker merger, the company made a determination to repatriate certain legacy black & decker foreign earnings, on which u.s. income taxes had not previously been provided. as a result of this repatriation decision, the company has recorded approximately $261 million of associated deferred tax liabilities at december 31, 2016. current plans and liquidity requirements do not demonstrate a need to repatriate other foreign earnings. accordingly, all other undistributed foreign earnings of the company are considered to be permanently reinvested, or will be remitted substantially free of additional tax, consistent with the company's overall growth strategy internationally, including acquisitions and long-term financial objectives. no provision has been made for taxes that might be payable upon remittance of these undistributed foreign earnings. however, should management determine at a later point to repatriate additional foreign earnings, the company would be required to accrue and pay taxes at that time.
at december 31, 2016 and january 2, 2016, the company had no commercial paper borrowings outstanding against the company's $2.0 billion commercial paper program. in january 2017, the company amended its $2.0 billion commercial paper program to increase the maximum amount of notes authorized to be issued to $3.0 billion and to include euro denominated borrowings in addition to u.s. dollars. in february 2017, the company issued €600.0 million in euro denominated commercial paper under its $3.0 billion u.s. dollar and euro commercial paper program which has been designated as a net investment hedge as described in more detail in note i, derivative financial instruments.
also, in january 2017, the company executed a 364-day $1.3 billion committed credit facility (the "2017 credit agreement"). the 2017 credit agreement consists of a $1.3 billion revolving credit loan and a sub-limit of an amount equal to the euro equivalent of $400 million for swing line advances. borrowings under the 2017 credit agreement may be made in u.s. dollars or euros, pursuant to the terms of the agreement, and bear interest at a floating rate dependent on the denomination of the borrowing. repayments must be made by january 17, 2018 or upon an earlier termination of the 2017 credit agreement at the election of the company. the 2017 credit agreement serves as a liquidity back-stop for the company's $3.0 billion u.s. dollar and euro commercial paper program, also authorized and amended in january 2017, as discussed above.
the company has a five-year $1.75 billion committed credit facility (the "credit agreement"). borrowings under the credit agreement may include u.s. dollars up to the $1.75 billion commitment or in euro or pounds sterling subject to a foreign currency sub-limit of $400.0 million and bear interest at a floating rate dependent upon the denomination of the borrowing. repayments must be made on december 18, 2020 or upon an earlier termination date of the credit agreement, at the election of the company. the credit agreement is designated to be a liquidity back-stop for the company's $2.0 billion commercial paper program. as of december 31, 2016, the company has not drawn on this commitment.
in addition, the company has short-term lines of credit that are primarily uncommitted, with numerous banks, aggregating $588.5 million, of which $493.8 million was available at december 31, 2016. short-term arrangements are reviewed annually for renewal.
at december 31, 2016, the aggregate amount of committed and uncommitted, long- and short-term lines was $2.3 billion. at december 31, 2016, $4.3 million was recorded as short-term borrowings outstanding against uncommitted lines excluding commercial paper. in addition, $94.7 million of the short-term credit lines was utilized primarily pertaining to outstanding letters of credit for which there are no required or reported debt balances. the weighted average interest rates on short-term borrowings, primarily commercial paper, for the fiscal years ended december 31, 2016 and january 2, 2016 were 0.6% and 0.4%, respectively.
in march 2015, the company entered into a forward share purchase contract with a financial institution counterparty for (3,645,510) shares of common stock. the contract obligates the company to pay $350.0 million, plus an additional amount related to the forward component of the contract. in november 2016, the company amended the settlement date to april 2019, or earlier at the company's option.
in october 2014, the company entered into a forward share purchase contract on its common stock. the contract obligated the company to pay $150.0 million, plus an additional amount related to the forward component of the contract, to the financial
31

(a)   future payments on long-term debt encompass all payments related to aggregate debt maturities, excluding certain fair value adjustments included in long-term debt, as discussed further in note h, long-term debt and financing arrangements.
(b)   future interest payments on long-term debt reflect the applicable fixed interest rate or variable rate for floating rate debt in effect at december 31, 2016.
(c)   inventory purchase commitments primarily consist of open purchase orders to purchase raw materials, components, and sourced products.
(d)   future cash flows on derivative instruments reflect the fair value and accrued interest as of december 31, 2016. the ultimate cash flows on these instruments will differ, perhaps significantly, based on applicable market interest and foreign currency rates at their maturity.
(e)   in march 2015, the company entered into a forward share purchase contract with a financial institution counterparty which obligates the company to pay $350.0 million, plus an additional amount related to the forward component of the contract. in november 2016, the company amended the final settlement date to april 2019, or earlier at the company's option. see note j, capital stock for further discussion.
(f)   this amount principally represents contributions either required by regulations or laws or, with respect to unfunded plans, necessary to fund current benefits. the company has not presented estimated pension and post-retirement funding beyond 2017 as funding can vary significantly from year to year based upon changes in the fair value of the plan assets, actuarial assumptions, and curtailment/settlement actions.
to the extent the company can reliably determine when payments will occur pertaining to unrecognized tax liabilities, the related amount will be included in the table above. however, due to the high degree of uncertainty regarding the timing of potential future cash flows associated with the $375.4 million of such liabilities at december 31, 2016, the company is unable to make a reliable estimate of when (if at all) amounts may be paid to the respective taxing authorities.
aside from debt payments, for which there is no tax benefit associated with repayment of principal, and tax obligations, payments of the above contractual obligations will typically generate a cash tax benefit such that the net cash outflow will be lower than the gross amounts summarized above.

market risk market risk is the potential economic loss that may result from adverse changes in the fair value of financial instruments, currencies, commodities and other items traded in global markets. the company is exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates, stock prices, bond prices and commodity prices, amongst others.
exposure to foreign currency risk results because the company, through its global businesses, enters into transactions and makes investments denominated in multiple currencies. the company's predominant currency exposures are related to the euro, canadian dollar, british pound, australian dollar, brazilian real, argentine peso, the chinese renminbi ("rmb") and the taiwan dollar. certain cross-currency trade flows arising from sales and procurement activities, as well as affiliate cross-border activity, are consolidated and netted prior to obtaining risk protection through the use of various derivative financial instruments which may include: purchased basket options, purchased options, collars, cross currency swaps and currency forwards. the company is thus able to capitalize on its global positioning by taking advantage of naturally offsetting exposures and portfolio efficiencies to reduce the cost of purchasing derivative protection. at times, the company also enters into forward exchange contracts and purchases options to reduce the earnings and cash flow impact of non-functional currency denominated receivables and payables, primarily for affiliate transactions. gains and losses from these hedging instruments offset the gains or losses on the underlying net exposures (the assets and liabilities being hedged). management determines the nature and extent of currency hedging activities, and in certain cases, may elect to allow certain currency exposures to remain un-hedged. the company may also enter into cross-currency swaps and forward contracts to hedge the net investments in certain subsidiaries and better match the cash flows of operations to debt service requirements. management estimates the foreign currency impact from its derivative financial instruments outstanding at the end of 2016 would have been approximately $6 million incremental pre-tax loss based on a hypothetical 10% adverse movement in all net derivative currency positions; this effect would occur from the strengthening of foreign currencies relative to the u.s. dollar. the company follows risk management policies in executing derivative financial instrument transactions, and does not use such instruments for speculative purposes. the company generally does not hedge the translation of its non-u.s. dollar earnings in foreign subsidiaries, but may choose to do so in certain instances in future periods.
as mentioned above, the company routinely has cross-border trade and affiliate flows that cause an impact on earnings from foreign exchange rate movements. the company is also exposed to currency fluctuation volatility from the translation of foreign earnings into u.s. dollars and the economic impact of foreign currency volatility on monetary assets held in foreign currencies. it is more difficult to quantify the transactional effects from currency fluctuations than the translational effects. aside from the use of derivative instruments, which may be used to mitigate some of the exposure, transactional effects can potentially be influenced by actions the company may take. for example, if an exposure occurs from a european entity sourcing product from a u.s. supplier it may be possible to change to a european supplier. management estimates the combined translational and transactional impact, on pre-tax earnings, of a 10% overall movement in exchange rates is approximately $123 million, or approximately $0.65 per diluted share. in 2016, translational and transactional foreign currency fluctuations negatively impacted pre-tax earnings by approximately $155 million and diluted earnings per share by approximately $0.82.
the company's exposure to interest rate risk results from its outstanding debt and derivative obligations, short-term investments, and derivative financial instruments employed in the management of its debt portfolio. the debt portfolio including both trade and affiliate debt, is managed to achieve capital structure targets and reduce the overall cost of borrowing by using a combination of fixed and floating rate debt as well as interest rate swaps, and cross-currency swaps.
the company's primary exposure to interest rate risk comes from its floating rate debt in the u.s. which is based on libor rates. at december 31, 2016, the impact of a hypothetical 10% increase in the interest rates associated with the company's floating rate debt instruments would have an immaterial effect on the company's financial position and results of operations.
the company has exposure to commodity prices in many businesses, particularly brass, nickel, resin, aluminum, copper, zinc, steel, and energy used in the production of finished goods. generally, commodity price exposures are not hedged with derivative financial instruments, but instead are actively managed through customer product and service pricing actions, procurement-driven cost reduction initiatives and other productivity improvement projects.
fluctuations in the fair value of the company's common stock affect domestic retirement plan expense as discussed below in the employee stock ownership plan section of md&a. additionally, the company has $70 million of liabilities as of december 31, 2016 pertaining to unfunded defined contribution plans for certain u.s. employees for which there is mark-to-market exposure.
the assets held by the company's defined benefit plans are exposed to fluctuations in the market value of securities, primarily global stocks and fixed-income securities. the funding obligations for these plans would increase in the event of adverse changes in the plan asset values, although such funding would occur over a period of many years. in 2016, 2015 and 2014,
34
investment returns on pension plan assets resulted in a $260 million increase, an $11 million decrease, and a $285 million increase, respectively. the company expects funding obligations on its defined benefit plans to be approximately $66 million in 2017. the company employs diversified asset allocations to help mitigate this risk. management has worked to minimize this exposure by freezing and terminating defined benefit plans where appropriate.
the company has access to financial resources and borrowing capabilities around the world. there are no instruments within the debt structure that would accelerate payment requirements due to a change in credit rating.
the company's existing credit facilities and sources of liquidity, including operating cash flows, are considered more than adequate to conduct business as normal. accordingly, based on present conditions and past history, management believes it is unlikely that operations will be materially affected by any potential deterioration of the general credit markets that may occur. the company believes that its strong financial position, operating cash flows, committed long-term credit facilities and borrowing capacity, and ready access to equity markets provide the financial flexibility necessary to continue its record of annual dividend payments, to invest in the routine needs of its businesses, to make strategic acquisitions and to fund other initiatives encompassed by its growth strategy and maintain its strong investment grade credit ratings.
other matters employee stock ownership plan as detailed in note l, employee benefit plans, the company has an esop under which the ongoing u.s. core and 401(k) defined contribution plans are funded. overall esop expense is affected by the market value of the company's stock on the monthly dates when shares are released, among other factors. the company's net esop activity resulted in income of $3.1 million in 2016 and expense of $0.8 million in 2015 and $0.7 million in 2014. esop expense could increase in the future if the market value of the company's common stock declines.
critical accounting estimates - preparation of the company's consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. significant accounting policies used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements are described in note a, significant accounting policies. management believes the most complex and sensitive judgments, because of their significance to the consolidated financial statements, result primarily from the need to make estimates about the effects of matters with inherent uncertainty. the most significant areas involving management estimates are described below. actual results in these areas could differ from management's estimates.
allowance for doubtful accounts - the company's estimate for its allowance for doubtful accounts related to trade receivables is based on two methods. the amounts calculated from each of these methods are combined to determine the total amount reserved. first, a specific reserve is established for individual accounts where information indicates the customers may have an inability to meet financial obligations. in these cases, management uses its judgment, based on the surrounding facts and circumstances, to record a specific reserve for those customers against amounts due to reduce the receivable to the amount expected to be collected. these specific reserves are reevaluated and adjusted as additional information is received. second, a reserve is determined for all customers based on a range of percentages applied to receivable aging categories. these percentages are based on historical collection and write-off experience.
if circumstances change, for example, due to the occurrence of higher-than-expected defaults or a significant adverse change in a major customer's ability to meet its financial obligation to the company, estimates of the recoverability of receivable amounts due could be reduced.
inventories - lower of cost or market, slow moving and obsolete - inventories in the u.s. are primarily valued at the lower of last-in first-out ("lifo") cost or market, while non-u.s. inventories are primarily valued at the lower of first-in, first-out ("fifo") cost or market. the calculation of lifo reserves, and therefore the net inventory valuation, is affected by inflation and deflation in inventory components. the company ensures all inventory is valued at the lower of cost or market, and continually reviews the carrying value of discontinued product lines and stock-keeping-units ("skus") to determine that these items are properly valued. the company also continually evaluates the composition of its inventory and identifies obsolete and/or slow-moving inventories. inventory items identified as obsolete and/or slow-moving are evaluated to determine if write-downs are required. the company assesses the ability to dispose of these inventories at a price greater than cost. if it is determined that cost is less than market value, cost is used for inventory valuation. if market value is less than cost, the company writes down the related inventory to that value. if a write-down to the current market value is necessary, the market value cannot be greater than the net realizable value, or ceiling (defined as selling price less costs to sell and dispose), and cannot be lower than the net realizable value less a normal profit margin, also called the floor. if the company is not able to achieve its expectations regarding net realizable value of inventory at its current value, a write-down would be recorded.
35
goodwill and intangible assets - the company acquires businesses in purchase transactions that result in the recognition of goodwill and intangible assets. the determination of the value of intangible assets requires management to make estimates and assumptions. in accordance with asc 350-20, "goodwill," acquired goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized but are subject to impairment testing at least annually or when an event occurs or circumstances change that indicate it is more likely than not an impairment exists. definite-lived intangible assets are amortized and are tested for impairment when an event occurs or circumstances change that indicate it is more likely than not that an impairment exists. goodwill represents costs in excess of fair values assigned to the underlying net assets of acquired businesses. at december 31, 2016, the company reported $6,694.0 million of goodwill, $1,508.5 million of indefinite-lived trade names and $791.0 million of net definite-lived intangibles. these amounts exclude approximately $302.8 million of goodwill, $65.2 million of an indefinite-lived trade name and $31.8 million of net definite-lived intangibles that are classified within assets held for sale on the consolidated balance sheets at december 31, 2016. refer to note t, divestitures, for further discussion.
management tests goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level. a reporting unit is an operating segment as defined in asc 280, "segment reporting," or one level below an operating segment (component level) as determined by the availability of discrete financial information that is regularly reviewed by operating segment management or an aggregate of component levels of an operating segment having similar economic characteristics. if the carrying value of a reporting unit (including the value of goodwill) is greater than its estimated fair value, an impairment may exist. an impairment charge would be recorded to the extent that the recorded value of goodwill exceeded the implied fair value.
as required by the company's policy, goodwill was tested for impairment in the third quarter of 2016. beginning in 2013, the company adopted asu 2011-08, "intangibles - goodwill and other (topic 350): testing goodwill for impairment," for its goodwill impairment testing. asu 2011-08 permits companies to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform the two-step quantitative goodwill impairment test. under the two-step quantitative goodwill impairment test, the fair value of the reporting unit is compared to its respective carrying amount including goodwill. if the fair value exceeds the carrying amount, then no impairment exists.  if the carrying amount exceeds the fair value, further analysis is performed to assess impairment. such tests are completed separately with respect to the goodwill of each of the company's reporting units. accordingly, the company applied the qualitative assessment for four of its reporting units, while performing the quantitative test for its infrastructure reporting unit. based on the results of the annual 2016 impairment testing, the company determined that the fair values of each of its reporting units exceeded their respective carrying amounts.
in performing the qualitative assessment, the company identified and considered the significance of relevant key factors, events, and circumstances that could affect the fair value of each reporting unit. these factors include external factors such as macroeconomic, industry, and market conditions, as well as entity-specific factors, such as actual and planned financial performance. the company also assessed changes in each reporting unit's fair value and carrying value since the most recent date a fair value measurement was performed. as a result of the qualitative assessments performed, the company concluded that it is more likely than not that the fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its respective carrying value and therefore, no additional quantitative impairment testing was performed.
with respect to the quantitative test, the company assessed the fair value of the infrastructure reporting unit using a discounted cash flow valuation model. the key assumptions applied to the cash flow projections included a 9% discount rate, near-term revenue growth rates over the next five years, which represented a cumulative annual growth rate of approximately 5%, and a 3% perpetual growth rate. these assumptions contemplated business, market and overall economic conditions. based on the results of this testing, the company determined that the fair value of the reporting unit exceeded its carrying amount. furthermore, management performed sensitivity analyses on the fair value resulting from the discounted cash flow valuation model utilizing more conservative assumptions that reflect reasonably likely future changes in the discount rate and perpetual growth rate. the discount rate was increased by 100 basis points with no impairment indicated. the perpetual growth rate was decreased by 150 basis points with no impairment indicated.
during the fourth quarter of 2016, in connection with its quarterly forecasting cycle, the company updated the forecasted operating results for each of its businesses based on the most recent financial results and best estimates of future operations. the updated forecasts reflected an expected decline in near-term revenue growth and profitability for the infrastructure reporting unit within the industrial segment, primarily due to ongoing difficult market conditions in the oil & gas industry, mainly related to project delays as a result of continued geopolitical challenges and a cyclical slowdown in offshore pipeline activity, as well as a slower than expected recovery in the scrap steel market. accordingly, in connection with the preparation of the consolidated financial statements for the year ended december 31, 2016, the company performed an updated impairment analysis with respect to the infrastructure reporting unit, which included approximately $269 million of goodwill at year-end. based on this analysis, which included revised assumptions of near-term revenue growth and profitability levels, it was determined that the fair value of the infrastructure reporting unit exceeded its carrying value by 14%. therefore, management concluded it was not more likely than not that an impairment had occurred. management is confident in the long-term viability
36
and success of the infrastructure reporting unit based on the strong long-term growth prospects of the markets and geographies served, the company's continued commitment to, and investments in, organic growth initiatives (including solid progress being made with respect to breakthrough innovation projects under the sfs 2.0 program), and infrastructure's leading market position in its respective industries.
in the event that future operating results of any of the company's reporting units do not meet current expectations, management, based upon conditions at the time, would consider taking restructuring or other actions as necessary to maximize revenue growth and profitability. accordingly, the above sensitivity analyses, while useful, should not be used as a sole predictor of potential impairment. a thorough analysis of all the facts and circumstances existing at that time would need to be performed to determine if recording an impairment loss would be appropriate.
the company also tested its indefinite-lived trade names for impairment during the third quarter of 2016, utilizing both qualitative assessments and quantitative tests. for the qualitative assessments, the company identified and considered the significance of relevant key factors, events, and circumstances that could affect the fair value of each trade name. these factors primarily included macroeconomic, industry, and market conditions, as well as the trade names' actual and planned financial performance. as a result of the qualitative assessments performed, the company concluded that it is more likely than not that the fair values of the trade names exceeded their respective carrying values and therefore, no additional quantitative impairment testing was performed. for the quantitative impairment tests, the company utilized a discounted cash flow model. the key assumptions used included discount rates, royalty rates, and perpetual growth rates applied to the projected sales. based on these quantitative impairment tests, the company determined that the fair values of the indefinite-lived trade names exceeded their respective carrying amounts.
defined benefit obligations - the valuation of pension and other postretirement benefits costs and obligations is dependent on various assumptions. these assumptions, which are updated annually, include discount rates, expected return on plan assets, future salary increase rates, and health care cost trend rates. the company considers current market conditions, including interest rates, to establish these assumptions. discount rates are developed considering the yields available on high-quality fixed income investments with maturities corresponding to the duration of the related benefit obligations. the company's weighted-average discount rates for the united states and international pension plans were 4.00% and 2.50%, respectively, at december 31, 2016. the company's weighted-average discount rate for the united states and international pension plans was 4.25% and 3.25%, respectively, at january 2, 2016. as discussed further in note l, employee benefit plans, the company develops the expected return on plan assets considering various factors, which include its targeted asset allocation percentages, historic returns, and expected future returns. the company's expected rate of return assumptions for the united states and international pension plans were 6.50% and 4.75%, respectively, at december 31, 2016. the company will use a 5.35% weighted-average expected rate of return assumption to determine the 2017 net periodic benefit cost. a 25 basis point reduction in the expected rate of return assumption would increase 2017 net periodic benefit cost by approximately $5 million on a pre-tax basis.
the company believes that the assumptions used are appropriate; however, differences in actual experience or changes in the assumptions may materially affect the company's financial position or results of operations. to the extent that actual (newly measured) results differ from the actuarial assumptions, the difference is recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income, and, if in excess of a specified corridor, amortized over future periods. the expected return on plan assets is determined using the expected rate of return and the fair value of plan assets. accordingly, market fluctuations in the fair value of plan assets can affect the net periodic benefit cost in the following year. the projected benefit obligation for defined benefit plans exceeded the fair value of plan assets by $691 million at december 31, 2016. a 25 basis point reduction in the discount rate would have increased the projected benefit obligation by approximately $90 million at december 31, 2016. the primary black & decker u.s pension and post employment benefit plans were curtailed in late 2010, as well as the only material black & decker international plan, and in their place the company implemented defined contribution benefit plans. the vast majority of the projected benefit obligation pertains to plans that have been frozen; the remaining defined benefit plans that are not frozen are predominantly small domestic union plans and those that are statutorily mandated in certain international jurisdictions. the company recognized $12 million of defined benefit plan expense in 2016, which may fluctuate in future years depending upon various factors including future discount rates and actual returns on plan assets.
environmental - the company incurs costs related to environmental issues as a result of various laws and regulations governing current operations as well as the remediation of previously contaminated sites. future laws and regulations are expected to be increasingly stringent and will likely increase the company's expenditures related to environmental matters.
the company's policy is to accrue environmental investigatory and remediation costs for identified sites when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. the amount of liability recorded is based on an evaluation of currently available facts with respect to each individual site and includes such factors as existing technology, presently enacted laws and regulations, and prior experience in remediation of contaminated sites. the liabilities
37
recorded do not take into account any claims for recoveries from insurance or third parties. as assessments and remediation progress at individual sites, the amounts recorded are reviewed periodically and adjusted to reflect additional technical and legal information that becomes available.
as of december 31, 2016, the company had reserves of $160.9 million for remediation activities associated with company-owned properties as well as for superfund sites, for losses that are probable and estimable. the range of environmental remediation costs that is reasonably possible is $128.3 million to $267.1 million which is subject to change in the near term. the company may be liable for environmental remediation of sites it no longer owns. liabilities have been recorded on those sites in accordance with this policy.
income taxes - income taxes are accounted for in accordance with asc 740, "accounting for income taxes," which requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities be recognized, using enacted tax rates, for the effect of temporary differences between the book and tax bases of recorded assets and liabilities. deferred tax assets, including net operating losses and capital losses, are reduced by a valuation allowance if it is "more likely than not" that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.
in assessing the need for a valuation allowance, the company considers all positive and negative evidence including: estimates of future taxable income, considering the feasibility of ongoing tax planning strategies, the realizability of tax loss carryforwards and the future reversal of existing temporary differences. valuation allowances related to deferred tax assets can be impacted by changes to tax laws, changes to statutory tax rates and future taxable income levels. in the event the company were to determine that it would not be able to realize all or a portion of its deferred tax assets in the future, the unrealizable amount would be charged to earnings in the period in which that determination is made. by contrast, if the company were to determine that it would be able to realize deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the net carrying amounts, it would decrease the recorded valuation allowance through a favorable adjustment to earnings in the period in which that determination is made.
the company is subject to income tax in a number of locations, including many state and foreign jurisdictions. significant judgment is required when calculating its worldwide provision for income taxes. the company considers many factors when evaluating and estimating its tax positions and tax benefits, which may require periodic adjustments and which may not accurately anticipate actual outcomes. it is reasonably possible that the amount of the unrecognized benefit with respect to certain of the company's unrecognized tax positions will significantly increase or decrease within the next 12 months. these changes may be the result of settlement of ongoing audits or final decisions in transfer pricing matters. the company periodically assesses its liabilities and contingencies for all tax years still subject to audit based on the most current available information, which involves inherent uncertainty. for those tax positions where it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained, the company has recorded the largest amount of tax benefit with a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority under the premise that the taxing authority has full knowledge of all relevant information. for those income tax positions where it is not more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained, no tax benefit has been recognized in the financial statements. the company recognizes interest and penalties associated with income taxes as a component of income taxes in the consolidated statement of operations. see note q, income taxes, for further discussion.
risk insurance - to manage its insurance costs efficiently, the company self insures for certain u.s. business exposures and generally has low deductible plans internationally. for domestic workers' compensation, automobile and product liability (liability for alleged injuries associated with the company's products), the company generally purchases insurance coverage only for severe losses that are unlikely, and these lines of insurance involve the most significant accounting estimates. while different self insured retentions, in the form of deductibles and self insurance through its captive insurance company, exist for each of these lines of insurance, the maximum self insured retention is set at no more than $5 million per occurrence. the process of establishing risk insurance reserves includes consideration of actuarial valuations that reflect the company's specific loss history, actual claims reported, and industry trends among statistical and other factors to estimate the range of reserves required. risk insurance reserves are comprised of specific reserves for individual claims and additional amounts expected for development of these claims, as well as for incurred but not yet reported claims discounted to present value. the cash outflows related to risk insurance claims are expected to occur over a period of approximately 13 years. the company believes the liabilities recorded for these u.s. risk insurance reserves, totaling $89 million and $96 million as of december 31, 2016, and january 2, 2016, respectively, are adequate. due to judgments inherent in the reserve estimation process, it is possible the ultimate costs will differ from this estimate.
warranty - the company provides product and service warranties which vary across its businesses. the types of warranties offered generally range from one year to limited lifetime, while certain products carry no warranty. further, the company sometimes incurs discretionary costs to service its products in connection with product performance issues. historical warranty and service claim experience forms the basis for warranty obligations recognized. adjustments are recorded to the
38
warranty liability as new information becomes available. the company believes the $103 million reserve for expected warranty claims as of december 31, 2016 is adequate, but due to judgments inherent in the reserve estimation process, including forecasting future product reliability levels and costs of repair as well as the estimated age of certain products submitted for claims, the ultimate claim costs may differ from the recorded warranty liability. the company also establishes a reserve for product recalls on a product-specific basis during the period in which the circumstances giving rise to the recall become known and estimable for both company-initiated actions and those required by regulatory bodies.
off-balance sheet arrangement synthetic leases - the company is a party to synthetic leasing programs for certain locations, including one of its major distribution centers. the programs qualify as operating leases for accounting purposes, such that only the monthly rent expense is recorded in the consolidated statements of operations and the liability and value of the underlying assets are off-balance sheet.
these lease programs are utilized primarily to reduce overall cost and to retain flexibility. the cash outflows for lease payments approximate the $1 million of rent expense recognized in fiscal 2016. as of december 31, 2016 the estimated fair value of assets and remaining obligations for these properties were $67 million and $58 million, respectively.

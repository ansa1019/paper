overview we are a global provider of domain name registry services and internet security, enabling internet navigation for many of the world's most recognized domain names and providing protection for websites and enterprises around the world. our registry services ensure the security, stability and resiliency of key internet infrastructure and services, including the .com and .net domains, two of the internet's root servers, and the operation of the root zone maintainer function for the core of the internet's dns. our product suite also includes security services, consisting of ddos protection services, idefense services, and managed dns services. revenues from security services are not significant in relation to our consolidated revenues. on february 9, 2017, we entered into an agreement to sell the idefense business, subject to customary closing conditions.
as of december 31, 2016, we had approximately 142.2 million .com and .net registrations in the domain name base. the number of domain names registered is largely driven by continued growth in online advertising, e-commerce, and the number of internet users, which is partially driven by greater availability of internet access, as well as marketing activities carried out by us and third-party registrars. growth in the number of domain name registrations under our management may be hindered by certain factors, including overall economic conditions, competition from cctlds, the introduction of new gtlds, and ongoing changes in the internet practices and behaviors of consumers and businesses. factors such as the evolving practices and preferences of internet users, and how they navigate the internet, as well as the motivation of domain name registrants and how they will manage their investment in domain names, can negatively impact our business and the demand for new domain name registrations and renewals.

critical accounting policies and significant management estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles. the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. on an ongoing basis, management evaluates those estimates. management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily available from other sources. actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
an accounting estimate is considered critical if the nature of the estimates or assumptions is material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment involved, and the impact of changes in the estimates and assumptions would have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements. we believe the following critical accounting estimates and policies have the most significant impact on our consolidated financial statements:
revenue recognition we generate revenues by providing services over a period of time. fees for these services are deferred and recognized as performance occurs. the majority of our revenue transactions contain standard business terms and conditions. however, at times, we enter into non-standard arrangements including multiple-element arrangements. as a result, we must evaluate (1) whether an arrangement exists; (2) how the arrangement consideration should be allocated among the deliverables; (3) when to recognize revenue on the deliverables; and (4) whether all elements of the arrangement have been delivered. our revenue recognition policy also requires an assessment as to whether collection is reasonably assured, which requires us to evaluate the creditworthiness of our customers.
fair value of financial instruments our subordinated convertible debentures have a contingent interest payment provision that is identified as an embedded derivative. the embedded derivative is accounted for separately at fair value, and is marked to market at the end of each reporting period. we utilize a valuation model based on stock price, bond price, risk free interest rates, volatility, and credit spread observations to estimate the value of the derivative. several of these inputs to the model are not observable and require management judgment.
income taxes accounting for income taxes requires significant judgments in the development of estimates used in income tax calculations. such judgments include, but are not limited to, the likelihood we would realize the benefits of net operating loss carryforwards, domestic and/or foreign tax credit carryforwards, the adequacy of valuation allowances, and the rates used to measure transactions with foreign subsidiaries. to the extent recovery of deferred tax assets is not likely, we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized.
our operations involve dealing with uncertainties and judgments in the application of complex tax regulations in multiple jurisdictions. the final taxes payable are dependent upon many factors, including negotiations with taxing authorities in various jurisdictions and resolution of disputes arising from u.s. federal, state, and international tax audits. we only recognize or continue to only recognize tax positions that are more likely than not to be sustained upon examination. we adjust these amounts in light of changing facts and circumstances; however, due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the tax liabilities.
deferred income taxes are not provided for any funds remaining in the foreign subsidiaries because these earnings are intended to be indefinitely reinvested. we consider the following matters, among others, in evaluating our plans for indefinite reinvestment: the forecasts, budgets and financial requirements of the parent and subsidiaries for both the long and short term; the tax consequences of a decision to reinvest; and any u.s. and foreign government programs designed to influence remittances. if factors change and as a result we are unable to indefinitely reinvest the foreign earnings, the income tax expense and payments may differ significantly from the current period and could materially adversely affect our results of operations.
28
earnings per share we use the treasury stock method to calculate the impact of our subordinated convertible debentures on diluted earnings per share. under this method, only a positive conversion spread related to the subordinated convertible debentures is included in the diluted earnings per share calculations. this is based on our intent and ability to settle the principal amount of the subordinated convertible debentures in cash. a change in our intent and ability would require us to use the if-converted method, which could have a material impact on our diluted earnings per share.

revenues revenues related to our registry services are primarily derived from registrations for domain names in the .com and .net domain name registries. we also derive revenues from operating domain name registries for several other tlds and from providing back-end registry services to a number of tld registry operators, all of which are not significant in relation to our consolidated revenues. for domain names registered with the .com and .net registries we receive a fee from registrars per annual registration that is fixed pursuant to our agreements with icann. individual customers, called registrants, contract directly with registrars or their resellers, and the registrars in turn register the domain names with verisign. changes in revenues are driven largely by changes in the number of new domain name registrations and the renewal rate for existing registrations as well as the impact of new and prior price increases, to the extent permitted by icann and the doc. new registrations and the renewal rate for existing registrations are impacted by continued growth in online advertising, e-commerce, and the number of internet users, as well as marketing activities carried out by us and our registrars. we increased the annual fee for a .net domain name registration from $6.18 to $6.79 on february 1, 2015, from $6.79 to $7.46 on february 1, 2016, and from $7.46 to $8.20 on february 1, 2017. the annual fee for a .com domain name registration is fixed at $7.85 for the duration of the current .com registry agreement through november 30, 2024, except that prices may be raised by up to 7% each year due to the imposition of any new consensus policy or documented extraordinary expense resulting from an attack or threat of attack on the security and stability (each as defined in the .com registry agreement) of the dns, subject to approval of the doc. we offer promotional marketing programs for our registrars based upon market conditions and the business environment in which the registrars operate. all fees paid to us for .com and .net registrations are in u.s. dollars. revenues from security services are not significant in relation to our total consolidated revenues.

2016 compared to 2015: revenues increased by $82.8 million, primarily due to an increase in the average number of domain names ending in .com and .net and increases in the .net domain name registration fees in february 2015 and 2016. growth in the domain name base was primarily driven by continued internet growth and marketing activities carried out by us and our registrars.  during the second half of 2015 and the first quarter of 2016 we experienced an increased volume of new domain name registrations primarily from our registrars in china.  the volume of these new registrations was inconsistent and episodic compared to prior periods, and by the end of the first quarter of 2016, reverted back to a more normalized registration pace. a significant portion of these registrations from the second half of 2015 did not renew in the fourth quarter of 2016, which resulted in a net decrease of 1.9 million domain name registrations during the quarter. despite the decrease in the domain name base in the fourth quarter, 2016 revenues benefited from this increased volume of registrations in the second half of 2015 and the first quarter of 2016.
2015 compared to 2014: revenues increased by $49.2 million, primarily due to a 6% increase in the number of domain names ending in .com and .net and increases in the .net domain name registration fees in february 2014 and 2015. total revenue growth of 5% was slightly less than the 6% growth in the domain name base due to the timing of registrations throughout the year, as a significant portion of new registrations occurred during the third and fourth quarters of 2015.
ongoing economic uncertainty, competitive pressure from cctlds, the introduction of new gtlds, ongoing changes in internet practices and behaviors of consumers and business, as well as the motivation of existing domain name registrants and how they will manage their investment in domain names, has limited the rate of growth of the domain name base in recent years and may continue to do so in 2017 and beyond.
we expect revenues will remain consistent in 2017, as a result of the increased volume of domain registrations in 2016, continued growth in the domain name base in 2017, and increases in the .net domain name registration fees in february 2016 and 2017, partially offset by the decrease in revenue resulting from the planned divestiture of our idefense business.

revenues for our registry services business are attributed to the country of domicile and the respective regions in which our registrars are located, however, this may differ from the regions where the registrars operate or where registrants are located. revenue growth for each region may be impacted by registrars reincorporating, relocating, or from acquisitions or changes in affiliations of resellers. revenue growth for each region may also be impacted by registrars domiciled in one region, registering domain names in another region. although revenues continued to grow in the more mature markets of the u.s. and emea during 2016, china saw the highest growth rate due in part to the increased volume of new registrations during the second half of 2015 and the first quarter of 2016.

our effective tax rate for each year presented was lower than the statutory federal rate of 35% primarily due to benefits from foreign income taxed at lower rates, partially offset by state income taxes. our effective tax rate for 2014 was also impacted by net income tax expense of $9.8 million related to a reorganization of certain international operations and changes in estimates related to the 2013 worthless stock deduction and the 2014 repatriation of earnings from foreign subsidiaries.
as of december 31, 2016, we had deferred tax assets arising from deductible temporary differences, tax losses, and tax credits of $235.7 million, net of valuation allowances, but before the offset of certain deferred tax liabilities. with the exception of deferred tax assets related to capital loss carryforwards, we believe it is more likely than not that the tax effects of the deferred tax liabilities, together with future taxable income, will be sufficient to fully recover the remaining deferred tax assets. our deferred tax assets related to net operating loss ("nol") carryforwards and tax credit carryforwards decreased in 2016 as a portion of the nol and tax credit carryforwards were utilized to offset 2016 taxable income.
beginning in 2015, we qualified for a tax holiday in switzerland which does not expire, unless the required thresholds are no longer met, or there is a law change which eliminates the holiday. we qualified for another tax holiday in switzerland which expired on december 31, 2016, but may be renewed if certain criteria are satisfied. an additional tax holiday in switzerland expired in 2014 and was not extended. the tax holidays provide reduced rates of taxation on certain types of income and also require certain thresholds of foreign source income. these tax holidays increased the company's earnings per share by $0.16, $0.14, and $0.50 in 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively.

as of december 31, 2016, our principal source of liquidity was $231.9 million of cash and cash equivalents and $1.6 billion of marketable securities. the marketable securities consist primarily of debt securities issued by the u.s. treasury meeting the criteria of our investment policy, which is focused on the preservation of our capital through investment in investment grade securities. the cash equivalents consist mainly of amounts invested in money market funds and u.s. treasury bills purchased with original maturities of less than 90 days. as of december 31, 2016, all of our debt securities have contractual maturities of less than one year. our cash and cash equivalents are readily accessible. for additional information on our investment portfolio, see note 2, "cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities," of our notes to consolidated financial statements in item 15 of this form 10-k.
as of december 31, 2016, the amount of cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities held by foreign subsidiaries was $1.4 billion. our intent remains to indefinitely reinvest these funds outside of the u.s. and accordingly, we have not provided deferred u.s. taxes for these funds. in the event funds from foreign operations are needed to fund operations in the u.s. and if u.s. tax has not already been provided, we would be required to accrue and pay additional u.s. taxes in order to repatriate these funds. as of december 31, 2016, the amount of undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries for which deferred income taxes have not been provided was $926.7 million.
in 2016, we repurchased 7.8 million shares of our common stock at an average stock price of $81.73 for an aggregate cost of $636.5 million under our share repurchase program. in 2015, we repurchased 9.3 million shares of our common stock at an average stock price of $66.59 for an aggregate cost of $621.9 million. in 2014, we repurchased 16.3 million shares of our common stock at an average stock price of $53.15 for an aggregate cost of $867.1million. on february 9, 2017, our board authorized the repurchase of approximately $640.9 million of our common stock, in addition to the $359.1 million of our common stock remaining available for repurchase under the previous share repurchase program, for a total repurchase authorization of up to $1.0 billion of our common stock.
on march 27, 2015, we issued $500.0 million of 5.25% senior unsecured notes due april 1, 2025. the proceeds were used for general corporate purposes, including, but not limited to, the repurchase of shares under our share repurchase program. as of december 31, 2016, we also had $750.0 million of 4.625% senior unsecured notes outstanding, which are due in may 2023.
on march 31, 2015, we entered into a new $200.0 million unsecured revolving credit facility. this facility will expire in 2020 and replaced our prior unsecured revolving credit facility. as of december 31, 2016, there were no borrowings outstanding under this credit facility.
as of december 31, 2016, we had $1.25 billion principal amount outstanding of our subordinated convertible debentures. the price of our common stock exceeded the conversion price threshold trigger during the fourth quarter of 2016. accordingly, the subordinated convertible debentures are convertible at the option of each holder through march 31, 2017. we do not expect a material amount of the subordinated convertible debentures to be converted in the near term as the trading price of the debentures exceeds the value that is likely to be received upon conversion. however, we cannot provide any assurance that the trading price of the debentures will continue to exceed the value that would be derived upon conversion or that the holders will not elect to convert the subordinated convertible debentures. if a holder elects to convert its subordinated convertible debentures, we are permitted under the indenture to pursue an exchange in lieu of conversion or to settle the conversion value (as defined in the indenture) in cash, stock, or a combination thereof. if we choose not to pursue or cannot complete an exchange in lieu of conversion, we currently have the intent and the ability (based on current facts and circumstances) to settle the principal amount of the subordinated convertible debentures in cash. however, if the principal amount of the subordinated convertible debentures that holders actually elect to convert exceeds our cash on hand and cash from operations, we will need to draw cash from existing financing or pursue additional sources of financing to settle the subordinated convertible debentures in cash. we cannot provide any assurances that we will be able to obtain new sources of financing on terms acceptable to us or at all, nor can we assure that we will be able to obtain such financing in time to settle the subordinated convertible debentures that holders elect to convert. the subordinated convertible debentures continue to generate cash tax benefits while they remain outstanding and they are an important part of our capital structure.  although we

will have the right to redeem these debentures under the terms of the indenture starting in august 2017, our intention, based on current conditions, is to not redeem these debentures, which will allow the cash tax benefits to continue to accrue.
we paid contingent interest of $13.4 million in 2016 and $10.8 million in 2015 in addition to the normal coupon interest on the subordinated convertible debentures. on february 16, 2017, we paid contingent interest of $7.7 million and we will pay an additional $7.5 million in august 2017.
during the third quarter of 2016, we paid $143.0 million for the future assignment to us of contractual rights to the .web gtld, pending resolution of objections by other applicants, regulatory review, and approval from icann.
during 2014, we repatriated approximately $740.9 million of cash held by foreign subsidiaries, net of foreign withholding taxes of $28.1 million. we utilized substantially all of the remaining net operating losses generated from the 2013 worthless stock deduction to offset 2014 taxable income including the taxable income recognized in the u.s. as a result of the repatriation.
we believe existing cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, and funds generated from operations, together with our ability to arrange for additional financing should be sufficient to meet our working capital, capital expenditure requirements, and to service our debt for the next 12 months. we regularly assess our cash management approach and activities in view of our current and potential future needs.
in summary, our cash flows for 2016, 2015, and 2014 were as follows:

net cash provided by operating activities our largest source of operating cash flows is cash collections from our customers. our primary uses of cash from operating activities are for personnel related expenditures, and other general operating expenses, as well as payments related to taxes, interest and facilities.
2016 compared to 2015: cash provided by operating activities increased primarily due to an increase in cash received from customers and a decrease in cash paid for income taxes, partially offset by an increase in cash paid for interest. cash received from customers increased primarily due to an increase in the number of domain name registration renewals and the increase in .net domain name registration fees in february 2016. cash paid for income taxes decreased primarily due to income tax payments in 2015 related to the reorganization of certain international operations. cash paid for interest increased due to the interest paid on the $500.0 million senior notes issued on march 2015, and higher contingent interest related to the subordinated convertible debentures.
2015 compared to 2014: cash provided by operating activities increased primarily due to an increase in cash received from customers partially offset by increases in cash paid for interest. cash received from customers increased primarily due to an increase in new and renewed domain name registrations. cash paid for interest increased as a result of the contingent interest paid to holders of the subordinated convertible debentures and the additional interest paid on the $500.0 million senior notes issued in march 2015.
net cash (used in) provided by investing activities the changes in cash flows from investing activities primarily relate to purchases, maturities and sales of marketable securities, and purchases of property and equipment and rights to intangible assets.
2016 compared to 2015: the decrease in cash used in investing activities was primarily due to an increase in sales and maturities of marketable securities, net of purchases, and a decrease in purchases of property and equipment and other investing activities, partially offset by the payments made for the future assignment of the rights to the .web gtld.
35
2015 compared to 2014: the change in cash (used in) provided by investing activities was primarily due to a decrease in proceeds from maturities and sales of marketable securities, partially offset by a decrease in purchases of marketable securities.
net cash used in financing activities the changes in cash flows from financing activities primarily relate to share repurchases, proceeds from and repayment of borrowings, stock option exercises, our employee stock purchase plan ("espp"), and excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation.
2016 compared to 2015: the increase in net cash used in financing activities was primarily due to an increase in share repurchases, and proceeds from the issuance of senior notes in march 2015, partially offset by an increase in excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation.
2015 compared to 2014: the decrease in net cash used in financing activities was primarily due to the proceeds from the issuance of the senior notes in 2015, a decrease in share repurchases, and higher recognized excess tax benefits associated with stock-based compensation, partially offset by lower proceeds from stock option exercises and espp.
impact of inflation we do not believe that inflation has had a significant impact on our operations in any of the periods presented.
income taxes we derive significant tax savings from the subordinated convertible debentures.  during 2016 and 2015, the interest deduction, for income tax purposes, related to our subordinated convertible debentures, was $183.7 million and $175.0 million, respectively, compared to cash interest paid, including contingent interest, of $54.0 million and $51.4 million in 2016 and 2015, respectively. for income tax purposes, we deduct interest expense on the subordinated convertible debentures calculated at 8.5% of the adjusted issue price, subject to adjustment for actual versus projected contingent interest. the adjusted issue price, and consequently the interest deduction for income tax purposes, grows over the term due to the difference between the interest deduction taken using a comparable yield of 8.5% on the adjusted issue price, and the coupon rate of 3.25% on the principal amount, compounded annually. the interest deduction taken is subject to recapture upon settlement to the extent that the amount paid (in cash or stock) to settle subordinated convertible debentures is less than the adjusted issue price. interest recognized in accordance with gaap, which is calculated at 8.39% of the liability component of the subordinated convertible debentures, will also grow over the term, but at a slower rate. this difference will result in a continuing increase in the deferred tax liability on our consolidated balance sheet.
we do not expect to pay significant u.s. federal income taxes during 2017 as a result of the interest deduction on our subordinated convertible debentures, the use of foreign tax credits and other tax attributes. we expect the amount of cash paid for non-u.s. income taxes in 2017 to increase compared to 2016.
property and equipment expenditures our planned property and equipment expenditures for 2017 are anticipated to be between $35.0 million and $45.0 million and will primarily be focused on infrastructure upgrades and enhancements to our product portfolio.
contractual obligations see note 13, "commitments and contingencies," purchase obligations and contractual agreements, of our notes to consolidated financial statements in item 15 of this form 10-k.
off-balance sheet arrangements it is not our business practice to enter into off-balance sheet arrangements. as of december 31, 2016, we did not have any significant off-balance sheet arrangements. see note 13, "commitments and contingencies," off-balance sheet arrangements, of our notes to consolidated financial statements in item 15 of this form 10-k for further information regarding off-balance sheet arrangements.
36
dilution from subordinated convertible debentures, rsus and stock options any conversion of our subordinated convertible debentures may dilute the holdings of existing shareholders due to the potential number of shares that could be required to settle the subordinated convertible debentures. we have the intent and ability to settle the principal amount of the subordinated convertible debentures in cash, but the excess of the conversion value over the principal amount ("the conversion spread") may be settled in shares of common stock. as of december 31, 2016, there are 36.4 million shares of common stock reserved for issuance upon conversion or repurchase of the subordinated convertible debentures. based on the if-converted value of the subordinated convertible debentures as of december 31, 2016, the conversion spread could have required us to issue up to 19.9 million shares of common stock.
grants of stock-based awards are key components of the compensation packages we provide to attract and retain certain of our talented employees and align their interests with the interests of existing stockholders. we recognize that these stock-based awards dilute existing stockholders and have sought to control the number granted while providing competitive compensation packages. as of december 31, 2016, there are a total of 1.8 million unvested rsus which represent potential dilution of 1.8%. this maximum potential dilution will only result if all outstanding rsus vest and are settled. in recent years, our stock repurchase program has more than offset the dilutive effect of rsu grants to employees; however, we may reduce the level of our stock repurchases in the future as we may use our available cash for other purposes.

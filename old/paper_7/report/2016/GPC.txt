index to financial statements we recorded consolidated net sales of $15.3 billion for the year ended december 31, 2016, an increase of 0.4% compared to sales in 2015. consolidated net income for the year ended december 31, 2016 was $687 million, down 3% from $706 million in 2015. the company's growth strategy, and in particular the initiatives to expand our global footprint via strategic acquisitions, served to offset the challenging sales environment that persisted in our u.s. markets during 2016. we were also focused on ongoing measures to improve gross margins and control costs, although the loss of leverage due to weak comparable sales trends increased our expenses as a percentage of sales and negatively impacted earnings growth.
the relatively unchanged sales results for 2016 and 2015 compare to a 9% sales increase in 2014. net income in 2015 was down by 1% and increased by 4% in 2014. our revenue and earnings in 2015 reflect a 3% negative impact of currency translation and after adjusting for this factor, the company produced an increase in both sales and net income for that year. in 2014, improved market conditions relative to the prior year drove sales and earnings growth in each of our four business segments. over the three year period of 2014 through 2016, our financial performance reflects a variety of initiatives the company implemented to grow sales and earnings across our businesses. examples of such initiatives include strategic acquisitions, the introduction of new and expanded product lines, geographic expansion, sales to new markets, enhanced customer marketing programs and a variety of gross margin and cost savings initiatives. we discuss these initiatives further below.
with regard to the december 31, 2016 consolidated balance sheet, the company's cash balance of $243 million compares to cash of $212 million at december 31, 2015. the company continues to maintain a strong cash position, supported by relatively steady net income and effective asset management. accounts receivable increased by approximately 6%, which compares to an approximate 3% sales increase in the fourth quarter of the year, and inventory was up by approximately 7%, including the impact of acquisitions. accounts payable increased $260 million or 9% from the prior year, due primarily to improved payment terms with certain suppliers. total debt outstanding at december 31, 2016 was $875 million, an increase from total debt of $625 million at december 31, 2015.
results of operations our results of operations are summarized below for the three years ended december 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014.

net sales consolidated net sales for the year ended december 31, 2016 totaled $15.3 billion, up slightly from 2015. 2016 net sales included a 2.4% contribution from acquisitions, net of store closures, offset by a 1.1% decrease in sales volume and an approximate 0.5% negative impact of currency translation. additionally, the company experienced overall product deflation of approximately 0.3%. the impact of product inflation/deflation varied by business in 2016, as prices were down 0.7% in the automotive segment, up approximately 0.4% in the industrial segment, up approximately 0.3% in the office segment and down approximately 1.2% in the electrical/electronic segment. the company, with its global growth initiatives and measures to control rising costs and manage assets, is well positioned for sustainable long-term growth.
consolidated net sales for the year ended december 31, 2015 totaled $15.3 billion, down slightly from 2014. 2015 net sales included a 1.5% increase in sales volume and a 1% contribution from acquisitions, offset by an approximate 3% negative impact of currency translation. the impact of product inflation/deflation varied by business in 2015 and, cumulatively, prices were down 0.2% in the automotive segment, up approximately 0.9% in the industrial segment, up approximately 0.6% in the office segment and down approximately 1.7% in the electrical/electronic segment.
automotive group net sales for the automotive group ("automotive") were $8.1 billion in 2016, a 1% increase from 2015. the increase in sales for the year consists of an approximate 1% comparable sales increase and a 1% contribution from acquisitions, less an approximate 1% negative impact of currency translation associated with our automotive businesses in canada, australasia and mexico. automotive sales were negatively impacted by product deflation of 0.7%, which is included in the comparable sales increase. in 2016, total automotive revenues were up 2% in the first quarter, down 1% in the second quarter, up 1.5% in the third quarter and up 2% in the fourth quarter. the underlying fundamentals in the automotive aftermarket, including the overall number and age of the vehicle population as well as the positive increase in miles driven, remain supportive of sustained
16
index to financial statements demand for automotive aftermarket maintenance and supply items. we expect these fundamentals as well as key sales initiatives to drive sales growth for the automotive business in 2017.
net sales for the automotive group were $8.0 billion in 2015, a 1% decrease from 2014. the decrease in sales for the year consists of a positive core sales increase of approximately 3.5% and a slight benefit from acquisitions. combined, the approximate 4% growth was offset by a 5% negative impact of currency associated with our automotive businesses in canada, australasia and mexico. automotive sales were not materially impacted by product inflation. in 2015, automotive revenues were flat in the first and second quarters and down 2% in the third and fourth quarters.
industrial group net sales for motion industries, our industrial group ("industrial"), were $4.6 billion in 2016, basically unchanged from 2015. an approximate 2.6% decrease in sales volumes and a slight negative impact of currency translation associated with our canadian and mexican operations were partially offset by higher transaction values associated with 0.4% product inflation and approximately 2% in sales from acquisitions. industrial revenues were down 2.5% in the first quarter of 2016, down 2% in the second quarter and down 1% in the third quarter. these quarterly declines were followed by a 4% sales increase in the fourth quarter. the sequential improvement in this group's sales performance correlates to the growing strength in the industrial economy, as evidenced by economic indicators such as manufacturing industrial production and the purchasing managers index. in addition, the energy sector, which had contracted throughout 2015 and the first half of 2016 began to stabilize over the last half of 2016. looking ahead to 2017, we believe the industrial business is well positioned for profitable growth.
net sales for industrial were $4.6 billion in 2015, a 3% decrease from 2014. sales volumes in industrial were down approximately 4% from the prior year, while a 1% negative impact of currency associated with our canadian and mexican operations also contributed to the decline in sales. these items were partially offset by higher transaction values associated with product inflation, which added an approximate 1% to sales, and 1% in sales from acquisitions. industrial revenues were up 3% in the first quarter of 2015, down 2% in the second quarter, down 4% in the third quarter and down 7.5% in the fourth quarter. the manufacturing indices we track in this group progressively weakened throughout 2015, which correlates to lower demand among our customer base and, in particular, those customers dependent on exports as well as the oil and gas sector.
office group net sales for s. p. richards, our office products group ("office"), were $2.0 billion in 2016, an increase of 2% from 2015. the increase in sales reflects an approximate 7% contribution from acquisitions and a 0.3% increase in higher transaction values associated with price inflation. these items were offset by an approximate 6% decrease in sales volume. sales were down 3% in the first quarter, up 1% in the second quarter, up 5% in the third quarter and up 4% in the fourth quarter of 2016. overall, this growth was driven by our strategy to further diversify the office business in the large and growing facilities, breakroom and safety supplies (fbs) category. we expect this diversification strategy and the execution of our core sales initiatives to drive this group's growth in 2017.
net sales for office were $1.9 billion in 2015, an increase of 7.5% from 2014. the increase in sales reflects an approximate 4% increase in sales volume, a 0.6% increase in higher transaction values associated with price inflation and a 3% contribution from acquisitions. these items were offset by an approximate 0.5% negative impact of currency associated with our canadian operations. in 2015, office experienced relatively stable industry conditions, as evidenced by the steady growth in new jobs throughout the year. these conditions combined with new business from a primary customer, which anniversaried on july 1, 2015, served to drive the increase in sales volume for the year. sales were up 17% in the first quarter, up 14% in the second quarter, up 3% in the third quarter and down 2% in the fourth quarter of 2015.
electrical/electronic group net sales for eis, our electrical and electronic group ("electrical/electronic"), were $716 million in 2016, a decrease of 5% from 2015. the decrease in sales consists of an approximate 4% decline in sales volume, a 1.2% decrease from lower transaction values associated with price deflation and a 0.5% negative sales impact of copper pricing. these items were partially offset by an approximate 1% contribution from acquisitions. sales for electrical/electronic decreased by 3% in the first quarter, 5% in the second quarter, 9% in the third quarter and were unchanged in the fourth quarter, relative to the prior year periods. the manufacturing segment of the economy was relatively weak in 2016, which pressured demand across the markets served by this business. as discussed earlier, however, these conditions improved in the fourth quarter of the year and we expect further improvement in 2017, which bodes well for the future growth at eis.
net sales for the electrical/electronic business were $751 million in 2015, an increase of 1.5% from 2014. the increase in sales consists of a 5% contribution from acquisitions, offset by a 1.7% headwind from lower transaction values associated with price deflation, a 1% negative sales impact of copper pricing and a 1% decrease in sales volume. sales for electrical/electronic increased by 1% in the first quarter, 4% in the second quarter, 2% in the third quarter and were unchanged in the fourth quarter, relative to the prior year periods.
17
index to financial statements cost of goods sold the company includes in cost of goods sold the actual cost of merchandise, which represents the vast majority of this line item. other items in cost of goods sold include warranty costs and in-bound freight from the suppliers, net of any vendor allowances and incentives. cost of goods sold was $10.74 billion in 2016, $10.72 billion in 2015 and $10.75 billion in 2014. cost of goods sold in 2016 and 2015 changed from the prior year periods in accordance with the related percentage change in sales for the same periods. for these periods, total product inflation or deflation was relatively insignificant and actual costs were relatively unchanged from the prior year. cost of goods sold represented 70.0% of net sales in 2016, 70.2% of net sales in 2015 and 70.1% of net sales in 2014 and, as a percent of net sales, decreased slightly in 2016 from 2015, while increasing slightly in 2015 from 2014.
in 2016, 2015 and 2014, the industrial and office business segments experienced slight vendor price increases. in 2014, the electrical/electronic business also experienced a slight vendor price increase. in any year where we experience price increases, we are able to work with our customers to pass most of these along to them.
operating expenses the company includes in selling, administrative and other expenses ("sg&a"), all personnel and personnel-related costs at its headquarters, distribution centers, stores and branches, which accounts for approximately 65% of total sg&a. additional costs in sg&a include our facilities, delivery, marketing, advertising, technology, legal and professional costs.
sg&a of $3.37 billion in 2016 increased by $93 million or approximately 3% from 2015. this represents 22.0% of net sales compared to 21.4% of net sales in 2015. the increase in sg&a expenses from the prior year reflect the year one costs associated with our 19 acquisitions, as well as the impact of higher cost, and higher gross margin, models at select acquisitions. the increase in sg&a expenses as a percentage of net sales from the prior year reflect the loss of leverage due to negative comparable sales in our u.s. automotive, industrial, office and electrical/electronic businesses. to offset these increases, we implemented enhanced cost control measures and are intensely focused on assessing the optimal cost structure in our businesses. depreciation and amortization expense was $147 million in 2016, an increase of approximately $6 million or 4% from 2015. the provision for doubtful accounts was $12 million in 2016, a decrease of $1 million from 2015. we believe the company is adequately reserved for bad debts at december 31, 2016.
sg&a of $3.28 billion in 2015 decreased by $37 million or approximately 1% from 2014. this represents 21.4% of net sales, and compares favorably to 21.6% of net sales in 2014. the decrease in sg&a expenses as a percentage of net sales from the prior year reflect the positive impact of our cost control measures and our management teams' focus on properly managing the company's expenses. depreciation and amortization expense was $142 million in 2015, a decrease of approximately $6 million or 4% from 2014. the provision for doubtful accounts was $12 million in 2015, up from $7 million in 2014.
total share-based compensation expense for the years ended december 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 was $19.7 million, $17.7 million and $16.2 million, respectively. refer to note 5 of the consolidated financial statements for further information regarding share-based compensation.
non-operating expenses and income non-operating expenses consist primarily of interest. interest expense was $21 million in 2016, $22 million in 2015 and $25 million in 2014. the $1 million decrease in interest expense in 2016 reflects the more favorable interest rate on certain debt, which was renewed in november 2016. this was partially offset by new long-term debt, which commenced in july 2016. the $3 million decrease in interest expense in 2015 reflects the impact of lower outstanding debt levels during the year relative to 2014.
in "other", the net benefit of interest income, equity method investment income, investment dividends and noncontrolling interests in 2016 was $26 million, a $5 million increase from the prior year due to higher interest income earned in 2016 relative to 2015. these items were $21 million in 2015, an increase from $19 million in 2014. the $2 million increase from the prior year was due to higher interest income earned in 2015 relative to 2014.
income before income taxes income before income taxes was $1.1 billion in 2016, down 4% from 2015. as a percentage of net sales, income before income taxes was 7.0% in 2016 compared to 7.4% in 2015. in 2015, income before income taxes of $1.1 billion was up slightly from 2014 and as a percentage of net sales was 7.4% compared to 7.3% in 2014.
automotive group automotive income before income taxes as a percentage of net sales, which we refer to as operating margin, decreased to 8.8% in 2016 from 9.1% in 2015. this group's loss of expense leverage due to weak comparable sales in the u.s. was the primary factor in automotive's decline in operating profit during the year. looking forward, planned initiatives to grow sales,
18
index to financial statements including store footprint expansion, expand gross margins and control costs are intended to improve its operating margin in the years ahead.
automotive's operating margin of 9.1% in 2015 was up from 8.7% in 2014. the change in gross margin and operating costs as a percentage of net sales positively impacted operating profit during the year.
industrial group industrial's operating margin was 7.3% in 2016, which is unchanged from 2015. the steady operating margin for this group primarily reflects improved gross margins and cost savings associated with initiatives to consolidate locations during 2016. these savings were partially offset by continued pressure on operating expenses associated with the decrease in comparable sales for the year. industrial implemented multiple initiatives to overcome the challenging sales environment and is well positioned to improve their operating margin in 2017.
industrial's operating margin decreased to 7.3% in 2015 from 7.8% in 2014, as the decline in sales for the year resulted in lower volume incentives, which pressured gross margins, and reduced expense leverage relative to the prior year.
office group office's operating margin decreased to 5.9% in 2016 from 7.3% in 2015, primarily due to gross margin pressures associated with lower supplier incentives and the deleveraging of expenses due to comparable sales declines in this group's core office supplies business. office enters 2017 intensely focused on its initiatives to further diversify its business and drive sales growth, while also driving cost savings.
office's operating margin decreased slightly to 7.3% in 2015 from 7.4% in 2014, primarily related to the deleveraging of expenses due to slower sales growth in the last half of 2015.
electrical/electronic group electrical/electronic's operating margin decreased to 8.5% in 2016 from 9.3% in 2015, as changes in product mix pressured gross margins and operating expenses were deleveraged due to the comparable sales decrease for the year. these items were partially offset by cost savings initiatives to consolidate locations during 2016. electrical/electronic will continue to focus on its sales initiatives and cost controls to further improve its operating margin in 2017.
electrical/electronic's operating margin increased to 9.3% in 2015 from 8.8% in 2014, primarily due to the positive impact of higher margin acquisitions, declining copper prices and effective cost management.
income taxes the effective income tax rate of 36.0% in 2016 decreased from 37.2% in 2015. the decrease in rate primarily reflects the company's lower mix of u.s. earnings in 2016, which is taxed at a higher rate relative to our foreign operations. additionally, the more favorable retirement asset valuation adjustment in 2016 relative to 2015 resulted in the decrease in rate.
the effective income tax rate of 37.2% in 2015 increased from 36.4% in 2014. the increase in rate primarily reflects the company's higher mix of u.s. earnings in 2015, which is taxed at a higher rate relative to our foreign operations. to a lesser extent, the less favorable retirement asset valuation adjustment in 2015 relative to 2014 impacted the increase in rate.
net income net income was $687 million in 2016, a decrease of 3% from $706 million in 2015. on a per share diluted basis, net income was $4.59 in 2016, down 1% compared to $4.63 in 2015. net income was 4.5% of net sales in 2016 compared to 4.6% of net sales in 2015.
net income was $706 million in 2015, a decrease of 1% from $711 million in 2014. on a per share diluted basis, net income was $4.63 in 2015, up slightly compared to $4.61 in 2014. net income was 4.6% of net sales in each of 2015 and 2014.
financial condition our cash balance of $243 million at december 31, 2016 compares to our cash balance of $212 million at december 31, 2015, as discussed further below. the company's accounts receivable balance at december 31, 2016 increased by approximately 6% from the prior year. this compares to the company's 3% sales increase for the fourth quarter of 2016, and we are satisfied with the quality and collectability of our accounts receivable. inventory at december 31, 2016 increased by
19
index to financial statements approximately 7% from december 31, 2015, primarily due to acquisitions, and accounts payable increased $260 million or approximately 9% from december 31, 2015 due primarily to improved payment terms with certain suppliers.
liquidity and capital resources the company's sources of capital consist primarily of cash flows from operations, supplemented as necessary by private issuances of debt and bank borrowings. we have $875 million of total debt outstanding at december 31, 2016, of which $50 million matures in july 2021, $250 million matures in december 2023 and $250 million matures in november 2026. in addition, the company has an unsecured revolving line of credit with a consortium of financial institutions for $1.2 billion, of which approximately $325 million and $125 million were outstanding under the line of credit at december 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. currently, we believe that our cash on hand and available short-term and long-term sources of capital are sufficient to fund the company's operations, including working capital requirements, scheduled debt payments, interest payments, capital expenditures, benefit plan contributions, income tax obligations, dividends, share repurchases and contemplated acquisitions.
the ratio of current assets to current liabilities was 1.4 to 1 at december 31, 2016 and 2015, and our liquidity position remains solid. the company's total debt outstanding at december 31, 2016 increased by $250 million or 40% from december 31, 2015, due primarily to the 19 acquisitions made in 2016.

net cash provided by operating activities:
the company continues to generate cash and in 2016 net cash provided by operating activities totaled $946 million. this reflects an 18% decrease from 2015, as the collective change in trade accounts receivable, merchandise inventories and trade accounts payable represented a $123 million source of cash in 2016 compared to a $312 million source of cash in 2015. net cash provided by operating activities was $1.2 billion in 2015, a 47% increase from 2014 due primarily to the change in trade accounts receivable, merchandise inventories and trade accounts payable, which, collectively, net to a $312 million source of cash in 2015 compared to a $34 million use of cash in 2014.
net cash used in investing activities:
net cash flow used in investing activities was $594 million in 2016 compared to $264 million in 2015, a 125% increase. cash used for acquisitions of businesses and other investing activities in 2016 was $462 million, or $299 million more than in 2015. capital expenditures of $161 million in 2016 were $51 million more than in 2015, which was at the high end of our original estimate of $140 to $160 million for the year. we estimate that cash used for capital expenditures in 2017 will be approximately $145 to $165 million. net cash flow used in investing activities was $264 million in 2015 compared to $387 million in 2014, a decrease of 32%. cash used for acquisitions of businesses and other investing activities in 2015 was $163 million, or $125 million less than in 2014. capital expenditures of $110 million in 2015 were relatively unchanged from 2014, and were slightly lower than our original estimate of $125 to $145 million for the year.
net cash used in financing activities:
the company used $322 million of cash in financing activities in 2016, down 60% from the $806 million used in financing activities in 2015. cash used in financing activities in 2015 was up 77% from the $455 million used in 2014. for the three years presented, net cash used in financing activities was primarily for dividends paid to shareholders and repurchases of the company's common stock. the company paid dividends to shareholders of $387 million, $368 million and $347 million during 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. the company expects this trend of increasing dividends to continue in the foreseeable future. during 2016, 2015 and 2014, the company repurchased $181 million, $292 million and $96 million, respectively, of the company's common stock. we expect to remain active in our share repurchase program, but the amount and value of shares repurchased will vary. in 2016, net cash used in financing activities was partially offset by approximately $250 million in net proceeds from debt. in 2015, net cash used in financing activities included payments on debt of approximately $140 million net of debt proceeds.

due to the uncertainty of the timing of future cash flows associated with the company's unrecognized tax benefits at december 31, 2016, the company is unable to make reasonably reliable estimates of the period of cash settlement with the respective taxing authorities. therefore, $17 million of unrecognized tax benefits have been excluded from the contractual obligations table above. refer to note 6 of the consolidated financial statements for a discussion on income taxes.
purchase orders or contracts for the purchase of inventory and other goods and services are not included in our estimates. we are not able to determine the aggregate amount of such purchase orders that represent contractual obligations, as purchase orders may represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements. our purchase orders are based on our current distribution needs and are fulfilled by our vendors within short time horizons. the company does not have significant agreements for the purchase of inventory or other goods specifying minimum quantities or set prices that exceed our expected requirements.
the company guarantees the borrowings of certain independently owned automotive parts stores (independents) and certain other affiliates in which the company has a noncontrolling equity ownership interest (affiliates). the company's maximum exposure to loss as a result of its involvement with these independents and affiliates is generally equal to the total borrowings subject to the company's guarantee. to date, the company has had no significant losses in connection with guarantees of independents' and affiliates' borrowings. the following table shows the company's approximate commercial commitments as of december 31, 2016:

in addition, the company sponsors defined benefit pension plans that may obligate us to make contributions to the plans from time to time. contributions in 2016 were $54 million. we expect to make $48 million in cash contributions to our qualified defined benefit plans in 2017, and contributions required for 2017 and future years will depend on a number of unpredictable factors including the market performance of the plans' assets and future changes in interest rates that affect the actuarial measurement of the plans' obligations.
share repurchases in 2016, the company repurchased approximately 2.0 million shares and the company had remaining authority to purchase approximately 4.3 million shares at december 31, 2016.
critical accounting policies general management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles. the preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates, assumptions and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, net sales and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
we describe in this section certain critical accounting policies that require us to make significant estimates, assumptions and judgments. an accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are uncertain at the time the estimate is made and if different estimates that reasonably could have been used, or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely to occur periodically, could materially impact the consolidated financial statements. management believes the following critical accounting policies reflect its most significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements. for further information on the critical accounting policies, see note 1 of the consolidated financial statements.
inventories - provisions for slow moving and obsolescence the company identifies slow moving or obsolete inventories and estimates appropriate provisions related thereto. historically, these losses have not been significant as the vast majority of the company's inventories are not highly susceptible to obsolescence and are eligible for return under various vendor return programs. while the company has no reason to believe its inventory return privileges will be discontinued in the future, its risk of loss associated with obsolete or slow moving inventories would increase if such were to occur.
allowance for doubtful accounts - methodology the company evaluates the collectability of trade accounts receivable based on a combination of factors. the company estimates an allowance for doubtful accounts as a percentage of net sales based on historical bad debt experience and periodically adjusts this estimate when the company becomes aware of a specific customer's inability to meet its financial obligations (e.g., bankruptcy filing) or as a result of changes in the overall aging of accounts receivable. while the company has a large customer base that is geographically dispersed, a general economic downturn in any of the industry segments in which the company operates could result in higher than expected defaults and, therefore, the need to revise estimates for bad debts. for the years ended december 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, the company recorded provisions for doubtful accounts of approximately $11.5 million, $12.4 million, and $7.2 million, respectively.

index to financial statements consideration received from vendors the company enters into agreements at the beginning of each year with many of its vendors that provide for inventory purchase incentives. generally, the company earns inventory purchase incentives upon achieving specified volume purchasing levels or other criteria. the company accrues for the receipt of these incentives as part of its inventory cost based on cumulative purchases of inventory to date and projected inventory purchases through the end of the year. while management believes the company will continue to receive consideration from vendors in 2017 and beyond, there can be no assurance that vendors will continue to provide comparable amounts of incentives in the future or that we will be able to achieve the specified volumes necessary to take advantage of such incentives.
impairment of property, plant and equipment and goodwill and other intangible assets at least annually, the company evaluates property, plant and equipment, goodwill and other intangible assets for potential impairment indicators. the company's judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators are based on market conditions and operational performance, among other factors. future events could cause the company to conclude that impairment indicators exist and that assets associated with a particular operation are impaired. evaluating for impairment also requires the company to estimate future operating results and cash flows which require judgment by management. any resulting impairment loss could have a material adverse impact on the company's financial condition and results of operations.
employee benefit plans the company's benefit plan committees in the u.s. and canada establish investment policies and strategies and regularly monitor the performance of the company's pension plan assets. the pension plan investment strategy implemented by the company's management is to achieve long-term objectives and invest the pension assets in accordance with the applicable pension legislation in the u.s. and canada, as well as fiduciary standards. the long-term primary objectives for the pension plan funds are to provide for a reasonable amount of long-term growth of capital without undue exposure to risk, protect the assets from erosion of purchasing power and provide investment results that meet or exceed the pension plans' actuarially assumed long term rates of return. the company's investment strategy with respect to pension plan assets is to generate a return in excess of the passive portfolio benchmark (47% s&p 500 index, 5% russell mid cap index, 7% russell 2000 index, 5% msci eafe index, 5% dj global moderate index, 3% msci emerging market net, and 28% barcap u.s. govt/credit).
we make several critical assumptions in determining our pension plan assets and liabilities and related pension income. we believe the most critical of these assumptions are the expected rate of return on plan assets and the discount rate. other assumptions we make relate to employee demographic factors such as rate of compensation increases, mortality rates, retirement patterns and turnover rates. refer to note 7 of the consolidated financial statements for more information regarding these assumptions.
based on the investment policy for the pension plans, as well as an asset study that was performed based on the company's asset allocations and future expectations, the company's expected rate of return on plan assets for measuring 2017 pension income is 7.82% for the plans. the asset study forecasted expected rates of return for the approximate duration of the company's benefit obligations, using capital market data and historical relationships.
the discount rate is chosen as the rate at which pension obligations could be effectively settled and is based on capital market conditions as of the measurement date. we have matched the timing and duration of the expected cash flows of our pension obligations to a yield curve generated from a broad portfolio of high-quality fixed income debt instruments to select our discount rate. based upon this cash flow matching analysis, we selected a weighted average discount rate for the plans of 4.26% at december 31, 2016.
net periodic benefit income for our defined benefit pension plans was $13.4 million, $5.8 million and $9.6 million for the years ended december 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. the income associated with the pension plans in 2016, 2015 and 2014 reflects the impact of the hard freeze effective december 31, 2013. refer to note 7 of the consolidated financial statements for more information regarding employee benefit plans.

we recorded the quarterly earnings per share amounts as if each quarter was a discrete period. as a result, the sum of the basic and diluted earnings per share will not necessarily total the annual basic and diluted earnings per share.
the preparation of interim consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions for the amounts reported in the interim condensed consolidated financial statements. specifically, the company makes estimates and assumptions in its interim condensed consolidated financial statements for inventory adjustments, the accrual of bad debts, the accrual of insurance reserves, customer sales returns and volume incentives earned, among others. inventory adjustments (including adjustments for a majority of inventories that are valued under the last-in, first-out (lifo) method) are accrued on an interim basis and adjusted in the fourth quarter based on the annual book to physical inventory adjustment and lifo valuation, which is performed each year-end. reserves for bad debts, insurance and customer sales returns are estimated and accrued on an interim basis based upon historical experience. volume incentives are estimated based upon cumulative and projected purchasing levels. the estimates and assumptions for interim reporting may change upon final determination at year-end, and such changes may be significant. the effect of these adjustments in 2016 and 2015 was not significant.

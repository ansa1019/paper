item 7.   management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this management's discussion and analysis provides a review of the results of operations, financial condition and liquidity and capital resources of visa inc. and its subsidiaries ("visa," "we," "us," "our" and the "company") on a historical basis and outlines the factors that have affected recent earnings, as well as those factors that may affect future earnings. the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included in item 8 of this report.

overall economic conditions. our business is affected by overall economic conditions and consumer spending. our business performance during fiscal 2016 reflects the impacts of continued uneven and tepid economic growth.
visa europe acquisition. on june 21, 2016, we acquired 100% of the share capital of visa europe. the purchase price consisted of: (a) at the closing of the transaction (closing), up-front cash consideration of €12.2 billion ($13.9 billion) and preferred stock convertible upon certain conditions into class a common stock or class a equivalent preferred stock, equivalent to a value of €5.3 billion ($6.1 billion) at the closing stock price of $77.33 on june 21, 2016, and (b) following the third anniversary of the closing, an additional €1.0 billion, plus 4% compound annual interest. the preferred stock conversion rates may be reduced from time to time to offset certain liabilities, if any, which may be incurred by us, visa europe or its affiliates as a result of certain existing and potential litigation relating to the setting of multilateral interchange fee rates in the visa europe territory before the closing. as part of the acquisition, we also entered into the u.k. loss sharing agreement with visa europe and certain of visa europe's members located in the united kingdom to compensate us for certain losses which may be incurred by us or visa europe as a result of certain existing and potential litigation relating to the setting and implementation of domestic multilateral interchange fee rates in the united kingdom before the closing. our consolidated balance sheets reflect the consolidation of visa europe as of september 30, 2016. we did not include visa europe's financial results in our consolidated statements of operations from the acquisition date, june 21, 2016, through june 30, 2016 as the impact was immaterial. our consolidated statements of operations include the financial results of visa europe for the three months ended september 30, 2016. see note 2-acquisition of visa europe, note 3-u.s. and europe retrospective responsibility plans and note 20-legal matters to our consolidated financial statements.
debt issuance. in december 2015, we issued fixed-rate senior notes in an aggregate principal amount of $16.0 billion, with maturities ranging between 2 and 30 years. interest on these notes, at a rate ranging between 1.20% and 4.30%, is payable semi-annually on june 14 and december 14, commencing june 14, 2016. the net aggregate proceeds of $15.9 billion, after deducting discounts and debt issuance costs, were used to fund the upfront cash portion of the purchase price for the acquisition of visa europe and for general corporate purposes, including share repurchases. see note 4-fair value measurements and investments and note 9-debt to our consolidated financial statements.
financial highlights. our financial results for fiscal 2016 include the impact of several significant one-time items. our as-reported u.s. gaap and adjusted non-gaap net income and diluted earnings per share are shown in the table below.

(1)   figures in the tables may not recalculate exactly due to rounding. percentage changes are calculated based on unrounded numbers.
(2)   the per share amounts for the prior periods presented have been retroactively adjusted to reflect the four-for-one stock split effected in the fiscal second quarter of 2015.
(3)   adjusted net income and diluted earnings per share in fiscal 2016, 2015 and 2014 exclude the impact of certain significant items that we believe are not indicative of our operating performance, as they are either non-recurring, have no cash impact or are covered by the u.s. retrospective responsibility plan. for a full reconciliation of our adjusted financial results, see tables in adjusted financial results below.
we recorded net operating revenues of $15.1 billion for fiscal 2016, an increase of 9% over the prior year driven by continued growth in processed transactions, nominal payments volume as well as the fiscal fourth quarter operating revenues of visa europe. the effect of exchange rate movements, as partially mitigated by our hedging program, resulted in a negative three percentage point impact to our total operating growth.
total operating expenses for fiscal 2016 were $7.2 billion, compared to $4.8 billion in fiscal 2015. the increase over the prior year was primarily due to the $1.9 billion loss resulting from the effective settlement of the framework agreement between us and visa europe upon consummation of the transaction, combined with acquisition-related costs of approximately $152 million. see note 2-acquisition of visa europe to our consolidated financial statements.
during fiscal 2015 we recognized a tax benefit of $296 million resulting from the resolution of uncertain tax positions with taxing authorities. of the $296 million benefit, $239 million relates to prior fiscal years. our financial results for the year ended september 30, 2014 reflect a one-time tax benefit of $191 million associated with a deduction for u.s. domestic production activities related to prior fiscal years. see note 19-income taxes to our consolidated financial statements.
adjusted financial results. our financial results for fiscal 2016, 2015 and 2014 reflect the impact of certain significant items that we do not believe are indicative of our ongoing operating performance in the prior or future years, as they are either non-recurring, have no cash impact or are covered by the u.s. retrospective responsibility plan. as such, we believe the presentation of adjusted financial results excluding the following items provides a clearer understanding of our operating performance for the periods presented.
•   severance cost. in the fiscal fourth quarter, we recorded a $110 million charge for severance costs related to personnel reductions including planned reductions at visa europe. although we routinely record severance expenses, these charges are larger than any past quarterly accrual due to the acquisition and integration of visa europe. net of related tax benefit of $38 million, determined by applying applicable tax rates, the adjustment to net income was an increase of $72 million.
•   remeasurement of deferred tax liability. in september 2016, we recorded a non-cash, non-recurring $88 million gain upon the remeasurement of a deferred tax liability, recorded upon the acquisition of visa europe, to reflect a tax rate change in the united kingdom.
•   acquisition-related costs. during fiscal 2016, we incurred $152 million of non-recurring acquisition costs in operating expense as a result of the visa europe transaction. this amount is comprised of $60 million of transaction expenses recorded in professional fees, and $92 million of u.k. stamp duty recorded in general and administrative expenses. net of related tax benefit of $56 million, determined by applying applicable
31
federal and state tax rates, the adjustment to net income was an increase of $96 million. see note 2-acquisition of visa europe to our consolidated financial statements.
•   visa europe framework agreement loss. upon consummation of the transaction, on june 21, 2016, we recorded a non-recurring loss of $1.9 billion, before tax, in operating expense resulting from the effective settlement of the framework agreement between us and visa europe. net of related tax benefit of $693 million, determined by applying applicable federal and state tax rates, the adjustment to net income was an increase of $1.2 billion. see note 2-acquisition of visa europe to our consolidated financial statements.
•   net gains on currency forward contracts. during fiscal 2016, we entered into currency forward contracts to mitigate a portion of our foreign currency exchange rate risk associated with the upfront cash consideration paid in the visa europe acquisition. as a result, we recorded non-recurring, net gains of $74 million, before tax, in other non-operating income. net of related tax expense of $27 million, determined by applying applicable federal and state tax rates, the adjustment to net income was a decrease of $47 million. see note 12-derivative and non-derivative financial instruments to our consolidated financial statements.
•   foreign exchange gain on euro deposits. during fiscal 2016, we recorded a non-recurring foreign exchange gain of $145 million, before tax, in other non-operating income as a result of holding euro-denominated bank balances for a short period in advance of the closing. net of related tax expense of $54 million, determined by applying applicable federal and state tax rates, the impact to net income was a decrease of $91 million.
•   revaluation of visa europe put option. during the first quarter of fiscal 2016 and the third quarter of fiscal 2015, we recorded a decrease of $255 million and an increase of $110 million, respectively, in the fair value of the visa europe put option, resulting in the recognition of non-cash income and expense in other non-operating income. these amounts are not subject to income tax and therefore have no impact on our reported income tax provision. see note 2-acquisition of visa europe and note 4-fair value measurements and investments to our consolidated financial statements.
•   litigation provision. during fiscal 2014, we recorded a litigation provision of $450 million and related tax benefits of $167 million associated with the u.s. interchange multidistrict litigation. the tax impact is determined by applying applicable federal and state tax rates to the litigation provision. monetary liabilities from settlements of, or judgments in, the u.s. covered litigation will be paid from the u.s. litigation escrow account. see note 3-u.s. and europe retrospective responsibility plans and note 20-legal matters to our consolidated financial statements.

(1)   operating margin is calculated as operating income divided by net operating revenues.
(2)   figures in the table may not recalculate exactly due to rounding. operating margin and diluted earnings per share figures are calculated based on unrounded numbers.
(3)   the per share amounts for the prior periods presented have been retroactively adjusted to reflect the four-for-one stock split effected in the fiscal second quarter of 2015.
common stock repurchases. during fiscal 2016, we repurchased 91 million shares of our class a common stock in the open market using $7.0 billion of cash on hand. as of september 30, 2016, we had remaining authorized funds of $5.8 billion. all share repurchase programs authorized prior to october 2015 have been completed. see note 14-stockholders' equity to our consolidated financial statements.
nominal payments volume and transaction counts. payments volume is the primary driver for our service revenues, and the number of processed transactions is the primary driver for our data processing revenues.
33
nominal payments volume over the prior year posted strong growth in the u.s., driven mainly by consumer debit and credit. nominal international payments volume was negatively impacted by the overall strengthening of the u.s. dollar. on a constant-dollar basis, which excludes the impact of exchange rate movements, our international payments volume growth rate for the 12 months ended june 30, 2016(1) and 2015 was 37% and 13%, respectively. processed transactions sustained healthy growth reflecting the ongoing worldwide shift to electronic currency.

results of operations operating revenues our operating revenues are primarily generated from payments volume on visa products for purchased goods and services, as well as the number of transactions processed on our network. we do not earn revenues from, or bear credit risk with respect to, interest or fees paid by account holders on visa products. our issuing clients have the responsibility for issuing cards and other payment products, and determining the interest rates and fees paid by account holders. we generally do not earn revenues from the fees that merchants are charged for acceptance by the acquirers, including the merchant discount rate. our acquiring clients are generally responsible for soliciting merchants, and establishing and earning these fees.
the following sets forth the components of our operating revenues:
service revenues consist mainly of revenues earned for services provided in support of client usage of visa products. current quarter service revenues are primarily assessed using a calculation of current pricing applied to the prior quarter's payments volume. service revenues also include assessments designed to support ongoing acceptance and volume growth initiatives, which are recognized in the same period the related volume is transacted.
data processing revenues are earned for authorization, clearing, settlement, network access and other maintenance and support services that facilitate transaction and information processing among our clients globally.
35
data processing revenues are recognized in the same period the related transactions occur or services are rendered.
international transaction revenues are earned for cross-border transaction processing and currency conversion activities. cross-border transactions arise when the country of origin of the issuer is different from that of the merchant. international transaction revenues are primarily generated by cross-border payments and cash volume.
other revenues consist mainly of license fees for use of the visa brand, revenues earned from visa europe in accordance with the visa europe framework agreement prior to the completion of the visa europe acquisition, fees for account holder services, certification and licensing, and other activities related to our acquired entities. other revenues also include optional service or product enhancements, such as extended account holder protection and concierge services.
client incentives consist of long-term contracts with financial institution clients, merchants and strategic partners for various programs designed to build payments volume, increase visa product acceptance, win merchant routing transactions over our network and drive innovation. these incentives are primarily accounted for as reductions to operating revenues.
operating expenses personnel expenses include salaries, employee benefits, incentive compensation, share-based compensation, severance charges and contractor expense.
marketing expenses include expenses associated with advertising and marketing campaigns, sponsorships and other related promotions of the visa brand.
network and processing expenses mainly represent expenses for the operation of our processing network, including maintenance, equipment rental and fees for other data processing services.
professional fees mainly consist of fees for consulting, legal and other professional services.
depreciation and amortization expenses include depreciation expense for property and equipment, as well as amortization of purchased and internally developed software. also included in this amount is amortization of finite-lived intangible assets primarily obtained through acquisitions.
general and administrative expenses mainly consist of transaction costs related to the visa europe acquisition, product enhancements, facilities costs, travel activities, foreign exchange gains and losses and other corporate expenses incurred in support of our business.
litigation provision is an estimate of litigation expense and is based on management's understanding of our litigation profile, the specifics of the cases, advice of counsel to the extent appropriate and management's best estimate of incurred loss as of the balance sheet date.
visa europe framework agreement loss is a one-time loss incurred upon consummation of the visa europe acquisition on june 21, 2016, resulting from the effective settlement of the framework agreement between us and visa europe.
non-operating income (expense)
non-operating income (expense) primarily includes interest expense, changes in the fair value of the visa europe put option and income, gains and losses earned on investments and derivative instruments not associated with our core operations.

(3)   reflects revenues earned from visa europe prior to the acquisition, in accordance with the framework agreement that provided for trademark and technology licenses and bilateral services. the framework agreement was effectively settled upon the closing of the acquisition. see note 2-acquisition of visa europe to our consolidated financial statements.
the increase in operating revenues primarily reflects continued growth in processed transactions and nominal payments volume, as well as the fiscal fourth quarter operating revenues of visa europe. these benefits were partially offset by increases in client incentives. overall revenue growth also reflects the positive impact of select pricing modifications effected in the third quarter of fiscal 2015.
our operating revenues, primarily service revenues, international transaction revenues, and client incentives, are impacted by the overall strengthening or weakening of the u.s. dollar as payments volume and related revenues denominated in local currencies are converted to u.s. dollars. the effect of exchange rate movements in fiscal 2016, as partially mitigated by our hedging program, resulted in a negative three percentage point impact to our net operating revenue growth.
the following table sets forth the components of our net operating revenues, including operating revenues earned by visa europe for the three months ended september 30, 2016. other revenues also includes revenue earned from visa europe in accordance with the framework agreement prior to its acquisition on june 21, 2016.

(2)   our operating revenues for fiscal 2016 do not reflect revenues earned by visa europe from the acquisition date, june 21, 2016, through june 30, 2016 as the impact was immaterial.
•   service revenues, which includes revenues earned by visa europe in the fiscal fourth quarter, increased in fiscal 2016 and 2015 primarily due to 16% and 7% growth in nominal payments volume, respectively. the growth in fiscal 2016 service revenues was slower than the growth in payments volume reflecting the inclusion of visa europe revenue for the fiscal fourth quarter and the resulting impact on our service revenue yield. fiscal 2016 growth also reflects select pricing modifications which became effective in the third quarter of fiscal 2015.
•   data processing revenues increased in fiscal 2016 and 2015 due to overall growth in processed transactions of 17% and 9%, respectively, which includes data processing revenues earned by visa europe in the fiscal fourth quarter and the resulting impact on our data processing revenue yield.
•   international transaction revenues increased in fiscal 2016 primarily due to nominal cross-border volume growth of 37%, including revenues earned by visa europe in the fiscal fourth quarter. in addition to the inclusion of visa europe revenue and the resulting impact on our international transaction revenue yield, fiscal 2016 growth also reflects select pricing modifications that became effective in the third quarter of fiscal 2015. the increase in fiscal 2015 was primarily driven by higher volatility in a broad range of currencies, combined with select pricing modifications that became effective in the third quarter of fiscal 2015.
•   client incentives increased in fiscal 2016 and 2015, reflecting overall growth in global payments volume, incentives incurred on long-term client contracts that were initiated or renewed during fiscal 2016 and 2015 and visa europe's incentives for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016. the amount of client incentives we record in future periods will vary based on changes in performance expectations, actual client performance, amendments to existing contracts or the execution of new contracts.

(3)   operating expenses for fiscal 2016 and 2014 include significant items that we do not believe are indicative of our operating performance as they are related to the visa europe acquisition, or are covered by the u.s. retrospective responsibility plan. see overview within this item 7-management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations.
•   personnel expenses increased in fiscal 2016 primarily due to a severance charge related to personnel reductions including planned reductions at visa europe, combined with an increase from the inclusion of visa europe fiscal fourth quarter expenses. this increase was partially offset by a decrease in contractor
38
costs, an increase in personnel costs that were invested in and capitalized as part of technology development projects and lower incentive compensation. the increase in fiscal 2015 was primarily due to an increase in headcount reflecting our strategy to invest for future growth, combined with higher incentive compensation.
•   marketing expenses in fiscal 2016 reflect efficiencies in production and agency costs which were redeployed for other marketing uses, and visa europe expenses for the fiscal fourth quarter. the decrease in marketing during fiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2014 was mainly due to the overall strengthening of the u.s. dollar as marketing spend in local currencies was converted to u.s. dollars, combined with the absence of the 2014 sochi winter olympics and 2014 fifa world cup spend that was incurred in fiscal 2014. the decrease was partially offset by increases in promotional campaigns that support our growth strategies and product initiatives.
•   network and processing expenses increased in fiscal 2016 primarily due to the inclusion of visa europe expenses beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016 and fees associated with the processing of russian domestic transactions that transitioned to the russian national payment card system during the third quarter of fiscal 2015. the decrease in fiscal 2015 was a result of initiatives to optimize the use of our technology resources. see note 2-acquisition of visa europe to our consolidated financial statements.
•   professional fees increased in fiscal 2016 primarily reflecting transaction costs incurred in connection with our acquisition of visa europe. see note 2-acquisition of visa europe to our consolidated financial statements.
•   depreciation and amortization expenses in fiscal 2016 were flat compared to fiscal 2015. the increase in fiscal 2015 was primarily due to additional depreciation from our ongoing investments in technology assets and infrastructure to support our digital solutions and core business initiatives.
•   general and administrative expenses increased in fiscal 2016 mainly due to costs incurred related to our acquisition of visa europe and the inclusion of visa europe expenses beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016. see note 2-acquisition of visa europe to our consolidated financial statements. the increase was also attributable to net foreign exchange losses incurred as a result of changes in the u.s. dollar exchange rate against other currencies in which we transact. the increase in fiscal 2015 was mainly due to an increase in travel activities, product enhancements and facilities costs in support of our business growth, combined with losses incurred from the sale of assets held by an international subsidiary. these increases were partially offset by unrealized foreign exchange gains and the absence of the fiscal 2014 disposal of obsolete technology assets.
•   litigation provision decreased in fiscal 2016 primarily due to the absence of a loss incurred in fiscal 2015 upon the settlement of uncovered litigation. the decrease in fiscal 2015 reflects the absence of a $450 million accrual related to the u.s. covered litigation incurred in fiscal 2014. see note 20-legal matters and note 3-u.s. and europe retrospective responsibility plans to our consolidated financial statements.
•   visa europe framework agreement loss resulted from the effective settlement of the framework agreement between visa and visa europe upon consummation of the transaction. see note 2-acquisition of visa europe to our consolidated financial statements.

(2)   our non-operating income (expense) for fiscal 2016 does not reflect the financial results of visa europe from the acquisition date, june 21, 2016, through june 30, 2016 as the impact was immaterial. fiscal 2016 non-operating income (expense) includes financial results of visa europe for the three months ended september 30, 2016. see note 2-acquisition of visa europe to our consolidated financial statements.
•   interest expense increased during fiscal 2016 primarily due to the issuance of $16.0 billion fixed-rate senior notes in december 2015. see note 9-debt to our consolidated financial statements.
•   other non-operating income (expense) in fiscal 2016 and 2015 was primarily comprised of the following:
•   net gains of $74 million in fiscal 2016 related to currency forward contracts entered into to mitigate a portion of our foreign currency exchange rate risk associated with the upfront cash consideration paid in the visa europe acquisition. as these contracts are not designated in hedging relationships, related gains and losses are recorded directly in earnings as part of non-operating income (expense);
•   a foreign exchange gain of $145 million in fiscal 2016 on euro deposits as a result of holding euro-denominated bank balances for a short period in advance of the closing;
•   a non-cash adjustment of $255 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2016 to decrease the fair value of the visa europe put option, which is not subject to tax, reducing the fair value of the liability to zero; and
•   a non-cash adjustment of $110 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2015 to increase the fair value of the unamended visa europe put option, which is not subject to tax.
see note 4-fair value measurements and investments and note 12-derivative and non-derivative financial instruments to our consolidated financial statements.
effective income tax rate the effective income tax rate was 25% in fiscal 2016 and 30% in fiscal 2015. the effective tax rate in fiscal 2016 differs from the effective tax rate in fiscal 2015 primarily due to:
•   the effect of one-time items related to the visa europe acquisition, the most significant of which was the $1.9 billion u.s. loss related to the effective settlement of the framework agreement between visa and visa europe. these one-time items impacted the geographic mix of our global income, resulting in a reduced effective tax rate;
•   an $88 million one-time tax benefit due to the remeasurement of deferred tax liabilities as a result of the reduction in the uk tax rate enacted in fiscal 2016;
•   the non-taxable $255 million revaluation of the visa europe put option recorded in fiscal 2016; and
•   the absence of a $296 million tax benefit recognized in fiscal 2015 resulting from the resolution of uncertain tax positions with taxing authorities. included in the $296 million was a one-time $239 million tax benefit that related to prior fiscal years.
the effective income tax rates were 30% in fiscal 2015 and 2014. the following highlights the significant tax items recorded in each respective year:
•   the aforementioned $296 million tax benefit recognized in fiscal 2015; and
•   a $264 million tax benefit recognized in fiscal 2014 related to a deduction for u.s. domestic production activities, of which $191 million was a one-time tax benefit related to prior fiscal years.
adjusted effective income tax rate. our financial results for fiscal 2016 reflect the impact of certain significant items that we do not believe are indicative of our ongoing operating performance in the prior or future years, as they are either non-recurring or have no cash impact. as such, we have presented our adjusted effective income tax rate in the table below, which we believe provides a clearer understanding of our operating performance in fiscal 2016. see overview - adjusted financial results within this management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for descriptions of the adjustments in the table below.

liquidity and capital resources management of our liquidity we regularly evaluate cash requirements for current operations, commitments, development activities and capital expenditures, and we may elect to raise additional funds for these purposes in the future through the issuance of either debt or equity. our treasury policies provide management with the guidelines and authority to manage liquidity risk in a manner consistent with our corporate objectives.
the objectives of our treasury policies are to:
•   provide adequate liquidity to cover operating expenditures and liquidity contingency scenarios;
•   ensure timely completion of payments settlement activities;
•   ensure payments on required litigation settlements;
•   make planned capital investments in our business;
•   pay dividends and repurchase our shares at the discretion of our board of directors; and
•   invest excess cash in securities that enable us to first meet our working capital and liquidity needs, and earn additional income.
based on our current cash flow budgets and forecasts of our short-term and long-term liquidity needs, we believe that our projected sources of liquidity will be sufficient to meet our projected liquidity needs for more than the next 12 months. we will continue to assess our liquidity position and potential sources of supplemental liquidity in view of our operating performance, current economic and capital market conditions, and other relevant circumstances.
cash flow data the following table summarizes our cash flow activity for the fiscal years presented:

operating activities. cash provided by operating activities in fiscal 2016, 2015 and 2014 was significantly impacted by cash flows related to the visa europe acquisition and the u.s. interchange multidistrict litigation, including:
•   $1.9 billion of the consideration paid in the visa europe acquisition related to the effective settlement of the framework agreement between us and visa europe, and payment of $244 million of interest on the senior notes during fiscal 2016 (see note 2-acquisition of visa europe and note 9-debt);
•   payments of $426 million made from the u.s. litigation escrow account and a related decrease of approximately $157 million of income taxes paid during fiscal 2015; and
•   the return of $1.1 billion in takedown payments in fiscal 2014 and related increase of $368 million in income taxes paid.
the cash inflows and outflows related to the u.s. litigation escrow account are also reflected as offsetting cash flows within financing activities for their respective years as they are covered by the u.s. retrospective responsibility plan. see note 3-u.s. and europe retrospective responsibility plans and note 20-legal matters to our consolidated financial statements.
investing activities. cash used in investing activities was higher in fiscal 2016 compared to the prior year primarily due to the up-front cash consideration paid in the visa europe acquisition, offset by $2.8 billion of cash held by visa europe at the closing of the transaction. cash used in investing activities was higher in fiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2014, primarily reflecting a decrease in the proceeds received from maturities and sales of available-for-sale securities, and an increase in purchases of available-for-sale securities. see note 2-acquisition of visa europe and note 4-fair value measurements and investments to our consolidated financial statements.
financing activities. cash provided by financing activities in fiscal 2016 reflects $15.9 billion net aggregate proceeds received from our debt issuance completed in december 2015, $7.0 billion used to repurchase class a common stock in the open market, and $1.4 billion of dividend payments. cash used in financing activities in fiscal 2015 and 2014 reflect significant cash flows in connection with the interchange multidistrict litigation that offset the impacts discussed above within operating activities as they are covered by the u.s. retrospective responsibility plan, as follows:
•   payments of $426 million made from the u.s. litigation escrow account in fiscal 2015;
•   $1.1 billion in takedown payments returned to the u.s. litigation escrow account in fiscal 2014; and
•   $450 million deposited into the u.s. litigation escrow account in fiscal 2014.
the remainder of the change in fiscal 2015 compared to 2014 was primarily due to decreases in common stock repurchases. see note 3-u.s. and europe retrospective responsibility plans, note 9-debt, note 14-stockholders' equity and note 20-legal matters to our consolidated financial statements.
sources of liquidity our primary sources of liquidity are cash on hand, cash flow from our operations, our investment portfolio and access to various equity and borrowing arrangements. funds from operations are maintained in cash and cash equivalents and short-term or long-term available-for-sale investment securities based upon our funding requirements, access to liquidity from these holdings, and the return that these holdings provide. we believe that cash flow generated from operations, in conjunction with access to our other sources of liquidity, will be more than sufficient to meet our ongoing operational needs.
cash and cash equivalents and short-term and long-term available-for-sale investment securities held by our foreign subsidiaries totaled $8.7 billion at september 30, 2016. if it were necessary to repatriate these funds for use in the u.s., we would be required to pay u.s. income taxes on the amount of undistributed earnings in those subsidiaries. it is our intent to indefinitely reinvest the majority of these funds outside of the u.s. as such, we have not accrued any u.s. income tax provision in our financial results related to approximately $8.3 billion of undistributed earnings included in these funds. the amount of income taxes that would have resulted had these funds been repatriated is not practicably determinable.
available-for-sale investment securities. our investment portfolio is designed to invest excess cash in securities which enables us to meet our working capital and liquidity needs. our investment portfolio primarily consists of debt securities issued by the u.s. treasury or u.s. government-sponsored agencies. the majority of these investments, $3.9 billion, are classified as non-current as they have stated maturities of more than one year from the balance sheet date. however, these investments are generally available to meet short-term liquidity needs.

factors that may impact the liquidity of our investment portfolio include, but are not limited to, changes to credit ratings of the securities, uncertainty related to regulatory developments, actions by central banks and other monetary authorities, and the ongoing strength and quality of credit markets. we will continue to review our portfolio in light of evolving market and economic conditions. however, if current market conditions deteriorate, the liquidity of our investment portfolio may be impacted and we could determine that some of our investments are impaired, which could adversely impact our financial results. we have policies that limit the amount of credit exposure to any one financial institution or type of investment.
commercial paper program. we maintain a commercial paper program to support our working capital requirements and for other general corporate purposes. under the program, we are authorized to issue up to $3.0 billion in outstanding notes, with maturities up to 397 days from the date of issuance. we had no outstanding obligations under the program at september 30, 2016. see note 9-debt to our consolidated financial statements.
credit facility. on january 27, 2016, we entered into an unsecured $4.0 billion revolving credit facility. the credit facility, which expires on january 27, 2021, replaced our previous $3.0 billion credit facility, which expired on january 27, 2016. the new credit facility contains covenants and events of default customary for facilities of this type. there were no borrowings under either facility and we were in compliance with all related covenants during the year ended september 30, 2016. see note 9-debt to our consolidated financial statements.
universal shelf registration statement. in july 2015, we filed a registration statement with the sec using a shelf registration process. as permitted by the registration statement, we may, from time to time, sell shares of debt or equity securities in one or more transactions. this registration statement expires in july 2018.
long-term debt and change in capital structure. in conjunction with the visa europe acquisition, we have evolved our long-term capital structure. in december 2015, we issued fixed-rate senior notes in an aggregate principal amount of $16.0 billion, with maturities ranging between 2 and 30 years. our first principal payment of $1.8 billion is due on december 14, 2017. interest on the notes, at a rate ranging between 1.20% and 4.30%, is payable semi-annually on june 14 and december 14 of each year. an interest payment of $244 million was made on june 14, 2016. the notes may be redeemed as a whole or in part, at our option at any time prior to maturity, at a specified redemption price. the net aggregate proceeds of $15.9 billion, after deducting underwriting discounts and debt issuance costs of $127 million, were used to fund a portion of the purchase price for the acquisition of visa europe and for general corporate purposes, including share repurchases. we are not subject to any financial covenants and did not experience any changes to our investment credit ratings as a result of this debt issuance. see note 9-debt to our consolidated financial statements. we expect to issue additional debt of about $2.0 billion by the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2017, market conditions permitting.
u.s. litigation escrow account. pursuant to the terms of the u.s. retrospective responsibility plan, we maintain a u.s. litigation escrow account from which monetary liabilities from settlements of, or judgments in, the u.s. covered litigation will be payable. when we fund the u.s. litigation escrow account, the shares of class b common stock held by our stockholders are subject to dilution through an adjustment to the conversion rate of the shares of class b common stock to shares of class a common stock. see note 3-u.s. and europe retrospective responsibility plans and note 20-legal matters to our consolidated financial statements. the balance in this account at september 30, 2016, was $1.0 billion and is reflected as restricted cash in our consolidated balance sheet. as these funds are restricted for the sole purpose of making payments related to the u.s. covered litigation matters, as described below under uses of liquidity, we do not rely on them for other operational needs.
credit ratings at september 30, 2016, our credit ratings by standard and poor's and moody's were as follows:
standard and poor's         moody's debt type                   rating            outlook   rating        outlook short-term unsecured debt   a-1               stable    p-1           stable long-term unsecured debt    a+                stable    a1            stable various factors affect our credit ratings, including changes in our operating performance, the economic environment, conditions in the electronic payment industry, our financial position and changes in our business strategy. we do not currently foresee any reasonable circumstances under which our credit ratings would be significantly downgraded. if a downgrade were to occur, it could adversely impact, among other things, our future borrowing costs and access to capital markets.
43
uses of liquidity payments settlement. payments settlement due from and to our financial institution clients can represent a substantial daily liquidity requirement. most u.s. dollar settlements are settled within the same day and do not result in a net receivable or payable balance, while settlements in currencies other than the u.s. dollar generally remain outstanding for one to two business days, which is consistent with industry practice for such transactions. in general, during fiscal 2016, we were not required to fund settlement-related working capital. our average daily net settlement position was a net payable of $242 million.
visa europe acquisition. on june 21, 2016, we acquired 100% of the share capital of visa europe, a payments technology business. the acquisition positions us to create additional value through increased scale, efficiencies realized by the integration of both businesses, and benefits related to visa europe's transition from an association to a for-profit enterprise. we paid up-front cash consideration of €12.2 billion ($13.9 billion) and issued preferred stock convertible upon certain conditions into approximately 79 million shares of class a common stock, equivalent to a value of €5.3 billion ($6.1 billion) at the closing stock price of $77.33 on june 21, 2016. also, in connection with the purchase, we will pay an additional €1.0 billion, plus 4% compound annual interest, on the third anniversary of the closing. see note 2-acquisition of visa europe to our consolidated financial statements.
u.s. covered litigation. we are parties to legal and regulatory proceedings with respect to a variety of matters, including certain litigation that we refer to as the u.s. covered litigation. as noted above, monetary liabilities from settlements of, or judgments in, the u.s. covered litigation are payable from the u.s. litigation escrow account. during fiscal 2016, we made $45 million in covered litigation payments that were funded from the u.s. litigation escrow account, reflecting settlements with individual opt-out merchants in the interchange multidistrict litigation proceedings. at september 30, 2016, the u.s. litigation escrow account had an available balance of $1.0 billion. in june 2016, the approval of the 2012 settlement agreement was reversed by the u.s. court of appeals for the second circuit. until the appeals process is complete, it is uncertain whether the company will be able to resolve the class plaintiffs' claims as contemplated by the settlement agreement. if the settlement agreement is terminated and no further agreement is reached regarding funds previously paid from the litigation account into settlement funds pursuant to the settlement agreement, we will have the right to approximately $3.0 billion, which would be returned to the u.s. litigation escrow account. this will increase our taxable income, thereby increasing our taxes to be paid by approximately $1.1 billion. see note 3-u.s. and europe retrospective responsibility plans and note 20-legal matters to our consolidated financial statements.
other litigation. judgments in and settlements of litigation, other than the u.s. covered litigation, could give rise to future liquidity needs.
common stock repurchases. during fiscal 2016, we repurchased 91 million shares of our class a common stock in the open market using $7.0 billion of cash on hand. as of september 30, 2016, we had remaining authorized funds of $5.8 billion. in october 2015 and july 2016, our board of directors authorized share repurchase programs for $5.0 billion each. these authorizations have no expiration date. all share repurchase programs authorized prior to october 2015 have been completed. see note 14-stockholders' equity to our consolidated financial statements.
dividends. during fiscal 2016, we declared and paid $1.4 billion in dividends. in october 2016, our board of directors declared a quarterly dividend in the aggregate amount of $0.165 per share of class a common stock (determined in the case of class b and class c common stock and u.k.&i and europe preferred stock on an as-converted basis). we expect to pay approximately $400 million in connection with this dividend on december 6, 2016. see note 14-stockholders' equity to our consolidated financial statements. we expect to continue paying quarterly dividends in cash, subject to approval by the board of directors. all preferred and class b and c common stock will share ratably on an as-converted basis in such future dividends.
pension and other postretirement benefits. we sponsor various qualified and non-qualified defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans that provide for retirement and medical benefits for substantially all employees residing in the u.s. as a result of the acquisition of visa europe, we assumed the obligations related to visa europe's defined benefit plan, primarily consisting of the u.k. pension plans. our policy with respect to our u.s. qualified pension plan is to contribute annually in september of each year, an amount not less than the minimum required under the employee retirement income security act. our u.s. non-qualified pension and other postretirement benefit plans are funded on a current basis. in relation to the visa europe u.k. pension plans, our funding policy is to contribute in accordance with the appropriate funding requirements agreed with the trustees of our u.k. pension plans. additional amounts may be agreed with the u.k. pension plan trustees. in fiscal 2016, 2015 and 2014, we made contributions to our u.s. pension and other postretirement plans of $4 million, $19 million, and
44
$14 million, respectively. for visa europe's u.k. pension plans, we made contributions of $102 million subsequent to the acquisition date as agreed upon with the trustees to improve the funding level of the plans. in fiscal 2017, given current projections and assumptions, we anticipate funding our u.s. and visa europe's u.k. defined benefit pension plans by approximately $12 million and $6 million, respectively. the actual contribution amount will vary depending upon the funded status of the pension plan, movements in the discount rate, performance of the plan assets and related tax consequences. see note 10-pension, postretirement and other benefits to our consolidated financial statements.
capital expenditures. our capital expenditures increased during fiscal 2016, due to investments in technology, infrastructure and growth initiatives. we expect to continue investing in technology assets and payments system infrastructure to support our digital solutions and core business initiatives.
fair value measurements-financial instruments the assessment of fair value of our financial instruments is based on a fair value hierarchy that requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. observable inputs are obtained from independent sources and can be validated by a third party, whereas unobservable inputs reflect assumptions regarding what a third party would use in pricing an asset or liability. as of september 30, 2016, our financial instruments measured at fair value on a recurring basis included approximately $12.0 billion of assets and $136 million of liabilities. none of these instruments were valued using significant unobservable inputs. see note 4-fair value measurements and investments to our consolidated financial statements.
off-balance sheet arrangements our off-balance sheet arrangements are primarily comprised of guarantees and indemnifications. visa has no off-balance sheet debt, other than lease and purchase order commitments, as discussed below and reflected in our contractual obligations table.
indemnifications we indemnify our financial institution clients for settlement losses suffered due to the failure of any other client to fund its settlement obligations in accordance with our rules. the amount of the indemnification is limited to the amount of unsettled visa payment transactions at any point in time. we maintain global credit settlement risk policies and procedures to manage settlement risk, which may require clients to post collateral if certain credit standards are not met. see note 1-summary of significant accounting policies and note 11-settlement guarantee management to our consolidated financial statements.
in the ordinary course of business, we enter into contractual arrangements with financial institutions and other clients and partners under which we may agree to indemnify the client for certain types of losses incurred relating to the services we provide or otherwise relating to our performance under the applicable agreement.
contractual obligations our contractual commitments will have an impact on our future liquidity. the contractual obligations identified in the table below include both on- and off-balance sheet transactions that represent a material, expected or contractually committed future obligation as of september 30, 2016. we believe that we will be able to fund these obligations through cash generated from our operations and available credit facilities.

(1)   in december 2015, we issued $16.0 billion of fixed-rate senior notes in conjunction with the acquisition of visa europe with maturities ranging between 2 and 30 years. interest on the notes, at a rate ranging between 1.20% and 4.30%, is payable semi-annually on june 14 and december 14 of each year. amounts presented include payments for both interest and principal. also see note 9-debt to our consolidated financial statements.
(2)   represents agreements to purchase goods and services that specify significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased, minimum or variable price provisions, and the approximate timing of the transaction.
(3)   includes operating leases for premises, equipment and software licenses, which range in terms from less than one year to nineteen years.
(4)   represents future cash payments for long-term contracts with financial institution clients and other business partners for various programs designed to build payments volume, increase visa product acceptance and win merchant routing transactions over our network. these agreements, which range in terms from one to sixteen years, can provide card issuance and/or conversion support, volume/growth targets and marketing and program support based on specific performance requirements. payments under these agreements will generally be offset by revenues earned from higher corresponding payments and transaction volumes. these payment amounts are estimates and will change based on client performance, amendments to existing contracts or execution of new contracts. related amounts disclosed in note 17-commitments and contingencies to our consolidated financial statements represent the associated expected reduction of revenue related to these agreements that we estimate we will record.
(5)   visa is a party to contractual sponsorship agreements ranging from approximately three to sixteen years. these contracts are designed to increase visa brand recognition, drive visa product usage, and differentiate visa against competition. over the life of these contracts, visa is required to make payments in exchange for certain advertising and promotional rights. in connection with these contractual commitments, visa has an obligation to spend certain minimum amounts for advertising and marketing promotion over the life of the contract. for obligations where the individual years of spend are not specified in the contract, we have estimated the timing of when these amounts will be spent.
(6)   includes expected dividend amount of $400 million as dividends were declared in october 2016 and will be paid on december 6, 2016 to all holders of record of visa's common stock as of november 18, 2016.
(7)   on june 21, 2016, we acquired 100% of the share capital of visa europe. in connection with the purchase, we will pay an additional €1.0 billion, plus 4% compound annual interest, on the third anniversary of the closing. see note 2-acquisition of visa europe to our consolidated financial statements.
(8)   we have liabilities for uncertain tax positions of $911 million. at september 30, 2016, we had also accrued $61 million of interest and $17 million of penalties associated with our uncertain tax positions. we cannot determine the range of cash payments that will be made and the timing of the cash settlements, if any, associated with our uncertain tax positions. therefore, no amounts related to these obligations have been included in the table.
(9)   we evaluate the need to make contributions to our pension plan after considering the funded status of the pension plan, movements in the discount rate, performance of the plan assets and related tax consequences. expected contributions to our pension plan have not been included in the table as such amounts are dependent upon the considerations discussed above, and may result in a wide range of amounts. see note 10-pension, postretirement and other benefits to our consolidated financial statements and the liquidity and capital resources section of this management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations.

critical accounting estimates our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america which require us to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported. see note 1-summary of significant accounting policies to our consolidated financial statements. we have established policies and control procedures which seek to ensure that estimates and assumptions are appropriately governed and applied consistently from period to period. however, actual results could differ from our assumptions and estimates, and such differences could be material.
we believe that the following accounting estimates are the most critical to fully understand and evaluate our reported financial results, as they require our most subjective or complex management judgments, resulting from the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and unpredictable.
revenue recognition-client incentives critical estimates. we enter into incentive agreements with financial institution clients, merchants and other business partners for various programs designed to build payments volume, increase visa product acceptance and win merchant routing transactions over our network. these incentives are primarily accounted for as reductions to operating revenues; however, if a separate identifiable benefit at fair value can be established, they are accounted for as operating expenses. we generally capitalize advance incentive payments under these agreements if select criteria are met. the capitalization criteria include the existence of future economic benefits to visa, the existence of legally enforceable recoverability language (e.g., early termination clauses), management's ability and intent to enforce the recoverability language and the ability to generate future earnings from the agreement in excess of amounts deferred. capitalized amounts are amortized over the shorter of the period of contractual recoverability or the corresponding period of economic benefit. incentives not yet paid are accrued systematically and rationally based on management's estimate of each client's performance. these accruals are regularly reviewed and estimates of performance are adjusted as appropriate, based on changes in performance expectations, actual client performance, amendments to existing contracts or the execution of new contracts.
assumptions and judgment. estimation of client incentives relies on forecasts of payments volume, card issuance and card conversion. performance is estimated using customer-reported information, transactional information accumulated from our systems, historical information and discussions with our clients, merchants and business partners.
impact if actual results differ from assumptions. if actual performance or recoverable cash flows are not consistent with our estimates, client incentives may be materially different than initially recorded. increases in incentive payments are generally driven by increased payments and transaction volume, which drive our net revenues. as a result, in the event incentive payments exceed estimates, such payments are not expected to have a material effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. the cumulative impact of a revision in estimates is recorded in the period such revisions become probable and estimable. for the year ended september 30, 2016, client incentives represented 18% of gross operating revenues.
legal and regulatory matters critical estimates. we are currently involved in various legal proceedings, the outcomes of which are not within our complete control or may not be known for prolonged periods of time. management is required to assess the probability of loss and amount of such loss, if any, in preparing our financial statements.
assumptions and judgment. we evaluate the likelihood of a potential loss from legal or regulatory proceedings to which we are a party. we record a liability for such claims when a loss is deemed probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated. significant judgment may be required in the determination of both probability and whether an exposure is reasonably estimable. our judgments are subjective based on the status of the legal or regulatory proceedings, the merits of our defenses and consultation with in-house and outside legal counsel. as additional information becomes available, we reassess the potential liability related to pending claims and may revise our estimates.
our u.s. retrospective responsibility plan only addresses monetary liabilities from settlements of, or final judgments in, the u.s. covered litigation. the plan's mechanisms include the use of the u.s. litigation escrow account. the accrual related to the u.s. covered litigation could be either higher or lower than the u.s. litigation escrow account balance. we did not record an accrual for the u.s. covered litigation during fiscal 2016. our europe
47
retrospective responsibility plan only covers visa europe territory covered litigation (and resultant liabilities and losses) relating to the covered period, subject to certain limitations. see note 3-u.s. and europe retrospective responsibility plans and note 20-legal matters to our consolidated financial statements.
impact if actual results differ from assumptions. due to the inherent uncertainties of the legal and regulatory processes in the multiple jurisdictions in which we operate, our judgments may be materially different than the actual outcomes, which could have material adverse effects on our business, financial conditions and results of operations. see note 20-legal matters to our consolidated financial statements.
income taxes critical estimates. in calculating our effective income tax rate, we make judgments regarding certain tax positions, including the timing and amount of deductions and allocations of income among various tax jurisdictions.
assumptions and judgment. we have various tax filing positions with regard to the timing and amount of deductions and credits, the establishment of liabilities for uncertain tax positions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions. we are also required to inventory, evaluate and measure all uncertain tax positions taken or to be taken on tax returns and to record liabilities for the amount of such positions that may not be sustained, or may only be partially sustained, upon examination by the relevant taxing authorities.
impact if actual results differ from assumptions. although we believe that our estimates and judgments are reasonable, actual results may differ from these estimates. some or all of these judgments are subject to review by the taxing authorities. if one or more of the taxing authorities were to successfully challenge our right to realize some or all of the tax benefit we have recorded, and we were unable to realize this benefit, it could have a material adverse effect on our financial results and cash flows.

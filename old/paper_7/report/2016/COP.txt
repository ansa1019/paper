due to discontinued operations reporting, we believe income (loss) from continuing operations is more representative of conocophillips earnings than overall net income (loss) attributable to conocophillips. the terms earnings and loss as used in managements discussion and analysis refer to income (loss) from continuing operations. for additional information, see note 3discontinued operations, in the notes to consolidated financial statements.
business environment and executive overview conocophillips is the worlds largest independent exploration and production (e&p) company, based on proved reserves and production of liquids and natural gas. headquartered in houston, texas, we have operations and activities in 17 countries. our diverse portfolio primarily includes resource-rich north american unconventional assets and oil sands assets in canada; lower-risk conventional assets in north america, europe, asia and australia; several liquefied natural gas (lng) developments; and an inventory of global conventional and unconventional exploration prospects. at december 31, 2016, we employed approximately 13,300 people worldwide and had total assets of $90 billion. our stock is listed on the new york stock exchange under the symbol cop.
overview the energy landscape remained challenged throughout 2016. global production oversupply caused continued weakness in commodity prices in 2016 following a year of weak prices in 2015. ongoing uncertainty around the timing and trajectory of a price recovery, coupled with tightening credit capacity across the industry, caused us to take actions early in the year to mitigate the impacts of possible prolonged weak prices. we reduced our quarterly dividend by 66 percent, to $0.25 per share, issued $3.0 billion of long-term debt, obtained a $1.6 billion three-year term loan, reduced capital expenditures and production and operating expenses, and further streamlined our portfolio.
our capital expenditures in 2016 were $4.9 billion, a 52 percent reduction compared with 2015 and a 72 percent reduction compared with 2014. production and operating expenses in 2016 were $5.7 billion, down 19 percent compared with 2015 and down 36 percent compared with 2014.
we also progressed our efforts to high-grade our portfolio. in 2016, we generated $1.3 billion from the disposition of certain non-core assets in our portfolio, including the offshore south natuna sea block b in indonesia and conocophillips senegal b.v., the entity that held our interest in three exploration blocks offshore senegal. the full-year 2016 production impact of completed dispositions was 27 thousand barrels of oil equivalent per day (mboed).
34
during 2016, we expanded our value proposition to position the company for long-term success in light of our view that commodity prices, specifically oil prices, are likely to remain lower and be more volatile in the future. our value proposition principles, namely to maintain a strong balance sheet, grow our dividend and pursue disciplined growth, remain essentially unchanged. however, we took steps to improve our competitiveness and resilience by establishing clear priorities for allocating future cash flows.
in order, these priorities are: invest capital at a level that maintains flat production volumes and pays our existing dividend; grow our existing dividend; reduce debt to a level we believe is sufficient to maintain a strong investment grade rating through price cycles; repurchase shares; and invest capital to grow absolute production. we outlined a 2017 to 2019 operating plan that achieves these priorities at brent prices at or above $50 per barrel with asset sales of $5 billion to $8 billion.
we believe we have taken prudent actions to position the company for success in an environment of price uncertainty and ongoing volatility, while accomplishing significant milestones in a challenged business environment throughout 2016.
key operating and financial summary significant items during 2016 included the following:
   achieved full-year production excluding libya of 1,567 mboed; 3 percent production growth adjusted for downtime and dispositions.

   capital expenditures of $4.9 billion, a more than 50 percent reduction compared with 2015.

   reduced production and operating expenses by 19 percent year over year.

   achieved project startups at aplng train 2 in australia, foster creek phase g and christina lake phase f in canada, alder in europe, malikai in malaysia, and bohai wellhead platform j in china.

   significant discovery at willow prospect in alaska.

   generated proceeds of $1.3 billion from asset dispositions.

   announced preliminary year-end proved reserves of 6.4 billion boe.

   initiated $3 billion share buyback program in mid-november.

business environment global oil market conditions in 2016 were challenging as the excess of supply relative to global demand led to another year of global inventory builds. global oil prices experienced elevated levels of volatility throughout 2016 with first quarter brent crude oil prices reaching a 10-year quarterly average low of $33.89 per barrel. prices recovered slightly in the second and third quarters of 2016 as production growth slowed while demand continued to increase. in the fourth quarter, prices continued to trend higher, with brent crude oil averaging $49.46 per barrel, as opec members and key non-opec producers agreed to cut production in 2017.
the energy industry has periodically experienced this type of extreme volatility due to fluctuating supply-and-demand conditions. commodity prices are the most significant factor impacting our profitability and related reinvestment of operating cash flows into our business. among other dynamics that could influence world energy markets and commodity prices are global economic health, supply disruptions or fears thereof caused by civil unrest or military conflicts, actions taken by opec, environmental laws, tax regulations, governmental policies and weather-related disruptions. north americas energy landscape has been transformed from resource scarcity to an abundance of supply, primarily due to advances in technology responsible for the rapid growth of tight oil production, successful exploration and rising production from the canadian oil sands. our strategy is to create value through price cycles by delivering on the financial and operational priorities that underpin our value proposition.
35
financial priorities the financial priorities we believe will drive our success through the price cycles include:
                        control costs and expenses. controlling operating and overhead costs, without compromising safety and environmental stewardship, is a high priority. we monitor these costs using various methodologies that are reported to senior management monthly, on both an absolute-dollar basis and a per-unit basis. managing operating and overhead costs is critical to maintaining a competitive position in our industry, particularly in a low commodity price environment.
the ability to control our operating and overhead costs impacts our ability to deliver strong cash from operations.

                      maintain a strong balance sheet. we believe financial strength is critical in a cyclical business such as ours. in early 2016, ongoing uncertainty around the timing of a price recovery, coupled with tightening credit capacity across the industry, caused us to take actions to preserve our balance sheet strength and mitigate the impacts of possible weak prices in 2016 and 2017. during the first quarter of 2016, we reduced our quarterly dividend and issued additional debt to secure liquidity. realized commodity prices improved subsequent to the first quarter of 2016, and we paid down approximately $2.3 billion of debt during the second half of the year. in november 2016, we announced our plan to reduce debt to $20 billion by year-end 2019. we expect to retire outstanding debt as it matures and exercise flexibility in paying down our term loan, which is due in 2019.

                    return capital to shareholders. in 2016, we paid dividends on our common stock of $1.3 billion. we believe in delivering value to our shareholders through the price cycles. as a result, we have set a priority to increase our dividend rate annually and purchase up to $3 billion of our common stock over the next three years. we began repurchasing shares in november 2016, and in january 2017, we announced a 6 percent increase to our quarterly dividend, from
$0.25 per share to $0.265 per share.

   focus on financial returns. this is a core aspect of our value proposition. our goal is to achieve strong financial returns by controlling our costs, high-grading our portfolio, shifting our production mix, and exercising capital discipline.

operational priorities the operational priorities we must manage well to be successful include:
                       maintain capital discipline. we participate in a commodity price-driven and capital-intensive industry, with varying lead times from when an investment decision is made to the time an asset is operational and generates cash flow. as a result, we must invest significant capital dollars to explore for new oil and gas fields, develop newly discovered fields, maintain existing fields, and construct pipelines and lng facilities. given our view of greater price volatility, we have shifted our capital allocation to focus on value-preserving, shorter cycle time and low cost-of-supply unconventional programs in our resource base. our cash allocation priorities call for the investment of sufficient capital to maintain production and pay the existing dividend. additional allocations of capital toward absolute growth will be dependent on satisfaction of other financial priorities. we use a disciplined approach, focused on value maximization, to set our capital plans.

in november 2016, we announced a 2017 capital budget of $5 billion.
                       optimize our portfolio. we continue to optimize our asset portfolio by focusing on low cost-of-supply assets which strategically fit our development plans. in the third quarter of 2015, we announced plans to reduce future capital spending in our deepwater exploration program. subsequently, in 2016, we sold our interests in several exploration areas, including offshore senegal, and terminated our final gulf of mexico deepwater drillship contract.
additionally, during the year, we sold our 40 percent working interest in the offshore south natuna sea block b production sharing contract (psc) in indonesia and our 30 percent interest in an exploration license offshore newfoundland. we generated approximately $1.3 billion in proceeds from non-core asset dispositions in 2016.

36
in november 2016, we announced our plan to divest between $5 billion and $8 billion of assets, primarily associated with north american natural gas, over the next two years. proceeds from the sale of assets will be directed toward the achievement of our financial priorities. we will continue to evaluate our assets to determine whether they fit our strategic direction and will optimize the portfolio as necessary, directing our capital investments to areas that align with our objectives.
                      maintain a relentless focus on safety and environmental stewardship. safety and environmental stewardship, including the operating integrity of our assets, remain our highest priorities, and we are committed to protecting the health and safety of everyone who has a role in our operations and the communities in which we operate. we strive to conduct our business with respect and care for both the local and global environment and systematically manage risk to drive sustainable business growth. our sustainability efforts in 2016 focused on updating action plans for climate change, biodiversity, water and human rights, as well as revamping public reporting to be more informative, searchable and responsive to common questions. we are committed to building a learning organization using human performance principles as we relentlessly pursue improved health, safety and environment (hse) and operational performance.

   add to our proved reserve base. we primarily add to our proved reserve base in two ways:

¡   successful exploration, exploitation and development of new and existing fields.

¡   application of new technologies and processes to improve recovery from existing fields.

proved reserve estimates require economic production based on historical 12-month, first-of-month, average prices and current costs. therefore, our proved reserves generally decrease as prices decline and increase as prices rise. additionally, as we continue cash conservation efforts, our reserve replacement efforts could be delayed thus limiting our ability to replace depleted reserves. low commodity prices and reduced capital expenditures in 2016 adversely affected our reported year-end proved reserves. in 2016, our reserve replacement was negative 194 percent. in the five years ended december 31, 2016, our reserve replacement was 35 percent. we expect our proved reserves to increase if prices rise.
access to additional resources may become increasingly difficult as commodity prices can make projects uneconomic or unattractive. in addition, prohibition of direct investment in some nations, national fiscal terms, political instability, competition from national oil companies, and lack of access to high-potential areas due to environmental or other regulation may negatively impact our ability to increase our reserve base. as such, the timing and level at which we add to our reserve base may, or may not, allow us to replace our production over subsequent years.
                      apply technical capability. we leverage our knowledge and technology to create value and safely deliver on our plans. technical strength is part of our heritage, and we are evolving our technical approach to optimally apply best practices. companywide, we continue to evaluate potential solutions to leverage knowledge of technological successes across our operations. such innovations enable us to economically convert additional resources to reserves, achieve greater operating efficiencies and reduce our environmental impact.

                       develop and retain a talented work force. we strive to attract, train, develop and retain individuals with the knowledge and skills to implement our business strategy and who support our values and ethics. to this end, we offer university internships across multiple disciplines to attract the best talent and, as needed, recruit experienced hires to maintain a broad range of skills and experience. we promote continued learning, development and technical training through structured development programs designed to enhance the technical and functional skills of our employees.

37
other factors affecting profitability other significant factors that can affect our profitability include:
   commodity prices. our earnings and operating cash flows generally correlate with industry price levels for crude oil and natural gas, the prices of which are subject to factors external to the company and over which we have no control. the following graph depicts the average benchmark prices for west texas intermediate (wti) crude oil, dated brent crude oil and u.s. henry hub natural gas:

brent crude oil prices averaged $49.46 per barrel in the fourth quarter of 2016, an increase of 13 percent compared with $43.67 per barrel in the fourth quarter of 2015. similarly, wti crude oil prices increased 17 percent from $42.10 per barrel in the fourth quarter of 2015 to $49.18 per barrel in the same period of 2016.
despite the fourth quarter increase, crude oil prices were under pressure throughout 2016 due to a continued global production increase that outpaced demand growth, leading to a large observed rise in global inventory. the average brent crude oil price decreased 17 percent, from $52.46 per barrel in 2015 to $43.69 per barrel in 2016.
henry hub natural gas prices averaged $2.98 per million british thermal units (mmbtu) in the fourth quarter of 2016, an increase of 31 percent compared with $2.27 per mmbtu in the fourth quarter of 2015. natural gas prices increased in the fourth quarter due to growth in demand, coupled with declining production.
on average, henry hub natural gas prices decreased 8 percent from $2.67 per mmbtu in 2015 to $2.46 per mmbtu in 2016, mainly due to strong production levels and a warmer-than expected winter reducing demand below expectations. in 2016, u.s. underground gas storage inventories reached their highest levels in five years.
our realized natural gas liquids prices averaged $21.82 per barrel in the fourth quarter of 2016, an increase of 33 percent compared with $16.42 per barrel in the same quarter of 2015.
similar to natural gas and crude oil, our natural gas liquids prices also declined on average in 2016. our average realized natural gas liquids prices decreased 6 percent, from $17.79 per barrel in 2015 to $16.68 per barrel in 2016, as the expansion in tight oil production boosted supplies of natural gas liquids, resulting in continued downward pressure on natural gas liquids prices in the united states.
38
declining global crude oil prices resulted in the western canada select benchmark price experiencing a 17 percent decline, from $35.21 per barrel in 2015 to $29.36 per barrel in 2016. consequently, our realized bitumen price experienced a decrease relative to 2015 price levels. our realized bitumen price was $15.27 per barrel in 2016, a decrease of 18 percent compared with $18.72 per barrel in the same period of 2015.
our worldwide annual average realized price was $28.35 per barrel of oil equivalent (boe) in 2016, a decrease of 17 percent compared with $34.34 per boe in 2015. the reduction in the prices reflects lower average realized prices across all commodities.
in recent years, the use of hydraulic fracturing and horizontal drilling in tight oil formations has led to increased industry actual and forecasted crude oil and natural gas production in the united states. although providing significant short- and long-term growth opportunities for our company, the increased abundance of crude oil and natural gas due to development of tight oil plays could also have adverse financial implications to us, including: an extended period of low commodity prices; production curtailments; delay of plans to develop areas such as unconventional fields or alaska north slope natural gas fields; and underutilization of lng regasification facilities. should one or more of these events occur, our revenues would be reduced and additional asset impairments might be possible.
                          impairments. as mentioned above, we participate in a capital-intensive industry. at times, our properties, plants and equipment and investments become impaired when, for example, commodity prices decline significantly for long periods of time, our reserve estimates are revised downward, or a decision to dispose of an asset leads to a write-down to its fair value. we may also invest large amounts of money in exploration which, if exploratory drilling proves unsuccessful, could lead to a material impairment of leasehold values. in 2016, we recorded before-tax impairments of $139 million for proved properties and $466 million for unproved properties. as we optimize our assets in the future, it is reasonably possible we may incur future losses upon sale or impairment charges to long-lived assets used in operations, investments in nonconsolidated entities accounted for under the equity method, and unproved properties. for additional information on our impairments in 2016, 2015 and 2014, see note 9impairments, in the notes to consolidated financial statements.

   effective tax rate. our operations are located in countries with different tax rates and fiscal structures. accordingly, even in a stable commodity price and fiscal/regulatory environment, our overall effective tax rate can vary significantly between periods based on the mix of before-tax earnings within our global operations.

                         fiscal and regulatory environment. our operations can be affected by changing economic, regulatory and political environments in the various countries in which we operate, including the united states. civil unrest or strained relationships with governments may impact our operations or investments. these changing environments have generally negatively impacted our results of operations, and further changes to government fiscal take could have a negative impact on future operations. our production operations in libya and related oil exports were suspended or significantly curtailed from july 2013 to october 2016 due to the closure of the es sider crude oil export terminal, and they were also suspended in 2011 during libyas period of civil unrest. in 2016, the united kingdom government enacted tax legislation which reduced our u.k. corporate tax rate by 10 percent. our assets in venezuela and ecuador were expropriated in 2007 and
2009, respectively. our management carefully considers these events when evaluating projects or determining the level of activity in such countries.

39
outlook full-year 2017 production is expected to be 1,540 to 1,570 mboed. this results in flat to 2 percent growth compared with full-year 2016 production of 1,540 mboed when adjusted for 2016 dispositions of 27 mboed. first-quarter 2017 production is expected to be 1,540 to 1,580 mboed. production guidance for 2017 excludes libya and the impact of future dispositions.
marketing activities in line with our strategic objectives, we are currently marketing certain non-core assets primarily associated with north american natural gas. we expect to generate $5 billion to $8 billion in proceeds over the next two years from asset sales.
operating segments we manage our operations through six operating segments, which are primarily defined by geographic region: alaska, lower 48, canada, europe and north africa, asia pacific and middle east, and other international.
corporate and other represents costs not directly associated with an operating segment, such as most interest expense, corporate overhead, certain technology activities, as well as licensing revenues received.
our key performance indicators, shown in the statistical tables provided at the beginning of the operating segment sections that follow, reflect results from our continuing operations, including commodity prices and production.

2016 vs. 2015
losses for conocophillips decreased 19 percent in 2016. the decrease was mainly due to:
   lower exploration expenses. exploration expenses decreased mainly due to reduced leasehold impairment expense and dry hole costs.

   lower proved property and equity investment impairments, including the absence of a $1.5 billion before- and after-tax impairment of our equity investment in australia pacific lng pty ltd (aplng) in 2015.

   lower production and operating expenses.

   a $161 million net deferred tax benefit resulting from a reduction in the u.k. tax rate, which was enacted in september 2016 and effective january 1, 2016.

   the absence of a $129 million deferred tax charge from increased corporate tax rates in canada in 2015.

the decrease in losses was partly offset by:
   lower commodity prices.

   the absence of a $555 million net deferred tax benefit resulting from a change in the u.k. tax rate in 2015.

   lower crude oil, natural gas liquids, and gas sales volumes.

   lower equity earnings, primarily driven by increased depreciation, depletion and amortization (dd&amp;a) expense, as well as a 2016 deferred tax charge of $174 million resulting from the change of the tax functional currency for aplng to u.s. dollar.

   higher interest and debt expense.

   lower gain on dispositions, mainly due to the absence of a $368 million after-tax gain on the disposition of certain properties in our lower 48 segment.

41
2015 vs. 2014
earnings for conocophillips decreased 175 percent in 2015. the decrease was mainly due to lower commodity prices.
in addition, earnings were negatively impacted by:
   higher proved property and equity investment impairments, including a $1.5 billion before- and after-tax impairment of our equity investment in aplng.

                   higher exploration expenses. exploration expenses increased mainly as a result of higher unproved property impairments, dry hole costs and other exploration expenses. the increase included after-tax unproved property impairments of $368 million for our alaska chukchi sea leasehold and capitalized interest, $310 million for our angola block 36 and 37 pscs, $154 million for multiple gulf of mexico leases, and $100 million for various gila prospect blocks.
additional after-tax dry hole costs and other expenses resulted from a $185 million charge for several properties in canada, $140 million for two dry holes in angola, $111 million for a dry hole in the gila prospect in deepwater gulf of mexico, and
$246 million related to the termination of our drilling contract with ensco.

   higher dd&amp;a, mainly from increased production and commodity price-driven reserve revisions.

   higher restructuring charges and pension settlement expense.

these reductions to earnings were partly offset by higher sales volumes, lower production taxes due to reduced commodity prices, lower operating expenses, a $555 million net deferred tax benefit resulting from a change in the u.k. tax rate in the first quarter of 2015, the absence of a $540 million after-tax loss resulting from the freeport lng termination agreement, gain on sale of assets, and higher licensing revenue.
income statement analysis
2016 vs. 2015
sales and other operating revenues decreased 20 percent in 2016, mainly as a result of lower prices across all commodities. additionally, sales and other operating revenues decreased due to lower natural gas, crude oil and natural gas liquids sales volumes, mainly from dispositions and field decline, partly offset by increased bitumen sales volumes.
equity in earnings of affiliates decreased 92 percent in 2016. the decrease was primarily due to lower commodity prices, increased dd&a mainly from trains 1 and 2 being placed in service at aplng, and a 2016 deferred tax charge of $174 million resulting from a tax functional currency change. the decrease in earnings was partly offset by higher sales volumes at aplng and fccl partnership, as well as lower production taxes at qatar liquefied gas company limited (3) (qg3).
gain on dispositions decreased 39 percent in 2016. the decrease resulted from the absence of a $583 million before-tax gain in 2015 from the sales of producing properties in east texas and north louisiana, south texas, and a certain pipeline and gathering assets in south texas, as well as a $26 million before-tax loss on the sale of our interest in the block b psc in indonesia in 2016. the decrease was partly offset by the absence of a $149 million before-tax loss on the disposition of non-core assets in western canada in the fourth quarter of 2015; and gains on the 2016 dispositions of conocophillips senegal b.v., the entity that held our interests in three exploration blocks offshore senegal, the alaska beluga river unit natural gas field, and non-core assets in the lower 48. for additional information on gains on dispositions, see note 6assets held for sale or sold, in the notes to consolidated financial statements.
42
other income increased 104 percent in 2016, mainly due to a gain of $88 million from our receipt of mineral properties and active leases from the greater northern iron ore properties trust in the fourth quarter of 2016. other income was further increased $76 million before-tax for a damage claim settlement in our lower 48 segment.
purchased commodities decreased 20 percent in 2016, mainly due to lower natural gas prices.
production and operating expenses decreased 19 percent in 2016, mainly due to lower operating expense activity, reduced headcount and dispositions of non-core assets, as well as favorable foreign currency impacts.
selling, general and administrative (sg&a) expenses decreased 24 percent in 2016, primarily due to reduced restructuring expenses, lower headcount and reduced activity. the decrease was partly offset by increases from market impacts on certain compensation programs.
exploration expenses decreased 54 percent in 2016, primarily as a result of lower leasehold impairment expense, dry hole costs, and other exploration expenses.
leasehold impairment expense was reduced, mainly due to the absence of 2015 before-tax charges of $575 million for our chukchi sea leasehold and capitalized interest; $493 million for angola blocks 36 and 37; and $447 million for certain gulf of mexico leases, partly offset by 2016 impairments of our melmar, gibson, tiber and other gulf of mexico leaseholds.
dry hole costs were reduced due to the absence of before-tax charges of $1,141 million in 2015, mainly from wells in deepwater gulf of mexico, horn river and northwest territories in canada, angola blocks 36 and 37, and malaysia. the reduction in costs was partly offset by before-tax charges in 2016, including $434 million from several wells in deepwater gulf of mexico and $256 million for two wells in nova scotia.
other exploration expenses were reduced mainly due to the absence of a $335 million before-tax charge in 2015 related to the termination of our ensco gulf of mexico deepwater drillship contract, partly offset by before-tax rig cancellation charges and third-party costs of $146 million for our final gulf of mexico deepwater drillship contract in 2016.
for additional information on leasehold impairments and other exploration expenses, see note 8suspended wells and other exploration expenses, and note 9impairments, in the notes to consolidated financial statements.
impairments decreased 94 percent in 2016. for additional information, see note 9impairments, in the notes to consolidated financial statements.
taxes other than income taxes decreased 18 percent in 2016, primarily as a result of lower production taxes, mainly in our alaska and lower 48 segments, given reduced commodity prices and the absence of the impact of a transportation cost ruling by the federal energy regulatory commission in the fourth quarter of 2015 in alaska. taxes other than income taxes were additionally decreased due to lower property taxes in 2016 in our alaska and lower 48 segments.
interest and debt expense increased 35 percent in 2016, primarily due to lower capitalized interest on projects and increased debt.
see note 19income taxes, in the notes to consolidated financial statements, for information regarding our income tax provision (benefit) and effective tax rate.

2015 vs. 2014
sales and other operating revenues decreased 44 percent in 2015, mainly as a result of lower prices across all commodities. lower prices were partly offset by higher crude oil and lng sales volumes.
equity in earnings of affiliates decreased 74 percent in 2015. the decrease was primarily due to lower earnings from fccl and qg3, given lower commodity prices, partly offset by higher volumes and lower operational costs.
gain on dispositions increased by $493 million in 2015. the increase resulted from a $583 million gain from the sales of producing properties in east texas and north louisiana, south texas, and a certain pipeline and gathering assets in south texas. gains realized were partly offset by a net loss from the disposition of non-core assets in western canada. for additional information on gains on dispositions, see note 6assets held for sale or sold, in the notes to consolidated financial statements.
other income decreased 66 percent in 2015, mainly due to the absence of 2014 income related to the resolution of a contingent liability in the other international segment and a legal arbitration settlement in asia pacific and middle east.
purchased commodities decreased 44 percent in 2015, largely as a result of lower natural gas prices and the absence of a $130 million loss in the lower 48 related to transportation and storage capacity agreements recognized in 2014.
production and operating expenses decreased 21 percent in 2015, largely due to lower operating expense activity, including reduced turnarounds at our bayu-undan field and darwin lng facility, favorable foreign exchange-related impacts, and the absence of an $849 million charge resulting from the freeport lng termination agreement in 2014. the decrease in expense was partially offset by restructuring expenses of $206 million in 2015.
sg&a expenses increased 30 percent in 2015, primarily due to $407 million in restructuring and pension settlement expenses, partially offset by lower staff and compensation plan costs.
exploration expenses increased 105 percent in 2015, mainly as a result of higher unproved property impairments, primarily in alaska, angola and the lower 48. higher dry hole and other exploration costs, including a $253 million before-tax expense for wells charged to dry hole in canada, a $383 million expense related to the termination of our gulf of mexico deepwater drillship contract, and a $176 million charge for two wells charged to dry hole in the gila prospect in the deepwater gulf of mexico, also contributed to the increase in exploration expenses. for additional information on leasehold impairments and other exploration expenses, see note 8suspended wells and other exploration expenses and note 9impairments, in the notes to consolidated financial statements.
dd&a increased 9 percent in 2015. the increase was mainly associated with higher production volumes in the lower 48 and asia pacific and middle east and commodity price-related reserve revisions, partly offset by reserve additions in the lower 48.
impairments increased 162 percent in 2015. for additional information, see note 9impairments, in the notes to consolidated financial statements.
taxes other than income taxes decreased 57 percent in 2015, mainly due to lower production taxes from reduced commodity prices in the lower 48, alaska and asia pacific and middle east.
interest and debt expense increased 42 percent in 2015, primarily due to lower capitalized interest on projects and increased average debt levels in 2015.

we explore for, produce, transport and market crude oil, bitumen, natural gas, lng and natural gas liquids on a worldwide basis. at december 31, 2016, our operations were producing in the united states, norway, the united kingdom, canada, australia, timor-leste, indonesia, china, malaysia, qatar and libya.
total production, including libya, of 1,569 mboed decreased 1 percent in 2016 compared with 2015. the decrease in total average production primarily resulted from normal field decline and the loss of 72 mboed mainly attributable to the 2015 dispositions of several non-core assets in the lower 48, western canada and the sale of our interest in the polar lights company in russia. the decrease in production was partly offset by additional production from major developments, including tight oil plays in the lower 48; aplng in australia; the western north slope in alaska; the kebabangan gas field in malaysia; and the greater ekofisk area in norway. improved drilling and well performance in canada, norway, the lower 48, and china, as well as lower unplanned downtime in the lower 48 also partly offset the decrease in production. adjusted for downtime and dispositions of 66 mboed, our production, excluding libya, increased by 44 mboed, or 3 percent, compared with 2015. assets sold in 2016 produced 27 mboed and 36 mboed in 2016 and 2015, respectively.
in 2015, average production from continuing operations, including libya, increased 3 percent compared with 2014, while average liquids production increased 4 percent. the increase in total average production in 2015 primarily resulted from additional production from major developments, including tight oil plays in the lower 48; gumusut in malaysia; aplng in australia; greater britannia projects and the j-area in the u.k.; and the ramp-up of foster creek phase f in canada. improved well performance, mostly in the lower 48, western canada and norway, and lower turnaround activity also contributed to higher production in 2015. these increases were largely offset by normal field decline. adjusted for downtime and dispositions of 13 mboed,

our production from continuing operations, excluding libya, increased by 70 mboed, or 5 percent, compared with 2014. full-year 2015 production from assets sold or under agreement was 64 mboed.

the alaska segment primarily explores for, produces, transports and markets crude oil, natural gas liquids, natural gas and lng. in 2016, alaska contributed 19 percent of our worldwide liquids production and less than 1 percent of our natural gas production.
2016 vs. 2015
alaska reported earnings of $319 million in 2016, compared with earnings of $4 million in 2015. the increase in earnings was mainly due to:
   lower exploration expenses, primarily due to the absence of the 2015 impairment charge for our chukchi sea leasehold and capitalized interest. for additional information on our impairments, see note 9impairments, in the notes to consolidated financial statements.

   reduced production and operating expense, mainly from lower maintenance costs and general and administrative expenses.

   enhanced oil recovery tax credits.

   higher crude oil sales volumes, partly offset by the absence of lng sales volumes.

   a $57 million after-tax impact for the recognition of state deferred tax assets.

   a $36 million after-tax gain on the sale of our interest in the alaska beluga river unit natural gas field.

the increase in earnings was partly offset by lower crude oil prices and higher dd&a expense, mainly due to capital additions.
average production increased 1 percent in 2016 compared with 2015, primarily due to new production from the alpine cd5 drill site and strong well performance in the greater prudhoe area. the production increase was partly offset by normal field decline.
2015 vs. 2014
alaska reported earnings of $4 million in 2015, compared with earnings of $2,041 million in 2014, mainly due to lower commodity prices and a $368 million after-tax charge in the fourth quarter of 2015 for the impairment of our chukchi sea leasehold and capitalized interest. the earnings decrease was partly offset by reduced production taxes resulting from lower commodity prices.
46
average production decreased 3 percent in 2015 compared with 2014, primarily due to normal field decline, partly offset by lower planned downtime activity and new production from the western north slope, greater prudhoe and greater kuparuk areas.

the lower 48 segment consists of operations located in the u.s. lower 48 states and exploration activities in the gulf of mexico. during 2016, the lower 48 contributed 30 percent of our worldwide liquids production and 32 percent of our natural gas production.
2016 vs. 2015
lower 48 reported a loss of $2,257 million after-tax in 2016, compared with a loss of $1,932 million after-tax in 2015. the increase in losses was primarily due to:
   the absence of a $368 million after-tax gain on the disposition of certain properties in south texas, east texas and north louisiana.

   lower crude oil and natural gas prices.

   lower sales volumes across all commodities due to dispositions and field decline.

   higher proved property impairments, including a $49 million after-tax impairment associated with changes to development plans for eagle ford infrastructure.

the increase in losses was partly offset by:
   lower production and operating expenses, mainly due to reduced activity and cost efficiencies.

   lower exploration expenses, mainly due to:

¡   reduced other exploration costs, mainly due to the absence of a $216 million after-tax charge related to the termination of our gulf of mexico deepwater drillship contract with ensco in 2015, partly offset by 2016 rig cancellation and related third party costs of $95 million after-tax for our final gulf of mexico deepwater drillship contract.

¡   lower general and administrative, and geological and geophysical expenses.

¡   lower leasehold impairment expense, including the absence of 2015 after-tax charges of $154 million for certain leases in the gulf of mexico and $100 million for various blocks in the gila prospect. the decrease in leasehold impairment was partly offset by 2016 after-tax charges of $132 million for our gibson and tiber leaseholds and $62 million for the melmar prospect, all in the gulf of mexico.

47
¡    lower exploration expenses were partly offset by slightly increased dry hole costs in 2016, including after-tax charges in deepwater gulf of mexico of $162 million for our gibson and tiber wells and $83 million associated with our melmar well. dry hole costs in 2016 were partly offset by the absence of a $111 million after-tax charge in 2015 associated with two wells in the gila prospect in the deepwater gulf of mexico.

   an $88 million gain associated with our receipt of greater northern iron ore properties trust assets in the fourth quarter of 2016.

   a $48 million after-tax benefit from a damage claim settlement.

   a $38 million after-tax gain from the disposition of non-core assets and lease exchanges.

   lower dd&amp;a, mainly due to 2016 reserve additions and reduced volumes, partly offset by price-related reserve revisions.

our average realized prices in the lower 48 have historically correlated with wti prices; however, beginning in the second half of 2013, our lower 48 crude differential versus wti began to widen. our 2016 average realized crude oil price of $37.49 per barrel was 13 percent less than wti of $43.20 per barrel. the differential is driven primarily by local market dynamics in the gulf coast, bakken and the permian basin, and may remain relatively wide in the near term.
total average production decreased 11 percent in 2016 compared with 2015. the decrease was mainly attributable to normal field decline and the 2015 disposition of non-core properties in east texas and north louisiana, as well as south texas. the reduction was partly offset by new production and well performance, primarily from eagle ford, bakken and the permian basin, as well as lower unplanned downtime.
2015 vs. 2014
lower 48 reported a loss of $1,932 million after-tax in 2015, compared with a loss of $22 million after-tax in 2014. the decrease in earnings was primarily due to:
   lower crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids prices.

   higher dd&amp;a, mostly due to increased crude oil production.

   higher exploration expenses, mainly due to:

¡   increased impairment expense in 2015, including after-tax charges of $154 million for certain leases in the gulf of mexico and $100 million for various blocks in the gila prospect, where we ceased further activity.

¡   a $246 million after-tax charge to exploration expense related to the termination of our gulf of mexico deepwater drillship contract with ensco.

¡   higher dry hole costs, including $111 million after-tax, associated with two wells in the gila prospect in the deepwater gulf of mexico.

these decreases were partly offset by the absence of a $545 million after-tax charge resulting from the freeport lng termination agreement in 2014; a $368 million after-tax gain on the disposition of certain properties in south texas, east texas and north louisiana; higher volumes; lower production taxes; and the absence of a $151 million after-tax impairment charge resulting from reduced volume forecasts on proved properties and the associated undeveloped leasehold costs.
total average production increased 2 percent in 2015 compared with 2014, while average crude oil production increased 10 percent across the same period. the increase was mainly attributable to new production, primarily from eagle ford, bakken and the permian basin, partially offset by normal field decline.

our canadian operations mainly consist of natural gas fields in western canada and oil sands developments in the athabasca region of northeastern alberta. in 2016, canada contributed 23 percent of our worldwide liquids production and 14 percent of our worldwide natural gas production.
2016 vs. 2015
canada operations reported a loss of $935 million in 2016, a decrease in loss of $109 million compared with 2015. the decrease in loss was primarily due to:
   the absence of a $136 million impact of a 2 percent increase in alberta corporate tax rates on deferred taxes in 2015.

   lower production and operating expenses, mainly due to reduced headcount and the disposition of non-core assets in western canada.

   lower exploration expenses, mainly due to:

¡   reduced leasehold impairment expense, including the absence of an impairment charge for undeveloped leasehold in the duvernay, thornbury, saleski and crow lake areas. the reduction in leasehold impairment expense was partly offset by a $23 million after-tax charge in the fourth quarter of 2016 primarily due to decisions to discontinue further testing on undeveloped leaseholds.

¡   lower general and administrative, and geological and geophysical expenses.

¡   lower dry hole costs, mainly due to the absence of 2015 charges associated with our horn river, northwest territories, thornbury and saleski properties, partly offset by dry hole costs in 2016, including total after-tax charges in offshore nova scotia of $187 million for our cheshire and monterey jack wells.

49
   higher gains on dispositions, including the absence of a $103 million net after-tax loss on the disposition of non-core assets in western canada in 2015.

the decrease in loss was partly offset by lower commodity prices; higher dd&a expense, mainly from price-related reserve revisions; and a $42 million after-tax impairment charge related to certain developed properties in central alberta, which were classified as held for sale, being written down to fair value less costs to sell.
total average production decreased 3 percent in 2016 compared with 2015, while bitumen production increased 21 percent over the same periods. the decrease in total production was mainly attributable to the disposition of non-core assets in western canada and normal field decline. the production decrease was partly offset by strong well performance in western canada, surmont and fccl. surmont has fully recovered from the forest fire impacts.
2015 vs. 2014
canada operations reported a loss of $1,044 million in 2015, a reduction in earnings of $1,984 million compared with 2014. the decrease in earnings was primarily due to:
   lower bitumen and natural gas prices.

   higher exploration expenses, mainly due to:

¡   higher dry hole costs, including an after-tax charge of $185 million associated with our horn river, northwest territories, thornbury and saleski properties.

¡   an after-tax impairment charge of $75 million for undeveloped leaseholds in the duvernay, thornbury, saleski and crow lake areas.

   a 2 percent increase in alberta corporate tax rates on deferred taxes.

   a $103 million net after-tax loss realized on the disposition of non-core assets in western canada.

the earnings decrease was partly offset by higher bitumen production volumes; lower operating expenses and dd&a, both primarily from favorable foreign currency impacts; and the absence of the $109 million after-tax impairment of undeveloped leasehold costs associated with the offshore amauligak discovery, arctic islands and other beaufort properties in 2014.
total average production increased 8 percent in 2015 compared with 2014, while bitumen production increased 17 percent over the same periods. the increases in total production were mainly attributable to strong well performance in western canada, lower royalty impacts, strong plant performance at foster creek and christina lake and the continued ramp-up of production from foster creek phase f. these increases were partly offset by normal field decline and increased unplanned downtime, including the precautionary shut down of foster creek for nearby forest fires in the second quarter of 2015.

the europe and north africa segment consists of operations principally located in the norwegian and u.k. sectors of the north sea, the norwegian sea, and libya. in 2016, our europe and north africa operations contributed 14 percent of our worldwide liquids production and 12 percent of our natural gas production.
2016 vs. 2015
earnings for europe and north africa operations of $394 million decreased 4 percent in 2016. the decrease in earnings was primarily due to the absence of a $555 million net deferred tax benefit as a result of a change in the u.k. tax rate, effective at the beginning of 2015; lower crude oil and natural gas prices; lower sales volumes; and the absence of a 2015 after-tax gain of $49 million on the sale of our 1.9 percent interest in norwegian continental shelf gas transportation (gassled).
the decrease in earnings was partly offset by:
                lower property impairments, including the absence of 2015 after-tax charges of $317 million in the u.k. due to lower crude oil and natural gas prices, and a $180 million credit to impairment in 2016 due to decreased asset retirement obligation estimates on fields that are nearing the end of life and were impaired in prior years. the reduction in property impairments was partly offset by a $59 million after-tax charge associated with our calder field and rivers terminal in the u.k. for additional information on our impairments, see note 9impairments, in the notes to consolidated financial statements.

   lower dd&amp;a expense in the u.k. driven by reduced rate, as a result of completed depreciation on the brodgar h3 tie-back well in 2015, and lower volumes.

   a $161 million net deferred tax benefit resulting from a reduction in the u.k. tax rate, which was enacted in september 2016 and effective january 1, 2016.

   reduced operating expenses across the segment.

average production decreased 1 percent in 2016, compared with 2015. the decrease in production was mainly due to normal field decline, partly offset by improved drilling and well performance in norway and new production from the greater ekofisk and greater britannia areas. libya production remained largely shut in, as the es sider crude oil export terminal closure continued throughout the third quarter of 2016. production resumed in libya in october 2016, with three crude liftings from es sider in january 2017. we expect a gradual ramp-up in activity.
51
2015 vs. 2014
earnings for europe and north africa operations decreased 50 percent in 2015. the decrease in earnings was primarily due to lower crude oil and natural gas prices. earnings further decreased due to higher property impairments in the u.k., given lower natural gas prices and increases to asset retirement obligations. the earnings decrease was partly offset by a $555 million net deferred tax benefit as a result of a change in the u.k. tax rate, effective at the beginning of 2015, and an after-tax gain of $49 million on the sale of our 1.9 percent interest in norwegian continental shelf gas transportation (gassled).
for additional information on the impairments, see note 9impairments, in the notes to consolidated financial statements.
average production decreased 5 percent in 2015, compared with 2014. the decrease in production was mostly due to normal field decline and lower volumes from libya, partly offset by the new production from the greater britannia area, the j-area and the greater ekofisk area, as well as improved well performance in norway.
the es sider terminal in libya remained shut in throughout 2015 as a result of civil unrest.

the asia pacific and middle east segment has operations in china, indonesia, malaysia, australia, timor-leste and qatar, as well as exploration activities in brunei. during 2016, asia pacific and middle east contributed 14 percent of our worldwide liquids production and 42 percent of our natural gas production.
2016 vs. 2015
asia pacific and middle east reported earnings of $265 million in 2016, compared with a loss of $406 million in 2015. the earnings increase was mainly due to:
   the absence of a $1,502 million before- and after-tax charge for the impairment of our aplng investment in 2015. for additional information on our aplng impairment, see the aplng section of note
7investments, loans and long-term receivables in the notes to consolidated financial statements.

   higher lng sales volumes.

53
   lower production taxes.

   reduced feedstock costs at darwin lng.

   lower operating expenses, mainly due to lower general and administrative spend, maintenance costs and transportation expenses across the segment.

   lower exploration expenses, mainly due to lower dry hole costs, as well as the absence of a $41 million after-tax charge in 2015 for the impairment of our relinquished palangkaraya psc, and reduced exploration general and administrative expense.

the earnings increase was partly offset by lower prices across all commodities; lower equity earnings from aplng, mainly as a result of higher dd&a expense from aplng trains 1 and 2 coming online; and a third-quarter 2016 deferred tax charge of $174 million resulting from aplngs tax functional currency change.
average production increased 15 percent in 2016, compared with 2015. the production increase in 2016 was mainly attributable to new production from the ramp-up of aplng in australia and the kebabangan gas field in malaysia, improved drilling and well performance in china and malaysia, and increased recoveries from production sharing contracts in indonesia. the production increase was partially offset by normal field decline across the segment.
2015 vs. 2014
asia pacific and middle east reported a loss of $406 million in 2015, compared with income of $3,008 million in 2014. the decrease in earnings was mainly due to lower prices across all commodities. earnings in 2015 were further decreased by a $1,502 million before- and after-tax charge for the impairment of our aplng investment, higher dd&a expense from increased volumes, primarily in malaysia, and a $41 million after-tax charge for the impairment of our relinquished palangkaraya psc. the earnings decrease was partially offset by lower production taxes, increased volumes, as well as lower feedstock costs and reduced turnarounds at our bayu-undan field and darwin lng facility.
average production increased 9 percent in 2015, compared with 2014. the production increase was mainly attributable to new production from gumusut, in malaysia, which came online in the fourth quarter of 2014; the ramp-up of aplng production due to additional gas processing facilities online; and infill drilling in china. production increases were partly offset by normal field decline.

2016 vs. 2015
other international operations reported a loss of $16 million in 2016, compared with a loss of $593 million in 2015. the decrease in losses was primarily due to the absence of after-tax charges in 2015 of $235 million, $75 million and $32 million net for property impairments on our angola block 36, angola block 37 and poland leasehold, respectively. additionally, losses decreased due to the absence of the 2015 after-tax dry hole expenses offshore angola of $81 million for the omosi-1 well and $59 million for the vali-1 well, combined with a $138 million gain on the disposition of conocophillips senegal b.v., the entity that held our interest in three exploration blocks offshore senegal.
2015 vs. 2014
other international operations reported a loss of $593 million in 2015, compared with a loss of $100 million in 2014. the decrease in earnings was primarily due to after-tax charges of $235 million, $75 million and $32 million net for property impairments on our angola block 36, angola block 37 and poland leasehold, respectively. earnings were also reduced due to increased dry hole expenses for the omosi-1 and vali-1 wells offshore angola and the absence of other income of $154 million after-tax associated with the favorable resolution of a contingent liability. the reduction in earnings was partly offset by the absence of the $136 million after-tax charge in 2014 for the kamoxi-1 exploration well, located offshore angola; and a $53 million after-tax gain from the disposition of our interest in the polar lights company.
for additional information on the impairments, see note 9impairments, in the notes to consolidated financial statements.

2016 vs. 2015
net interest consists of interest and financing expense, net of interest income and capitalized interest, as well as premiums incurred on the early retirement of debt. net interest increased 89 percent in 2016 compared with 2015, primarily as a result of the absence of the 2015 impacts from the fair market value of apportioning interest expense in the united states, lower capitalized interest on projects, and increased debt.
corporate general and administrative expenses increased 17 percent in 2016, mainly due to increases from market impacts on certain compensation programs, partly offset by lower staff expenses.
technology includes our investment in new technologies or businesses, as well as licensing revenues received. activities are focused on tight oil reservoirs, heavy oil and oil sands, as well as lng. earnings from technology were $50 million in 2016, compared with $122 million in 2015. the decrease in earnings primarily resulted from lower licensing revenues, partly offset by reduced technology program spend.
55
the category other includes certain foreign currency transaction gains and losses, environmental costs associated with sites no longer in operation, and other costs not directly associated with an operating segment. other expenses decreased 34 percent in 2016, mainly due to lower restructuring costs and favorable foreign currency impacts, partly offset by the absence of a 2015 tax benefit.
2015 vs. 2014
net interest increased 3 percent in 2015 compared with 2014, primarily as a result of lower capitalized interest on projects completed or sold and increased debt. the 2015 net interest expense increase was largely offset by a $148 million net tax benefit for electing the fair market value method of apportioning interest expense in the united states for prior years.
corporate general and administrative expenses increased 27 percent in 2015, mainly due to $143 million in after-tax pension settlement expense, partially offset by lower staff and compensation plan costs.
earnings from technology were $122 million in 2015, compared with a loss of $93 million in 2014. the increase in earnings primarily resulted from higher licensing revenues.
other expenses increased by $82 million in 2015, mainly due to $142 million after-tax in restructuring charges and foreign currency translation impacts, partially offset by lower environmental expenses.

*capital includes total debt and total equity.
to meet our short- and long-term liquidity requirements, we look to a variety of funding sources, including cash generated from operating activities. in addition, during 2016 we received $1,286 million in proceeds from asset sales and issued $4,594 million of new debt consisting of a three-year term loan and fixed rate notes. the primary uses of our available cash were $4,869 million to support our ongoing capital expenditures and investments program; $2,251 million to repay debt; $1,253 million to pay dividends on our common stock; and $126 million to repurchase common stock. during 2016, cash and cash equivalents increased by $1,242 million, to $3,610 million.
in addition to cash flows from operating activities and proceeds from asset sales, we rely on our commercial paper and credit facility programs and our shelf registration statement to support our short- and long-term liquidity requirements. we believe current cash balances and cash generated by operations, together with access to external sources of funds as described below in the significant sources of capital section, will be sufficient to meet our funding requirements in the near and long term, including our capital spending program, dividend payments and required debt payments.
significant sources of capital operating activities during 2016, cash provided by operating activities was $4,403 million, a 42 percent decrease from 2015. the decrease was primarily due to lower prices across all commodities. cash flows from operating activities were positively impacted by the $585 million and $642 million tax refunds received from the internal revenue service during 2016 and 2015, respectively.
while the stability of our cash flows from operating activities benefits from geographic diversity, our short- and long-term operating cash flows are highly dependent upon prices for crude oil, bitumen, natural gas, lng and natural gas liquids. prices and margins in our industry have historically been volatile and are driven by market conditions over which we have no control. absent other mitigating factors, as these prices and margins fluctuate, we would expect a corresponding change in our operating cash flows.
the level of absolute production volumes, as well as product and location mix, impacts our cash flows. our 2016 production averaged 1,569 mboed. full-year 2017 production is expected to be 1,540 to 1,570 mboed, which results in flat to 2 percent growth compared with full-year 2016 production, excluding libya, of 1,540 mboed when adjusted for 2016 dispositions of 27 mboed. production guidance for 2017 excludes libya and the impact of future dispositions. future production is subject to numerous uncertainties, including, among others, the volatile crude oil and natural gas price environment, which may impact investment decisions; the effects of price changes on production sharing and variable-royalty contracts; acquisition and disposition of fields; field production decline rates; new technologies; operating efficiencies;

timing of startups and major turnarounds; political instability; weather-related disruptions; and the addition of proved reserves through exploratory success and their timely and cost-effective development. while we actively manage these factors, production levels can cause variability in cash flows, although generally this variability has not been as significant as that caused by commodity prices.
to maintain or grow our production volumes, we must continue to add to our proved reserve base. our total reserve replacement in 2016 was negative 194 percent. over the five-year period ended december 31, 2016, our reserve replacement was 35 percent (including 11 percent from consolidated operations) reflecting the impact of lower prices and asset dispositions. the total reserve replacement amount above is based on the sum of our net additions (revisions, improved recovery, purchases, extensions and discoveries, and sales) divided by our production, as shown in our reserve table disclosures. for additional information about our 2017 capital budget, see the 2017 capital budget section within capital resources and liquidity and for additional information on proved reserves, including both developed and undeveloped reserves, see the oil and gas operations section of this report.
as discussed in the critical accounting estimates section, engineering estimates of proved reserves are imprecise; therefore, each year reserves may be revised upward or downward due to the impact of changes in commodity prices or as more technical data becomes available on reservoirs. in 2016 and 2015, revisions decreased reserves, while in 2014, revisions increased reserves. it is not possible to reliably predict how revisions will impact reserve quantities in the future.
investing activities proceeds from asset sales in 2016 were $1.3 billion, primarily from the sales of conocophillips senegal b.v., the entity that held our 35 percent interest in three exploration blocks offshore senegal; our 40 percent interest in south natuna sea block b in indonesia; our interest in the alaska beluga river unit natural gas field in the cook inlet; and certain mineral and non-mineral fee lands in northeastern minnesota. this compares with proceeds of $2.0 billion in 2015, primarily from the sales of certain western canadian properties; producing properties in east texas and north louisiana and in south texas; a certain pipeline and gathering assets in south texas; and our 50 percent equity method investment in the russian joint venture, polar lights company. for additional information, see note 6assets held for sale or sold in the notes to consolidated financial statements, and the outlook section within managements discussion and analysis.
commercial paper and credit facilities on march 28, 2016, we reduced our revolving credit facility, expiring in june 2019, from $7.0 billion to $6.75 billion. our revolving credit facility may be used for direct bank borrowings, the issuance of letters of credit totaling up to $500 million, or as support for our commercial paper programs. the revolving credit facility is broadly syndicated among financial institutions and does not contain any material adverse change provisions or any covenants requiring maintenance of specified financial ratios or credit ratings. the facility agreement contains a cross-default provision relating to the failure to pay principal or interest on other debt obligations of $200 million or more by conocophillips or any of its consolidated subsidiaries.
credit facility borrowings may bear interest at a margin above rates offered by certain designated banks in the london interbank market or at a margin above the overnight federal funds rate or prime rates offered by certain designated banks in the united states. the agreement calls for commitment fees on available, but unused, amounts. the agreement also contains early termination rights if our current directors or their approved successors cease to be a majority of the board of directors.
our primary funding source for short-term working capital needs is the conocophillips $6.25 billion commercial paper program. commercial paper maturities are generally limited to 90 days. we also have the conocophillips qatar funding ltd. $500 million commercial paper program, which is used to fund commitments relating to qg3. at both december 31, 2016 and 2015, we had no direct borrowings or letters of credit issued under the revolving credit facility. under the conocophillips qatar funding ltd. commercial paper programs, no commercial paper was outstanding at december 31, 2016, compared with $803 million at december 31, 2015. since we had no commercial paper outstanding and had issued no letters of credit, we had access to $6.75 billion in borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility at december 31, 2016.
58
due to the significant decline in commodity prices during 2015, and the expectation these prices could remain depressed in the near future, the major ratings agencies conducted a review of the oil and gas industry. as a result of this review, our credit ratings, along with several other companies in the oil and gas industry, were downgraded. in the first quarter of 2016, moodys investors service downgraded our senior long-term debt ratings to baa2 from a2, with a negative outlook and our short-term commercial paper ratings to prime 2 from prime 1 and fitch downgraded our long-term debt ratings to a- from a with a negative outlook and our short-term commercial paper ratings to f2 from f1. in the second quarter of 2016, standard and poors downgraded our senior long-term debt ratings to a- from a, with a negative outlook and our short-term commercial paper ratings to a-2 from a-1. we do not have any ratings triggers on any of our corporate debt that would cause an automatic default, and thereby impact our access to liquidity, in the event of a further downgrade of our credit rating. if our credit rating were downgraded further, it could increase the cost of corporate debt available to us and restrict our access to commercial paper. if our credit rating were to deteriorate to a level prohibiting us from accessing the commercial paper market, we would still be able to access funds under our revolving credit facility.
certain of our project-related contracts, commercial contracts and derivative instruments contain provisions requiring us to post collateral. many of these contracts and instruments permit us to post either cash or letters of credit as collateral. at december 31, 2016 and december 31, 2015, we had direct bank letters of credit of $304 million and $340 million, respectively, which secured performance obligations related to various purchase commitments incident to the ordinary conduct of business. in the event of further credit ratings downgrades, we may be required to post additional letters of credit.
shelf registration we have a universal shelf registration statement on file with the u.s. securities and exchange commission (sec) under which we, as a well-known seasoned issuer, have the ability to issue and sell an indeterminate amount of various types of debt and equity securities.
off-balance sheet arrangements as part of our normal ongoing business operations and consistent with normal industry practice, we enter into numerous agreements with other parties to pursue business opportunities, which share costs and apportion risks among the parties as governed by the agreements.
for information about guarantees, see note 12guarantees, in the notes to consolidated financial statements, which is incorporated herein by reference.
capital requirements for information about our capital expenditures and investments, see the capital expenditures section.
our debt balance at december 31, 2016, was $27.3 billion, an increase of $2.4 billion from the balance at december 31, 2015, primarily as a result of obtaining a $1.6 billion three-year term loan and the issuance of $3.0 billion in new fixed rate notes, both in march 2016, partly offset by the retirement in october 2016 of the $1,250 million of 5.625% notes at maturity, the $803 million repayment of outstanding commercial paper, and early repayment of $150 million of our term loan. our short-term debt balance at december 31, 2016, decreased $338 million compared with december 31, 2015, primarily as a result of the timing of scheduled maturities. for more information, see note 11debt, in the notes to consolidated financial statements.
to preserve our balance sheet strength and provide financial flexibility through the recent downturn, in the first quarter of 2016, we announced a reduction in the quarterly dividend to $0.25 per share. the dividend was paid march 1, 2016, to stockholders of record at the close of business on february 16, 2016. in july 2016, we announced a dividend of $0.25 per share. the dividend was paid september 1, 2016, to stockholders of record at the close of business on july 25, 2016. in october 2016, we announced a dividend of $0.25 per share. the dividend was paid december 1, 2016, to stockholders of record at the close of business on october 17, 2016.
59
additionally, on january 31, 2017, we announced an increase to our quarterly dividend of 6 percent, from $0.25 per share to $0.265 per share. the dividend will be paid march 1, 2017, to stockholders of record at the close of business on february 14, 2017.
on november 10, 2016, we announced plans to purchase up to $3 billion of our common stock over the next three years. repurchase of shares began in november and totaled 2,579,098 shares at a cost of $126 million, through december 31, 2016.

(b)   capital lease obligations are presented on a discounted basis.

(c)   operating lease obligations are presented on an undiscounted basis.

(d)   represents any agreement to purchase goods or services that is enforceable and legally binding and that specifies all significant terms, presented on an undiscounted basis. does not include purchase commitments for jointly owned fields and facilities where we are not the operator.

the majority of the purchase obligations are market-based contracts related to our commodity business. product purchase commitments with third parties totaled $4,673 million.
purchase obligations of $6,232 million are related to agreements to access and utilize the capacity of third-party equipment and facilities, including pipelines and lng and product terminals, to transport, process, treat and store commodities. the remainder is primarily our net share of purchase commitments for materials and services for jointly owned fields and facilities where we are the operator.

(f)   represents estimated discounted costs to retire and remove long-lived assets at the end of their operations.

(g)   represents estimated costs for accrued environmental expenditures presented on a discounted basis for costs acquired in various business combinations and an undiscounted basis for all other accrued environmental costs.

(h)   excludes unrecognized tax benefits of $341 million because the ultimate disposition and timing of any payments to be made with regard to such amounts are not reasonably estimable. although unrecognized tax benefits are not a contractual obligation, they are presented in this table because they represent potential demands on our liquidity.

our capital expenditures and investments from continuing operations for the three-year period ended december 31, 2016, totaled $32 billion. the 2016 expenditures supported key exploration and developments, primarily:
   oil and natural gas development and exploration activities in the lower 48, including eagle ford, bakken, and the permian basin.

   in europe, development activities in the clair ridge, greater ekofisk, aasta hansteen, and greater britannia areas, and exploration and appraisal activities in the north sea.

   alaska activities related to development in the greater kuparuk area, greater prudhoe area and the western north slope, and exploration activities in the national petroleum reserve-alaska.

   major project expenditures associated with the aplng joint venture in australia.

   oil sands development in canada.

   exploration and appraisal drilling in deepwater gulf of mexico.

   exploration activities in offshore nova scotia and appraisal activities in western canada.

   continued development in china, malaysia and indonesia, and exploration and appraisal activity in senegal and chile.

2017 capital budget in 2016, given our view of greater price volatility, we announced a plan for allocating cash across the business which sets annual capital at a level that maintains flat production volumes. our 2017 capital budget of $5 billion reaffirms this strategy. we have shifted our capital allocation to focus on value-preserving, shorter cycle time and low cost-of-supply unconventional programs in our resource base.
we are planning to allocate approximately:
   46 percent of our 2017 capital expenditures budget to development drilling programs. these funds will focus predominantly on the lower 48 unconventionals including the eagle ford and bakken, as well as development drilling in norway, alaska and canada.

   26 percent of our 2017 capital expenditures budget to major projects. these funds will focus on major projects in alaska, china, europe and malaysia, as well as aplng in australia.

   15 percent of our 2017 capital expenditures budget to maintain base production and corporate expenditures.

   13 percent of our 2017 capital expenditures budget to exploration and appraisal activity. these funds will primarily target the permian and niobrara, colombia, chile, australia and canada.

for information on proved undeveloped reserves and the associated costs to develop these reserves, see the oil and gas operations section.
contingencies a number of lawsuits involving a variety of claims arising in the ordinary course of business have been filed against conocophillips. we also may be required to remove or mitigate the effects on the environment of the placement, storage, disposal or release of certain chemical, mineral and petroleum substances at various active and inactive sites. we regularly assess the need for accounting recognition or disclosure of these contingencies. in the case of all known contingencies (other than those related to income taxes), we accrue a liability when the loss is probable and the amount is reasonably estimable. if a range of amounts can be reasonably estimated and no amount within the range is a better estimate than any other amount, then the minimum of the range is accrued. we do not reduce these liabilities for potential insurance or third-party recoveries. if applicable, we accrue receivables for probable insurance or other third-party recoveries. with respect to income tax related contingencies, we use a cumulative probability-weighted loss accrual in cases where sustaining a tax position is less than certain.
based on currently available information, we believe it is remote that future costs related to known contingent liability exposures will exceed current accruals by an amount that would have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial statements. for information on other contingencies, see critical accounting estimates and note 13contingencies and commitments, in the notes to consolidated financial statements.
legal and tax matters we are subject to various lawsuits and claims including but not limited to matters involving oil and gas royalty and severance tax payments, gas measurement and valuation methods, contract disputes, environmental damages, personal injury, and property damage. our primary exposures for such matters relate to alleged royalty and tax underpayments on certain federal, state and privately owned properties and claims of alleged environmental contamination from historic operations. we will continue to defend ourselves vigorously in these matters.
our legal organization applies its knowledge, experience and professional judgment to the specific characteristics of our cases, employing a litigation management process to manage and monitor the legal proceedings against us. our process facilitates the early evaluation and quantification of potential exposures in individual cases. this process also enables us to track those cases that have been scheduled for trial and/or mediation. based on professional judgment and experience in using these litigation management tools and available information about current developments in all our cases, our legal organization regularly assesses the adequacy of current accruals and determines if adjustment of existing accruals, or establishment of new accruals, is required. see note 19income taxes, in the notes to consolidated financial statements, for additional information about income tax-related contingencies.
62
environmental we are subject to the same numerous international, federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations as other companies in our industry. the most significant of these environmental laws and regulations include, among others, the:
   u.s. federal clean air act, which governs air emissions.

   u.s. federal clean water act, which governs discharges to water bodies.

   european union regulation for registration, evaluation, authorization and restriction of chemicals (reach).

   u.s. federal comprehensive environmental response, compensation and liability act (cercla), which imposes liability on generators, transporters and arrangers of hazardous substances at sites where hazardous substance releases have occurred or are threatening to occur.

   u.s. federal resource conservation and recovery act (rcra), which governs the treatment, storage and disposal of solid waste.

   u.s. federal oil pollution act of 1990 (opa90), under which owners and operators of onshore facilities and pipelines, lessees or permittees of an area in which an offshore facility is located, and owners and operators of vessels are liable for removal costs and damages that result from a discharge of oil into navigable waters of the united states.

   u.s. federal emergency planning and community right-to-know act (epcra), which requires facilities to report toxic chemical inventories with local emergency planning committees and response departments.

   u.s. federal safe drinking water act, which governs the disposal of wastewater in underground injection wells.

   u.s. department of the interior regulations, which relate to offshore oil and gas operations in u.s. waters and impose liability for the cost of pollution cleanup resulting from operations, as well as potential liability for pollution damages.

   european union trading directive resulting in european emissions trading scheme.

these laws and their implementing regulations set limits on emissions and, in the case of discharges to water, establish water quality limits. they also, in most cases, require permits in association with new or modified operations. these permits can require an applicant to collect substantial information in connection with the application process, which can be expensive and time consuming. in addition, there can be delays associated with notice and comment periods and the agencys processing of the application. many of the delays associated with the permitting process are beyond the control of the applicant.
many states and foreign countries where we operate also have, or are developing, similar environmental laws and regulations governing these same types of activities. while similar, in some cases these regulations may impose additional, or more stringent, requirements that can add to the cost and difficulty of marketing or transporting products across state and international borders.
the ultimate financial impact arising from environmental laws and regulations is neither clearly known nor easily determinable as new standards, such as air emission standards, water quality standards and stricter fuel regulations, continue to evolve. however, environmental laws and regulations, including those that may arise to address concerns about global climate change, are expected to continue to have an increasing impact on our operations in the united states and in other countries in which we operate. notable areas of potential impacts include air emission compliance and remediation obligations in the united states and canada.
an example is the use of hydraulic fracturing, an essential completion technique that facilitates production of oil and natural gas otherwise trapped in lower permeability rock formations. a range of local, state, federal or national laws and regulations currently govern hydraulic fracturing operations, with hydraulic fracturing currently prohibited in some jurisdictions.
63
although hydraulic fracturing has been conducted for many decades, a number of new laws, regulations and permitting requirements are under consideration by the u.s. environmental protection agency (epa), the u.s. department of the interior, and others which could result in increased costs, operating restrictions, operational delays and/or limit the ability to develop oil and natural gas resources. governmental restrictions on hydraulic fracturing could impact the overall profitability or viability of certain of our oil and natural gas investments. we have adopted operating principles that incorporate established industry standards designed to meet or exceed government requirements. our practices continually evolve as technology improves and regulations change.
we also are subject to certain laws and regulations relating to environmental remediation obligations associated with current and past operations. such laws and regulations include cercla and rcra and their state equivalents. longer-term expenditures are subject to considerable uncertainty and may fluctuate significantly.
we occasionally receive requests for information or notices of potential liability from the epa and state environmental agencies alleging we are a potentially responsible party under cercla or an equivalent state statute. on occasion, we also have been made a party to cost recovery litigation by those agencies or by private parties. these requests, notices and lawsuits assert potential liability for remediation costs at various sites that typically are not owned by us, but allegedly contain wastes attributable to our past operations. as of december 31, 2016, there were 14 sites around the united states in which we were identified as a potentially responsible party under cercla and comparable state laws.
for most superfund sites, our potential liability will be significantly less than the total site remediation costs because the percentage of waste attributable to us, versus that attributable to all other potentially responsible parties, is relatively low. although liability of those potentially responsible is generally joint and several for federal sites and frequently so for state sites, other potentially responsible parties at sites where we are a party typically have had the financial strength to meet their obligations, and where they have not, or where potentially responsible parties could not be located, our share of liability has not increased materially. many of the sites at which we are potentially responsible are still under investigation by the epa or the state agencies concerned. prior to actual cleanup, those potentially responsible normally assess site conditions, apportion responsibility and determine the appropriate remediation. in some instances, we may have no liability or attain a settlement of liability. actual cleanup costs generally occur after the parties obtain epa or equivalent state agency approval. there are relatively few sites where we are a major participant, and given the timing and amounts of anticipated expenditures, neither the cost of remediation at those sites nor such costs at all cercla sites, in the aggregate, is expected to have a material adverse effect on our competitive or financial condition.
expensed environmental costs were $435 million in 2016 and are expected to be about $470 million per year in 2017 and 2018. capitalized environmental costs were $192 million in 2016 and are expected to be about $275 million per year in 2017 and 2018.
accrued liabilities for remediation activities are not reduced for potential recoveries from insurers or other third parties and are not discounted (except those assumed in a purchase business combination, which we do record on a discounted basis).
many of these liabilities result from cercla, rcra and similar state or international laws that require us to undertake certain investigative and remedial activities at sites where we conduct, or once conducted, operations or at sites where conocophillips-generated waste was disposed. the accrual also includes a number of sites we identified that may require environmental remediation, but which are not currently the subject of cercla, rcra or other agency enforcement activities. if applicable, we accrue receivables for probable insurance or other third-party recoveries. in the future, we may incur significant costs under both cercla and rcra.
64
remediation activities vary substantially in duration and cost from site to site, depending on the mix of unique site characteristics, evolving remediation technologies, diverse regulatory agencies and enforcement policies, and the presence or absence of potentially liable third parties. therefore, it is difficult to develop reasonable estimates of future site remediation costs.
at december 31, 2016, our balance sheet included total accrued environmental costs of $247 million, compared with $258 million at december 31, 2015, for remediation activities in the u.s. and canada. we expect to incur a substantial amount of these expenditures within the next 30 years.
notwithstanding any of the foregoing, and as with other companies engaged in similar businesses, environmental costs and liabilities are inherent concerns in our operations and products, and there can be no assurance that material costs and liabilities will not be incurred. however, we currently do not expect any material adverse effect upon our results of operations or financial position as a result of compliance with current environmental laws and regulations.
climate change there has been a broad range of proposed or promulgated state, national and international laws focusing on greenhouse gas (ghg) reduction. these proposed or promulgated laws apply or could apply in countries where we have interests or may have interests in the future. laws in this field continue to evolve, and while it is not possible to accurately estimate either a timetable for implementation or our future compliance costs relating to implementation, such laws, if enacted, could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial condition. examples of legislation or precursors for possible regulation that do or could affect our operations include:
   european emissions trading scheme (ets), the program through which many of the european union (eu) member states are implementing the kyoto protocol. our cost of compliance with the eu ets in 2016 was approximately $1.4
million (net share before-tax).

                the alberta specified gas emitter regulations require any existing facility with emissions equal to or greater than 100,000 metric tonnes of carbon dioxide or equivalent per year to reduce its net emissions intensity from its baseline. the reduction requirement increased from 12 percent in 2015, to 15 percent in 2016 and will increase again to 20 percent in 2017. we also incur a carbon tax for emissions from fossil fuel combustion in our british columbia operations. the total cost of compliance with these regulations in 2016 was approximately $8 million.

   the u.s. supreme court decision in massachusetts v. epa, 549 u.s. 497, 127 s.ct. 1438 (2007), confirming that the epa has the authority to regulate carbon dioxide as an air pollutant under the federal clean air act.

                       the u.s. epas announcement on march 29, 2010 (published as interpretation of regulations that determine pollutants covered by clean air act permitting programs, 75 fed. reg. 17004 (april 2,
2010)), and the epas and u.s. department of transportations joint promulgation of a final rule on april 1, 2010, that triggers regulation of ghgs under the clean air act, may trigger more climate-based claims for damages, and may result in longer agency review time for development projects.

   the u.s. epas announcement on january 14, 2015, outlining a series of steps it plans to take to address methane and smog-forming volatile organic compound emissions from the oil and gas industry. the former u.s. administration established a goal of reducing the 2012 levels in methane emissions from the oil and gas industry by 40 to 45 percent by 2025.

   carbon taxes in certain jurisdictions. our cost of compliance with norwegian carbon tax legislation in 2016 was approximately $28 million (net share before-tax).

   the agreement reached in paris in december 2015 at the 21st conference of the parties to the united nations framework on climate change, setting out a new process for achieving global emission reductions.

in the united states, some additional form of regulation may be forthcoming in the future at the federal and state levels with respect to ghg emissions. such regulation could take any of several forms that may result in the creation of additional costs in the form of taxes, the restriction of output, investments of capital to maintain compliance with laws and regulations, or required acquisition or trading of emission allowances.
65
we are working to continuously improve operational and energy efficiency through resource and energy conservation throughout our operations.
compliance with changes in laws and regulations that create a ghg emission trading scheme or ghg reduction policies could significantly increase our costs, reduce demand for fossil energy derived products, impact the cost and availability of capital and increase our exposure to litigation. such laws and regulations could also increase demand for less carbon intensive energy sources, including natural gas. the ultimate impact on our financial performance, either positive or negative, will depend on a number of factors, including but not limited to:
   whether and to what extent legislation or regulation is enacted.

   the timing of the introduction of such legislation or regulation.

   the nature of the legislation (such as a cap and trade system or a tax on emissions) or regulation.

   the price placed on ghg emissions (either by the market or through a tax).

   the ghg reductions required.

   the price and availability of offsets.

   the amount and allocation of allowances.

   technological and scientific developments leading to new products or services.

   any potential significant physical effects of climate change (such as increased severe weather events, changes in sea levels and changes in temperature).

   whether, and the extent to which, increased compliance costs are ultimately reflected in the prices of our products and services.

the company has responded by putting in place a corporate climate change action plan, together with individual business unit climate change management plans in order to undertake actions in four major areas:
   equipping the company for a low emission world, for example by integrating ghg forecasting and reporting into company procedures; utilizing ghg pricing in planning economics; developing systems to handle ghg market transactions.

   reducing ghg emissionsin 2015, the company reduced or avoided ghg emissions by approximately 566,000 metric tonnes by carrying out a range of programs across a number of business units.

   evaluating business opportunities such as the creation of offsets and allowances, the use of low carbon energy and the development of low carbon technologies.

   engaging externallythe company is a sponsor of mits joint program on the science and policy of global change; constructively engages in the development of climate change legislation and regulation; and discloses our progress and performance through the carbon disclosure project and the dow jones sustainability index.

the company uses an estimated market cost of ghg emissions in the range of $9 to $43 per tonne depending on the timing and country or region to evaluate future opportunities.
other we have deferred tax assets related to certain accrued liabilities, loss carryforwards and credit carryforwards. valuation allowances have been established to reduce these deferred tax assets to an amount that will, more likely than not, be realized. based on our historical taxable income, our expectations for the future, and available tax-planning strategies, management expects the net deferred tax assets will be realized as offsets to reversing deferred tax liabilities and as offsets to the tax consequences of future taxable income.

new accounting standards in february 2016, the financial accounting standards board (fasb) issued accounting standards update (asu) no. 2016-02, leases (asu no. 2016-02), which establishes comprehensive accounting and financial reporting requirements for leasing arrangements. this asu supersedes the existing requirements in fasb accounting standards codification (asc) topic 840, leases, and requires lessees to recognize substantially all lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet. the provisions of asu no. 2016-02 also modify the definition of a lease and outline requirements for recognition, measurement, presentation, and disclosure of leasing arrangements by both lessees and lessors. the asu is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after december 15, 2018, and early adoption of the standard is permitted. entities are required to adopt the asu using a modified retrospective approach, subject to certain optional practical expedients, and apply the provisions of asu no. 2016-02 to leasing arrangements existing at or entered into after the earliest comparative period presented in the financial statements. while we continue to evaluate the asu, we expect the adoption of the asu to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements and disclosures. for additional information, see note 25new accounting standards, in the notes to consolidated financial statements.
critical accounting estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to select appropriate accounting policies and to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. see note 1accounting policies, in the notes to consolidated financial statements, for descriptions of our major accounting policies. certain of these accounting policies involve judgments and uncertainties to such an extent there is a reasonable likelihood materially different amounts would have been reported under different conditions, or if different assumptions had been used. these critical accounting estimates are discussed with the audit and finance committee of the board of directors at least annually. we believe the following discussions of critical accounting estimates, along with the discussions of contingencies and of deferred tax asset valuation allowances in this report, address all important accounting areas where the nature of accounting estimates or assumptions is material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for highly uncertain matters or the susceptibility of such matters to change.
oil and gas accounting accounting for oil and gas exploratory activity is subject to special accounting rules unique to the oil and gas industry. the acquisition of geological and geophysical seismic information, prior to the discovery of proved reserves, is expensed as incurred, similar to accounting for research and development costs. however, leasehold acquisition costs and exploratory well costs are capitalized on the balance sheet pending determination of whether proved oil and gas reserves have been discovered on the prospect.
property acquisition costs for individually significant leaseholds, management periodically assesses for impairment based on exploration and drilling efforts to date. for relatively small individual leasehold acquisition costs, management exercises judgment and determines a percentage probability that the prospect ultimately will fail to find proved oil and gas reserves and pools that leasehold information with others in the geographic area. for prospects in areas with limited, or no, previous exploratory drilling, the percentage probability of ultimate failure is normally judged to be quite high. this judgmental percentage is multiplied by the leasehold acquisition cost, and that product is divided by the contractual period of the leasehold to determine a periodic leasehold impairment charge that is reported in exploration expense.
this judgmental probability percentage is reassessed and adjusted throughout the contractual period of the leasehold based on favorable or unfavorable exploratory activity on the leasehold or on adjacent leaseholds, and leasehold impairment amortization expense is adjusted prospectively. at year-end 2016, the book value of the pools of property acquisition costs, that individually are relatively small and thus subject to the above-described periodic leasehold impairment calculation, was $404 million and the accumulated impairment reserve was $197 million.
67
the weighted-average judgmental percentage probability of ultimate failure was approximately 69 percent, and the weighted-average amortization period was approximately two years. if that judgmental percentage were to be raised by 5 percent across all calculations, before-tax leasehold impairment expense in 2017 would increase by approximately $5 million. at year-end 2016, the remaining $3,659 million of net capitalized unproved property costs consisted primarily of individually significant leaseholds, mineral rights held in perpetuity by title ownership, exploratory wells currently being drilled, suspended exploratory wells, and capitalized interest. of this amount, approximately $2.5 billion is concentrated in nine major development areas, the majority of which are not expected to move to proved properties in 2017. management periodically assesses individually significant leaseholds for impairment based on the results of exploration and drilling efforts and the outlook for commercialization.
exploratory costs for exploratory wells, drilling costs are temporarily capitalized, or suspended, on the balance sheet, pending a determination of whether potentially economic oil and gas reserves have been discovered by the drilling effort to justify development.
if exploratory wells encounter potentially economic quantities of oil and gas, the well costs remain capitalized on the balance sheet as long as sufficient progress assessing the reserves and the economic and operating viability of the project is being made. the accounting notion of sufficient progress is a judgmental area, but the accounting rules do prohibit continued capitalization of suspended well costs on the expectation future market conditions will improve or new technologies will be found that would make the development economically profitable. often, the ability to move into the development phase and record proved reserves is dependent on obtaining permits and government or co-venturer approvals, the timing of which is ultimately beyond our control. exploratory well costs remain suspended as long as we are actively pursuing such approvals and permits, and believe they will be obtained. once all required approvals and permits have been obtained, the projects are moved into the development phase, and the oil and gas reserves are designated as proved reserves. for complex exploratory discoveries, it is not unusual to have exploratory wells remain suspended on the balance sheet for several years while we perform additional appraisal drilling and seismic work on the potential oil and gas field or while we seek government or co-venturer approval of development plans or seek environmental permitting. once a determination is made the well did not encounter potentially economic oil and gas quantities, the well costs are expensed as a dry hole and reported in exploration expense.
management reviews suspended well balances quarterly, continuously monitors the results of the additional appraisal drilling and seismic work, and expenses the suspended well costs as a dry hole when it determines the potential field does not warrant further investment in the near term. criteria utilized in making this determination include evaluation of the reservoir characteristics and hydrocarbon properties, expected development costs, ability to apply existing technology to produce the reserves, fiscal terms, regulations or contract negotiations, and our expected return on investment.
at year-end 2016, total suspended well costs were $1,063 million, compared with $1,260 million at year-end 2015. for additional information on suspended wells, including an aging analysis, see note 8suspended wells and other exploration expenses, in the notes to consolidated financial statements.
proved reserves engineering estimates of the quantities of proved reserves are inherently imprecise and represent only approximate amounts because of the judgments involved in developing such information. reserve estimates are based on geological and engineering assessments of in-place hydrocarbon volumes, the production plan, historical extraction recovery and processing yield factors, installed plant operating capacity and approved operating limits. the reliability of these estimates at any point in time depends on both the quality and quantity of the technical and economic data and the efficiency of extracting and processing the hydrocarbons.
despite the inherent imprecision in these engineering estimates, accounting rules require disclosure of proved reserve estimates due to the importance of these estimates to better understand the perceived value and future cash flows of a companys operations. there are several authoritative guidelines regarding the engineering criteria that must be met before estimated reserves can be designated as proved.
68
our geosciences and reservoir engineering organization has policies and procedures in place consistent with these authoritative guidelines. we have trained and experienced internal engineering personnel who estimate our proved reserves held by consolidated companies, as well as our share of equity affiliates.
proved reserve estimates are adjusted annually in the fourth quarter and during the year if significant changes occur, and take into account recent production and subsurface information about each field. also, as required by current authoritative guidelines, the estimated future date when an asset will be permanently shut down for economic reasons is based on 12-month average prices and current costs. this estimated date when production will end affects the amount of estimated reserves. therefore, as prices and cost levels change from year to year, the estimate of proved reserves also changes. generally, our proved reserves decrease as prices decline and increase as prices rise.
our proved reserves include estimated quantities related to production sharing contracts, reported under the economic interest method, as well as variable-royalty regimes, and are subject to fluctuations in commodity prices; recoverable operating expenses; and capital costs. if costs remain stable, reserve quantities attributable to recovery of costs will change inversely to changes in commodity prices. we would expect reserves from these contracts to decrease when product prices rise and increase when prices decline.
the estimation of proved developed reserves also is important to the income statement because the proved developed reserve estimate for a field serves as the denominator in the unit-of-production calculation of the dd&a of the capitalized costs for that asset. at year-end 2016, the net book value of productive properties, plants and equipment (pp&e) subject to a unit-of-production calculation was approximately $60 billion and the dd&a recorded on these assets in 2016 was approximately $8.6 billion. the estimated proved developed reserves for our consolidated operations were 4.0 billion boe at the end of 2015 and 3.7 billion boe at the end of 2016. if the estimates of proved reserves used in the unit-of-production calculations had been lower by 10 percent across all calculations, before-tax dd&a in 2016 would have increased by an estimated $955 million.
impairments long-lived assets used in operations are assessed for impairment whenever changes in facts and circumstances indicate a possible significant deterioration in future cash flows expected to be generated by an asset group and annually in the fourth quarter following updates to corporate planning assumptions. if there is an indication the carrying amount of an asset may not be recovered, the asset is monitored by management through an established process where changes to significant assumptions such as prices, volumes and future development plans are reviewed. if, upon review, the sum of the undiscounted before-tax cash flows is less than the carrying value of the asset group, the carrying value is written down to estimated fair value. individual assets are grouped for impairment purposes based on a judgmental assessment of the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows of other groups of assetsgenerally on a field-by-field basis for exploration and production assets. because there usually is a lack of quoted market prices for long-lived assets, the fair value of impaired assets is typically determined based on the present values of expected future cash flows using discount rates believed to be consistent with those used by principal market participants, or based on a multiple of operating cash flow validated with historical market transactions of similar assets where possible. the expected future cash flows used for impairment reviews and related fair value calculations are based on judgmental assessments of future production volumes, commodity prices, operating costs and capital decisions, considering all available information at the date of review. differing assumptions could affect the timing and the amount of an impairment in any period. see note 9impairments, in the notes to consolidated financial statements, for additional information.
investments in nonconsolidated entities accounted for under the equity method are reviewed for impairment when there is evidence of a loss in value and annually following updates to corporate planning assumptions. such evidence of a loss in value might include our inability to recover the carrying amount, the lack of sustained earnings capacity which would justify the current investment amount, or a current fair value less than the investments carrying amount. when it is determined such a loss in value is other than temporary, an impairment charge is recognized for the difference between the investments carrying value and its estimated fair value.
69
when determining whether a decline in value is other than temporary, management considers factors such as the length of time and extent of the decline, the investees financial condition and near-term prospects, and our ability and intention to retain our investment for a period that will be sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in the market value of the investment. since quoted market prices are usually not available, the fair value is typically based on the present value of expected future cash flows using discount rates believed to be consistent with those used by principal market participants, plus market analysis of comparable assets owned by the investee, if appropriate. differing assumptions could affect the timing and the amount of an impairment of an investment in any period. see the aplng section of note 7investments, loans and long-term receivables, in the notes to consolidated financial statements, for additional information.
asset retirement obligations and environmental costs under various contracts, permits and regulations, we have material legal obligations to remove tangible equipment and restore the land or seabed at the end of operations at operational sites. our largest asset removal obligations involve plugging and abandonment of wells, removal and disposal of offshore oil and gas platforms around the world, as well as oil and gas production facilities and pipelines in alaska. the fair values of obligations for dismantling and removing these facilities are recorded as a liability and an increase to pp&e at the time of installation of the asset based on estimated discounted costs. estimating future asset removal costs is difficult. most of these removal obligations are many years, or decades, in the future and the contracts and regulations often have vague descriptions of what removal practices and criteria must be met when the removal event actually occurs. asset removal technologies and costs, regulatory and other compliance considerations, expenditure timing, and other inputs into valuation of the obligation, including discount and inflation rates, are also subject to change.
normally, changes in asset removal obligations are reflected in the income statement as increases or decreases to dd&a over the remaining life of the assets. however, for assets at or nearing the end of their operations, as well as previously sold assets for which we retained the asset removal obligation, an increase in the asset removal obligation can result in an immediate charge to earnings, because any increase in pp&e due to the increased obligation would immediately be subject to impairment, due to the low fair value of these properties.
in addition to asset removal obligations, under the above or similar contracts, permits and regulations, we have certain environmental-related projects. these are primarily related to remediation activities required by canada and various states within the united states at exploration and production sites. future environmental remediation costs are difficult to estimate because they are subject to change due to such factors as the uncertain magnitude of cleanup costs, the unknown time and extent of such remedial actions that may be required, and the determination of our liability in proportion to that of other responsible parties. see note 10asset retirement obligations and accrued environmental costs, in the notes to consolidated financial statements, for additional information.
projected benefit obligations determination of the projected benefit obligations for our defined benefit pension and postretirement plans are important to the recorded amounts for such obligations on the balance sheet and to the amount of benefit expense in the income statement. the actuarial determination of projected benefit obligations and company contribution requirements involves judgment about uncertain future events, including estimated retirement dates, salary levels at retirement, mortality rates, lump-sum election rates, rates of return on plan assets, future health care cost-trend rates, and rates of utilization of health care services by retirees. due to the specialized nature of these calculations, we engage outside actuarial firms to assist in the determination of these projected benefit obligations and company contribution requirements. for employee retirement income security act-governed pension plans, the actuary exercises fiduciary care on behalf of plan participants in the determination of the judgmental assumptions used in determining required company contributions into the plans. due to differing objectives and requirements between financial accounting rules and the pension plan funding regulations promulgated by governmental agencies, the actuarial methods and assumptions for the two
70
purposes differ in certain important respects. ultimately, we will be required to fund all vested benefits under pension and postretirement benefit plans not funded by plan assets or investment returns, but the judgmental assumptions used in the actuarial calculations significantly affect periodic financial statements and funding patterns over time. projected benefit obligations are particularly sensitive to the discount rate assumption. a 1 percent decrease in the discount rate assumption would increase projected benefit obligations by $1,100 million. benefit expense is particularly sensitive to the discount rate and return on plan assets assumptions. a 1 percent decrease in the discount rate assumption would increase annual benefit expense by $90 million, while a 1 percent decrease in the return on plan assets assumption would increase annual benefit expense by $50 million. in determining the discount rate, we use yields on high-quality fixed income investments matched to the estimated benefit cash flows of our plans. we are also exposed to the possibility that lump sum retirement benefits taken from pension plans during the year could exceed the total of service and interest components of annual pension expense and trigger accelerated recognition of a portion of unrecognized net actuarial losses and gains. these benefit payments are based on decisions by plan participants and are therefore difficult to predict. in the event there is a significant reduction in the expected years of future service of present employees or elimination for a significant number of employees the accrual of defined benefits for some or all of their future services, we could recognize a curtailment gain or loss. see note 18employee benefit plans, in the notes to consolidated financial statements, for additional information.
contingencies a number of claims and lawsuits are made against the company arising in the ordinary course of business. management exercises judgment related to accounting and disclosure of these claims which includes losses, damages, and underpayments associated with environmental remediation, tax, contracts, and other legal disputes. as we learn new facts concerning contingencies, we reassess our position both with respect to amounts recognized and disclosed considering changes to the probability of additional losses and potential exposure. however, actual losses can and do vary from estimates for a variety of reasons including legal, arbitration, or other third party decisions; settlement discussions; evaluation of scope of damages; interpretation of regulatory or contractual terms; expected timing of future actions; and proportion of liability shared with other responsible parties. estimated future costs related to contingencies are subject to change as events evolve and as additional information becomes available during the administrative and litigation processes. for additional information on contingent liabilities, see the contingencies section within capital resources and liquidity.

cautionary statement for the purposes of the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995
this report includes forward-looking statements within the meaning of section 27a of the securities act of 1933 and section 21e of the securities exchange act of 1934. all statements other than statements of historical fact included or incorporated by reference in this report, including, without limitation, statements regarding our future financial position, business strategy, budgets, projected revenues, projected costs and plans, and objectives of management for future operations, are forward-looking statements. examples of forward-looking statements contained in this report include our expected production growth and outlook on the business environment generally, our expected capital budget and capital expenditures, and discussions concerning future dividends. you can often identify our forward-looking statements by the words anticipate, estimate, believe, budget, continue, could, intend, may, plan, potential, predict, seek, should, will, would, expect, objective, projection, forecast, goal, guidance, outlook, effort, target and similar expressions.
we based the forward-looking statements on our current expectations, estimates and projections about ourselves and the industries in which we operate in general. we caution you these statements are not guarantees of future performance as they involve assumptions that, while made in good faith, may prove to be incorrect, and involve risks and uncertainties we cannot predict. in addition, we based many of these forward-looking statements on assumptions about future events that may prove to be inaccurate. accordingly, our actual outcomes and results may differ materially from what we have expressed or forecast in the forward-looking statements. any differences could result from a variety of factors, including, but not limited to, the following:
   fluctuations in crude oil, bitumen, natural gas, lng and natural gas liquids prices, including a prolonged decline in these prices relative to historical or future expected levels.

   the impact of recent, significant declines in prices for crude oil, bitumen, natural gas, lng and natural gas liquids, which may result in recognition of impairment costs on our long-lived assets, leaseholds and nonconsolidated equity investments.

   potential failures or delays in achieving expected reserve or production levels from existing and future oil and gas developments, including due to operating hazards, drilling risks and the inherent uncertainties in predicting reserves and reservoir performance.

   inability to maintain reserves replacement rates consistent with prior periods, whether as a result of the recent, significant declines in commodity prices or otherwise.

   unsuccessful exploratory drilling activities or the inability to obtain access to exploratory acreage.

   unexpected changes in costs or technical requirements for constructing, modifying or operating exploration and production facilities.

   legislative and regulatory initiatives addressing environmental concerns, including initiatives addressing the impact of global climate change or further regulating hydraulic fracturing, methane emissions, flaring or water disposal.

   lack of, or disruptions in, adequate and reliable transportation for our crude oil, bitumen, natural gas, lng and natural gas liquids.

   inability to timely obtain or maintain permits, including those necessary for drilling and/or development, construction of lng terminals or regasification facilities; failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations; or inability to make capital expenditures required to maintain compliance with any necessary permits or applicable laws or regulations.

   failure to complete definitive agreements and feasibility studies for, and to timely complete construction of, announced and future exploration and production and lng development.

   potential disruption or interruption of our operations due to accidents, extraordinary weather events, civil unrest, political events, war, terrorism, cyber attacks or infrastructure constraints or disruptions.

   changes in international monetary conditions and exchange controls, including changes in foreign currency exchange rates.

   reduced demand for our products or the use of competing energy products, including alternative energy sources.

72
   substantial investment in and development of alternative energy sources, including as a result of existing or future environmental rules and regulations.

   liability for remedial actions, including removal and reclamation obligations, under environmental regulations.

   liability resulting from litigation.

   general domestic and international economic and political developments, including armed hostilities; expropriation of assets; changes in governmental policies relating to crude oil, bitumen, natural gas, lng and natural gas liquids pricing, regulation or taxation; and other political, economic or diplomatic developments.

   volatility in the commodity futures markets.

   changes in tax and other laws, regulations (including alternative energy mandates), or royalty rules applicable to our business.

   competition in the oil and gas exploration and production industry.

   any limitations on our access to capital or increase in our cost of capital related to illiquidity or uncertainty in the domestic or international financial markets.

   our inability to execute asset dispositions or delays in the completion of any asset dispositions we elect to pursue.

   our inability to obtain economical financing for development, construction or modification of facilities and general corporate purposes.

   the operation and financing of our joint ventures.

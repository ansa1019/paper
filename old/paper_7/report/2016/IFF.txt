overview company background we are a leading innovator of sensorial experiences, co-creating unique products that consumers taste, smell, or feel in fine fragrances and cosmetics, detergents and household goods, and food and beverages. we take advantage of our capabilities in consumer insights, research and product development ("r&d"), creative expertise and customer intimacy to partner with our customers in developing innovative and differentiated offerings for consumers. we believe that this collaborative approach will generate market share gains for our customers. our flavors and fragrance compounds combine a number of ingredients that are blended, mixed or reacted together to produce proprietary formulas created by our flavorists and perfumers.
flavors are the key building blocks that impart taste experiences in food and beverage products and, as such, play a significant role in determining consumer preference of the end products in which they are used. as a leading creator of flavors, we help our customers deliver on the promise of delicious and healthy foods and drinks that appeal to consumers. while we are a global leader, our flavors business is more regional in nature, with different formulas that reflect local taste preferences. our flavors compounds are ultimately used by our customers in four end-use categories: (1) savory, (2) beverages, (3) sweet and (4) dairy.
we are a global leader in the creation of fragrance compounds that are integral elements in the world's finest perfumes and best-known consumer products, within fabric care, home care, personal wash, hair care and toiletries products. our fragrances business consists of fragrance compounds and fragrance ingredients. our fragrance compounds are defined into broad categories, (1) fine fragrances and (2) consumer fragrances. consumer fragrances consists of five end-use categories of products: (1) fabric care, (2) home care, (3) personal wash, (4) hair care and (5) toiletries. in addition, fragrance ingredients, that are used internally and sold to third parties, including customers and competitors, for use in preparation of compounds, and cosmetic active ingredients, which consist of active and functional ingredients, are included in the fragrances business unit.
the flavors and fragrances market is part of a larger market which supplies a wide variety of ingredients and compounds that are used in consumer products. the broader market includes large multinational companies or smaller regional and local participants which supply products such as seasonings, texturizers, spices, enzymes, certain food-related commodities, fortified products and cosmetic active ingredients. the global market for flavors and fragrances has expanded consistently, primarily as a result of an increase in demand for, as well as an increase in the variety of, consumer products containing flavors and fragrances. in 2016, the flavors, fragrances and cosmetic actives and functional ingredients market, in which we compete, was estimated by management to be approximately $20.0 billion and is forecasted to grow approximately 2-3% by 2020, primarily

driven by expected growth in emerging markets; however the exact size of the global market is not available due to fragmentation of data. we, together with the other top three companies, are estimated to represent approximately two-thirds of the total estimated sales in the global flavors and fragrances sub-segment of the broader market.
development of new flavors and fragrance compounds is driven by a variety of sources, including requests from our customers, who are in need of a specific flavor or fragrance for use in a new or modified consumer product, or as a result of internal initiatives stemming from our consumer insights program. our product development team works in partnership with our scientists and researchers to optimize the consumer appeal of the flavor or fragrance. it then becomes a collaborative process between our researchers, our product development team and our customers to perfect the flavor or fragrance so that it is ready to be included in the final consumer product.
on january 17, 2017, we completed the acquisition of fragrance resources for approximately euro 142 million (approximately $150.5 million). the acquisition had no impact on our consolidated financial statements for 2016. the acquisition is expected to strengthen our fragrances market position in north america and germany.
2016 overview our 25 largest customers accounted for 52% of total sales in 2016; this percentage has remained fairly constant for several years. sales to our largest customer across all end-use categories accounted for 12% of our sales for each of the last three fiscal years. a key factor for commercial success is inclusion on our strategic customers' core supplier lists, which provides opportunities to win new business. we are on the core supplier lists of a large majority of our global and strategic customers within fragrances and flavors.
sales in 2016 increased 3% on a reported basis and 5% on a currency neutral basis (which excludes the effects of changes in currency), with the effects of acquisitions contributing approximately 2% to both reported and currency neutral growth rates. flavors achieved reported sales growth of 4% and currency neutral sales growth of 6%, with the effect of acquisitions contributing approximately 3% to both reported and currency neutral growth rates. fragrances achieved reported sales growth of 3% and currency neutral growth of 4% in 2016, with the effect of acquisitions contributing approximately 2% to both reported and currency neutral growth rates. sales growth excluding acquisitions was driven by new win performance (net of losses) in both flavors and fragrance compounds. additionally, fragrance ingredients sales were up 9% on a reported basis and 10% on a currency neutral basis, which were driven entirely by the inclusion of acquisitions. overall, our 2016 results continued to be driven by our strong emerging market presence that represented 51% of total sales and experienced 4% currency neutral growth in 2016. from a geographic perspective, north america (noam), europe, africa and middle east (eame) and greater asia (ga) all delivered sales growth on a consolidated basis in 2016; led by noam. latin america (la) sales declined in 2016.
during the fourth quarter of 2016, we completed the acquisition of 100% of the outstanding shares of david michael & company, inc. ("david michael") for approximately $242.0 million. the acquisition did not have a material impact on our consolidated statement of income and comprehensive income for 2016. the acquisition strengthened our flavors market position in the targeted north american market.
the year 2014 included an extra week of activity, due to the timing of our fiscal year-end (as discussed in note 1 of the consolidated financial statements). the impact of this week was not material to our results of operations for the year ended december 31, 2014.

financial performance overview reported sales for 2016 increased 3% year-over-year (including approximately 2% growth from acquisitions). we continue to benefit from our diverse portfolio of end-use product categories and geographies and had sales growth in three of our four regions and in consumer fragrances, fragrance ingredients and flavor compounds. both flavors and fragrances benefited from new win performance (net of losses) and the effect of acquisitions. exchange rate variations represented a 2% decrease in year-over-year sales. the effect of exchange rates can vary by business and region depending upon the mix of sales by country as well as the relative percentage of local sales priced in u.s. dollars versus local currencies. currency neutral sales growth, including acquisitions, was 5% in 2016. we saw currency neutral sales growth during each quarter of 2016. we believe that market conditions and the macro-economic environment will continue to be challenging in many markets in 2017. this lower growth environment combined with a stronger u.s. dollar and the reset of the incentive compensation program is expected to pressure our currency neutral operating profit growth in 2017.
on a long-term basis, we expect that sales growth for the industry will generally be in line with the underlying assumptions that support our long-term strategic goals, albeit with some risk in the near term given the continuing global economic uncertainty. we believe changing social habits resulting from increased disposable income, improved focus on personal health and wellness awareness should help drive growth of our consumer product customers' businesses.

gross margin increased 20 basis points (bps) year-over-year. included in 2016 was $7.6 million of acquisition-related inventory "step-up" costs, $2.4 million of costs associated with operational improvement initiatives and $0.7 million of costs related to accelerated depreciation included in cost of goods sold, compared to $6.8 million of acquisition-related inventory "step-up" costs and $1.1 million of costs related to operational improvement initiatives included in 2015. excluding these items, adjusted gross margin increased 20 bps compared to the prior year period. the increase was principally driven by productivity initiatives. we ended 2016 in a relatively stable, but upward trending raw material cost environment. we believe that we will continue to see higher prices on certain categories (such as vanilla and citrus) and to a lesser extent oil-based derivatives that are expected to continue in 2017. we continue to seek improvements in our margins through operational performance, cost reduction efforts and mix enhancement.
operating profit decreased $21.0 million to $567.4 million (18.2% of sales) in 2016 compared to $588.3 million (19.5% of sales) in 2015. included in 2016 were net legal charges/credits of $48.5 million, acquisition-related costs of $12.2 million, gain on sale of fixed assets of $7.8 million, operational improvement initiative costs of $2.4 million and restructuring and other charges, net of $0.3 million. included in 2015 were acquisition-related costs of $18.3 million, the reversal of the previously recorded provision for the spanish capital tax case of $10.5 million, restructuring and other charges, net of $7.6 million, accelerated contingent consideration payments of $7.2 million and operational improvement initiative costs of $1.1 million in 2015. excluding these charges, adjusted operating profit was $623.0 million (20.0% of sales) for 2016 versus $612.1 million (20.2% of sales) for 2015. foreign currency changes had an unfavorable impact on operating profit of approximately 2% and 6% in 2016 and 2015, respectively.
cash flows from operations were $535.4 million or 17.2% of sales in 2016 as compared to cash flows from operations of $433.6 million, or 14.3% of sales, during 2015. the increase in operating cash flows in 2016 as compared to 2015 is principally related to the impact of decreased core working capital requirements (trade receivables, inventories and accounts payable) and lower pension contributions.
our capital spend was $126.4 million (4.1% of sales, excluding david michael) during 2016. given our intent to construct a new flavors facility in china, the continuation of our indonesia project, spending associated with the integrations of david michael and fragrance resources, infrastructure needs in india, upgrades to creative center and application laboratory facilities and carryover payments from 2016, we expect that capital spending in 2017 will be about 5% of sales (net of potential grants and other reimbursements from government authorities).

2016 in comparison to 2015
sales sales for 2016 totaled $3.1 billion, an increase of 3% from the prior year. excluding currency impacts, sales increased 5%. sales growth reflected new win performance (net of losses) in both flavors and fragrance compounds. on both a reported and currency neutral basis, the effect of acquisitions was approximately 2% to net sales amounts. in addition, fragrance

ingredients sales were up 9% on a reported basis and 10% on a currency neutral basis, driven entirely by the impact of acquisitions. overall organic sales growth includes 1% growth from both developed and emerging markets and on a currency neutral basis, 4% growth from emerging markets and 1% growth from developed markets, respectively.
flavors business unit flavors sales in 2016 increased 4% on a reported basis and 6% on a currency neutral basis versus the prior year period. acquisitions accounted for approximately 3% of the net sales growth on both a reported and currency neutral basis. overall growth was primarily driven by to mid single-digit growth in savory, sweet and dairy combined with low single-digit growth in beverage. regionally, the flavors business delivered reported and currency neutral growth across all regions. sales growth was led by noam, driven by high single-digit gains in sweet and low single-digit gains in beverage and dairy. sales growth in ga was driven by mid single-digit gains in savory, beverage and sweet and high single-digit gains in dairy. sales growth in eame was driven by mid single-digit gains in savory and sweet and high single-digit gains in dairy. la sales growth was primarily driven by double-digit growth in savory and dairy and high single-digit growth in sweet. eame performance continues to be led by our performance in the emerging market countries within the region. globally, flavors growth included mid single-digit growth in emerging markets. overall, emerging markets represented approximately 52% of total flavors sales.
fragrances business unit fragrances sales in 2016 increased 3% on a reported basis and 4% on a currency neutral basis. acquisitions accounted for approximately 2% of both reported and currency neutral sales growth. year-over-year, 2016 sales performance was led by high single-digit growth in fragrance ingredients (which was driven entirely by the impact of acquisitions) and mid single-digit growth in fabric care, home care and personal wash. sales growth within the regions was led by ga reflecting double-digit gains in fragrance ingredients and fabric care and high single-digit growth in personal wash. noam sales growth reflected double-digit gains in fragrance ingredients, fabric care and home care categories, which more than offset low single-digit declines in fine fragrance. eame sales growth reflected double-digit gains in fragrance ingredients and hair care and low single-digit gains in fabric care. la sales declined reflecting double-digit declines in fragrance ingredients as well as high single-digit declines in hair care and mid single-digit declines in fabric care and home care which more than offset double-digit gains in personal wash. excluding the effects of acquisitions, fragrance ingredients sales declined low single-digits. globally, fragrances growth included low single-digit growth in emerging markets. overall, emerging markets represented 48% of total fragrances sales.

cost of goods sold cost of goods sold, as a percentage of sales, decreased 20 bps, to 55.1% in 2016 compared to 55.3% in 2015. included in cost of goods sold was $7.6 million of acquisition-related inventory "step-up" costs, $2.4 million of costs associated with operational improvement initiatives and $0.7 million of costs related to accelerated depreciation in 2016 and $6.8 million of acquisition-related inventory "step-up" costs and $1.1 million of costs related to operational improvement initiatives included in 2015.
research and development (r&d)
r&d expenses, as a percentage of sales, remained relatively consistent with the prior year period at 8.2% in 2016 compared to 8.1% in 2015. the slight increase in 2016 was principally driven by slightly higher salary costs and, to a lesser extent, the effect of recent acquisitions.
selling and administrative (s&a)
s&a, as a percentage of sales, increased 180 bps to 18.2% versus 16.4% (or 16.4% and 16.1% on an adjusted basis in 2016 and 2015, respectively). included in 2016 were net legal charges/credits, principally related to litigation accrual, of $48.5 million, acquisition-related costs of $4.5 million and severance costs related to the termination of a former executive officer of $1.4 million, compared to acquisition related costs of $11.5 million, accelerated contingency payments of $7.2 million and the reversal of the previously recorded provision related to the spanish capital tax case of $10.5 million included in 2015. additionally, during 2016, costs were higher as a result of legal and professional fees associated with various finance initiatives and the effect of recently acquired companies, offset by slightly lower salary costs and the effect of foreign currency.
restructuring and other charges restructuring and other charges primarily consist of separation costs for employees, including severance, outplacement and other benefit costs.

2015 severance and contingent consideration charges during the fourth quarter of 2015, the company established a series of initiatives intended to streamline its management structure, simplify decision-making and accountability, better leverage and align its capabilities across the organization and improve efficiency of its global manufacturing and operations network. as a result, in 2015, the company recorded a pre-tax charge of $7.6 million, included in restructuring and other charges, net, related to severance and related costs pertaining to approximately 150 positions that will be affected. during 2016, the company made payments of $2.9 million and recorded accelerated depreciation expense of $0.7 million. in addition, during 2016, the company recorded a credit of $1.7 million related to the reversal of severance accruals that were determined to be no longer required. the total cost of the plan is now expected to be approximately $8.8 million with the remaining charges related principally to accelerated depreciation. the company expects the plan to be fully completed in the second half of 2017.
separately, in 2015, the company recorded a charge of $7.2 million, included in selling and administrative expenses, associated with the acceleration from 2016 to 2015 of contingent consideration payments from the aromor acquisition that were triggered by certain of the management structure changes noted above.
2017 productivity program on february 15, 2017, the company announced that it was adopting a multi-year productivity program designed to improve overall financial performance, provide flexibility to invest in growth opportunities and drive long-term value creation. in connection
36
with this program, the company expects to optimize its global footprint and simplify its organizational structures globally. in connection with this initiative, the company expects to incur cumulative, pre-tax cash charges of between $30-$35 million, consisting primarily of $21-$22 million in personnel-related costs and an estimated $9-$13 million in facility-related costs, such as lease termination, and integration-related costs. in addition, the company may incur up to $5 million of accelerated depreciation. approximately $10 million of these charges are expected to be recorded in the first quarter of 2017, with the remainder of the personnel-related costs expected to be recognized by the end of 2017 and the other costs expected to be recognized over the following seven quarters. the overall charges are split approximately evenly between flavors and fragrances. this initiative is expected to result in the reduction of approximately 370 members of the company's global workforce in various parts of the organization. once fully implemented, the company expects to realize annual run-rate savings of between $40 million and $45 million from this program by 2019.
amortization of acquisition-related intangibles amortization expenses increased to $23.8 million in 2016 compared to $15.0 million in 2015. the increase of $8.7 million is principally due a full year of amortization in 2016 related to the acquisitions of ottens flavors and lucas meyer as compared to 2015 as well as the acquisition of david michael in 2016.

flavors business unit flavors segment profit increased $18.8 million to $337.2 million in 2016 (22.5% of sales) from $318.5 million (22.1% of sales) in the comparable 2015 period. the increase in segment profit and profit margin principally reflects productivity initiatives and solid top-line growth.
fragrances business unit fragrances segment profit increased $12.5 million to $334.2 million in 2016 (20.6% of sales), compared to $321.8 million (20.4% of sales) reported in 2015. the increase in segment profit and profit margin was principally driven by volume growth and the benefits from cost and productivity initiatives.
global expenses global expenses represent corporate and headquarter-related expenses which include legal, finance, human resources and r&d and other administrative expenses that are not allocated to an individual business unit. in 2016, global expenses were
37
$48.5 million compared to $28.2 million during 2015. the increase is principally driven by lower gains on our cash flow hedging program and higher incentive compensation costs.
interest expense in 2016, interest expense increased $6.9 million to $53.0 million, compared to $46.1 million in 2015 reflecting the impact of borrowings under the euro senior notes - 2016. average cost of debt was 3.8% for the 2016 period compared to 4.5% in 2015.
other (income) expense, net other (income) expense, net increased approximately $12.5 million to $9.4 million of income in 2016 versus $3.2 million of expense in 2015. the increase was largely driven by gains on foreign currency of approximately $5.0 million in the current year versus losses of approximately $6.0 million in the prior year.
income taxes the effective tax rate was 22.7% in 2016 as compared to 22.2% in 2015. excluding $17.1 million, $4.1 million, $0.6 million and $0.1 million of tax benefits associated with pretax legal charges/credits, net, acquisition-related costs, operational improvement initiatives and restructuring related costs, respectively, as well as a $2.7 million tax charge related to the gain on sale of property, the adjusted tax rate for 2016 was 23.8%. excluding $6.2 million, $2.3 million and $0.3 million of tax benefits associated with pretax acquisition-related costs, restructuring charges and operational improvement initiatives, respectively, a $10.5 million tax settlement received in 2015 due to favorable tax rulings in spain and another jurisdiction as well as a $2.9 million charge related to the reversal of the previously recorded provision for the spanish capital tax case, the adjusted tax rate for 2015 was 24.2%. the year-over-year reduction reflects a benefit from lower cost of repatriation and mix of earnings, which were partially offset by loss provisions.
2015 in comparison to 2014
sales sales for 2015 totaled $3.0 billion, a decrease of 2% from the prior year. excluding currency impacts, sales increased 5%. sales growth reflects new win performance (net of losses) in both flavors and fragrance compounds, partially offset by volume erosion on existing business principally driven by our customers' product line rationalization and inventory management efforts. in addition, our flavors business was negatively impacted by volume erosion in north america (noam) as well as weak demand and lost business in china (principally associated with facility issues). on both a reported and currency neutral basis, the effect of acquisitions was approximately 2% to net sales amounts. fragrance ingredients sales declined 5% on a reported basis but were up 2% on a currency neutral basis. overall organic sales growth includes declines of 1% and 7% from emerging markets and developed markets, respectively, compared to currency neutral sales growth of 5% and 1% from emerging markets and developed markets, respectively.
flavors business unit flavors sales in 2015 decreased 1% on a reported basis but increased 6% on a currency neutral basis versus the prior year period. acquisitions accounted for the majority of net sales growth on a reported basis and approximately half of the net sales growth on a currency neutral basis. overall sales growth was primarily due to mid single-digit growth in beverage combined with high single-digit growth in dairy and low single-digit growth in savory. regionally, the flavors business delivered reported sales growth in noam and la but had currency neutral growth across all regions. sales growth was led by noam which was primarily driven by high double-digit growth in sweet and dairy and double-digit growth in beverage. la sales growth was driven by double-digit gains in beverage, savory and dairy. ga sales included low single-digit gains in savory and dairy and low single-digit declines in sweet, offset by the effects of currency. eame sales included mid single-digit gains in savory and beverage, offset by the effects of currency. eame performance continued to be led by our performance in the emerging market countries within the region. globally, flavors growth was led by mid single-digit growth in emerging markets. overall, emerging markets represented approximately 52% of total flavors sales.
fragrances business unit fragrances sales in 2015 declined 3% on a reported basis but increased 4% on a currency neutral basis. acquisitions accounted for approximately 1% of both reported and currency neutral sales growth. year-over-year, 2015 sales performance was led by double-digit growth in fabric care, high single-digit growth in home care, mid single-digit growth in hair care and low single-digit growth in fragrance ingredients and fine fragrance. sales in eame included double-digit gains in fabric care and mid single-digit growth in fine fragrance and fragrance ingredients, offset by the effects of currency. la sales growth reflected double-digit gains in fabric care, home care and hair care categories as well as low single-digit gains in fragrance ingredients, which offset mid single-digit declines in fine fragrance. ga sales growth reflected high single-digit
38
gains in fragrance ingredients and mid single-digit gains in fabric care, offset by the effects of currency. noam sales declined driven by double-digit declines in toiletries, high single-digit declines in fragrance ingredients and mid single-digit declines in fine fragrance which more than offset mid to high single-digit gains in home care and fabric care. overall, emerging markets represented 49% of total fragrances sales.

2015 severance and contingent consideration charges during the fourth quarter of 2015, we established a series of initiatives that were expected to streamline our management structure, simplify decision-making and accountability, better leverage and align our capabilities across the organization and improve efficiency of our global manufacturing and operations network. as a result, we recorded a pre-tax charge of $7.6 million, included in restructuring and other charges, net, related to severance and related costs pertaining to approximately 150 positions that will be affected. the company expects the plan to be fully completed in the second half of 2017.

fragrance ingredients rationalization - 2014
in 2014, we closed our fragrance ingredients manufacturing facility in augusta, georgia and consolidated production into other company facilities. in connection with this closure, we incurred charges of $13.8 million, consisting primarily of $10.3 million in accelerated depreciation of fixed assets, $2.2 million in personnel-related costs and $1.3 million in plant shutdown and other related costs. we recorded total charges of $7.4 million during 2013, consisting of $2.2 million of pre-tax charges related to severance included in restructuring and other charges, net and $5.2 million of non-cash charges related to accelerated depreciation included in cost of goods sold. during 2014, we recorded $1.3 million of plant shutdown and other related costs included in restructuring and other charges, net as well as an additional $5.1 million of non-cash charges related to accelerated depreciation included in cost of goods sold. as a result of this closure, 43 positions were eliminated. during 2015, we recorded a net credit of $0.5 million principally related to the reversal of severance accruals.
amortization of acquisition-related intangibles amortization expenses increased to $15.0 million in 2015 compared to $7.3 million in 2014. the increase of $7.7 million was driven by the acquisitions of ottens flavors and lucas meyer in 2015.

flavors business unit flavors segment profit decreased $12.8 million to $318.5 million in 2015 (22.1% of sales) from $331.3 million (22.7% of sales) in the comparable 2014 period. the decrease in segment profit and profit margin was driven by unfavorable foreign currency impacts, scale up costs of new sites in turkey and indonesia and other one-off costs, including incremental operating costs associated with the china flavors facility. these costs were only partially offset by favorable volume growth, productivity initiatives, sales mix and a slight impact from the addition of ottens flavors.
fragrances business unit fragrances segment profit decreased $13.7 million to $321.8 million in 2015 (20.4% of sales), compared to $335.4 million (20.6% of sales) reported in 2014. the decrease in segment profit and profit margin was principally driven by unfavorable foreign currency impacts, which were partially offset by favorable volume growth, sales mix and a slight impact from the addition of lucas meyer.
global expenses global expenses represent corporate and headquarter-related expenses which include legal, finance, human resources and r&d and other administrative expenses that are not allocated to an individual business unit. in 2015, global expenses were $28.2 million compared to $65.4 million during 2014. the decrease is principally driven by lower incentive compensation expense and the favorable impact of our cash flow hedging program.
interest expense in 2015, interest expense remained comparable with the prior year at $46.1 million. average cost of debt was 4.5% for the 2015 period compared to 4.9% in 2014.
other expense (income), net other expense (income), net decreased approximately $6.0 million to $3.2 million of expense in 2015 versus $2.8 million of income in 2014. this decrease is primarily driven by lower foreign exchange gains on working capital and lower mark-to-market adjustments on deferred compensation plan assets during 2015 compared to the 2014 period.
income taxes the effective tax rate was 22.2% in 2015 as compared to 24.5% in 2014. excluding the $2.6 million tax benefit associated with the pretax restructuring charges and operational improvement initiatives, the $6.2 million benefit associated with acquisition related costs, the $10.5 million tax settlement received in 2015 due to favorable tax rulings in spain and
41
another jurisdiction as well as the $2.9 million charge related to the reversal of the previously recorded provision for the spanish capital tax case, the adjusted tax rate for 2015 was 24.2%. excluding the $2.6 million tax benefit associated with the pretax restructuring charges and operational improvement initiative costs as well as the $3.8 million tax benefit related to the reserve reversal for the 2001 spanish dividend withholding tax case, the adjusted tax rate for 2014 was 25.3%. the year-over-year reduction reflected a benefit from lower cost of repatriation and loss provisions which were partially offset by mix of earnings.
liquidity and capital resources cash and cash equivalents we had cash and cash equivalents of $324.0 million at december 31, 2016 compared to $182.0 million at december 31, 2015, of which $252.6 million of the balance at december 31, 2016 was held outside the united states. cash balances held in foreign jurisdictions are, in most circumstances, available to be repatriated to the united states; however, they would be subject to united states federal income taxes, less applicable foreign tax credits. we have not provided u.s. income tax expense on substantially all of the accumulated undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries because we have the ability and plan to reinvest these indefinitely.
effective utilization of the cash generated by our international operations is a critical component of our tax strategy. strategic dividend repatriation from foreign subsidiaries creates u.s. taxable income, which enables us to realize u.s. deferred tax assets. we regularly repatriate, in the form of dividends from our non-u.s. subsidiaries, a portion of our current year earnings to fund financial obligations in the u.s. these repatriations of current year earnings totaled $134.5 million, $184.6 million and $248.0 million in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.
cash flows from operating activities operating cash flows in 2016 were $535.4 million compared to $433.6 million in 2015 and $518.4 million in 2014. the increase in operating cash flows in 2016 as compared to 2015 is principally related to the impact of decreased core working capital requirements (trade receivables, inventories and accounts payable) and lower pension contributions. included in 2014 was payment of $11.2 million to the spanish government related to a capital tax case.
working capital (current assets less current liabilities) totaled $710.7 million at year-end 2016 compared to $712.0 million at december 31, 2015. this slight decrease in working capital of $1.3 million primarily reflects an increase in payable balances principally associated with short-term debt which were partially offset by increased cash balances as a result of our borrowings under the euro senior notes - 2016. we sold certain accounts receivable on a non-recourse basis to unrelated financial institutions under "factoring" agreements that are sponsored, solely and individually, by certain customers. we believe that participating in the factoring programs strengthens our relationships with these customers and provides operational efficiencies. we estimate that, as a result of participating in the programs, there was a beneficial impact on cash provided by operations of approximately $34.0 million, $3.4 million and $33.1 million in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. the cost of participating in these programs was immaterial to our results in all periods.
cash flows used in investing activities net investing activities in 2016 utilized $355.5 million compared to $577.2 million and $221.3 million in 2015 and 2014, respectively. the decrease in cash paid for investing activities is primarily driven by the acquisition of david michael in 2016 for approximately $236.9 million (net of cash acquired) as compared to the acquisitions of ottens flavors and lucas meyer for approximately $188.5 million (net of cash acquired) and $305.1 million (net of cash acquired), respectively, in 2015. the 2014 amount was principally driven by the acquisition of aromor for approximately $102.5 million (net of cash acquired).
additions to property, plant and equipment were $126.4 million, $101.0 million and $143.2 million in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively (net of grants and other reimbursements from government authorities). these investments largely arise from our ongoing focus to align our manufacturing facilities with our customer demand, primarily in emerging markets and new technology consistent with our strategy.
in light of our intent to construct a new flavors facility in china, our relocation of our ingredients facility in hangzhou, china and the continuation of our indonesia project we expect that capital spending in 2017 will be about 5% of sales (net of potential grants and other reimbursements from government authorities).
cash flows used in financing activities net financing activities in 2016 utilized $19.7 million compared to $131.3 million and $202.3 million in 2015 and 2014, respectively. the decrease in outflow of cash used in financing activities in 2016 as compared to 2015 principally reflects borrowings under the euro senior notes - 2016 which were offset by repayment of our senior notes - 2006 as well as higher
42
dividend payments and treasury share repurchases in 2016. the decrease in outflow of cash used in financing activities in 2015 compared to 2014 principally reflected incremental dividend payments and treasury share repurchases in 2015 which were more than offset by proceeds from the drawdown on the revolving credit facility during 2015.
at december 31, 2016, we had $1,325.4 million of debt outstanding compared to $1,067.7 million outstanding at december 31, 2015.
we paid dividends totaling $184.9 million, $158.9 million and $133.2 million in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. the cash dividend declared per share in 2016, 2015 and 2014 was $2.40, $2.06 and $1.72, respectively.
in december 2012, the board of directors authorized a $250 million share repurchase program, which commenced in the first quarter of 2013. in august 2015, the board of directors approved an additional $250 million share repurchase authorization and extension through december 31, 2017. based on the total remaining amount of $109 million available under the repurchase program, approximately 0.9 million shares, or 1.2% of shares outstanding (based on the market price and shares outstanding as of december 31, 2016) could be repurchased under the program as of december 31, 2016. the purchases will be made from time to time on the open market or through private transactions as market and business conditions warrant. repurchased shares will be placed into treasury stock. the ultimate level of purchases will be a function of the daily purchase limits established in the pre-approved program according to the share price at that time.
capital resources operating cash flow provides the primary source of funds for capital investment needs, dividends paid to shareholders and debt service repayments. we anticipate that cash flows from operations and availability under our existing credit facilities are sufficient to meet our investing and financing needs for at least the next eighteen months. we regularly assess our capital structure, including both current and long-term debt instruments, as compared to our cash generation and investment needs in order to provide ample flexibility and to optimize our leverage ratios. based on our leverage ratios and general market interest rate expectations, we anticipate evaluating refinancing opportunities during 2017. we believe our existing cash balances are sufficient to meet our debt service requirements.
during the first quarter of 2017, we acquired fragrance resources for approximately $143.3 million (net of cash acquired), which was funded from existing resources.
during the fourth quarter of 2016, we acquired david michael for approximately $236.9 million (net of cash acquired), which was funded from existing resources.
during the third quarter of 2015, we acquired lucas meyer for approximately $305.1 million (net of cash acquired), which was funded from existing resources.
during the second quarter of 2015, we acquired ottens flavors for approximately $188.5 million (net of cash acquired), which was funded from existing resources.
credit facility and senior notes we supplement short-term liquidity with access to capital markets, mainly through bank credit facilities and issuance of commercial paper.
commercial paper during 2016, we issued approximately $65 million of commercial paper, which was fully repaid by december 31, 2016. as of december 31, 2016, there was no commercial paper outstanding. we did not issue commercial paper during 2015.
subsequent to december 31, 2016, we issued approximately $87.5 million of commercial paper.
credit facility there are two tranches under the credit facility. tranche a of the facility is now available to borrowers in u.s. dollars, euros, swiss francs, japanese yen and british sterling in an aggregate amount up to an equivalent of approximately $564.1 million, with a sublimit of $25 million for swing line borrowings. tranche b of the facility is now available to borrowers in u.s. dollars, euros, swiss francs, japanese yen and british sterling in an aggregate amount up to an equivalent of approximately $385.9 million, with sublimits of €50 million and $25 million for swing line borrowings.
the credit facility is available for general corporate purposes. borrowings under the credit facility bear interest at an annual rate of libor plus a margin, currently 112.5 bps, linked to our credit rating. the interest rate under our credit facility at
43
december 31, 2016 was 1.13%. the credit facility contains various affirmative and negative covenants, including the requirement for us to maintain, at the end of each fiscal quarter, a ratio of net debt for borrowed money to adjusted ebitda in respect of the previous 12-month period of not more than 3.50 to 1. based on this ratio, at december 31, 2016 our covenant compliance would provide overall borrowing capacity of $1,647.3 million.
during the first quarter of 2016, the company repaid the full amount outstanding under the credit facility ($131.2 million).
as of december 31, 2016 we had no borrowings under the credit facility. the amount which we are able to draw down on under the credit facility is limited by financial covenants as described in more detail below. our drawdown capacity on the credit facility was $950 million at december 31, 2016. see note 9 to the consolidated financial statements for further information on the credit facility.
at december 31, 2016 and 2015 we were in compliance with all financial and other covenants, including the net debt to adjusted ebitda ratio. at december 31, 2016 our net debt/adjusted ebitda(1) ratio was 1.32 to 1 as defined by the credit facility, well below the financial covenants of existing outstanding debt. failure to comply with the financial and other covenants under our debt agreements would constitute default and would allow the lenders to accelerate the maturity of all indebtedness under the related agreement. if such acceleration were to occur, we would not have sufficient liquidity available to repay the indebtedness. we would likely have to seek amendments under the agreements for relief from the financial covenants or repay the debt with proceeds from the issuance of new debt or equity, and/or asset sales, if necessary. we may be unable to amend the agreements or raise sufficient capital to repay such obligations in the event the maturities are accelerated.
_______________________
(1)   adjusted ebitda and net debt, which are non-gaap measures used for these covenants, are calculated in accordance with the definition in the debt agreements. in this context, these measures are used solely to provide information on the extent to which we are in compliance with debt covenants and may not be comparable to adjusted ebitda and net debt used by other companies. reconciliations of adjusted ebitda to net income and net debt to total debt are as follows:

other commitments compliance with existing governmental requirements regulating the discharge of materials into the environment has not materially affected our operations, earnings or competitive position. in 2016 and 2015, we spent $4.6 million and $9.3 million on capital projects and $16.0 million and $19.0 million, respectively, in operating expenses and governmental charges for the purpose of complying with such regulations. expenditures for these purposes will continue for the foreseeable future. in addition, we are party to a number of proceedings brought under the comprehensive environmental response, compensation and liability act or similar state statutes. it is expected that the impact of any judgments in or voluntary settlements of such proceedings will not be material to our financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.

critical accounting policies and use of estimates our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements. as disclosed in note 1, the preparation of financial statements in conformity with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles ("gaap") requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts and accompanying disclosures. these estimates are based on management's best judgment of current events and actions that we may undertake in the future. actual results may ultimately differ from these estimates.
those areas requiring the greatest degree of management judgment or deemed most critical to our financial reporting involve:
the periodic assessment of potential impairment of goodwill. we currently have goodwill of $1.0 billion. in assessing the potential for impairment of goodwill, management uses the most current actual and forecasted operating data available and current market based assumptions in accordance with the criteria in asc 350. the company has identified four reporting units: (1) flavors, (2) fragrance compounds (3) fragrance ingredients and (4) cosmetic active ingredients.
the company performed the annual goodwill impairment test, utilizing the two-step approach for the flavors, fragrance compounds, fragrance ingredients and cosmetic active ingredients reporting units, by assessing the fair value of our reporting units based on discounted cash flows. we completed our annual goodwill impairment test as of november 30, 2016, which indicated no impairment of goodwill, as the estimated fair values substantially exceeded the carrying values of each of these reporting units.
the periodic assessment of potential impairment of finite-lived intangible assets. we currently have intangible assets of $365.8 million. the company reviews long-lived assets for impairment when events or changes in business conditions indicate that their full carrying value may not be recovered. an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows produced by an asset or group of assets is compared to the carrying value to determine whether impairment exists. if assets are determined to be impaired, the loss is measured based on an estimate of fair value using various valuation techniques, including a discounted estimate of future cash flows.
the analysis and evaluation of income taxes. we account for taxes under the asset and liability method. under this method, deferred income taxes are recognized for temporary differences between the financial statement and tax return bases of assets and liabilities. a valuation allowance is recognized if, based on the weight of available evidence, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. the assessment of the need for a valuation allowance requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future earnings, reversal of existing temporary differences and available tax planning strategies. if actual experience differs from these estimates and assumptions, the recorded deferred tax asset may not be fully realized resulting in an increase to income tax expense in our results of operations.
the company has not established deferred tax liabilities for substantially all undistributed foreign earnings as it has plans to and intends to indefinitely reinvest those earnings to finance foreign activities. the unrecognized deferred tax liability on these undistributed earnings approximates $344 million.
we are subject to income taxes in the u.s. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. significant judgment is required in evaluating our uncertain tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes. we first determine whether it is "more likely than not" that we would sustain our tax position if the relevant tax authority were to audit the position with full knowledge of all the relevant facts and other information. for those tax positions that meet this threshold, we measure the amount of tax benefit based on the largest amount of tax benefit that we have a greater than 50% chance of realizing in a final settlement with the relevant authority. those tax positions failing to qualify for initial recognition are recognized in the first interim period in which they meet the more likely than not standard. this evaluation is made at the time that we adopt a tax position and whenever there is new information and is based upon management's evaluation of the facts, circumstances and information available at the reporting date. we maintain a cumulative risk portfolio relating to all of our uncertainties in income taxes in order to perform this analysis, but the evaluation of our tax positions requires significant judgment and estimation in part because, in certain cases, tax law is subject to varied interpretation, and whether a tax position will ultimately be sustained may be uncertain. we do not currently believe that any of our pending tax assessments, even if ultimately resolved against us, would have a material impact on our results of operations and cash flows.
the evaluation of potential litigation and environmental liabilities, where changing circumstances, rules and regulations require regular reassessment of related practices and anticipated costs. we are subject to certain legal claims regarding products and other matters, as well as environmental-related matters. significant management judgment is involved in determining when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the extent to which it can be reasonably estimated.
we regularly assess potential liabilities with respect to all legal claims based on the most recent available information, in consultation with outside counsel we have engaged on our behalf to handle the defense of such matters. to the extent a liability is considered to be probable and reasonably estimable, we recognize a corresponding liability; if the reasonably estimated liability is a range, we recognize that amount considered most likely, or in the absence of such a determination, the minimum
46
reasonably estimated liability. to the extent such claims are covered by various insurance policies, we separately evaluate the right to recovery and estimate the related insurance claim receivable. management judgments involve determination as to whether a liability has been incurred, the reasonably estimated amount of that liability, and any potential insurance recovery.
we regularly evaluate potential environmental exposure in terms of total estimated cost and the viability of other potentially responsible parties ("prp's") associated with our exposure. recorded liabilities are adjusted periodically as remediation efforts progress and additional information becomes available. critical management assumptions relate to expected total costs to remediate and the financial viability of prp's to share such costs.
determination of the various assumptions employed in the valuation of pension and retiree health care expense and associated obligations. amounts recognized in the consolidated financial statements related to pension and other postretirement benefits are determined from actuarial valuations. inherent in such valuations are assumptions including expected return on plan assets, discount rates at which the liabilities could be settled, rates of increase in future compensation levels, mortality rates and health care cost trend rates. these assumptions are updated annually and are disclosed in note 14 to the consolidated financial statements. in accordance with gaap, actual results that differ from the assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and, therefore, affect expense recognized and obligations recorded in future periods.
we consider a number of factors in determining and selecting assumptions for the overall expected long-term rate of return on plan assets. we consider the historical long-term return experience of our assets, the current and expected allocation of our plan assets, and expected long-term rates of return. we derive these expected long-term rates of return with the assistance of our investment advisors. we base our expected allocation of plan assets on a diversified portfolio consisting of domestic and international equity securities, fixed income, real estate, and alternative asset classes.
we consider a variety of factors in determining and selecting our assumptions for the discount rate at december 31. for the u.s. plans, the discount rate was based on the internal rate of return for a portfolio of high quality bonds rated aa or higher by either moody's or standard & poor's with maturities that are consistent with the projected future benefit payment obligations of the plan. for the non-u.s. plans, the discount rates were determined by region and are based on high quality long-term corporate bonds. consideration has been given to the duration of the liabilities in each plan when selecting the bonds to be used in determining the discount rate. the rate of compensation increase for all plans and the medical cost trend rate for the applicable u.s. plans are based on plan experience.
with respect to the u.s. plans, the expected rate of return on plan assets was determined based on an asset allocation model using the current target allocation, real rates of return by asset class and an anticipated inflation rate. the target asset allocation consists of approximately: 40% in equity securities and 60% in fixed income securities. the plan has achieved a compounded annual rate of return of 6.3% over the previous 20 years. at december 31, 2016, the actual asset allocation for the u.s. plan was: 36% in equity securities and 64% in fixed income securities.
the expected rate of return for the non-u.s. plans employs a similar set of criteria adapted for local investments, inflation rates and in certain cases specific government requirements. the target asset allocation, for the non-u.s. plans, consists of approximately: 40% - 70% in fixed income securities; 15% - 40% in equity securities; 5% - 20% in real estate; and 5% - 10% in alternative investments. at december 31, 2016, the actual asset allocation for the non-u.s. plan was: 56% in fixed income investments; 27% in equity investments; 5% in real estate investments, 2% in cash and cash equivalents and 10% in alternative investments.
changes in pension and other post-employment benefits, and associated expenses, may occur in the future due to changes in these assumptions. the impact that a 0.25% decrease in the discount rate or a 1% change in the medical cost trend rate would have on our pension and other post-employment benefit expense, as applicable, is as follows:

the ongoing assessment of the valuation of inventory, given the large number of natural ingredients employed, the quality of which may be diminished over time. we hold a majority of our inventory as raw materials, providing the greatest degree of flexibility in manufacture and use. as of december 31, 2016, we maintained 49% of our inventory as raw materials. materials are evaluated based on shelf life, known uses and anticipated demand based on forecasted customer order activity and changes in product/sales mix. management policy provides for an ongoing assessment of inventory with adjustments recorded when an item is deemed to be slow moving or obsolete.
we believe that we have considered relevant circumstances that we may be currently subject to, and the financial statements accurately reflect our best estimate of the impact of these items in our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows for the years presented. we have discussed the decision process and selection of these critical accounting policies with the audit committee of the board of directors.
new accounting standards in january 2017, the financial accounting standards board ("fasb") issued amendments to the business combination guidance which clarifies the definition of a business in order to assist companies when evaluating whether transactions should be accounted for as acquisitions or disposals of assets or businesses. this guidance will be effective prospectively for annual and interim periods beginning after december 15, 2017. this guidance may have an impact on accounting for future acquisitions.
in january 2017, the fasb issued an amendment to the goodwill impairment guidance which eliminates step 2 from the goodwill impairment test. this guidance will be effective for fiscal years beginning after december 15, 2019. early adoption is permitted. the company plans to adopt this guidance in accordance with its existing annual impairment review policy in fiscal year 2017. the company does not expect this adoption to have an impact on its consolidated financial statements.
in october 2016, the fasb issued authoritative guidance which allows for the immediate recognition of current and deferred income tax impact on intra-entity asset transfers, excluding inventory. this guidance will be effective for fiscal years beginning after december 15, 2017. early adoption is only permitted as of the beginning of an annual reporting period. this guidance must be adopted using a modified retrospective transition. the company plans to adopt this guidance in the first quarter of fiscal year 2017 and accordingly, will record a cumulative-effect adjustment directly to retained earnings of approximately $47 million.
in august 2016, the fasb issued authoritative guidance which requires changes to the classification of certain activities within the statement of cash flows. this guidance will be effective for annual and interim periods beginning after december 15, 2017. early adoption will be permitted for all entities. the company does not expect this adoption to have a significant impact on its statement of cash flows.
in march 2016, the fasb issued authoritative guidance which requires changes to several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment transactions, including the treatment of income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, and classification of certain items on the statement of cash flows. this guidance will be effective for annual and interim periods beginning after december 15, 2016. the standard requires that employee taxes paid when an employer withholds shares be presented in the consolidated statement of cash flows as a financing activity instead of an operating activity. the company expects to adopt this change retroactively and that the impact of this aspect of the standard on the consolidated statement of cash flows will be approximately $13-$25 million on an annual basis. in addition, the standard requires that excess tax benefits presented in the consolidated statement of cash flows be classified as an operating activity instead of a financing activity. the company expects to adopt this change retroactively and that the impact of this aspect of the standard on the consolidated statement of cash flows will be approximately $5-$12 million on an annual basis. the standard also requires all excess tax benefits/deficiencies be recognized as income tax expense/benefit in the income statement to be applied on a prospective basis. depending on the future volatility of the stock price, the impact of this aspect of the standard could have a material impact on tax expense on its consolidated statement of income and comprehensive income. additionally, the standard allows the company to make an entity-wide accounting policy election to either estimate the number of awards that are expected to vest or account for forfeitures as they occur. the company plans to continue to account for forfeitures using an estimate of awards expected to be forfeited. lastly, the standard requires that the threshold for equity classification of awards permits withholding up to the maximum statutory tax rates in the applicable jurisdictions. the adoption of this aspect of the standard will impact future vestings.
in february 2016, the fasb issued authoritative guidance which requires changes to the accounting for leases. the new guidance establishes a new lease accounting model, that requires entities to record assets and liabilities related to leases on the balance sheet for certain types of leases. the guidance will be effective for annual and interim periods beginning after december 31, 2018. early adoption will be permitted for all entities. the company expects the adoption of this guidance will
48
result in significant increases to assets and liabilities on its consolidated balance sheet and is still evaluating the impact on its consolidated statement of income and comprehensive income.
in september 2015, the fasb issued authoritative guidance related to the adjustments made during the measurement period for items in a business combination. specifically, the new guidance requires adjustments related to the finalization of estimates to be recorded in the period when they are determined and to provide certain additional disclosures. this guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after december 15, 2015. the company adopted this guidance during 2016 and the adoption did not have a significant impact on its consolidated financial statements.
in may 2015, the fasb issued authoritative guidance which removed the requirement to categorize within the fair value hierarchy investments for which fair values are estimated using the net asset value practical expedient. the company has adopted this guidance for the year ended december 31, 2016 and has reclassified prior year amounts for the year ended december 31, 2015 as disclosed in note 14 to the consolidated financial statements.
in april 2015, the fasb issued authoritative guidance which requires that debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability. this guidance is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after december 15, 2015. the company adopted this guidance retrospectively in 2016 and accordingly has reclassified all debt issuance costs on long-term debt as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of the debt liability in the consolidated balance sheet as of december 31, 2015. the adoption of this guidance did not have a significant impact on its consolidated financial statements.
in may 2014, the fasb issued authoritative guidance that provides for a comprehensive model to be used in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers. under this standard, revenue will be recognized to depict the transfer of goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. this guidance is applicable to all entities and is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after december 15, 2017. adoption as of the original effective date is permitted. accordingly, the company is required to adopt this standard in the first quarter of fiscal year 2018. companies have the option to apply the new guidance under a retrospective approach to each prior reporting period presented or a modified retrospective approach with the cumulative effect of initially applying the new guidance recognized at the date of initial application within the consolidated balance sheet. the company is evaluating the impact of the new standard, including updates to the standard that have been proposed by the fasb. in particular, the company has reviewed the nature of its larger customer relationships and is in the process of reviewing the nature of potential regional variations in all aspects of its customer base regardless of size. based on the work performed to date, the company expects to conduct further review and analysis of certain areas that may lead to changes in the manner in which the company recognizes revenue, including the customized nature of the product, consignment arrangements, rebates, upfront costs, shipping terms and documentation other than formal contracts. as a result, the financial statement impact has not yet been determined. the company is also currently evaluating the method of adoption and the potential impacts to the consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.
non-gaap financial measures the company uses non-gaap financial operating measures in this quarterly report, including: (i) currency neutral sales (which eliminates the effects that result from translating its international sales in u.s. dollars), (ii) adjusted gross profit and adjusted gross margin (which exclude acquisition-related costs, operational improvement initiative costs and restructuring charges) (iii) adjusted operating profit and adjusted operating margin (which excludes legal charges/credits, acquisition-related costs, operational improvement initiative costs, restructuring charges and gains on sale of assets), (iv) adjusted selling and administrative expenses (which excludes legal charges/credits, acquisition-related costs, operational improvement initiative costs and restructuring charges) and (v) adjusted effective tax rate (which excludes legal charges/credits, acquisition-related costs, operational improvement initiative costs, restructuring charges and gains on the sale of assets). the company also provides the non-gaap measures adjusted ebitda (which excludes certain specified items and non-cash items as set forth in the company's debt agreements) and net debt (which is adjusted for deferred gain on interest rate swaps and cash and cash equivalents) solely for the purpose of providing information on the extent to which the company is in compliance with debt covenants contained in its debt agreements.
we have included each of these non-gaap measures in order to provide additional information regarding our underlying operating results and comparable year-over-year performance. such information is supplemental to information presented in accordance with gaap and is not intended to represent a presentation in accordance with gaap. in discussing our historical and expected future results and financial condition, we believe it is meaningful for investors to be made aware of and to be assisted in a better understanding of, on a period-to-period comparable basis, financial amounts both including and excluding these identified items, as well as the impact of exchange rate fluctuations. we believe such additional non-gaap information provides investors with an overall perspective of the period-to-period performance of our business. in addition, management internally reviews each of these non-gaap measures to evaluate performance on a comparative period-to-period basis in terms
49
of absolute performance, trends and expected future performance with respect to our business. a material limitation of these non-gaap measures is that such measures do not reflect actual gaap amounts. we compensate for such limitations by using these measures as one of several metrics, including gaap measures. these non-gaap measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies.

•   average revenue per paying user ("arppu") - is direct revenue from members in the relevant measurement period (whether in the form of subscription payments or à la carte payments) divided by the average pmc in such period divided by the number of calendar days in such period. this definition has been updated in the fourth quarter of 2016 to exclude non-subscriber direct revenue and previously reported arppu has been adjusted to conform to this definition.

•   acquisition-related contingent consideration fair value adjustments - relate to the portion of the purchase price (of certain acquisitions) that is contingent upon the future operating performance of the acquired company. the amounts ultimately paid are generally dependent upon earnings performance and/or operating metrics as stipulated in the relevant purchase agreements. the fair value of the liability is estimated at the date of acquisition and adjusted each reporting period until the liability is settled. if the payment date of the liability is longer than one year, the amount is initially recorded net of a discount, which is amortized as an expense each period. in a period where the acquired company is expected to perform better than the previous estimate, the liability will be increased resulting in additional expense; and in a period when the acquired company is expected to perform worse than the previous estimate, the liability will be decreased resulting in income. the year-over-year impact can be significant, for example, if there is income in one period and expense in the other period.

management overview iac is a leading media and internet company comprised of widely known consumer brands, such as homeadvisor, vimeo, dictionary.com, the daily beast, investopedia, and match group's online dating portfolio, which includes match, tinder, plentyoffish and okcupid.
sources of revenue match group's dating revenue is primarily derived directly from users in the form of recurring membership fees, which typically provide unlimited access to a bundle of features for a specific period of time, and the balances from à la carte features, where users pay a fee for a specific action or event; with additional revenue generated from online advertisers who pay to reach our large audiences. non-dating revenue is primarily earned from fees received directly from students for in-person and online test preparation classes, access to online test preparation materials and individual tutoring services.
homeadvisor's revenue is derived primarily from fees paid by members of its network of home services professionals for consumer leads and memberships.
a significant portion of the revenue from our applications and publishing segments is derived from online advertising, most of which is attributable to our services agreement with google inc. ("google"). the company's service agreement became effective on april 1, 2016, following the expiration of the previous services agreement. the services agreement expires on march 31, 2020; however, the company may choose to terminate the agreement effective march 31, 2019. the services agreement requires that we comply with certain guidelines promulgated by google. google may generally unilaterally update its policies and guidelines without advance notice; which could in turn require modifications to, or prohibit and/or render obsolete certain of our products, services and/or business practices, which could be costly to address or otherwise have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. for the years ended december 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, revenue earned from google was $824.4 million, $1.3 billion and $1.4 billion, respectively. for the years ended december 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, google revenue represents 87% and 73%; 94% and 83%; and 97% and 83%, of applications and publishing revenue, respectively.
the revenue earned by our video segment is derived from media production and distribution, subscriptions and advertising.
shoebuy's revenue was derived principally from merchandise sales. pricerunner's revenue was derived principally from advertising.
strategic partnerships, advertiser relationships and online advertising a meaningful portion of the company's revenue is attributable to the services agreement with google described above. for the years ended december 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, revenue earned from google represents 26%, 40% and 45%, respectively, of our consolidated revenue.
we pay traffic acquisition costs, which consist of payments made to partners who distribute our partnerships customized browser-based applications, integrate our paid listings into their websites and fees related to the distribution and facilitation of in-app purchases of product features. we also pay to market and distribute our services on third-party distribution channels, such as search engines and social media websites. in addition, some of our businesses manage affiliate programs, pursuant to which we pay commissions and fees to third parties based on revenue earned. these distribution channels might also offer their own products and services, as well as those of other third parties, which compete with those we offer.
we market and offer our products and services directly to consumers through branded websites and subscriptions, allowing consumers to transact directly with us in a convenient manner. we have made, and expect to continue to make, substantial investments in online and offline advertising to build our brands and drive traffic to our websites and consumers and advertisers to our businesses.
the cost of acquiring new consumers through online and offline third-party distribution channels has increased, particularly in the case of online channels, as internet commerce continues to grow and competition in the markets in which iac's businesses operate increases.
2016 developments during 2016, the company:
33
•   repurchased 6.3 million shares of common stock at an average price of $49.98 per share, or $315.3 million in aggregate; and
•   redeemed and repurchased $109.8 million of its 2013 senior notes and repurchased $16.6 million of its 2012 senior notes.
on december 30, 2016, shoebuy, which was part of the other segment, was sold for approximately $70.0 million resulting in a pre-tax gain of $37.5 million.
on december 8, 2016, match group made a $40 million principal payment on the match group term loan. in addition, the remaining outstanding balance of $350 million was repriced at libor plus 3.25%, with a libor floor of 0.75%. the previous interest charged on the match group term loan was libor plus 4.50%, with a libor floor of 1.00%.
on november 3, 2016, homeadvisor acquired a controlling interest in myhammer holding ag ("myhammer"), the leading home services marketplace in germany.
on june 30, 2016, askfm, which was part of the publishing segment, was sold resulting in a pre-tax loss of $3.8 million.
on june 1, 2016, match group issued $400 million aggregate principal amount of 6.375% senior notes due june 1, 2024. the proceeds were used to prepay a portion of the match group term loan.
on may 2, 2016, vimeo, which is part of the video segment, acquired vhx, a platform for premium over-the-top subscription video channels.
on march 18, 2016, pricerunner, which was part of the other segment, was sold for $96.6 million resulting in a pre-tax gain of $12.0 million.
2016 consolidated results in 2016, the company's revenue decreased 3% and operating income declined $212.2 million to a loss of $32.6 million; however, the company delivered 3% adjusted ebitda growth. revenue declined due primarily to significant decreases from publishing and applications, partially offset by strong growth at match group and homeadvisor. the operating income decline, despite higher adjusted ebitda, was due primarily to increases of $261.3 million in goodwill impairment charges, $9.5 million in depreciation and a change of $18.0 million in acquisition-related contingent consideration fair value adjustments, partially offset by a decrease of $60.5 million in amortization of intangibles. the increase in goodwill impairment charges is due to the write-off of goodwill of $275.4 million at publishing in the current year period compared to the write-off of goodwill of $14.1 million at shoebuy in the prior year period. the change in acquisition-related contingent consideration fair value adjustments reflects expense in the current year period of $2.6 million versus income of $15.5 million in the prior year period. the decrease in amortization of intangibles was due primarily to a reduction in impairment charges during the year. the company recorded in 2016 an impairment charge of $11.6 million compared to an impairment charge in 2015 of $88.0 million all related to certain publishing indefinite-lived trade names. the adjusted ebitda increase was primarily driven by strong growth from match group and homeadvisor and reduced losses from video, partially offset by declines of $95.4 million and $52.0 million from publishing and applications, respectively.

for the year ended december 31, 2016 compared to the year ended december 31, 2015
match group revenue increased 20% driven by a 23% increase in dating revenue attributable to higher average pmc at both north america and international, up 22% and 46%, respectively, due primarily to growth in paying members at tinder and the contribution from the 2015 acquisition of plentyoffish. this revenue growth was partially offset by a 6% decline in arppu. north america and international arppu decreased 5% and 7%, respectively, due primarily to the continued mix shift towards lower arppu brands, including tinder and plentyoffish, which have lower price points compared to match group's more established brands. north america arppu decline was partially offset by an increase in mix-adjusted rates. non-dating revenue decreased 6% reflecting fewer in-person sat test preparation courses and in-person tutoring sessions, partially offset by an increase in online and self-paced services.
homeadvisor revenue increased 38% due primarily to 44% growth at the domestic business and 18% growth at the international business. domestic revenue growth was driven by a 41% increase in paying sps and a 34% increase in service requests. international revenue growth was driven by organic growth across all regions as well as the acquisition of a controlling interest in myhammer on november 3, 2016.
video revenue increased 7% due primarily to growth at electus, vimeo and daily burn, partially offset by lower revenue from iac films as the prior year benefited from the release of the movie while we're young.
applications revenue decreased 21% due to a 39% decline in partnerships and a 12% decline in consumer. partnerships revenue decreased due primarily to the loss of certain partners. the consumer decline was driven by lower search revenue from our downloadable desktop applications due primarily to lower monetization, partially offset by strong growth at apalon and slimware, which together comprised 12% of total applications revenue in 2016.
35
publishing revenue decreased 41% due to 54% lower ask & other revenue and 25% lower premium brands revenue. ask & other revenue decreased due to a decline in revenue at ask.com primarily as a result of the new google contract, which became effective april 1, 2016, as well as declines from certain other legacy businesses. premium brands revenue decreased due primarily to declines in paid search traffic at about.com, mainly attributable to the new google contract, partially offset by strong growth at investopedia and the daily beast.
other revenue decreased 3% due to the sale of pricerunner on march 18, 2016, partially offset by growth at shoebuy.
for the year ended december 31, 2015 compared to the year ended december 31, 2014
match group revenue increased 15%, or 20% excluding the effects of foreign exchange, driven by a 9% increase in dating revenue attributable to 8% growth in direct revenue. direct revenue growth was primarily driven by higher average pmc at both north america and international, up 13% and 31%, respectively, due mainly to tinder, partially offset by 9% lower arppu due to brand mix shifts and foreign exchange effects. excluding foreign exchange effects, total dating revenue and international direct revenue would have increased 15% and 21%, respectively. non-dating revenue increased 114% principally due to the full year contribution from the princeton review, which was acquired on august 1, 2014.
see "iac's principles of financial reporting" for a discussion and reconciliation of effects of foreign exchange on match group revenue.
homeadvisor revenue increased 27% due primarily to 43% growth at the domestic business, partially offset by international declines due primarily to the restructuring of certain european operations in the fourth quarter of 2014. domestic revenue growth was driven by 49% higher service requests and a 46% increase in paying sps.
video revenue grew 17% due primarily to strong growth at vimeo, daily burn and electus.
applications revenue decreased 2% due to a 27% decline in partnerships, partially offset by 16% growth in consumer. consumer growth was driven by higher revenue from our downloadable desktop applications, including slimware, and a full year contribution from apalon, our mobile applications business, which was acquired on november 3, 2014.
publishing revenue decreased 13% due to 31% lower ask & other revenue, partially offset by 29% higher premium brands revenue. ask & other revenue decreased primarily to a decline in revenue at ask.com and certain legacy businesses. premium brands revenue increased due primarily to strong growth at about.com and investopedia.
other revenue decreased 2% due to lower revenue at pricerunner.

for the year ended december 31, 2016 compared to the year ended december 31, 2015
cost of revenue in 2016 decreased from 2015 due to decreases of $54.7 million from applications and $47.0 million from publishing, partially offset by increases of $56.0 million from match group, $12.4 million from other and $7.7 million from video.
•   the applications decrease was due primarily to a reduction of $52.0 million in traffic acquisition costs driven by a decline in revenue at partnerships.
•   the publishing decrease was due primarily to reductions of $40.0 million in traffic acquisition costs and $4.6 million in content costs driven by a decline in revenue at ask.com and certain legacy businesses, partially offset by $9.2 million in restructuring charges in the current year period related to vacating a data center facility and severance costs in connection with a reduction in workforce.
36
•   the match group increase was due primarily to a significant increase in in-app purchase fees across multiple brands, including tinder, and the 2015 acquisitions of plentyoffish and eureka, partially offset by a mix shift to higher margin online products from in-person courses at non-dating.
•   the other increase was due primarily to an increase in cost of products sold at shoebuy due to increased sales, partially offset by the sale of pricerunner.
•   the video increase was due primarily to a net increase in production costs at our media and video businesses and an increase in hosting fees related to vimeo's subscription growth, increased video plays and expanded on demand catalog. these increases were partially offset by a reduction in investment in content costs at vimeo in 2016.
for the year ended december 31, 2015 compared to the year ended december 31, 2014
cost of revenue in 2015 decreased from 2014 due to decreases of $87.8 million from publishing and $65.3 million from applications, partially offset by increases of $58.0 million from match group and $10.4 million from video.
•   the publishing decrease was due primarily to a reduction of $87.1 million in traffic acquisition costs at ask &amp; other driven primarily by a decline in revenue at ask.com.
•   the applications decrease was due primarily to a reduction of $72.2 million in traffic acquisition costs driven by a decline in revenue at partnerships.
•   the match group increase was due primarily to a significant increase in in-app purchase fees given that its native mobile apps were largely introduced in the second quarter of 2014, the full year contribution from the acquisition of the princeton review and higher hosting fees driven by growth in users and product features.
•   the video increase was due primarily to increases in hosting fees and content costs related to vimeo's expanded on demand catalog.

selling and marketing expense in 2016 decreased from 2015 due to decreases of $130.2 million from publishing, $40.1 million from applications and $11.3 million from video, partially offset by an increase of $81.5 million from homeadvisor.
•   the publishing decrease was due primarily to a reduction of $132.6 million in online marketing, resulting from a decline in revenue, partially offset by $3.1 million in restructuring charges in the current year period related to severance costs in connection with a reduction in workforce.
•   the applications decrease was due primarily to a decline of $37.5 million in online marketing, principally related to lower anticipated search revenue from our downloadable desktop applications at consumer.
•   the video decrease was due primarily to a reduction of $8.9 million in online marketing driven primarily by vimeo.
•   the homeadvisor increase was due primarily to higher online and offline marketing of $51.2 million and an increase of $27.2 million in compensation due primarily to an increase in the sales force at the domestic business.

•   the homeadvisor increase was due primarily to increases of $41.5 million in offline and online marketing and $19.1 million in compensation due, in part, to an increase in the sales force at the domestic business.
•   the publishing increase was due primarily to an increase of $54.8 million in online marketing across premium brands, including about.com, partially offset by declines at ask.com.
•   the applications increase was due primarily to an increase of $38.1 million in online marketing, which was primarily related to a significant increase in new downloadable desktop applications at consumer.

general and administrative expense in 2016 increased from 2015 due to increases of $21.8 million from homeadvisor, $10.5 million from applications, $4.7 million from video and $3.3 million from match group, partially offset by decreases of $14.1 million from publishing and $3.3 million from corporate.
•   the homeadvisor increase was due primarily to higher compensation due, in part, to increased headcount at the domestic business, an increase in bad debt expense due to higher domestic revenue and $2.1 million in transaction-related costs in the current year period.
•   the applications increase was due primarily to a change of $13.8 million in acquisition-related contingent consideration fair value adjustments, which was due to expense of $12.0 million in the current year period versus income of $1.8 million in the prior year period, partially offset by a decrease in compensation due, in part, to a decrease in headcount related to a reduction in workforce that took place in the first half of 2016.
•   the video increase was due primarily to the inclusion in the prior year of income of $2.6 million in acquisition-related contingent consideration fair value adjustments and higher compensation due, in part, to an increase in headcount at vimeo.
•   the match group increase was due primarily to an increase of $5.3 million in compensation, an increase of $4.0 million in office rent due to growth in the business and a decrease in income of $1.9 million in acquisition-related contingent consideration fair value adjustments, partially offset by decreases in consulting expenses and non-income tax related items at non-dating. the increase in compensation is due to an increase in headcount from both recent acquisitions and existing business growth, partially offset by a decrease in stock-based compensation expense due primarily to the inclusion in 2015 of a modification charge related to certain equity awards, partially offset by the issuance of new equity awards since the prior year.
•   the publishing decrease was due primarily to the sale of askfm and a decrease in bad debt expense, partially offset by $2.3 million in restructuring charges in the current year period primarily related to severance costs in connection with a reduction in workforce.

nm = not meaningful for the year ended december 31, 2016 compared to the year ended december 31, 2015
operating income in 2016 decreased to a loss from 2015 despite an increase of $15.4 million in adjusted ebitda described below, due primarily to increases of $261.3 million in goodwill impairment charges, $9.5 million in depreciation and a change of $18.0 million in acquisition-related contingent consideration fair value adjustments, partially offset by a decrease of $60.5 million in amortization of intangibles. the increase in goodwill impairment charges is due to the write-off of goodwill of $275.4 million at publishing in the current year period compared to the write-off of goodwill of $14.1 million at shoebuy in the prior year period. the goodwill impairment charge at publishing was driven by the impact from the new google contract, traffic trends and monetization challenges and the corresponding impact on the current estimate of fair value. the goodwill impairment charge was recorded in the second quarter of 2016. the change in acquisition-related contingent consideration fair value adjustments was primarily the result of expense in the current year period of $2.6 million versus income of $15.5 million in the prior year period. the decrease in amortization of intangibles was due primarily to a reduction in impairment charges during the year, partially offset by $23.3 million in amortization related to a change in classification of a publishing trade name from an indefinite-lived intangible asset to a definite-lived intangible asset, effective april 1, 2016. the company recorded an impairment charge in 2016 of $11.6 million compared to an impairment charge in 2015 of $88.0 million all related to certain publishing indefinite-lived trade names.

for a detailed description of the publishing goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset impairments, see "note 2-summary of significant accounting policies" to the consolidated financial statements included in "item 8-consolidated financial statements and supplementary data."
at december 31, 2016, there was $177.9 million of unrecognized compensation cost, net of estimated forfeitures, related to all equity-based awards, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of approximately 2.6 years.
for the year ended december 31, 2015 compared to the year ended december 31, 2014
operating income in 2015 decreased from 2014 due to the decrease of $58.3 million in adjusted ebitda described below and increases of $82.0 million in amortization of intangibles, $45.8 million in stock-based compensation expense and a $14.1 million goodwill impairment charge at shoebuy, partially offset by an increase in income of $2.1 million in changes from acquisition-related contingent consideration fair value adjustments compared to 2014. the increase in amortization of intangibles was due primarily to an $88.0 million impairment charge related to certain trade names of certain ask & other direct marketing brands, including ask.com. the impairment charge reflected the impact of google ecosystem changes that have impacted our ability to market, the effect of the reduced revenue share on mobile under the terms of the services agreement with google, and the shift in focus to higher margin businesses in publishing's premium brands. the combined impact of these factors has reduced the forecasted revenue and profits for these brands and the impairment charge reflected the resultant reduction in fair value. the increase in stock-based compensation expense was due primarily to the modification of certain equity awards in 2015, a higher number of forfeited awards in 2014 and issuance of equity awards since 2014. the goodwill impairment charge at shoebuy was due to increased investment and the seasonal effect of high inventory levels as of october 1, 2015, the date of our 2015 annual assessment.

interest expense in 2016 increased from 2015 due to the $800 million of borrowings under the match group term loan in november 2015, of which $400 million was refinanced on june 1, 2016 with the 2016 match group senior notes, and the 2% higher interest rate associated with the 2015 match group senior notes which were issued in exchange for a substantially like amount of 2012 senior notes, partially offset by the repurchases and redemptions of the 2013 and 2012 senior notes during the year.

interest expense in 2015 increased from 2014 due primarily to both the costs and the higher interest rate associated with the exchange of $445 million of match group senior notes for a substantially like amount of 2012 senior notes, as well as the $800 million match group term loan. in connection with the note exchange, $7.3 million in costs were expensed during 2015. the note exchange and term loan borrowings closed on november 16, 2015. interest expense in 2015 was also impacted by the accelerated amortization of deferred financing costs associated with the redemption of the liberty bonds on september 1, 2015.

in 2016, the company recorded an income tax benefit for continuing operations of $64.9 million, which represents an effective income tax rate of 80%. the effective income tax rate was higher than the statutory rate of 35% due primarily to foreign income taxed at lower rates and the non-taxable gain on the sale of shoebuy, partially offset by the non-deductible portion of the goodwill impairment charge at the publishing segment.
in 2015, the company recorded an income tax provision for continuing operations of $29.5 million, which represents an effective income tax rate of 21%. the effective income tax rate was lower than the statutory rate of 35% due primarily to the realization of certain deferred tax assets, foreign income taxed at lower rates, the non-taxable gain on contingent consideration fair value adjustments, and a reduction in tax reserves and related interest due to the expiration of statutes of limitations, partially offset by a non-deductible goodwill impairment charge and unbenefited losses of unconsolidated subsidiaries.
in 2014, the company recorded an income tax provision for continuing operations of $35.4 million, which represents an effective income tax rate of 13%. the effective income tax rate was lower than the statutory rate of 35% due principally to a reduction in tax reserves and related interest of $88.2 million due to the expiration of statutes of limitations for federal income taxes for 2001 through 2009 and foreign income taxed at lower rates, partially offset by the largely unbenefited loss associated with the write-downs of certain of the company's investments and non-deductible goodwill associated with the sale of urbanspoon.

iac's principles of financial reporting iac reports adjusted ebitda as a supplemental measure to u.s. generally accepted accounting principles ("gaap"). this measure is one of the primary metrics by which we evaluate the performance of our businesses, on which our internal budgets are based and by which management is compensated. we believe that investors should have access to, and we are obligated to provide, the same set of tools that we use in analyzing our results. this non-gaap measure should be considered in addition to results prepared in accordance with gaap, but should not be considered a substitute for or superior to gaap results. iac endeavors to compensate for the limitations of the non-gaap measure presented by providing the comparable gaap measure with equal or greater prominence and descriptions of the reconciling items, including quantifying such items, to derive the non-gaap measure. we encourage investors to examine the reconciling adjustments between the gaap and non-gaap measure, which we discuss below.
definition of iac's non-gaap measure adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization ("adjusted ebitda") is defined as operating income excluding: (1) stock-based compensation expense; (2) depreciation; and (3) acquisition-related items consisting of (i) amortization of intangible assets and impairments of goodwill and intangible assets, if applicable, and (ii) gains and losses recognized on changes in the fair value of contingent consideration arrangements. we believe this measure is useful for analysts and investors as this measure allows a more meaningful comparison between our performance and that of our competitors. moreover, our management uses this measure internally to evaluate the performance of our business as a whole and our individual business segments, and this measure is one of the primary metrics by which our internal budgets are based and by which management is compensated. the above items are excluded from our adjusted ebitda measure because these items are non-cash in nature, and we believe that by excluding these items, adjusted ebitda corresponds more closely to the cash operating income generated from our business, from which capital investments are made and debt is serviced. adjusted ebitda has certain limitations in that it does not take into account the impact to iac's statement of operations of certain expenses.
for a reconciliation of operating income (loss) by reportable segment and net (loss) earnings attributable to iac shareholders to adjusted ebitda for the years ended december 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, see "note 14-segment information" to the consolidated financial statements included in "item 8-consolidated financial statements and supplementary data."
non-cash expenses that are excluded from iac's non-gaap measure stock-based compensation expense consists principally of expense associated with the grants of stock options, restricted stock units ("rsus"), performance-based rsus and market-based awards. these expenses are not paid in cash, and we include the related shares in our fully diluted shares outstanding using the treasury stock method; however, performance-based rsus and market-based awards are included only to the extent the applicable performance or market condition(s) has been met (assuming the end of the reporting period is the end of the contingency period). upon the exercise of certain stock options and vesting of rsus, performance-based rsus and market-based awards, the awards are settled, at the company's discretion, on a net basis, with the company remitting the required tax-withholding amount from its current funds.
depreciation is a non-cash expense relating to our property and equipment and is computed using the straight-line method to allocate the cost of depreciable assets to operations over their estimated useful lives or, in the case of leasehold improvements, the lease term, if shorter.
amortization of intangible assets and impairments of goodwill and intangible assets are non-cash expenses related primarily to acquisitions. at the time of an acquisition, the identifiable definite-lived intangible assets of the acquired company, such as trade names, content, technology, customer lists, advertiser and supplier relationships, are valued and amortized over their estimated lives. value is also assigned to acquired indefinite-lived intangible assets, which comprise trade names and trademarks, and goodwill that are not subject to amortization. an impairment is recorded when the carrying value of an intangible asset or goodwill exceeds its fair value. we believe that intangible assets represent costs incurred by the acquired company to build value prior to acquisition and the related amortization and impairment charges of intangible assets or goodwill, if applicable, are not ongoing costs of doing business.
gains and losses recognized on changes in the fair value of contingent consideration arrangements are accounting adjustments to report contingent consideration liabilities at fair value. these adjustments can be highly variable and are excluded from our assessment of performance because they are considered non-operational in nature and, therefore, are not indicative of current or future performance or the ongoing cost of doing business.
effects of changes in foreign exchange rates on match group revenue the impact of foreign exchange rates on match group, due to its global reach, may be an important factor in understanding period over period comparisons if movement in rates is significant. international revenues are favorably
45
impacted as the u.s. dollar weakens relative to other foreign currencies, and unfavorably impacted as the u.s dollar strengthens relative to other foreign currencies. we believe the presentation of revenue excluding foreign exchange, in addition to reported revenue, helps improve the ability to understand match group's performance because it excludes the impact of foreign currency volatility that is not indicative of match group's core operating results.
revenue, excluding foreign exchange impact compares results between periods as if exchange rates had remained constant period over period. revenue, excluding foreign exchange impact is calculated by translating current period revenues using prior period exchange rates. revenue growth, excluding foreign exchange impact (expressed as a percentage), is calculated by determining the increase in current period revenues over prior period revenues where current period revenues are translated using prior period exchange rates.
this non-gaap measure should be considered in addition to results reported in accordance with gaap, but should not be considered a substitute for or superior to gaap.
the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates on match group revenue was not material to the consolidated statement of operations for the year ended december 31, 2016 compared to the year ended december 31, 2015.

(a)   domestically, cash equivalents primarily consist of aaa rated government money market funds, commercial paper rated a1/p1 or better and treasury discount notes.
(b)   internationally, cash equivalents primarily consist of aaa rated treasury money market funds with maturities of less than 91 days from the date of purchase, and time deposits with maturities of less than 91 days.
(c)   if needed for our u.s. operations, most of the cash and cash equivalents held by the company's foreign subsidiaries could be repatriated, however, under current law, would be subject to u.s. federal and state income taxes. we have not provided for any such tax because the company currently does not anticipate a need to repatriate these funds to finance our u.s. operations and it is the company's intent to indefinitely reinvest these funds outside of the u.s.
(d)   marketable securities consist of commercial paper rated a1/p1, treasury discount notes, short-to-medium-term debt securities issued by investment grade corporate issuers and an equity security (which was sold in the second quarter of 2016). the company invests in marketable debt securities with active secondary or resale markets to ensure portfolio liquidity to fund current operations or satisfy other cash requirements as needed. the company also invests in equity securities as part of its investment strategy.
(e)   at december 31, 2016 and 2015, cash and cash equivalents includes match group's domestic and international cash and cash equivalents of $114.0 million and $139.6 million; and $34.4 million and $53.8 million, respectively. marketable securities at december 31, 2015 include $11.6 million at match group. there are no marketable securities at december 31, 2016 at match group. match group is a separate and distinct legal entity with its own public shareholders and board of directors and has no obligation to provide the company with funds. as a result, we cannot freely access the cash of match group and its subsidiaries. match group generated $234.1 million and $209.1 million of operating cash flows for the years ended december 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. in addition, agreements governing match group's indebtedness limit the payment of dividends or distributions, loans or advances to stockholders, including the company, in the event a default has occurred or match group's leverage ratio (as defined in the indentures) exceeds 5.0 to 1.0.

(f)   proceeds from the 2016 match group senior notes were used to prepay a portion of the match group term loan. a final payment of $350 million is due at maturity.
(g)   the match group term loan matures on november 16, 2022; provided that, if any of the 2015 match group senior notes remain outstanding on the date that is 91 days prior to the maturity date of the 2015 match group senior notes, the match group term loan maturity date shall be the date that is 91 days prior to the maturity date of the 2015 match group senior notes.
match group senior notes:
on june 1, 2016, match group issued $400 million aggregate principal amount of the 2016 match group senior notes due june 1, 2024.
promptly following the closing of the match exchange offer on november 16, 2015, match group and its subsidiaries were designated as unrestricted subsidiaries of iac for purposes of the indentures governing the 2013 and 2012 senior notes and the iac credit facility. following the designation, neither match group nor any of its subsidiaries guarantee any debt of iac, or are subject to any of the covenants related to such debt.
the indentures governing the 2016 and 2015 match group senior notes contain covenants that would limit match group's ability to pay dividends or to make distributions and repurchase or redeem match group stock in the event a default has occurred or match group's leverage ratio (as defined in the indentures) exceeds 5.0 to 1.0. as of december 31, 2016, match group was in compliance with all applicable covenants and was below the 5.0 to 1.0 leverage ratio.

on november 16, 2015, under a credit agreement (the "match group credit agreement"), match group borrowed $800 million in the form of a term loan. on march 31, 2016, the company made a $10.0 million principal payment on the term loan. on june 1, 2016, the proceeds of the 2016 match group senior notes were used to prepay a portion of the match group term loan and, as a result, quarterly principal payments of $10 million under the match group term loan are no longer due. on december 8, 2016, match group made an additional $40 million principal payment on the match group term loan. in addition, the remaining outstanding balance of $350 million, which is due at maturity, was repriced; following the repricing, match group term loan bears interest, at match group's option, at a base rate or libor, plus 2.25% or 3.25%, respectively, and in the case of libor, a floor of 0.75%. the interest rate at december 31, 2016 is 4.20%. interest payments are due at least semi-annually through the term of the loan. the match group term loan provides for additional annual principal payments as part of an excess cash flow sweep provision, the amount of which, if any, is governed by the secured net leverage ratio set forth in the match group credit agreement.
match group has a $500 million revolving credit facility that expires on october 7, 2020 (the "match group credit facility"). the annual commitment fee on undrawn funds based on the current leverage ratio is 30 basis points. borrowings under the match group credit facility bear interest, at match group's option, at a base rate or libor, in each case plus an applicable margin, which is determined by reference to a pricing grid based on match group's consolidated net leverage ratio. the terms of the match group credit facility require match group to maintain a consolidated net leverage ratio of not more than 5.0 to 1.0 and a minimum interest coverage ratio of not less than 2.5 to 1.0 (in each case as defined in the match group credit agreement).
there are additional covenants under the match group credit facility and the match group term loan that limit the ability of match group and its subsidiaries to, among other things, incur indebtedness, pay dividends or make distributions. while the match group term loan remains outstanding, these same covenants under the match group credit agreement are more restrictive than the covenants that are applicable to the match group credit facility. obligations under the match group credit facility and match group term loan are unconditionally guaranteed by certain match group wholly-owned domestic subsidiaries, and are also secured by the stock of certain match group domestic and foreign subsidiaries. the match group term loan and outstanding borrowings, if any, under the match group credit facility rank equally with each other, and have priority over the 2016 and 2015 match group senior notes to the extent of the value of the assets securing the borrowings under the match group credit agreement.
iac senior notes:
the indenture governing the 2013 senior notes contains covenants that would limit our ability to pay dividends or to make distributions and repurchase or redeem our stock in the event a default has occurred or our leverage ratio (as defined in the indenture) exceeds 3.0 to 1.0. at december 31, 2016, there were no limitations pursuant thereto. there are additional covenants that limit the company's ability and the ability of its restricted subsidiaries to, among other things, (i) incur
48
indebtedness, make investments, or sell assets in the event we are not in compliance with the financial ratio set forth in the indenture, and (ii) incur liens, enter into agreements limiting our restricted subsidiaries' ability to pay dividends, enter into transactions with affiliates and consolidate, merge or sell substantially all of our assets. the indenture governing the 2012 senior notes was amended to eliminate substantially all of the restrictive covenants contained therein in connection with the match exchange offer.
iac credit facility:
iac has a $300 million revolving credit facility that expires october 7, 2020 (the "iac credit facility"). the annual commitment fee on undrawn funds is currently 35 basis points and is based on the leverage ratio most recently reported. borrowings under the iac credit facility bear interest, at the company's option, at a base rate or libor, in each case, plus an applicable margin, which is determined by reference to a pricing grid based on the company's leverage ratio. the terms of the iac credit facility require that the company maintains a leverage ratio (as defined in the agreement) of not more than 3.25 to 1.0 and restrict our ability to incur additional indebtedness. borrowings under the iac credit facility are unconditionally guaranteed by the same domestic subsidiaries that guarantee the 2013 and 2012 senior notes and are also secured by the stock of certain of our domestic and foreign subsidiaries. the 2013 and 2012 senior notes rank equally with each other, and are subordinate to outstanding borrowings under the iac credit facility to extent of the value of the assets securing such borrowings.

50
primarily related to the internal development of software to support our products and services, partially offset by $58.4 million of proceeds from the sales of a business and long-term investments.
net cash used in financing activities attributable to continuing operations in 2014 includes $97.3 million related to the payment of cash dividends to iac shareholders, $33.2 million for the purchase of noncontrolling interests in tinder and meetic, and $8.1 million in contingent consideration payments related principally to the 2013 twoo acquisition, partially offset by excess tax benefits from stock-based awards of $45.0 million.
liquidity and capital resources the company's principal sources of liquidity are its cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities as well as cash flows generated from operations. iac has a $300 million revolving credit facility that expires on october 7, 2020. match group has a $500 million revolving credit facility that expires on october 7, 2020. at december 31, 2016, there were no outstanding borrowings under the iac credit facility or the match group credit facility.
at december 31, 2016, iac had 9.3 million shares remaining in its share repurchase authorization. iac may purchase shares over an indefinite period of time on the open market and in privately negotiated transactions, depending on those factors iac management deems relevant at any particular time, including, without limitation, market conditions, share price and future outlook.
iac's consolidated cash and cash equivalents at december 31, 2016 were $1.3 billion, of which $253.7 million was held by match group. the company generated $292.4 million of operating cash flows for the year ended december 31, 2016, of which $234.1 million was generated by match group. match group is a separate and distinct legal entity with its own public shareholders and board of directors and has no obligation to provide the company with funds. as a result, we cannot freely access the cash of the match group and its subsidiaries. in addition, agreements governing match group's indebtedness limit the payment of dividends or distributions and loans or advances to stockholders, including the company, in the event a default has occurred or match group's leverage ratio (as defined in the indentures) exceeds 5.0 to 1.0.
the company anticipates that it will need to make capital and other expenditures in connection with the development and expansion of its operations. the company's 2017 capital expenditures are expected to be higher than 2016 by approximately 5% to 10%, driven, in part, by certain corporate related expenditures and homeadvisor's sales center and corporate headquarters expansion.
awards made under our subsidiary denominated equity plans are settled on a net basis, with the award holder entitled to receive a payment in iac shares equal to the intrinsic value of the award at exercise less an amount equal to the required cash tax withholding payment. awards made to employees of match group subsidiaries may be settled in either iac shares or match group shares, at our option. the tax withholding payment associated with these awards is made by the company in cash on behalf of the employee at the time these awards are exercised; in the case of match group awards, the tax withholding payment is made by match group in cash at the time these awards are exercised. in either case, the cash tax withholding payments will vary based on the ultimate number of awards exercised, the intrinsic value of the awards upon exercise and relevant withholding tax rates. we expect a reduction in future corporate income taxes equal to a substantial portion of any such withholding tax payments by virtue of the income tax deduction we will recognize based on the intrinsic value of the awards at exercise. however, there may be some delay in the timing of the realization of the cash benefit of the income tax deduction because it will be dependent upon the amount and timing of future taxable income and the timing of estimated income tax payments. as it relates to awards made to employees of match group subsidiaries, if the company elects to settle these awards in iac shares, we will receive match group shares equal in value to the iac shares issued.  if the company elects to settle these awards in match group shares, our ownership interest in match group will be diluted. the match group subsidiary denominated equity plan at tinder has a number of scheduled option exercise periods, and the next period is in may 2017; the company expects to settle a sufficient number of exercises in iac shares to maintain an economic interest in match group of at least 80%. see "note 13-stock-based compensation" to the consolidated financial statements included in "item 8-consolidated financial statements and supplementary data" for additional discussion of subsidiary denominated equity plans.
the company believes its existing cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities and expected positive cash flows generated from operations will be sufficient to fund our normal operating requirements, including capital expenditures, debt service, the payment of withholding taxes on behalf of employees for net-settled stock-based awards, and investing and other commitments for the foreseeable future. the company's liquidity could be negatively affected by a decrease in demand for our products and services. the company's indebtedness could limit our ability to: (i) obtain additional financing to fund working capital needs, acquisitions, capital expenditure or debt service or other requirements; and (ii) use operating cash flow to make acquisitions, capital expenditures, invest in other areas, such as developing properties and exploiting business opportunities, in
51
the event a default has occurred or in certain circumstances our leverage ratio (as defined in the indenture) exceeds 3.0 to 1.0. the company may make additional acquisitions and investments and, as a result, the company may need to raise additional capital through future debt or equity financing to provide for greater financial flexibility. additional financing may not be available at all or on terms favorable to us.

critical accounting policies and estimates the following disclosure is provided to supplement the descriptions of iac's accounting policies contained in "note 2-summary of significant accounting policies" to the consolidated financial statements included in "item 8-consolidated financial statements and supplementary data" in regard to significant areas of judgment. management of the company is required to make certain estimates, judgments and assumptions during the preparation of its consolidated financial statements in accordance with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles. these estimates, judgments and assumptions impact the reported amount of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses and the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. actual results could differ from these estimates. because of the size of the financial statement elements to which they relate, some of our accounting policies and estimates have a more significant impact on our consolidated financial statements than others. what follows is a discussion of some of our more significant accounting policies and estimates.
business combinations and contingent consideration arrangements acquisitions are an important part of the company's growth strategy. the company invested $18.4 million, $617.4 million and $259.4 million in acquisitions in the years ended december 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. the purchase price of each acquisition is attributed to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their fair values at the date of acquisition, including identifiable intangible assets that either arise from a contractual or legal right or are separable from goodwill. the fair value of these intangible assets is based on detailed valuations that use information and assumptions provided by management. the excess purchase price over the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets is recorded as goodwill and is assigned to the reporting unit(s) that is expected to benefit from the combination as of the acquisition date.
in connection with certain business combinations, the company has entered into contingent consideration arrangements that are determined to be part of the purchase price. each of these arrangements are recorded at its fair value at the time of the acquisition and reflected at current fair value for each subsequent reporting period thereafter until settled. the contingent consideration arrangements are generally based upon earnings performance and/or operating metrics. the company determines the fair value of the contingent consideration arrangements by using probability-weighted analyses to determine the amounts of the gross liability, and, if the arrangement is long-term in nature, applying a discount rate that appropriately captures the risk associated with the obligation to determine the net amount reflected in the consolidated financial statements. determining the fair value of these arrangements is inherently difficult and subjective. significant changes in forecasted earnings or operating metrics would result in a significantly higher or lower fair value measurement and can have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. the changes in the estimated fair value of the contingent consideration arrangements during each reporting period, including the accretion of the discount, if applicable, are recognized in "general and administrative expense" in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations. see "note 8-fair value measurements and financial instruments" to the consolidated financial statements included in "item 8-consolidated financial statements and supplementary data" for a discussion of contingent consideration arrangements.
recoverability of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets goodwill is the company's largest asset with a carrying value of $1.9 billion and $2.2 billion at december 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. indefinite-lived intangible assets, which consist of the company's acquired trade names and trademarks, have a carrying value of $320.6 million and $380.1 million at december 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are assessed annually for impairment as of october 1 or, more frequently, if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit or the fair value of an indefinite-lived intangible asset below its carrying value. in performing its annual assessment, the company has the option to qualitatively assess whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value.
for the company's annual goodwill test at october 1, 2016, a qualitative assessment of the match group, homeadvisor domestic, homeadvisor international, vimeo, daily burn and shoebuy reporting units' goodwill was performed because the company concluded it was more likely than not that the fair value of these reporting units was in excess of their respective carrying values. the primary factors that the company considered in its qualitative assessment for each of these reporting units is described below:
•   match group's october 1, 2016 market capitalization of $4.8 billion exceeded its carrying value by more than 970% and match group's strong operating performance.
•   the company performed valuations of the homeadvisor domestic, homeadvisor international, vimeo and daily burn reporting units during 2016. these valuations were prepared primarily in connection with the issuance and/or settlement of equity grants that are denominated in the shares of these businesses. the valuations were prepared time proximate to, however, not as of october 1, 2016. the fair value of each of these businesses was significantly in excess of its october 1, 2016 carrying value.
54
•   shoebuy's expected sales price was significantly in excess of its october 1, 2016 carrying value; which was confirmed by the sales price realized in its sale on december 30, 2016, which resulted in a pre-tax gain of $37.5 million.
when the company elects to perform a qualitative assessment and concludes it is not more likely than not that the fair value a reporting unit is greater than its carrying value goodwill must be tested for impairment. for the company's annual goodwill test at october 1, 2016, the company concluded that it was not more likely than not that the fair values of the applications and connected ventures reporting units were greater than their respective carrying values and performed a quantitative test of these reporting units. the company's quantitative test indicated that the fair value of each of these reporting units is in excess of its respective carrying value; therefore, the goodwill of these reporting units is not impaired. the publishing reporting unit had no goodwill as of october 1, 2016 because the company recorded an impairment charge equal to the entire $275.4 million balance of the publishing reporting unit goodwill during the second quarter of 2016, which is more fully described below, following a quantitative impairment test as of june 30, 2016. the quantitative impairment test is performed using the two-step process described below.
the first step of an annual or interim quantitative test of the recovery of goodwill involves a comparison of the estimated fair value of each of the company's reporting units to its carrying value, including goodwill. the fair value of the company's reporting units is determined using both an income approach based on discounted cash flows ("dcf") and a market approach when it tests goodwill for impairment, either on an interim basis or annual basis as of october 1 each year. the company uses the same approach in determining the fair value of its businesses in connection with its subsidiary denominated stock based compensation plans, which can be a significant factor in the decision to apply the qualitative screen. determining fair value using a dcf analysis requires the exercise of significant judgment with respect to several items, including the amount and timing of expected future cash flows and appropriate discount rates. the expected cash flows used in the dcf analyses are based on the company's most recent forecast and budget and, for years beyond the budget, the company's estimates, which are based, in part, on forecasted growth rates. the discount rates used in the dcf analyses are intended to reflect the risks inherent in the expected future cash flows of the respective reporting units. assumptions used in the dcf analyses, including the discount rate, are assessed based on the reporting units' current results and forecasted future performance, as well as macroeconomic and industry specific factors. the discount rates used in determining the fair value of the company's reporting units ranged from 10% to 17.5% in 2016 and 12% to 22% in 2015. determining fair value using a market approach considers multiples of financial metrics based on both acquisitions and trading multiples of a selected peer group of companies. from the comparable companies, a representative market multiple is determined which is applied to financial metrics to estimate the fair value of a reporting unit. to determine a peer group of companies for our respective reporting units, we considered companies relevant in terms of consumer use, monetization model, margin and growth characteristics, and brand strength operating in their respective sectors. while a primary driver in the determination of the fair values of the company's reporting units is the estimate of future revenue and profitability, the determination of fair value is based, in part, upon the company's assessment of macroeconomic factors, industry and competitive dynamics and the strategies of its businesses in response to these factors.
if the estimated fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, goodwill of the reporting unit is not impaired and the second step of the impairment test is not necessary. if the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value, then the second step of the goodwill impairment test must be performed. the second step of the goodwill impairment test compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit's goodwill with its carrying value to measure the amount of impairment, if any. the implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner as the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination. in other words, the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is allocated to all of the assets and liabilities of that unit (including any unrecognized intangible assets) as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination and the fair value of the reporting unit was the purchase price paid. if the carrying value of the reporting unit's goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill, an impairment is recognized in an amount equal to that excess. the company has adopted the provisions of accounting standards update no. 2017-04, intangibles-goodwill and other (topic 350): simplifying the test for goodwill impairment, effective january 1, 2017. therefore, any goodwill impairment charge that might result in the future would be determined based solely upon the excess of the carrying value of the reporting unit over its fair value. the second step of the impairment analysis that is described above will no longer be performed.
at october 1, 2016, the fair value of each of the company's reporting units with goodwill exceeded its carrying value by more than 20%.
while the company has the option to qualitatively assess whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of its indefinite-lived intangible asset are less than its carrying value, the company's policy is to determine the fair value of each of its indefinite-lived intangible assets annually as of october 1. the company determines the fair value of indefinite-lived intangible assets using an avoided royalty dcf valuation analysis. significant judgments inherent in this analysis include the selection of appropriate royalty and discount rates and estimating the amount and timing of expected future cash flows. the discount rates used in the dcf analyses are intended to reflect the risks inherent in the expected future cash flows generated by the respective intangible assets. the royalty rates used in the dcf analyses are based upon an estimate of the royalty rates that a market participant would pay to license the company's trade names and trademarks. assumptions used in the avoided royalty
55
dcf analyses, including the discount rate and royalty rate, are assessed annually based on the actual and projected cash flows related to the asset, as well as macroeconomic and industry specific factors. the discount rates used in the company's annual indefinite-lived impairment assessment ranged from 11% to 16% in both 2016 and 2015, and the royalty rates used ranged from 2% to 7% in 2016 and 1% to 9% in 2015.
while the 2016 annual assessment did not identify any material impairments, during the second quarter of 2016, the company recorded impairment charges equal to the entire $275.4 million balance of the publishing reporting unit goodwill and $11.6 million related to certain publishing indefinite-lived intangible assets. the 2015 annual assessment identified impairment charges related to certain intangible assets of the publishing reporting unit and the goodwill on the shoebuy reporting unit of $88.0 million and $14.1 million, respectively. these impairment charges are more fully described above in "results of operations for the years ended december 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014-operating income (loss)" and "note 2-summary of significant accounting policies" to the consolidated financial statements included in "item 8-consolidated financial statements and supplementary data."
recoverability and estimated useful lives of long-lived assets we review the carrying value of all long-lived assets, comprising property and equipment, including leasehold improvements, and definite-lived intangible assets, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. the carrying value of a long-lived asset is not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset. if the carrying value is deemed not to be recoverable, an impairment loss is recorded equal to the amount by which the carrying value of the long-lived asset exceeds its fair value. in addition, the company reviews the useful lives of its long-lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that these lives may be changed. the carrying value of property and equipment and definite-lived intangible assets is $341.1 million and $363.5 million at december 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
income taxes the company accounts for income taxes under the liability method, and deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying values of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. a valuation allowance is provided on deferred tax assets if it is determined that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset will not be realized. as of december 31, 2016 and 2015, the balance of deferred tax liabilities, net, is $226.3 million and $346.8 million, respectively.
we recognize liabilities for uncertain tax positions based on the two-step process. the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, if any. the second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount which is more than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. this measurement step is inherently difficult and requires subjective estimations of such amounts to determine the probability of various possible outcomes. we consider many factors when evaluating and estimating our tax positions and tax benefits, which may require periodic adjustments and which may not accurately anticipate actual outcomes. at december 31, 2016 and 2015, the company has unrecognized tax benefits of $41.0 million and $43.4 million, including interest, respectively. changes to reserves from period to period and differences between amounts paid, if any, upon resolution of issues raised in audits and amounts previously provided may be material. differences between the reserves for income tax contingencies and the amounts owed by the company are recorded in the period they become known.
the ultimate amount of deferred income tax assets realized and the amounts paid for deferred income tax liabilities and uncertain tax positions may vary from our estimates due to future changes in income tax law, state income tax apportionment or the outcome of any review of our tax returns by the various tax authorities, as well as actual operating results of the company that vary significantly from anticipated results.
no income taxes have been provided on indefinitely reinvested earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries aggregating $680.2 million at december 31, 2016. the estimated amount of the unrecognized deferred income tax liability with respect to such earnings would be $169.3 million.
stock-based compensation the company recorded stock-based compensation expense of $104.8 million, $105.4 million and $59.6 million for the years ended december 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. the company estimated the fair value of stock options issued in 2016, 2015 and 2014 using a black-scholes option pricing model and, for those with a market condition, a lattice model. for stock options, including subsidiary denominated equity, the value of the stock option is measured at the grant date at fair value and expensed over the vesting term. the impact on stock-based compensation expense for the year ended december 31, 2016, assuming a 1% increase in the risk-free interest rate, a 10% increase in the volatility factor and a one-year increase in the weighted average expected term of the outstanding options would be an increase of $3.5 million, $15.9 million and
56
$7.1 million, respectively. the company also issues rsus and performance-based rsus. for rsus issued, the value of the instrument is measured at the grant date as the fair value of the underlying iac common stock and expensed as stock-based compensation expense over the vesting term. for performance-based rsus issued, the value of the instrument is measured at the grant date as the fair value of the underlying iac common stock and expensed as stock-based compensation over the vesting term when the performance targets are considered probable of being achieved.
marketable securities and long-term investments at december 31, 2016, marketable securities of $89.3 million consist of commercial paper rated a1/p1, treasury discount notes and short-to-medium-term debt securities issued by investment grade corporate issuers. long-term investments at december 31, 2016 of $122.8 million include equity securities accounted for under the cost and equity methods.
the company invests in marketable debt securities with active secondary or resale markets to ensure portfolio liquidity to fund current operations or satisfy other cash requirements as needed. marketable securities are adjusted to fair value each quarter, and the unrealized gains and losses, net of tax, are included in accumulated other comprehensive income as a separate component of shareholders' equity. the specific-identification method is used to determine the cost of securities sold and the amount of unrealized gains and losses reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income into earnings. the company recognizes unrealized losses on marketable securities in net earnings when the losses are determined to be other-than-temporary. additionally, the company evaluates each cost and equity method investment for indicators of impairment on a quarterly basis, and recognizes an impairment loss if the decline in value is deemed to be other-than-temporary. future events may result in reconsideration of the nature of losses as other-than-temporary and market and other factors may cause the value of the company's investments to decline.
the company employs a methodology that considers available evidence in evaluating potential other-than-temporary impairments of its investments. investments are considered to be impaired when a decline in fair value below the amortized cost basis is determined to be other-than-temporary. such impairment evaluations include, but are not limited to: the length of time and extent to which fair value has been less than the cost basis, the current business environment, including competition; going concern considerations such as financial condition, the rate at which the investee utilizes cash and the investee's ability to obtain additional financing to achieve its business plan; the need for changes to the investee's existing business model due to changing business and regulatory environments and its ability to successfully implement necessary changes; and comparable valuations. during 2016, 2015 and 2014, the company recognized other-than-temporary impairments of $10.0 million, $6.7 million and $66.6 million, respectively, related to cost method investments. these charges are described above in "results of operations for the years ended december 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014-other income (expense), net."

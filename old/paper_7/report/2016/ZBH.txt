item 7.   managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the corresponding notes included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10-k. certain percentages presented in this discussion and analysis are calculated from the underlying whole-dollar amounts and therefore may not recalculate from the rounded numbers used for disclosure purposes. certain amounts in the 2015 and 2014 consolidated financial statements have been reclassified to conform to the 2016 presentation.
on june 24, 2015, we completed our merger with biomet and its results of operations have been included in our results starting on that date. the biomet merger was a transformational event for us and has had significant effects on all aspects of our business. accordingly, our sales and expenses increased significantly in the years ended december 31, 2016 and 2015 when compared to prior years.
in portions of this discussion and analysis, we also present sales information on an unaudited, pro forma basis for the years ended december 31, 2015 and 2014. this pro forma information includes zimmer and biomet sales in those periods as if the merger occurred on january 1, 2014. accordingly, the pro forma net sales information for periods prior to the closing date includes the net sales of biomet, but does not include the impact of the divestiture of certain product line rights and assets. we believe this pro forma analysis is beneficial for investors because it represents how the merged companies may have performed on a combined basis in 2015 and 2014.
executive level overview
2016 results in 2016, we made strategic internal and external investments to further broaden and diversify our musculoskeletal portfolio, including the acquisitions of ldr, which provided us with an immediate position in the growing cervical disc replacement market; cayenne medical, inc. (cayenne medical), a sports medicine company; compression therapy concepts, inc. (ctc), a provider of non-invasive products for the prevention of deep vein thrombosis; cd diagnostics, inc. (cd diagnostics), a medical diagnostic testing company; and medtech sa (medtech), a designer and manufacturer of robotic equipment for brain and spine surgeries. these commercial additions have both enhanced our core offerings and expanded our presence across the full continuum and episode of care.
we have also continued to make progress in our commercial and operational integration of biomet across all geographies and functions. despite this progress, sales in 2016 were below our expectations due in part to some temporary disruption in product supply in certain knee, hip, upper extremities, sports medicine and trauma product lines in the second half of 2016 related to several factors, including implementation of operational and quality process enhancements that resulted in various shipment delays, and manufacturing forecasting constraints related to continued integration of our supply chain. in the second half of 2016, we saw increased demand for certain knee, hip and upper extremities products, particularly related to cross-selling various offerings across the combined zimmer biomet portfolio. the increased demand temporarily impacted our ability to effectively respond to this shifting product mix. in response, we accelerated work to enhance certain aspects of our supply chain infrastructure as we harmonize and optimize our sourcing, manufacturing and quality management systems. we are in the process of deploying new demand planning and production planning tools. we made progress on these enhancements in late 2016 and anticipate continued progress towards the replenishment of safety stocks on key cross-sell products throughout the first half of 2017.
our 2016 results have been significantly impacted by the inclusion of biomet sales and expenses for the entire year, including sales growth of 28.1 percent. on an unaudited pro forma basis, sales increased by 2.2 percent driven by volume/mix growth across all our regions in most of our product categories, including growth from our 2016 acquisitions, offset by the negative effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and continued, but stable, pricing pressure in all of our geographic regions.
our net earnings increased in 2016 compared to 2015. the primary drivers of the improved earnings performance were the inclusion of biomet earnings for the entire year and the absence in 2016 of significant expenses incurred in 2015 in connection with completing the biomet merger. as a result of the merger, we recognized significant expenses in 2015 due to the acceleration of unvested lvb stock options and lvb stock-based awards, retention bonuses paid to biomet employees and third-party sales agents who remained with biomet through the closing date, severance expense, a loss related to a call premium on biomet debt we redeemed, third party fees, and other acquisition and integration charges. while we did incur similar expenses in 2016 related to acquisitions, they were less significant.
2017 outlook we estimate our sales growth in 2017 over 2016 will be in a range of 2.2 to 3.2 percent. this estimate assumes foreign currency exchange rates will decrease sales by approximately 1.5 percent, continued pricing pressure will decrease sales by approximately 2 percent and the inclusion of ldr sales for the full year will increase sales by approximately 1.2 percent. as noted previously, we expect to make substantial progress in remediating supply constraints during the first half of this year as we prioritize production for key cross-sell brands, clear our back orders, and restore safety stocks.
additionally, as part of our effort to implement certain regulatory compliance enhancements, we are making operational and quality process improvements in certain of our major production facilities. as such, affected products may experience temporary and occasional distribution delays while
21
zimmer biomet holdings, inc.   2016 form 10-k annual report we implement and validate these enhanced processes and generate the necessary supporting records. we believe that continued progress towards restoring full supply expected during the second quarter will enable our commercial teams to service existing customers and also resume executing against the full potential of our broad and diverse portfolio. as such, we expect volume/mix sales growth to improve as we progress through 2017.
turning to cost of products sold, in 2016 we recognized significant expenses related to stepping up acquired biomet inventory to fair value and for excess and obsolete inventory charges from our decision to discontinue certain products. without these significant expenses, we expect cost of products sold will decrease in 2017. additionally, due to the two year moratorium on the u.s. medical device excise tax, costs of products sold will decrease. however, we believe we will experience unfavorable effects on costs of products sold as a percentage of sales from declining selling prices, as well as from lower hedge gains expected to be recognized in 2017 when compared to 2016.
as it relates to other expenses, our intangible asset amortization expense is expected to increase as we recognize a full year of intangible asset amortization from the ldr merger and other 2016 acquisitions. we expect research and development (r&d) expense for the year to be approximately 4.5 percent of sales. selling, general and administrative (sg&a) expense is expected to approximate 37.5 percent of sales, which is an improvement from 2016 as we expect to realize synergies from our acquisitions and leverage sales growth. we estimate special items expense will continue to be significant as we continue our integration activities as well as harmonize and optimize our supply chain and manufacturing and quality systems. however, we expect special items expense will be less in 2017 compared to 2016. we expect interest expense will decrease in 2017 compared to 2016 due to lower debt levels from planned debt repayments.
results of operations we analyze sales by three geographies, the americas, emea and asia pacific, and by the following product categories: knees, hips, s.e.t., dental, spine & cmf and other. this sales analysis differs from our reportable operating segments, which are based upon our senior management organizational structure and how we allocate resources towards achieving operating profit goals. we analyze sales by geography because the underlying market trends in any particular geography tend to be similar across product categories and because we primarily sell the same products in all geographies.

as previously discussed, sales increased significantly in 2016 when compared to prior years due to the inclusion of biomet sales for the entire year. therefore, we analyze sales on a pro forma basis because it represents how the zimmer and biomet underlying businesses may have performed. sales discussion in this management discussion and analysis focuses on sales trends on a pro forma basis since that is how we analyze our business.
demand (volume/mix) trends increased volume and changes in the mix of product sales contributed 4.9 percentage points of year-over-year sales growth during 2016 on a pro forma basis. volume/mix growth was driven by recent product introductions, sales in key emerging markets, an aging population and 2016 acquisitions (including ldr, which contributed 1.1 percentage points of growth).
we believe long-term indicators point toward sustained growth driven by an aging global population, growth in emerging markets, obesity, proven clinical benefits, new material technologies, advances in surgical techniques and more active lifestyles, among other factors. in addition, demand for clinically proven premium products and patient specific devices are expected to continue to positively affect sales growth in markets that recognize the value of these advanced technologies.
pricing trends global selling prices had a negative effect of 1.5 percentage points on year-over-year sales during 2016 on a pro forma basis. the negative 1.5 percent effect on year-over-year sales was consistent with the range experienced over the past several years. the majority of countries in which we operate continue to experience pricing pressure from governmental healthcare cost containment efforts and from local hospitals and health systems.
foreign currency exchange rates in 2016, changes in foreign currency exchange rates had a negative effect of 0.3 percentage points on year-over-year sales on a pro forma basis. we address currency risk through regular operating and financing activities and through the use of forward contracts and foreign currency options solely to manage foreign currency volatility and risk. changes in foreign currency exchange rates affect sales growth, but due to offsetting gains/losses on hedge contracts and options, which
24
zimmer biomet holdings, inc.   2016 form 10-k annual report are recorded in cost of products sold, the effect on net earnings in the near term is reduced.
sales by product category knees on a pro forma basis, knee sales experienced steady volume/mix growth in 2016 compared to 2015, primarily driven by recent product introductions, such as persona the personalized knee system, cross-sell opportunities, and strong performance in our asia pacific operating segment. volume/mix growth was partially offset by continued pricing pressure and the divestiture of certain product line rights and assets.
hips on a pro forma basis, hips sales experienced steady volume/mix growth in 2016 compared to 2015, primarily driven by recent product introductions, such as the g7 acetabular system, and strong performance in our asia pacific operating segment. volume/mix growth was partially offset by continued pricing pressure.
s.e.t.
on a pro forma basis, our s.e.t. sales have continued positive volume/mix trends in 2016 compared to 2015, primarily driven by a growing emphasis on sales force specialization, strong performance by key brands and 2016 acquisitions. this product categorys sub-categories all experienced growth in 2016 despite continued pricing pressure.
dental on a pro forma basis, dental sales have continued to decline. in the second half of 2015, we experienced a supply disruption related to a voluntary field action in response to a packaging issue which we were not able to remediate until 2016, which affected our sales. looking forward, we must improve our commercial execution to get back to market growth rates.
spine & cmf on a pro forma basis, spine and cmf sales increased in 2016 compared to 2015 due to the ldr merger and continued strong performance of our cmf products.

the decrease in gross margin percentage in 2016 compared to 2015 was primarily due to increased intangible asset amortization from the 2016 acquisitions, excess and obsolete inventory charges for certain product lines we intend to discontinue, lower average selling prices and lower hedge gains in 2016 from our foreign currency hedging program compared to 2015. under the hedging program, for derivatives which qualify as hedges of future cash flows, the effective portion of changes in fair value is temporarily recorded in other comprehensive income and then recognized in cost of products sold when the hedged items affect earnings. these unfavorable items were partially offset by lower inventory step-up charges from the biomet merger and lower expense from the u.s. medical device excise tax, in each case in 2016 compared to 2015.
in 2015, we experienced a decrease in gross margin percentage compared to 2014 primarily due to increased inventory step-up charges and intangible asset amortization from the biomet merger.

zimmer biomet holdings, inc.   2016 form 10-k annual report operating expenses r&d expenses and r&d as a percentage of sales have increased over the last three years, driven primarily by the biomet merger and 2016 acquisitions. the combination of our r&d functions subsequent to the merger allow us to allocate a greater portion of the combined r&d spending towards innovation efforts to address unmet clinical needs and create new market adjacencies. additionally, most of our r&d activities occur in the u.s., so expenses do not decrease proportionally to changes in net sales when there are significant changes in foreign currency exchange rates, which contributes to an increase in r&d as a percentage of sales. we expect r&d spending in 2017 to stay consistent and be approximately 4.5 percent of sales.
sg&a expenses and sg&a as a percentage of sales have increased over the last three years, driven primarily by the biomet merger and 2016 acquisitions. we expect that sg&a as a percentage of sales will continue to be higher than prior to these mergers and acquisitions until we can realize synergy benefits of the transactions and further leverage sales growth. in 2017, we expect to make additional progress in our synergy programs with sg&a as a percentage of sales estimated to be approximately 37.5 percent of sales.

we recognize expenses resulting directly from our business combinations, employee termination benefits, certain r&d agreements, certain contract terminations, consulting and professional fees and asset impairment or loss on disposal charges connected with global restructuring, quality and operational excellence initiatives, and other items as special items in our consolidated statement of earnings. we recognized significant expenses in 2015 due to biomet merger-related expenses, such as the acceleration of unvested lvb stock options and lvb stock-based awards, retention bonuses paid to biomet employees and third-party sales agents who remained with biomet through the closing date, severance expense and contract terminations. expenses declined in 2016 due to the absence of certain of these expenses. see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for more information regarding special items charges.
other expense, interest income, interest expense, and income taxes in 2016, other expense, net, primarily included a $53.3 million loss on debt extinguishment. it also included losses on the sale of certain assets and the net expense related to remeasuring monetary assets and liabilities denominated in a foreign currency other than an entitys functional currency, offset by foreign currency forward exchange contracts we enter into to mitigate any gain or loss. in 2015, other expense, net, included a $22.0 million loss on debt extinguishment, debt issuance costs that we recognized for a bridge credit agreement that we entered into in may 2014 in connection with the biomet merger, the net expense related to remeasuring monetary assets and liabilities, partially offset by a gain related to selling certain product line rights and assets. in 2014, other expense, net, only included debt issuance costs that we recognized for the bridge credit agreement and the net expense related to remeasuring monetary assets and liabilities.
net interest expense has increased due to the issuance of the debt in connection with the ldr merger in july 2016 and biomet merger in march 2015.
our effective tax rate (etr) on earnings before income taxes for the years ended december 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 was 23.8 percent, 4.6 percent and 23.4 percent, respectively. we have incurred significant expenses associated with the biomet merger and other acquisitions which were generally recognized in higher income tax jurisdictions. accordingly, this reduced our etr as our earnings were lower in these higher income tax jurisdictions. additionally, other discrete adjustments have occurred that have significantly affected our etr. in 2016, we recognized $40.6 million of tax benefits from the favorable resolution of certain tax matters with taxing authorities. these benefits were partially offset by $27.6 million of additional tax provisions related to finalizing the tax accounts of the biomet merger. the low 2015 tax rate resulted from operating losses in the u.s. caused by significant expenses incurred in connection with the merger. our etr in future periods could potentially be impacted by changes in our mix of pre-tax earnings; changes in tax rates, tax laws or their interpretation, including the european union rules on state aid; the outcome of various federal, state and foreign audits; and the expiration of certain statutes of limitations. currently, we cannot reasonably estimate the impact of these items on our financial results.
segment operating profit similar to our consolidated results, our segment operating profit has been significantly impacted by the addition of biomet sales and expenses to these segments. in the americas, operating profit as a percentage of sales increased due to synergies from the biomet merger and a two year moratorium on the u.s. medical device excise tax for the calendar years of 2016 and 2017. under the applicable accounting rules that we applied to the u.s. medical device excise tax, we still had a portion of the tax paid prior to the moratorium included in the cost of inventory and continued to recognize expense, albeit at a lower level than in 2015, related to the tax through the fourth quarter of 2016. in 2017, we intend to invest the savings from the medical device excise tax moratorium into our business in areas such as r&d, sales force specialization and medical training and education.
in emea, operating profit as a percentage of sales declined due to the increased expenses related to the biomet merger, lower average selling prices and a reduced impact of hedge gains. in emea, even though our integration plans are on schedule, it will take longer to realize the full synergies of the merger compared to other segments due to the multiple

non-gaap operating performance measures we use financial measures that differ from financial measures determined in accordance with gaap to evaluate our operating performance. these non-gaap financial measures exclude the impact of inventory step-up; certain inventory and manufacturing-related charges connected to discontinuing certain product lines, quality enhancement and remediation efforts; intangible asset amortization; special items; certain claims; financing and other expenses/gains related to the biomet merger and other acquisitions; debt extinguishment; the interest expense incurred on the senior notes issued in connection with the biomet merger during the period prior to the consummation of the biomet merger; any related effects on our income tax provision associated with these items and other certain tax adjustments. other certain tax adjustments primarily include internal restructuring transactions to integrate biomet operations and facilitate access to offshore earnings, resolution of certain matters with taxing authorities, adjustments to deferred tax liabilities recognized as part of acquisition-related accounting, the resolution of unrecognized tax positions established through goodwill as part of acquisition accounting that had not previously been recognized in the earnings of the acquired company and any tax item that would otherwise be distortive to the expected future tax rate. we use these non-gaap financial measures internally to evaluate the performance of the business and believe they are useful measures that provide meaningful supplemental information to investors to consider when evaluating our performance. we believe these measures offer the ability to make period-to-period comparisons that are not impacted by certain items that can cause dramatic changes in reported operating results, to perform trend analysis, to better identify operating trends that may otherwise be masked or distorted by these types of items and to provide additional transparency of certain items. in addition, certain of these non-gaap financial measures are used as performance metrics in our incentive compensation programs.
our non-gaap adjusted net earnings used for internal management purposes for the years ended december 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 were $1,610.8 million, $1,310.5 million, and $1,098.0 million, respectively, and our non-gaap adjusted diluted earnings per share were $7.96, $6.90, and $6.40, respectively.
the following are reconciliations from our gaap net earnings and diluted earnings per share to our non-gaap adjusted net earnings and non-gaap adjusted diluted earnings per share used for internal management purposes (in millions, except per share amounts).

liquidity and capital resources cash flows provided by operating activities increased to $1,632.2 million in 2016 compared to $849.8 million and $1,060.5 million in 2015 and 2014, respectively. the increased operating cash flows in 2016 were primarily from the inclusion of biomet cash flows for the entire year. we also sold $103.1 million of our accounts receivable in certain countries in 2016, which improved operating cash flows. conversely, in 2015 we had various significant cash outflows, including a $97.6 million loss on our forward starting interest rate swaps we settled and expenses related to completing the biomet merger. in 2017, we expect operating cash flows to be in a range of $1,750.0 million to $1,900.0 million.
cash flows used in investing activities were $1,691.5 million in 2016 compared to $7,557.9 million and $469.4 million in 2015 and 2014, respectively. instrument and property, plant and equipment additions increased due to the biomet merger as we continue to invest in the combined company product portfolio and optimize our manufacturing and logistics network. purchases and sales of investments in debt securities declined because as investments matured, we used the cash to pay off debt and repurchase shares of our common stock. in the 2016 period, we also invested in the cayenne, ctc, ldr, cd diagnostics and medtech acquisitions and other various assets. in 2017, we expect to spend approximately $330.0 million on instruments and $170.0 million on property, plant and equipment to support the ongoing business.
cash flows used in financing activities were $743.2 million in 2016. this reflected approximately $1,010.0 million of net principal repayments on the senior notes and term loan we issued in 2015 for the biomet merger. we also borrowed $750.0 million in 2016 for the ldr merger.
in february, may, july and december 2016, our board of directors declared cash dividends of $0.24 per share. we expect to continue paying cash dividends on a quarterly basis; however, future dividends are subject to approval of the board of directors and may be adjusted as business needs or market conditions change. as further discussed below, our debt facilities restrict the payment of dividends in certain circumstances.
in february 2016, our board of directors authorized a new $1.0 billion share repurchase program effective march 1, 2016, with no expiration date. the previous program expired on february 29, 2016. as of december 31, 2016, all $1.0 billion remained authorized for repurchase under the program.
we will continue to exercise disciplined capital allocation designed to drive stockholder value creation. we intend to use available cash for reinvestment in the business, debt repayment, dividends and opportunistic share repurchases. if the right opportunities arise, we may also use available cash to pursue business development opportunities.
in order to achieve operational synergies, we expect cash outlays related to our integration plans to be approximately $310.0 million in 2017. these cash outlays are necessary to achieve our integration goals of net annual pre-tax operating profit synergies of $350.0 million by mid-2018.
as discussed in note 16 to our consolidated financial statements, the internal revenue service (irs) has issued proposed adjustments for years 2005 through 2009 reallocating profits between certain of our u.s. and foreign subsidiaries. we have disputed these proposed adjustments and continue to pursue resolution with the irs. although the ultimate timing for resolution of the disputed tax issues is uncertain, future payments may be significant to our operating cash flows.
as discussed in note 20 to our consolidated financial statements, as of december 31, 2016, a short-term liability of $75.0 million and long-term liability of $218.6 million related to durom cup product liability claims was recorded on our consolidated balance sheet. we expect to continue paying these claims over the next few years. we expect to be reimbursed a portion of these payments for product liability claims from insurance carriers. as of december 31, 2016, we have received a portion of the insurance proceeds we estimate we will recover. we have a long-term receivable of $95.3 million remaining for future expected reimbursements from our insurance carriers. we also had a short-term liability of $57.4 million related to biomet metal-on-metal hip implant claims.
at december 31, 2016, we had twelve tranches of senior notes outstanding as follows (dollars in millions):

zimmer biomet holdings, inc.   2016 form 10-k annual report that will mature on september 30, 2021. there were no outstanding borrowings on this facility as of december 31, 2016. we also have other available uncommitted credit facilities totaling $47.1 million.
for additional information on our debt, see note 12 to our consolidated financial statements.
we place our cash and cash equivalents in highly-rated financial institutions and limit the amount of credit exposure to any one entity. we invest only in high-quality financial instruments in accordance with our internal investment policy.
as of december 31, 2016, $408.6 million of our cash and cash equivalents were held in jurisdictions outside of the u.s. of this amount, $77.8 million is denominated in u.s. dollars and, therefore, bears no foreign currency translation risk. the balance of these assets is denominated in currencies of the various countries where we operate.
in light of our commitments under various credit facilities, as well as our expectation for continued business development, we have plans to repatriate a significant portion of our offshore earnings to the u.s. in particular, as a result of the biomet merger, we have unremitted foreign earnings of $3,658.7 million, which we plan to repatriate to the u.s. in future periods. we have estimated a long-term deferred tax liability of $1,190.7 million for the estimated tax impact of this repatriation.
management believes that cash flows from operations and available borrowings under the multicurrency revolving facility are sufficient to meet our working capital, capital expenditure and debt service needs, as well as to return cash to stockholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases. should additional investment opportunities arise, we believe that our earnings, balance sheet and cash flows will allow us to obtain additional capital, if necessary.
contractual obligations we have entered into contracts with various third parties in the normal course of business that will require future payments. the following table illustrates our contractual obligations (in millions):

$82.2 million of the other long-term liabilities on our balance sheet as of december 31, 2016 are liabilities related to defined benefit pension plans. defined benefit plan liabilities are based upon the underfunded status of the respective plans; they are not based upon future contributions. due to uncertainties regarding future plan asset performance, changes in interest rates and our intentions with respect to voluntary contributions, we are unable to reasonably estimate future contributions beyond 2016. therefore, this table does not include any amounts related to future contributions to our plans. see note 15 to our consolidated financial statements for further information on our defined benefit plans.
also included in other long-term liabilities on our balance sheet are liabilities related to unrecognized tax benefits and corresponding interest and penalties thereon. due to the uncertainties inherent in these liabilities, such as the ultimate timing and resolution of tax audits, we are unable to reasonably estimate the amount or period in which potential tax payments related to these positions will be made. therefore, this table does not include any obligations related to unrecognized tax benefits. we have also excluded long-term deferred tax liabilities from this table, as they do not represent liabilities that will be settled in cash. see note 16 to our consolidated financial statements for further information on these tax-related accounts.
we have entered into various agreements that may result in future payments dependent upon various events such as the achievement of certain product r&d milestones, sales milestones, or, at our discretion, to maintain exclusive rights to distribute a product. since there is uncertainty on the timing or whether such payments will have to be made, we have not included them in this table. these payments could range from $0 to $57 million.
critical accounting estimates our financial results are affected by the selection and application of accounting policies and methods. significant accounting policies which require managements judgment are discussed below.
excess inventory and instruments  we must determine as of each balance sheet date how much, if any, of our inventory may ultimately prove to be unsaleable or unsaleable at our carrying cost. similarly, we must also determine if instruments on hand will be put to productive use or remain undeployed as a result of excess supply. accordingly, inventory and instruments are written down to their net realizable value. to determine the appropriate net realizable value, we evaluate current stock levels in relation to historical and expected patterns of demand for all of our products and instrument systems and components. the basis for the determination is generally the same for all inventory and instrument items and categories except for work-in-process inventory, which is recorded at cost. obsolete or discontinued items are generally destroyed and completely written off. management evaluates the need for changes to inventory and instruments net realizable values based on market conditions, competitive offerings and other factors on a regular basis.
income taxes  our income tax expense, deferred tax assets and liabilities and reserves for unrecognized tax benefits
29
zimmer biomet holdings, inc.   2016 form 10-k annual report reflect managements best assessment of estimated future taxes to be paid. we are subject to income taxes in the u.s. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. significant judgments and estimates are required in determining the consolidated income tax expense.
we estimate income tax expense and income tax liabilities and assets by taxable jurisdiction. realization of deferred tax assets in each taxable jurisdiction is dependent on our ability to generate future taxable income sufficient to realize the benefits. we evaluate deferred tax assets on an ongoing basis and provide valuation allowances unless we determine it is more likely than not that the deferred tax benefit will be realized. federal income taxes are provided on the portion of the income of foreign subsidiaries that is expected to be remitted to the u.s.
the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws and regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions across our global operations. we are subject to regulatory review or audit in virtually all of those jurisdictions and those reviews and audits may require extended periods of time to resolve. we record our income tax provisions based on our knowledge of all relevant facts and circumstances, including existing tax laws, our experience with previous settlement agreements, the status of current examinations and our understanding of how the tax authorities view certain relevant industry and commercial matters.
we recognize tax liabilities in accordance with the financial accounting standards boards (fasb) guidance on income taxes and we adjust these liabilities when our judgment changes as a result of the evaluation of new information not previously available. due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the tax liabilities. these differences will be reflected as increases or decreases to income tax expense in the period in which they are determined.
commitments and contingencies  accruals for product liability and other claims are established with the assistance of internal and external legal counsel based on current information and historical settlement information for claims, related legal fees and for claims incurred but not reported. we use an actuarial model to assist management in determining an appropriate level of accruals for product liability claims. historical patterns of claim loss development over time are statistically analyzed to arrive at factors which are then applied to loss estimates in the actuarial model.
in addition to our general product liability, we have recorded provisions totaling $479.4 million related to the durom cup. see note 20 to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the durom cup litigation.
goodwill and intangible assets  we evaluate the carrying value of goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets annually, or whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. we evaluate the carrying value of finite life intangible assets whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. significant assumptions are required to estimate the fair value of goodwill and intangible assets, most notably estimated future cash flows generated by these assets. as such, these fair value measurements use significant unobservable inputs. changes to these assumptions could require us to record impairment charges on these assets.
we have seven reporting units with goodwill assigned to them. in our 2016 impairment test, our emea reporting units estimated fair value only exceeded the carrying value of its net assets by 8 percent, or approximately $240 million. the goodwill balance of the emea reporting unit at the time of the impairment test was $1,326.0 million. this reporting units estimated fair value continues to be lower than in past years due to the weakening of the euro against the u.s. dollar. we estimated the fair value of this reporting unit by using a combination of income and market approaches. fair value under the income approach was determined by discounting to present value the estimated future cash flows of the reporting unit. fair value under the market approach utilized the guideline public company methodology, which uses valuation indicators determined from other businesses that are similar to the reporting unit. in estimating the future cash flows of the reporting unit, we utilized a combination of market and company-specific inputs that a market participant would use in assessing the fair value of the reporting unit. the primary market input was revenue growth rates. these rates were based on historical trends and estimated future growth drivers such as an aging population, obesity and more active lifestyles. significant company-specific inputs included assumptions regarding how the reporting unit could leverage operating expenses as revenue grows and the impact any new products will have on revenues. discount rates used to determine the present value of the estimated future cash flows considered the weighted average cost of capital of other comparable companies and the country risk of our reporting unit. under the guideline public company methodology, we took into consideration differences between the reporting unit and the comparable companies.
the emea reporting unit remains sensitive to changes in market conditions. if estimated cash flows for this reporting unit decrease, we may be required to record impairment charges in the future. the cash flows used in our annual impairment test are estimates and therefore involve uncertainty. factors that could result in our actual cash flows being lower than our current estimates include: 1) decreased revenues caused by unforeseen changes in these areas of the healthcare market, our inability to generate new product revenue from our research and development activities, or macroeconomic factors that may affect consumers ability to pay for these products and 2) our inability to achieve the estimated operating margins for these reporting units forecasts due to unforeseen factors. additionally, changes in the broader economic environment could cause changes to our estimated discount rates or comparable company valuation indicators, which may impact our estimated fair values.
for our other six reporting units, their estimated fair value exceeded their carrying value by more than 15 percent.

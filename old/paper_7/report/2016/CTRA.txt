item 7.    management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion is intended to assist you in understanding our results of operations and our present financial condition. our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10-k contain additional information that should be referred to when reviewing this material.
overview financial and operating overview financial and operating results for the year ended december 31, 2016 compared to the year ended december 31, 2015 are as follows:
•   equivalent production increased 24.6 bcfe, or 4%, from 602.5 bcfe, or 1,650.8 mmcfe per day, in 2015 to 627.1 bcfe, or 1,713.4 mmcfe per day, in 2016.
•   natural gas production increased 34.4 bcf, or 6%, from 566.0 bcf in 2015 to 600.4 bcf in 2016, as a result of drilling and completion activities in pennsylvania, partially offset by the divestiture of certain oil and gas properties in east texas in early 2016.
•   crude oil/condensate/ngl production decreased 1.6 mmbbls, or 27%, from 6.1 mmbbls in 2015 to 4.5 mmbbls in 2016, as a result of a decrease in drilling activities in south texas.
•   average realized natural gas price for 2016 was $1.70 per mcf, 21% lower than the $2.15 per mcf price realized in 2015.
•   average realized crude oil price for 2016 was $37.30 per bbl, 18% lower than the $45.72 per bbl price realized in 2015.
•   drilled 40 gross wells (38.0 net) with a success rate of 100.0% in 2016 compared to 138 gross wells (130.5 net) with a success rate of 100.0% in 2015.
•   completed 76 gross wells (76.0 net) in 2016 compared to 107 gross wells (98.9 net) in 2015.
•   total capital expenditures were $372.5 million in 2016 compared to $773.5 million in 2015.
•   average rig count during 2016 was approximately 1.1 rigs in the marcellus shale and approximately 0.3 rigs in the eagle ford shale, compared to an average rig count in the marcellus shale of approximately 3.5 rigs and approximately 1.9 rigs in the eagle ford shale during 2015.
•   in february 2016, we completed a public offering of our common stock and received net proceeds of $995.6 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions.
•   in february 2016, we received proceeds of $50.1 million primarily related to the divestiture of certain proved and unproved oil and gas properties in east texas.
•   in may 2016, we repurchased $64.0 million principal amount of our 6.51% weighted-average senior notes for approximately $68.3 million.
•   in december 2016, we recognized an impairment loss of $435.6 million associated with our oil and gas properties and related pipeline assets in west virginia and virginia.
market conditions and commodity prices our financial results depend on many factors, particularly the price of natural gas and crude oil and our ability to market our production on economically attractive terms. commodity prices are affected by many factors outside of our control, including changes in market supply and demand, which are impacted by pipeline capacity constraints, inventory storage levels, basis differentials, weather conditions and other factors. in addition, our realized prices are further impacted by our hedging activities. as a result, we cannot accurately predict future commodity prices and, therefore, we cannot determine with any degree of certainty what effect increases or decreases in these prices will have on our capital program, production volumes or revenues. location differentials have increased in certain regions, such as in the appalachian region, resulting in further declines in natural gas prices. we expect natural gas and crude oil prices to remain volatile. in addition to production volumes and commodity prices, finding and developing sufficient amounts of natural gas and crude oil reserves at economical costs are critical to our long-term success. for information about the impact of realized commodity prices on our natural gas and crude

oil and condensate revenues, refer to "results of operations" below. see "risk factors-natural gas and oil prices fluctuate widely, and low prices for an extended period would likely have a material adverse impact on our business" and "risk factors-our future performance depends on our ability to find or acquire additional natural gas and oil reserves that are economically recoverable" in item 1a.
we account for our derivative instruments on a mark-to-market basis with changes in fair value recognized in operating revenues in the consolidated statement of operations. as a result of these mark-to-market adjustments associated with our derivative instruments, we will experience volatility in our earnings due to commodity price volatility. refer to "impact of derivative instruments on operating revenues" below and note 6 to the consolidated financial statements for more information.
commodity prices have remained volatile and have improved during the fourth quarter of 2016 compared to the fourth quarter of 2015 but have yet to recover to levels experienced in 2014. in the event that commodity prices significantly decline, management would test the recoverability of the carrying value of its oil and gas properties and, if necessary, record an impairment charge.
we believe we are well-positioned to manage the challenges presented in the current commodity pricing environment, and we can endure the current cyclical downturn in the oil and gas industry and the continued volatility in current and future commodity prices by:
•   continuing to exercise discipline in our capital program by fully funding our capital expenditures with operating cash flows.
•   continuing to optimize our drilling, completion and operational efficiencies, resulting in lower operating costs per unit of production.
•   continuing to manage our balance sheet, which included the issuance of common stock in february 2016. our common stock issuance allowed us to pay down the outstanding balance under our revolving credit facility and certain of our senior notes, leaving us with sufficient availability under our revolving credit facility and existing cash balances to meet our capital requirements and maintain compliance with our debt covenants.
•   continuing to manage price risk by strategically hedging our natural gas and crude oil production.
financial condition capital resources and liquidity our primary sources of cash in 2016 were from funds generated from the sale of common stock, the sale of natural gas and oil production and proceeds from the sale of assets. these cash flows were primarily used to fund our capital expenditures (including contributions to our equity method investments), repayment of indebtedness under our revolving credit facility and to repurchase certain of our senior notes, interest payments on debt and payment of dividends. see below for additional discussion and analysis of cash flow.
in february 2016, we sold an aggregate of 50.6 million shares of common stock at a price of $19.675 per share and received $995.6 million in net proceeds, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions. these net proceeds were used for general corporate purposes, including repaying indebtedness under our revolving credit facility, repurchasing certain of our senior notes.
the borrowing base under the terms of our revolving credit facility is redetermined annually in april. in addition, either we or the banks may request an interim redetermination twice a year or in connection with certain acquisitions or divestitures of oil and gas properties. effective april 19, 2016, our borrowing base was reduced from $3.4 billion to $3.2 billion. the maximum credit amount under the revolving credit facility remained unchanged at $1.8 billion; however, the available commitments were reduced to $1.6 billion at the time of redetermination.
in may 2016, we repurchased $64.0 million principal amount of our 6.51% weighted-average senior notes for approximately $68.3 million. a $4.7 million extinguishment loss was recognized in the second quarter of 2016 associated with the premium paid and the write-off of a portion of the related deferred financing costs due to early repayment. as a result of the repurchase of these senior notes, the available commitments under the revolving credit facility increased to $1.7 billion and remained at that level as of december 31, 2016.
39
a decline in commodity prices could result in the future reduction of our borrowing base and related commitments under the revolving credit facility. unless commodity prices decline significantly from current levels, we do not believe that any such reductions would have a significant impact on our ability to service our debt and fund our drilling program and related operations.
we strive to manage our debt at a level below the available credit line in order to maintain borrowing capacity. our revolving credit facility includes a covenant limiting our total debt. we believe that, with the existing cash on hand, internally generated cash flow and availability under our revolving credit facility, we have the capacity to finance our spending plans.
as of december 31, 2016, we had no borrowings outstanding and unused commitments of $1.7 billion under our revolving credit facility. at december 31, 2015, we had $413.0 million of borrowings outstanding under our revolving credit facility.
at december 31, 2016, we were in compliance with all restrictive financial covenants for both the revolving credit facility and senior notes. see note 5 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further details regarding our debt.
cash flows our cash flows from operating activities, investing activities and financing activities are as follows:
year ended december 31,
(in thousands)                                                     2016   2015                    2014
cash flows provided by operating activities               $392,377                $740,737                $1,236,435
cash flows used in investing activities                   (353,218    )           (993,334    )           (1,664,840    )
cash flows provided by financing activities                458,869                 232,157                   425,959
net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents      $498,028                $(20,440    )              $(2,446    )
operating activities. operating cash flow fluctuations are substantially driven by commodity prices and changes in our production volumes and operating expenses. prices for natural gas and crude oil have historically been volatile, primarily as a result of supply and demand for natural gas and crude oil, pipeline infrastructure constraints and seasonal influences. in addition, fluctuations in cash flow may result in an increase or decrease in our capital expenditures. see "results of operations" for a review of the impact of prices and volumes on revenues.
our working capital is substantially influenced by the variables discussed above and fluctuates based on the timing and amount of borrowings and repayments under our revolving credit facility, the timing of cash collections and payments on our trade accounts receivable and payable, respectively, sales of our securities and changes in the fair value of our commodity derivative activity. from time to time, our working capital will reflect a deficit, while at other times it will reflect a surplus. this fluctuation is not unusual. at december 31, 2016 and 2015, we had a working capital surplus of $458.1 million and a deficit of $90.8 million, respectively. we believe we have adequate liquidity and availability under our revolving credit facility available to meet our working capital requirements over the next twelve months.
net cash provided by operating activities in 2016 decreased by $348.4 million when compared to 2015. this decrease was primarily due to unfavorable changes in working capital and other assets and liabilities and lower operating revenues, partially offset by lower operating expenses (excluding non-cash expenses). the decrease in operating revenues was primarily due to a decrease in realized natural gas and crude oil prices, partially offset by an increase in equivalent production. average realized natural gas and crude oil prices decreased by 21% and 18%, respectively, for 2016 compared to 2015. equivalent production increased by 4% for 2016 over 2015 as a result of higher natural gas production in the marcellus shale, partially offset by lower oil production in the eagle ford shale.
net cash provided by operating activities in 2015 decreased by $495.7 million when compared to 2014. this decrease was primarily due to lower operating revenues and higher operating expenses (excluding non-cash expenses), partially offset by favorable changes in working capital and other assets and liabilities. the decrease in operating revenues was primarily due to a decrease in realized natural gas and crude oil prices, partially offset by an increase in equivalent production. average realized natural gas and crude oil prices decreased by 34% and 48%, respectively, for 2015 compared to 2014. equivalent production volumes increased by 13% for 2015 over 2014 as a result of higher natural gas production in the marcellus shale and higher oil production in the eagle ford shale.
40
see "results of operations" for additional information relative to commodity price, production and operating expense fluctuations. we are unable to predict future commodity prices and, as a result, cannot provide any assurance about future levels of net cash provided by operating activities.
investing activities. cash flows used in investing activities decreased by $640.1 million from 2015 to 2016 due to a decrease of $580.4 million in capital expenditures, $16.3 million lower acquisition costs and $42.8 million higher proceeds from the sale of assets.
cash flows used in investing activities decreased by $671.5 million from 2014 to 2015 due to a decrease of $524.0 million in capital expenditures, $198.4 million lower acquisition costs and a $9.0 million decrease in capital contributions associated with our equity method investments. these decreases were partially offset by a $31.8 million decrease in proceeds from the sale of assets and $28.1 million of changes in restricted cash balances.
financing activities. cash flows provided by financing activities increased by $226.7 million from 2015 to 2016 due to $995.3 million of net proceeds related to the issuance of common stock and lower capitalized debt issuance costs of $4.6 million related to the amendment of our revolving credit facility and senior notes in december 2015. these increases were partially offset by $770.0 million of higher net repayments of debt due to the repayment of the outstanding balance on our revolving credit facility and certain of our senior notes with the proceeds from the issuance of common stock and $3.1 million of higher dividend payments.
cash flows provided by financing activities decreased by $193.8 million from 2014 to 2015 due to $332.0 million of lower net borrowings and an increase in cash paid for capitalized debt issuance costs of $2.2 million related to the amendment of our credit facility in april 2015. these decreases were partially offset by lower treasury stock repurchases of $138.9 million as no shares were repurchased in 2015 and a decrease of $1.4 million in tax benefits associated with our stock-based compensation.

amounts related to our asset retirement obligation are not included in the above table given the uncertainty regarding the actual timing of such expenditures. the total amount of our asset retirement obligation at december 31, 2016 was $133.7 million. see note 8 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further details.
we have no off-balance sheet debt or other similar unrecorded obligations.
potential impact of our critical accounting policies our significant accounting policies are described in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements. the preparation of the consolidated financial statements, which is in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states, requires management to make certain estimates and judgments that affect the amounts reported in our financial statements and the related disclosures of assets and liabilities. the following accounting policies are our most critical policies requiring more significant judgments and estimates. we evaluate our estimates and assumptions on a regular basis. actual results could differ from those estimates.
successful efforts method of accounting we follow the successful efforts method of accounting for our oil and gas producing activities. acquisition costs for proved and unproved properties are capitalized when incurred. judgment is required to determine the proper classification of wells designated as developmental or exploratory, which will ultimately determine the proper accounting treatment of costs incurred. exploration costs, including geological and geophysical costs, the costs of carrying and retaining unproved properties and exploratory dry hole costs are expensed. development costs, including costs to drill and equip development wells and successful exploratory drilling costs to locate proved reserves are capitalized.
oil and gas reserves the process of estimating quantities of proved reserves is inherently imprecise, and the reserve data included in this document are only estimates. the process relies on interpretations and judgment of available geological, geophysical, engineering and production data. the extent, quality and reliability of this technical data can vary. the process also requires certain economic assumptions, some of which are mandated by the sec, such as natural gas and crude oil prices. additional assumptions include drilling and operating expenses, capital expenditures, taxes and availability of funds. any significant variance in the interpretations or assumptions could materially affect the estimated quantity and value of our reserves and can change substantially over time. periodic revisions to the estimated reserves and future cash flows may be necessary as a result of reservoir performance, drilling activity, commodity prices, fluctuations in operating expenses, technological advances, new geological or geophysical data or other economic factors. accordingly, reserve estimates are generally different from the quantities ultimately recovered. we cannot predict the amounts or timing of such future revisions.
our reserves have been prepared by our petroleum engineering staff and audited by miller and lents, independent petroleum engineers, who in their opinion determined the estimates presented to be reasonable in the aggregate. for more information regarding reserve estimation, including historical reserve revisions, refer to the supplemental oil and gas information to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8.
our rate of recording depreciation, depletion and amortization (dd&a) expense is dependent upon our estimate of proved and proved developed reserves, which are utilized in our unit-of-production calculation. if the estimates of proved reserves were to be reduced, the rate at which we record dd&a expense would increase, reducing net income. such a reduction in reserves may result from lower market prices, which may make it uneconomic to drill and produce higher cost fields. a 5% positive or negative revision to proved reserves would result in a decrease of $0.04 per mcfe and an increase of $0.04 per mcfe, respectively, on our dd&a rate. revisions in significant fields may individually affect our dd&a rate. it is estimated that a positive or negative reserve revision of 10% in one of our most productive fields would result in a decrease of $0.05 per mcfe and an increase of $0.06 per mcfe, respectively, on our total dd&a rate. these estimated impacts are based on current data, and actual events could require different adjustments to our dd&a rate.
in addition, a decline in proved reserve estimates may impact the outcome of our impairment test under applicable accounting standards. due to the inherent imprecision of the reserve estimation process, risks associated with the operations of proved producing properties and market sensitive commodity prices utilized in our impairment analysis, management cannot determine if an impairment is reasonably likely to occur in the future.
carrying value of oil and gas properties we evaluate our proved oil and gas properties for impairment on a field-by-field basis whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate an asset's carrying amount may not be recoverable. we compare expected undiscounted future cash flows to the net book value of the asset. if the future undiscounted expected cash flows, based on our estimate of future natural
43
gas and crude oil prices, operating costs and anticipated production from proved reserves and risk-adjusted probable and possible reserves, are lower than the net book value of the asset, the capitalized cost is reduced to fair value. commodity pricing is estimated by using a combination of assumptions management uses in its budgeting and forecasting process, historical and current prices adjusted for geographical location and quality differentials, as well as other factors that management believes will impact realizable prices. in the event that commodity prices significantly decline, management would test the recoverability of the carrying value of its oil and gas properties and, if necessary, record an impairment charge. fair value is calculated by discounting the future cash flows. the discount factor used is based on rates utilized by market participants that are commensurate with the risks inherent in the development and production of the underlying natural gas and oil.
unproved oil and gas properties are assessed periodically for impairment on an aggregate basis through periodic updates to our undeveloped acreage amortization based on past drilling and exploration experience, our expectation of converting leases to held by production and average property lives. average property lives are determined on a geographical basis and based on the estimated life of unproved property leasehold rights. historically, the average property life in each of the geographical areas has not significantly changed and generally range from three to five years. the commodity price environment may impact the capital available for exploration projects as well as development drilling. we have considered these impacts when determining the amortization rate of our undeveloped acreage, especially in exploratory areas. if the average unproved property life decreases or increases by one year, the amortization would increase by approximately $8.9 million or decrease by approximately $7.5 million, respectively, per year.
as these properties are developed and reserves are proved, the remaining capitalized costs are subject to depreciation and depletion. if the development of these properties is deemed unsuccessful, the capitalized costs related to the unsuccessful activity is expensed in the year the determination is made. the rate at which the unproved properties are written off depends on the timing and success of our future exploration and development program.
asset retirement obligations the majority of our asset retirement obligations (aro) relates to the plugging and abandonment of oil and gas wells and to a lesser extent meter stations, pipelines, processing plants and compressors. we record the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation in the period in which it is incurred, with the associated asset retirement cost capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the related long-lived asset. the recognition of an asset retirement obligation requires management to make assumptions that include estimated plugging and abandonment costs, timing of settlements, inflation rates and discount rate. in periods subsequent to initial measurement, the asset retirement cost is depreciated using the units-of-production method, while increases in the discounted aro liability resulting from the passage of time (accretion expense) are reflected as depreciation, depletion and amortization expense.
accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities under applicable accounting standards, the fair value of each derivative instrument is recorded as either an asset or liability on the balance sheet. at the end of each quarterly period, these instruments are marked-to-market. the change in fair value of derivatives not designated as hedges and the ineffective portion of the change in the fair value of derivatives designated as cash flow hedges and are recorded as a component of operating revenues in gain (loss) on derivative instruments in the consolidated statement of operations. the change in the fair value of derivatives designated as cash flow hedges that are effective are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in stockholders' equity in the consolidated balance sheet.
our derivative contracts are measured based on quotes from our counterparties. such quotes have been derived using an income approach that considers various inputs including current market and contractual prices for the underlying instruments, quoted forward prices for natural gas and crude oil, basis differentials, volatility factors and interest rates, such as a libor curve for a similar length of time as the derivative contract term, as applicable. these estimates are verified using relevant nymex futures contracts or are compared to multiple quotes obtained from counterparties for reasonableness. the determination of fair value also incorporates a credit adjustment for non-performance risk. we measure the non-performance risk of our counterparties by reviewing credit default swap spreads for the various financial institutions in which we have derivative transactions, while our non-performance risk is evaluated using a market credit spread provided by one of our banks.
our financial condition, results of operations and liquidity can be significantly impacted by changes in the market value of our derivative instruments due to volatility of natural gas and crude oil prices, both nymex and basis differentials.

income taxes we make certain estimates and judgments in determining our income tax expense for financial reporting purposes. these estimates and judgments include the calculation of certain deferred tax assets and liabilities that arise from differences in the timing and recognition of revenue and expenses for tax and financial reporting purposes and estimating reserves for potential adverse outcomes regarding tax positions that we have taken. we account for the uncertainty in income taxes using a recognition and measurement threshold for tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position is recognized when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination by taxing authorities based on technical merits of the position. the amount of the tax benefit recognized is the largest amount of the benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. the effective tax rate and the tax basis of assets and liabilities reflect management's estimates of the ultimate outcome of various tax uncertainties.
we believe all of our deferred tax assets, net of any valuation allowances, will ultimately be realized, taking into consideration our forecasted future taxable income, which includes consideration of future operating conditions specifically related to commodity prices. if our estimates and judgments change regarding our ability to realize our deferred tax assets, our tax provision could increase in the period it is determined that it is more likely than not it will not be realized.
our effective tax rate is subject to variability as a result of factors other than changes in federal and state tax rates and/or changes in tax laws which could affect us. our effective tax rate is affected by changes in the allocation of property, payroll and revenues among states in which we operate. a small change in our estimated future tax rate could have a material effect on current period earnings.
contingency reserves a provision for contingencies is charged to expense when the loss is probable and the cost is estimable. the establishment of a reserve is based on an estimation process that includes the advice of legal counsel and subjective judgment of management. in certain cases, management's judgment is based on the advice and opinions of legal counsel and other advisors, the interpretation of laws and regulations, which can be interpreted differently by regulators and courts of laws, our experience and the experiences of other companies dealing with similar matters, and our decision on how we intend to respond to a particular matter. actual losses can differ from estimates for various reasons, including those noted above. we monitor known and potential legal, environmental and other contingencies and make our best estimate based on the information we have. future changes in facts and circumstances not currently foreseeable could result in the actual liability exceeding the estimated ranges of loss and amounts accrued.
stock-based compensation we account for stock-based compensation under the fair value method of accounting in accordance with applicable accounting standards. under the fair value method, compensation cost is measured at the grant date for equity-classified awards and remeasured each reporting period for liability-classified awards based on the fair value of an award and is recognized over the service period, which is generally the vesting period. to calculate fair value, we use either a monte carlo or black-scholes valuation model, as determined by the specific provisions of the award. the use of these models requires significant judgment with respect to expected life, volatility and other factors. stock-based compensation cost for all types of awards is included in general and administrative expense in the consolidated statement of operations. see note 13 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for a full discussion of our stock-based compensation.
recently adopted accounting pronouncements refer to note 1 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements, "summary of significant accounting policies," for a discussion of recently adopted accounting pronouncements.
recently issued accounting pronouncements refer to note 1 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements, "summary of significant accounting policies," for a discussion of new accounting pronouncements that affect us.
other issues and contingencies regulations. our operations are subject to various types of regulation by federal, state and local authorities. see "regulation of oil and natural gas exploration and production," "natural gas marketing, gathering and transportation," "federal regulation of swap transactions," "federal regulation of petroleum," "pipeline safety regulation," and "environmental and safety regulations" in the "other business matters" section of item 1 for a discussion of these regulations.
45
restrictive covenants. our ability to incur debt and to make certain types of investments is subject to certain restrictive covenants in our various debt instruments. among other requirements, our senior note agreements and our revolving credit agreement specify a minimum annual coverage ratio of consolidated cash flow to interest expense for the trailing four quarters of 2.8 to 1.0, a minimum asset coverage ratio of the present value of proved reserves before income taxes plus adjusted cash to indebtedness and other liabilities of 1.25 to 1.0, which increases back to a ratio of 1.75 to 1.0 beginning on january 1, 2018, and a leverage ratio of debt to consolidated ebitdax of 4.75 to 1.0. through and including december 31, 2016. under the terms of the respective agreements, the leverage ratio will be adjusted to 4.25 to 1.0 through and including december 31, 2017 and 3.5 to 1.0 beginning on march 31, 2018 or until we maintain a leverage ratio below 3.0 to 1.0 for two consecutive fiscal quarters on or after december 31, 2017 or we receive an investment grade rating by standard & poor's ratings services (s&p) or moody's investor service, inc. (moody's), at which time we will no longer be subject to this covenant. our revolving credit agreement also requires us to maintain a minimum current ratio of 1.0 to 1.0. at december 31, 2016, we were in compliance with all restrictive financial covenants in both our senior note agreements and our revolving credit agreement.
operating risks and insurance coverage. our business involves a variety of operating risks. see "risk factors-we face a variety of hazards and risks that could cause substantial financial losses" in item 1a. in accordance with customary industry practice, we maintain insurance against some, but not all, of these risks and losses. the occurrence of any of these events not fully covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. the costs of these insurance policies are somewhat dependent on our historical claims experience, the areas in which we operate and market conditions.
commodity pricing and risk management activities. our revenues, operating results, financial condition and ability to borrow funds or obtain additional capital depend substantially on prevailing prices for natural gas and crude oil. further declines in natural gas and crude oil prices may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, liquidity, ability to obtain financing and operating results. lower natural gas and crude oil prices also may reduce the amount of natural gas and crude oil that we can produce economically. historically, natural gas and crude oil prices have been volatile, with prices fluctuating widely, and they are likely to continue to be volatile. depressed prices in the future would have a negative impact on our future financial results. in particular, substantially lower prices would significantly reduce revenue and could potentially trigger an impairment of our oil and gas properties or a violation of certain financial debt covenants. because our reserves are predominantly natural gas (approximately 97% of equivalent proved reserves), changes in natural gas prices may have a more significant impact on our financial results than oil prices.
the majority of our production is sold at market responsive prices. generally, if the related commodity index declines, the price that we receive for our production will also decline. furthermore, we have experienced widening basis differentials in certain regions, such as in the appalachian region, resulting in further declines in natural gas prices. therefore, the amount of revenue that we realize is determined by certain factors that are beyond our control. however, management may mitigate this price risk on a portion of our anticipated production with the use of commodity derivatives. most recently, we have used commodity derivatives such as collar, swap and basis swap arrangements to reduce the impact of sustained lower pricing on our revenue. under both arrangements, there is also a risk that the movement of index prices may result in our inability to realize the full benefit of an improvement in market conditions.
results of operations
2016 and 2015 compared we reported a net loss for 2016 of $417.1 million, or $0.91 per share, compared to net loss for 2015 of $113.9 million, or $0.28 per share. the increase in net loss was primarily due to lower operating revenues and higher operating expenses, partially offset by a higher income tax benefit.

natural gas revenues the decrease in natural gas revenues of $2.5 million was due to lower natural gas prices, partially offset by higher production. the increase in production was a result of our drilling and completion activities in pennsylvania, partially offset by the divestiture of certain oil and gas properties in east texas in early 2016.
crude oil and condensate revenues the decrease in crude oil and condensate revenues of $97.1 million was due to lower production and crude oil prices. the decrease in production was a result of a decrease in drilling and completion activities in south texas.

total costs and expenses from operations increased by $260.1 million from 2015 to 2016. the primary reasons for this fluctuation are as follows:
•   direct operations decreased $40.1 million largely due to improved operational efficiencies, cost reductions from service providers and suppliers in 2016 compared to 2015 and divestiture of certain oil and gas properties in east texas in february 2016.
•   transportation and gathering increased $9.0 million due to higher throughput as a result of higher marcellus shale production and the commencement of various transportation and gathering agreements in the marcellus shale throughout 2015.

•   brokered natural gas decreased $1.8 million from 2015 to 2016. see the preceding table titled "brokered natural gas" for further analysis.
•   taxes other than income decreased $13.6 million due to $7.2 million lower production taxes resulting from lower crude oil prices and production in south texas and the receipt of a production tax refund of $1.9 million in february 2016. additionally, drilling impact fees decreased $1.5 million as a result of drilling fewer wells in pennsylvania during 2016 compared to 2015 and ad valorem taxes decreased $3.8 million as a result of lower property values primarily in south texas. the remaining changes were not individually significant.
•   exploration increased $0.2 million as a result of a $6.7 million increase in exploratory dry hole expense, partially offset by lower charges related to the release of certain drilling rig contracts in south texas and $2.7 million lower geophysical and geological costs and other exploration expenses. during 2016, we recorded rig termination charges of $1.7 million, compared to $5.1 million during 2015.
•   depreciation, depletion and amortization decreased $32.1 million, of which $41.2 million was due to a lower dd&amp;a rate of $0.87 per mcfe for 2016 compared to $0.93 per mcfe for 2015, partially offset by a $23.0 million increase due to higher equivalent production volumes. the lower dd&amp;a rate was primarily due to lower cost reserve additions and the impairment charge recorded in the fourth quarter of 2015 associated with higher dd&amp;a rate fields. in addition, amortization of unproved properties decreased $16.4 million in 2016 as a result of lower lease acquisition costs and lower amortization rates.
•   impairment of oil and gas properties and other assets was $435.6 million in 2016 due to the impairment of oil and gas properties and related pipeline assets in west virginia and virginia. in 2015, we recognized an impairment of oil and gas properties of $114.9 million related to certain non-core fields in south texas, east texas and louisiana. the impairment of these fields was due to a significant decline in commodity prices in late 2015.
•   general and administrative increased $17.8 million due to higher stock-based compensation expense of $12.3 million primarily the result of an increase in the company's stock price during 2016 compared to 2015 and $2.7 million higher professional services. the remaining changes were not individually significant.
earnings (loss) on equity method investments the decrease in equity method earnings (loss) is the result of our proportionate share of net earnings from our equity method investments in 2016 compared to 2015.
gain (loss) on sale of assets during 2016, we recognized a net aggregate loss of $1.9 million primarily due to the sale of certain of our oil and gas properties in east and south texas. during 2015, we recognized a net aggregate gain of $3.9 million primarily due to the sale of certain unproved oil and gas properties in east texas.
loss on debt extinguishment a $4.7 million extinguishment loss was recognized in the second quarter of 2016 related to the premium paid for the repurchase of a portion of our 6.51% weighted-average senior notes in may 2016 and the write-off of a portion of the associated deferred financing costs due to early repayment.
interest expense interest expense decreased $8.6 million due to a $5.5 million decrease resulting from the repayment of the outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit facility in march 2016, which remained undrawn through december 31, 2016. interest expense also decreased $3.4 million resulting from the repurchase of a portion of our 6.51% weighted-average senior notes in may 2016 and the repayment of our 7.33% weighted-average senior notes at maturity. these decreases were offset by a $0.6 million increase in commitment fees as a result of an increase in the unused portion of the commitments under our revolving credit facility.
income tax benefit income tax benefit increased $169.1 million due to a higher pretax loss, partially offset by a lower effective tax rate. the effective tax rates for 2016 and 2015 were 36.8% and 39.2%, respectively. the decrease in the effective tax rate is primarily due to the impact of non-recurring discrete items recorded during 2016 compared to 2015.
49
we expect our 2017 effective income tax rate to be approximately 37.0%; however, this rate may fluctuate based on a number of factors, including but not limited to changes in enacted federal and/or state tax rates that occur during the year, as well as changes in the composition and location of our asset base, our employees and our customers.
2015 and 2014 compared we reported a net loss for 2015 of $113.9 million, or $0.28 per share, compared to net income for 2014 of $104.5 million, or $0.25 per share. the decrease in net income was primarily due to lower operating revenues, higher operating and interest expenses and a decrease in gain on sale of assets. these decreases were partially offset by lower impairments on oil and gas properties.

natural gas revenues the decrease in natural gas revenues of $565.6 million was due to lower natural gas prices, partially offset by higher production associated with the positive results of our marcellus shale drilling program in pennsylvania.
crude oil and condensate revenues the decrease in crude oil and condensate revenues of $65.7 million was due to lower crude oil prices, partially offset by higher production. the increase in production was a result of our oil-focused eagle ford shale drilling program in south texas and production associated with the south texas assets acquired in the fourth quarter of 2014.

total costs and expenses from operations decreased by $629.2 million from 2014 to 2015. the primary reasons for this fluctuation are as follows:
•   direct operations decreased $4.7 million largely due to cost reductions from suppliers, improved operational efficiencies and lower workover and plugging and abandonment expenses in 2015 compared to 2014. these decreases were partially offset by higher operating costs associated with the south texas assets acquired in the fourth quarter of 2014.
•   transportation and gathering increased $78.3 million due to higher throughput as a result of higher marcellus shale production, higher transportation rates and the commencement of various transportation and gathering agreements throughout 2014.
•   brokered natural gas decreased $17.4 million from 2014 to 2015. see the preceding table titled "brokered natural gas" for further analysis.
•   taxes other than income decreased $4.2 million due to $5.9 million lower production taxes resulting from lower crude oil and condensate revenues and $0.8 million lower drilling impact fees due to a decrease in our marcellus shale drilling activities. these decreases were partially offset by $2.0 million higher ad valorem taxes due to increased activity and the assets acquired in the fourth quarter of 2014 in south texas and $0.6 million higher franchise taxes.
•   exploration decreased $1.3 million as a result of lower exploratory dry hole costs of $4.5 million and $2.4 million lower geophysical and geological and other exploration expenses due to reduced activity. these decreases were partially offset by a $5.1 million charge related to the release of certain drilling rig contracts in south texas in the first half of 2015.
•   depreciation, depletion and amortization decreased $10.5 million, of which $117.3 million was due to a lower dd&amp;a rate of $0.93 per mcfe for 2015 compared to $1.13 per mcfe for 2014, partially offset by $79.9 million due to higher equivalent production volumes. the lower dd&amp;a rate was primarily due to lower cost reserve additions associated with our marcellus shale drilling program and the impairment charge recorded in the fourth quarter of 2014 associated with higher dd&amp;a rate fields. in addition, amortization of unproved properties increased $24.0 million as a result of ongoing evaluation of our unproved properties and the acquisition of undeveloped leaseholds in south texas in late 2014. accretion expense increased $1.8 million due to the acquisition of proved properties in south texas in late 2014 and an increase in asset retirement obligations as a result of revisions of previous estimates recorded in fourth quarter 2014.
•   impairment of oil and gas properties and other assets was $114.9 million in 2015 due to the impairment of certain non-core fields in south texas, east texas and louisiana. the impairment of these fields was due to a significant decline in commodity prices in late 2015. in 2014, we recognized an impairment of oil and gas properties and other assets of
52
$771.0 million related to certain non-core fields, primarily in east texas. the impairment of these fields was due to a significant decline in commodity prices in late 2014 and management's decision not to pursue activity in these non-core areas in the then current price environments.
•   general and administrative decreased $13.1 million due to lower stock-based compensation expense of $7.8 million primarily due to a decline in the company's stock price during 2015 compared to 2014 and $1.8 million lower incentive compensation expense. the remaining increase and decreases in other expenses were not individually significant.
earnings (loss) on equity method investments the increase in equity method earnings (loss) is the result of our proportionate share of net earnings from our equity method investments in 2015 compared to 2014.
gain (loss) on sale of assets during 2015, we recognized a net aggregate gain of $3.9 million primarily due to the sale of certain unproved oil and gas properties in east texas. during 2014, we recognized a net aggregate gain of $17.1 million primarily due to the sale of certain proved and unproved oil and gas properties in east texas.
interest expense interest expense increased $23.1 million due to $24.1 million of higher interest expense associated with our private placement in september 2014 of $925 million aggregate principal amount of senior notes with a weighted-average interest rate of 3.65% and higher commitment fees on the unused portion of our revolving credit facility of $1.0 million. these increases were partially offset by a decrease in interest expense of $1.7 million associated with our revolving credit facility due to a decrease in weighted-average borrowings based on daily balances of approximately $347.2 million compared to approximately $410.0 million during 2015 and 2014, respectively.
income tax benefit income tax benefit increased $1.3 million due to lower pretax income, partially offset by a higher effective tax rate.  the effective tax rates for 2015 and 2014 were 39.2% and (222.4)%, respectively. the overall effective tax rate for 2014 was significantly lower due to a change in our effective state income tax rates based on updated state apportionment factors in states in which we operate. the 2014 decrease in our state apportionment factors was primarily driven by a shift in the sourcing of revenues based on the location of customers to whom we ultimately sell our natural gas in the northeast united states. the 2014 decrease in effective state income tax rates significantly affected our estimated net state deferred tax liabilities reflected in our consolidated balance sheet, resulting in an income tax benefit of approximately $87.0 million that was reflected in our provision for income taxes in 2014.

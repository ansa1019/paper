overview we are a fully integrated, self-administered and self-managed real estate investment trust, or reit, formed to continue the business commenced in 1977 by extra space storage llc and its subsidiaries to own, operate, manage, acquire, develop and redevelop professionally managed stores.
at december 31, 2016, we owned, had ownership interests in, or managed 1,427 operating stores in 38 states, washington, d.c. and puerto rico. of these 1,427 operating stores, we owned 836, we held joint venture interests in 180 stores, and our taxable reit subsidiary, extra space management, inc., operated an additional 411 stores that are owned by third parties. these operating stores contain approximately 107 million square feet of rentable space in approximately 960,000 units and currently serve a customer base of approximately 850,000 tenants.
our stores are generally situated in convenient, highly visible locations clustered around large population centers such as atlanta, baltimore/washington, d.c., boston, chicago, dallas, houston, las vegas, los angeles, miami, new york city, orlando, philadelphia, phoenix, st. petersburg/tampa and san francisco/oakland. these areas all enjoy above average population growth and income levels. the clustering of our assets around these population centers enables us to reduce our operating costs through economies of scale. we consider a store to be in the lease-up stage after it has been issued a certificate of occupancy, but before it has achieved stabilization. we consider a store to be stabilized once it has achieved either an 80% occupancy rate for a full year measured as of january 1 of the current year, or has been open for three years prior to the january 1 of the current year.
to maximize the performance of our stores, we employ industry-leading revenue management systems. developed by our management team, these systems enable us to analyze, set and adjust rental rates in real time across our portfolio in order to respond to changing market conditions. we believe our systems and processes allow us to more proactively manage revenues.
we derive substantially all of our revenues from rents received from tenants under leases at each of our wholly-owned stores, from management fees on the stores we manage for joint-venture partners and unaffiliated third parties, and from our tenant reinsurance program. our management fee is generally equal to approximately 6.0% of cash collected from total revenues generated by the managed stores. we also receive an asset management fee of 0.5% of the total asset value from one of our joint ventures.
we operate in competitive markets, often where consumers have multiple stores from which to choose. competition has impacted, and will continue to impact, our store results. we experience seasonal fluctuations in occupancy levels, with occupancy levels generally higher in the summer months due to increased moving activity. our operating results depend materially on our ability to lease available self-storage units, to actively manage unit rental rates, and on the ability of our
20
tenants to make required rental payments. we believe that we are able to respond quickly and effectively to changes in local, regional and national economic conditions by adjusting rental rates through the combination of our revenue management team and our industry-leading technology systems.
we continue to evaluate a range of new initiatives and opportunities in order to enable us to maximize stockholder value. our strategies to maximize stockholder value include the following:
•   maximize the performance of our stores through strategic, efficient and proactive management. we pursue revenue-generating and expense-minimizing opportunities in our operations. our revenue management team seeks to maximize revenue by responding to changing market conditions through our advanced technology system's ability to provide real-time, interactive rental rate and discount management. our size allows us greater ability than the majority of our competitors to implement more effective online marketing programs, which we believe will attract more customers to our stores at a lower net cost.
•   acquire self-storage stores. our acquisitions team continues to pursue the acquisition of multi-store portfolios and single stores that we believe can provide stockholder value. we have established a reputation as a reliable, ethical buyer, which we believe enhances our ability to negotiate and close acquisitions. in addition, we believe our status as an upreit enables flexibility when structuring deals. we continue to review available acquisitions. as interest rates increase, our expectation is that capitalization rates will also increase and that prices will begin to decrease. we remain a disciplined buyer and only execute acquisitions that we believe will strengthen our portfolio and increase stockholder value.
•   expand our management business. our management business enables us to generate increased revenues through management fees and expand our geographic footprint. we believe this expanded footprint enables us to reduce our operating costs through economies of scale. in addition, we see our management business as a future acquisition pipeline. we pursue strategic relationships with owners whose stores would enhance our portfolio in the event an opportunity arises to acquire such stores.
critical accounting policies and estimates our financial statements have been prepared in accordance with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles. the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. on an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and assumptions, including those that impact our most critical accounting policies. we base our estimates and assumptions on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. a summary of significant accounting policies is also provided in the notes to our consolidated financial statements (see note 2 to our consolidated financial statements). actual results may differ from these estimates. we believe the following are our most critical accounting policies:
consolidation: arrangements that are not controlled through voting or similar rights are accounted for as variable interest entities ("vies"). an enterprise is required to consolidate a vie if it is the primary beneficiary of the vie.
a vie is created when (i) the equity investment at risk is not sufficient to permit the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties, or (ii) the entity's equity holders as a group either: (a) lack the power, through voting or similar rights, to direct the activities of the entity that most significantly impact the entity's economic performance, (b) are not obligated to absorb expected losses of the entity if they occur, or (c) do not have the right to receive expected residual returns of the entity if they occur. if an entity is deemed to be a vie, the enterprise that is deemed to have a variable interest, or combination of variable interests, that provides the enterprise with a controlling financial interest in the vie is considered the primary beneficiary and must consolidate the vie.
we have concluded that under certain circumstances when we enter into arrangements for the formation of joint ventures, a vie may be created under condition (i) or (ii)(b) or (ii)(c) of the previous paragraph. for each vie created, we have performed a qualitative analysis, including considering which party, if any, has the power to direct the activities most significant to the economic performance of each vie and whether that party has the obligation to absorb losses of the vie or the right to receive benefits from the vie that could be significant to the vie. if we are determined to be the primary beneficiary of the vie, the assets, liabilities and operations of the vie are consolidated with our financial statements. as of december 31, 2016, we had no consolidated vies. additionally, our operating partnership has notes payable to three trusts that are vies under condition (ii)(a) above. since the operating partnership is not the primary beneficiary of the trusts, these vies are not consolidated.
21
real estate assets: real estate assets are stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation. direct and allowable internal costs associated with the development, construction, renovation, and improvement of real estate assets are capitalized. interest, property taxes, and other costs associated with development incurred during the construction period are capitalized.
expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred. major replacements and betterments that improve or extend the life of the asset are capitalized and depreciated over their estimated useful lives. depreciation is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the buildings and improvements, which are generally between 5 and 39 years.
in connection with our acquisition of operating stores, the purchase price is allocated to the tangible and intangible assets and liabilities acquired based on their fair values, which are estimated using significant unobservable inputs. the value of the tangible assets, consisting of land and buildings, is determined as if vacant. intangible assets, which represent the value of existing tenant relationships, are recorded at their fair values based on the avoided cost to replace the current leases. we measure the value of tenant relationships based on the rent lost due to the amount of time required to replace existing customers, which is based on our historical experience with turnover in our facilities. debt assumed as part of an acquisition is recorded at fair value based on current interest rates compared to contractual rates. acquisition-related transaction costs are expensed as incurred.
stores purchased at the time of certificate of occupancy issuance are considered asset acquisitions. as such, the purchase price is allocated to the land and buildings acquired based on their fair values. any debt assumed as part of the acquisition is recorded at fair value based on current interest rates compared to contractual rates. acquisition-related transactions costs are capitalized as part of the purchase price.
intangible lease rights include: (1) purchase price amounts allocated to leases on three stores that cannot be classified as ground or building leases; these rights are amortized to expense over the term of the leases; and (2) intangibles related to ground leases on eight stores where the ground leases were assumed by us at rates that were different than the current market rates for similar leases. the value associated with these assumed leases were recorded as intangibles, which will be amortized over the lease terms.
evaluation of asset impairment: long lived assets held for use are evaluated for impairment when events or circumstances indicate that there may be impairment. we review each store at least annually to determine if any such events or circumstances have occurred or exist. we focus on stores where occupancy and/or rental income have decreased by a significant amount. for these stores, we determine whether the decrease is temporary or permanent and whether the store will likely recover the lost occupancy and/or revenue in the short term. in addition, we review stores in the lease-up stage and compare actual operating results to original projections.
when we determine that an event that may indicate impairment has occurred, we compare the carrying value of the related long-lived assets to the undiscounted future net operating cash flows attributable to the assets. an impairment loss is recorded if the net carrying value of the assets exceeds the undiscounted future net operating cash flows attributable to the assets. the impairment loss recognized equals the excess of net carrying value over the related fair value of the assets.
when real estate assets are identified as held for sale, we discontinue depreciating the assets and estimate the fair value of the assets, net of selling costs. if the estimated fair value, net of selling costs, of the assets that have been identified as held for sale is less than the net carrying value of the assets, we would recognize a loss on the disposal group classified as held for sale. the operations of assets held for sale or sold during the period are presented as part of normal operations for all periods presented.
investments in unconsolidated real estate ventures: our investments in real estate joint ventures where we have significant influence but not control, and joint ventures which are vies in which we are not the primary beneficiary, are recorded under the equity method of accounting on the accompanying consolidated financial statements.
under the equity method, our investment in real estate ventures is stated at cost and adjusted for our share of net earnings or losses and reduced by distributions. equity in earnings of real estate ventures is generally recognized based on our ownership interest in the earnings of each of the unconsolidated real estate ventures. for the purposes of presentation in the statement of cash flows, we follow the "look through" approach for classification of distributions from joint ventures. under this approach, distributions are reported under operating cash flow unless the facts and circumstances of a specific distribution clearly indicate that it is a return of capital (e.g., a liquidating dividend or distribution of the proceeds from the joint venture's sale of assets) in which case it is reported as an investing activity.
22
our management assesses annually whether there are any indicators that the value of our investments in unconsolidated real estate ventures may be impaired and when events or circumstances indicate that there may be impairment. an investment is impaired if management's estimate of the fair value of the investment, using significant unobservable inputs, is less than its carrying value. to the extent impairment has occurred and is considered to be other than temporary, the loss is measured as the excess of the carrying amount of the investment over the fair value of the investment.
derivative instruments and hedging activities: the accounting for changes in the fair value of derivatives depends on the intended use of the derivative and the resulting designation. derivatives used to hedge the exposure to changes in the fair value of an asset, liability or firm commitment attributable to a particular risk, are considered fair value hedges. derivatives used to hedge the exposure to variability in expected future cash flows, or other types of forecasted transactions, are considered cash flow hedges.
for derivatives designated as fair value hedges, changes in the fair value of the derivative and the hedged item related to the hedged risk are recognized in earnings. for derivatives designated as cash flow hedges, the effective portion of changes in the fair value of the derivative is initially reported in other comprehensive income, outside of earnings and subsequently reclassified to earnings when the hedged transaction affects earnings.
revenue and expense recognition: rental revenues are recognized as earned based upon amounts that are currently due from tenants. leases are generally on month-to-month terms. prepaid rents are recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the leases. promotional discounts are recognized as a reduction to rental income over the promotional period. late charges, administrative fees, merchandise sales and truck rentals are recognized in income when earned. management fee revenues are recognized monthly as services are performed and in accordance with the terms of the related management agreements. equity in earnings of real estate entities is recognized based on our ownership interest in the earnings of each of the unconsolidated real estate entities. interest income is recognized as earned.
property expenses, including utilities, property taxes, repairs and maintenance and other costs to manage the facilities are recognized as incurred. we accrue for property tax expense based upon invoice amounts, estimates and historical trends. if these estimates are incorrect, the timing of expense recognition could be affected.
tenant reinsurance premiums are recognized as revenue over the period of insurance coverage. we record an unpaid claims liability at the end of each period based on existing unpaid claims and historical claims payment history. the unpaid claims liability represents an estimate of the ultimate cost to settle all unpaid claims as of each period end, including both reported but unpaid claims and claims that may have been incurred but have not been reported. we use a third party claims administrator to adjust all tenant reinsurance claims received. the administrator evaluates each claim to determine the ultimate claim loss and includes an estimate for claims that may have been incurred but not reported. annually, a third party actuary evaluates the adequacy of the unpaid claims liability. prior year claim reserves are adjusted as experience develops or new information becomes known. the impact of such adjustments is included in the current period operations. the unpaid claims liability is not discounted to its present value. each tenant chooses the amount of insurance coverage they want through the tenant reinsurance program. tenants can purchase policies in amounts of two thousand dollars to ten thousand dollars of insurance coverage in exchange for a monthly fee. our exposure per claim is limited by the maximum amount of coverage chosen by each tenant. we purchase reinsurance for losses exceeding a set amount on any one event. we do not currently have any amounts recoverable under the reinsurance arrangements.
income taxes: we have elected to be treated as a reit under sections 856 through 860 of the internal revenue code. in order to maintain our qualification as a reit, among other things, we are required to distribute at least 90% of our reit taxable income to our stockholders and meet certain tests regarding the nature of our income and assets. as a reit, we are not subject to federal income tax with respect to that portion of our income which meets certain criteria and is distributed annually to our stockholders. we plan to continue to operate so that we meet the requirements for taxation as a reit. many of these requirements, however, are highly technical and complex. if we were to fail to meet these requirements, we would be subject to federal income tax. we are subject to certain state and local taxes. provision for such taxes has been included in income tax expense in our consolidated statements of operations.
we have elected to treat one of our corporate subsidiaries, extra space management, inc., as a taxable reit subsidiary ("trs"). in general, our trs may perform additional services for tenants and generally may engage in any real estate or non-real estate related business. a trs is subject to corporate federal income tax. deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities. interest and penalties relating to uncertain tax positions will be recognized in income tax expense when incurred.

property rental-the increase in property rental revenues for the year ended december 31, 2016 was primarily the result of an increase of $144,985 associated with acquisitions completed in 2016 and 2015. we acquired 99 stores during the year ended december 31, 2016 and 171 stores during the year ended december 31, 2015. property rental revenue also increased by $42,171 during the year ended december 31, 2016 as a result of increases in rental rates to new and existing customers at our stabilized stores. revenues at our lease-up stores increased by $3,439 for the year ended december 31, 2016 due primarily to increases in occupancy. the achieved rental rate to new tenants on wholly owned properties for the year ended december 31, 2016 increased an average of approximately 7.0% over the prior year. these increases were offset by decreases in property revenue of $1,991 for the year ended december 31, 2016 related to the sales of stores during 2016.
tenant reinsurance-the increase in tenant reinsurance revenues was due primarily to the increase in stores operated. we operated 1,427 stores at december 31, 2016, compared to 1,347 stores at december 31, 2015.
management fees and other income-our trs manages stores owned by our joint ventures and third parties. management fees generally represent 6.0% of cash collected from stores owned by third parties and unconsolidated joint ventures. we also earn an asset management fee from the storage portfolio i ("spi") joint venture, equal to 0.50% multiplied by the total asset value, provided certain conditions are met. the increase in management fees is due primarily to an increase in the revenues at the stores we managed. at december 31, 2016, we managed 591 stores for third parties and non-consolidated joint ventures, compared to 601 stores at december 31, 2015. the decrease in the number of stores managed is due primarily to our acquisition of 40 stores from our joint ventures during 2016.

property operations-the increase in property operations expense consists primarily of an increase of $45,055 related to acquisitions completed in 2016 and 2015. we acquired 99 operating stores during the year ended december 31, 2016 and 171 stores during the year ended december 31, 2015.
tenant reinsurance-tenant reinsurance expense represents the costs that are incurred to provide tenant reinsurance. the change is due primarily to the increase in the number of stores we owned and/or managed. at december 31, 2016, we owned and/or managed 1,427 stores compared to 1,347 stores at december 31, 2015.
acquisition related costs and other-these costs relate primarily to acquisition activities during the periods indicated. the decrease in these expenses for the year ended december 31, 2016 compared to the prior year was due to a decrease in the number of acquisitions. we acquired 99 properties during the year ended december 31, 2016 compared to 171 during the prior year. included in the acquisitions completed in 2015 was the acquisition of smartstop self storage inc. ("smartstop") on october 1, 2015. as part of this acquisition, we recorded an expense of $38,360 related to defeasance costs and prepayment penalties incurred related to the repayment of smartstop's existing debt as of the acquisition date. we incurred $8,053 of professional fess/closing costs, $6,338 of severance-related costs, $1,327 of other payroll-related costs and $9,043 of other acquisition related costs as a result of the acquisition of smartstop, for a total of $63,121.
general and administrative-general and administrative expenses primarily include all expenses not directly related to our stores, including corporate payroll, travel and professional fees. these expenses are recognized as incurred. general and administrative expenses for the year ended december 31, 2016 increased when compared to the same periods in the prior year primarily due to the overall cost associated with the management of additional stores. at december 31, 2016, we owned and/or managed 1,427 stores compared to 1,347 stores at december 31, 2015. additionally, during 2016, we accrued a $4,000 expense related to the potential settlement of a legal action. we did not observe any material trends in specific payroll, travel or other expenses that contributed significantly to the increase in general and administrative expenses apart from the increase due to the management of additional stores.
depreciation and amortization-depreciation and amortization expense increased as a result of the acquisition of new stores. we acquired 99 operating stores during the year ended december 31, 2016, and 171 operating stores during the year ended december 31, 2015.

gain on real estate transactions, earnout from prior acquisition and sale of other assets- during the year ended december 31, 2016, through various transactions, we sold a total of nine stores located in indiana, ohio and texas. we received a total of $22,002 in cash and 85,452 of our op units valued at $7,689 in exchange for these stores. the operating partnership has canceled the op units received. we recognized a total gain of $11,358 related to these dispositions.
during 2014, we acquired a portfolio of five stores. as part of this acquisition, we agreed to make an additional cash payment to the sellers if the acquired stores exceeded a specified amount of net operating income for the years ending december 31, 2015 and 2016. at the acquisition date, we recorded an estimated liability related to this provision. as the operating income of these stores during the earnout period was higher than originally estimated, an additional payment was due to the sellers of $4,284, which was recorded as a loss during 2016.
in 2011, we acquired a single store in florida. as part of the acquisition, we agreed to make an additional cash payment to the sellers if the acquired store exceeded a specified amount of net rental income for the period of 12 consecutive months ending june 30, 2015. during 2014, we recorded a liability of $2,500 as an estimate of the payment that would become due. the $400 gain recorded during 2015 represents the adjustment needed to true up the existing liability to the amount owed to the sellers as of june 30, 2015.
during 2015, we determined that one of our acquisitions was purchased at below its market value, and therefore recorded a $1,101 gain at the time of the acquisition, which represents the excess of the fair value of the store acquired over the consideration paid.
interest expense-the increase in interest expense during the year ended december 31, 2016 was primarily the result of higher debt balances when compared to the prior year. the total face value of our debt, including our lines of credit, was $4,363,697 at december 31, 2016 compared to $3,598,254 at december 31, 2015.
non-cash interest expense related to amortization of discount on equity component of exchangeable senior notes-represents the amortization of the discounts related to the equity components of the exchangeable senior notes issued by our operating partnership. our operating partnership has issued and outstanding 2.375% exchangeable senior notes due 2033 (the "2013 notes") and 3.125% exchangeable senior notes due 2035 (the "2015 notes.") the 2013 notes and the 2015 notes both have an effective interest rate of 4.0% relative to the carrying amount of the liability. the increase for the year ended december 31, 2016 when compared to the same period in the prior year is due to the issuance of $575,000 principal amount of the 2015 notes in september 2015 and related discount of $22,597.

interest income-interest income represents amounts earned on cash and cash equivalents deposited with financial institutions and interest earned on notes receivable. the increase for the year ended december 31, 2016 is related primarily to the increase in the average notes receivable balances outstanding when compared to the prior year. the majority of the increase in interest income related to the $84,331 of notes receivable issued in conjunction with the acquisition of smartstop in october 2015. these notes have a 7.0% interest rate which increases to 9.0% in february 2017. as of december 31, 2016, the remaining principal balance was $52,201.
interest income on note receivable from preferred operating partnership unit holder-represents interest on a $100,000 loan to the holder of the operating partnership's series a participating redeemable preferred units (the "series a units").
equity in earnings of unconsolidated real estate ventures-equity in earnings of unconsolidated real estate ventures represents the income earned through our ownership interests in unconsolidated joint ventures. the increase for the year ended december 31, 2016 compared to the same period in the prior year was primarily the result of an increase in our ownership interest from 2.0% to approximately 4.0% in the ess prisa llc ("prisa") joint venture and from 2.0% to approximately 4.4% in the ess prisa ii llc ("prisa ii") joint venture, as well as an increase in revenue at the stores owned by our joint ventures. these increases were offset by an overall decrease in the number of stores owned by our joint ventures, primarily due to our acquisition of 40 of these stores as noted below.
on april 25, 2016, we and affiliates of prudential financial, inc. ("prudential") entered into the "second amendment to amended and restated operating agreement of ess prisa llc" and the "first amendment to amended and restated operating agreement of ess prisa ii llc" (the "amendments"). the amendments are deemed effective as of april 1, 2016. under the amendments, we gave up any future rights to receive distributions from these joint ventures at the higher "excess profit participation" percentage of 17.0% in exchange for a higher equity ownership percentage. our equity ownership in ess prisa llc increased from 2.0% to 4.0%, and our equity ownership in ess prisa ii llc increased from 2.0% to 4.4%.
equity in earnings of unconsolidated real estate ventures-gain on sale of real estate assets and purchase of joint venture partners' interests-on november 17, 2016, we acquired 11 stores from our ess wcot llc joint venture ("wcot") in a step acquisition. we owned 5.0% of wcot, with the other 95.0% owned by affiliates of prudential. wcot created a new subsidiary, extra space storage 132 llc ("ess 132"), and transferred 11 stores into ess 132. wcot then distributed ess 132 to prudential and us on a pro rata basis. this distribution was accounted for as a spinoff, and was therefore recorded at the net carrying amount of the properties of $68,814 . immediately after the distribution, we acquired prudential's 95.0% interest in ess 132 for $153,304, resulting in 100% ownership of ess 132 and the related 11 stores. based on the purchase price of prudential's share of ess 132, we determined that the fair value of our investment in ess 132 immediately prior to the acquisition of prudential's share was $8,119, and we recorded a gain of $4,651 as a result of re-measuring to fair value our existing equity interest in ess 132.
on september 16, 2016, we acquired 23 stores from prisa ii in a step acquisition. we owned 4.4% of prisa ii, with the other 95.6% owned by affiliates of prudential. prisa ii created a new subsidiary, extra space properties 131 llc ("esp 131"), and transferred 23 stores into esp 131. prisa ii then distributed esp 131 to prudential and us on a pro rata basis. this distribution was accounted for as a spinoff, and was therefore recorded at the net carrying amount of the properties of $4,326. immediately after the distribution, we acquired prudential's 95.6% interest in esp 131 for $238,679, resulting in 100% ownership of esp 131 and the related 23 stores. based on the purchase price of prudential's share of esp 131, we determined that the fair value of our investment in esp 131 immediately prior to the acquisition of prudential's share was $10,988, and we recorded a gain of $6,778 as a result of re-measuring to fair value our existing equity interest in esp 131. subsequent to these transactions, prisa ii owned 42 stores. we then sold our remaining interest in prisa ii to prudential for $34,758 in cash. as a result of this sale, we recognized a gain of $30,846.
on february 2, 2016, we acquired six stores from our vrs self storage llc joint venture ("vrs") in a step acquisition. we owned 45.0% of vrs, with the other 55.0% owned by prudential. vrs created a new subsidiary, extra space properties 122 llc ("esp 122") and transferred six stores into esp 122. vrs then distributed esp 122 to prudential and us on a pro rata basis. this distribution was accounted for as a spinoff, and was therefore recorded at the net carrying amount of the properties of $17,261, immediately after the distribution, we acquired prudential's 55.0% interest in esp 122 for $53,940, resulting in 100% ownership of esp 122 and the related six stores. based on the purchase price of prudential's share of esp 122, we determined that the fair value of our investment in esp 122 immediately prior to the acquisition of prudential's share was $44,184, and we recorded a gain of $26,923 as a result of re-measuring to fair value our existing equity interest in esp 122.
in march 2015, one of our joint ventures sold a store located in new york to a third party and recognized a gain of $60,495. we recognized our 2.0% share of this gain, or $1,228.
27
in march 2015 we acquired a joint venture partner's 82.4% equity interest in an existing joint venture which had one store. we previously held the remaining 17.6% equity interest in this joint venture. prior to the acquisition, we accounted for our equity interest in this joint venture as an equity-method investment. we recognized a non-cash gain of $1,629 as a result of re-measuring the fair value of our equity interest in this joint venture held before the acquisition.

gain (loss) on real estate transactions, earnout from prior acquisitions and sale of other assets-during 2011, we acquired a store located in florida. as part of this acquisition, we agreed to make an additional cash payment to the sellers if the acquired store exceeded a specified amount of net rental income for any twelve-month period prior to june 30, 2015. at the acquisition date, $133 was recorded as the estimated amount that would be due, and we believed that it was unlikely that any significant additional payment would be made as a result of this earnout provision. because the rental growth of the stores trended significantly higher than expected, we recorded additional liability of $2,500. this amount is included in gain (loss) on sale of real estate and earnout from prior acquisitions on our consolidated statements of operations for the year ended december 31, 2014. the $400 gain recorded during the year ended december 31, 2015 represents the adjustment needed to true up the existing liability to the amount owed to the sellers as of june 30, 2015.
during the year ended december 31, 2015, we determined that one of our acquisitions was purchased at below its market value, and we therefore recorded a $1,101 gain, which represents the excess of the fair value of the store acquired over the consideration paid.
during 2012, we acquired a portfolio of ten stores. as part of this acquisition, we agreed to make an additional cash payment to the sellers if the acquired stores exceeded a specified amount of net rental income two years after the acquisition date. at the acquisition date, we believed that it was unlikely that any significant payment would be made as a result of this earnout provision. the rental growth of the stores was significantly higher than expected, resulting in a payment to the sellers of $7,785. this amount is included in gain (loss) on sale of real estate and earnout from prior acquisitions on our consolidated statements of operations for the year ended december 31, 2014.
property casualty loss, net-in october 2014, a store located in venice, california, was damaged by a fire. as a result, we recorded a loss, net of insurance recoveries, of $1,724.

interest expense-interest expense increased due to the increase in total amount of debt outstanding. this increase was partially offset by a decrease in the average interest rate. at december 31, 2015, our total face value of debt was $3,598,254, compared to a total face value of debt of $2,379,657 at december 31, 2014. the average interest rate was 3.1% as of december 31, 2015, compared to 3.4% as of december 31, 2014.
non-cash interest expense related to amortization of discount on equity component of exchangeable senior notes-represents the amortization of the discount related to the equity component of the exchangeable senior notes issued by our operating partnership. in june 2013, our operating partnership issued $250,000 of its 2013 notes. in september 2015, our operating partnership issued $575,000 of its 2015 notes, and repurchased $164,636 principal amount of the 2013 notes. both the 2013 notes and the 2015 notes have effective interest rates of 4.0%.
interest income-interest income represents amounts earned on cash and cash equivalents deposited with financial institutions and interest earned on notes receivable. the increase relates primarily to the increase in the average balance of notes receivable when compared to the prior year and an increase in our average cash balance. as part of the smartstop acquisition on october 1, 2015, we issued an $84,331 note receivable that accrues interest at 7.0% annually. we recorded approximately $1,476 of interest income related to this note receivable during the year ended december 31, 2015.
interest income on note receivable from preferred operating partnership unit holder-represents interest on a $100,000 loan to the holder of the series a units.
equity in earnings of unconsolidated real estate ventures-equity in earnings of unconsolidated real estate ventures represents the income earned through our ownership interests in unconsolidated joint ventures. the increase in equity in earnings for the year ended december 31, 2015 was due primarily to increases in revenue at the stores owned by the joint ventures.
equity in earnings of unconsolidated real estate ventures-gain on sale of real estate assets and purchase of joint venture partners' interests- during march 2015, one of our joint ventures sold a store located in new york to a third party and recognized a gain of $60,495. we recognized our 2.0% share of this gain, or $1,228. additionally, in march 2015 we acquired a joint venture partner's 82.4% equity interest in an existing joint venture. we previously held the remaining 17.6% equity interest in this joint venture. prior to the acquisition, we accounted for our equity interest in this joint venture as an equity-method investment. we recognized a non-cash gain of $1,629 during the three months ended march 31, 2015 as a result of re-measuring the fair value of our equity interest in this joint venture held before the acquisition.
in december 2013 and may 2014, as part of a larger acquisition, we acquired our joint venture partners' 60% to 65% equity interests in six stores located in california. we previously held the remaining 35% to 40% interests in these stores through six separate joint ventures with affiliates of grupe properties co. inc. ("grupe"). prior to the acquisition, we accounted for our interests in these joint ventures as equity-method investments. we recognized a non-cash gain of $3,438 during the year ended december 31, 2014, as a result of re-measuring the fair value of our equity interest in one of these joint ventures held before the acquisition. during the year ended december 31, 2014, we recorded an additional gain of $584 as a result of the final cash distributions received from the other five joint ventures associated with the acquisitions that were completed during 2013.
income tax expense-the increase in income tax expense relates primarily to an increase in income earned by our trs when compared to the same periods in the prior year. additionally, during the year ended december 31, 2014, we recorded the initial tax benefit related to a royalty fee that we charge quarterly to our captive insurance subsidiary, which reduced the tax expense for that period.

net income allocated to preferred operating partnership noncontrolling interests-in december 2014, as part of the acquisition of a single store, our operating partnership issued 548,390 series d redeemable preferred units ("series d units"). the series d units have a liquidation value of $25.00 per unit, and receive distributions at an annual rate of 5.0%.
in december 2013 and may 2014, as part of a portfolio acquisition, our operating partnership issued 704,016 series c convertible redeemable preferred units ("series c units"). the series c units have a liquidation value of $42.10 per unit. from issuance until the fifth anniversary of issuance, the series c units receive distributions at an annual rate of $0.18 plus the then-payable quarterly distribution per op unit.
in april 2014, as part of a single store acquisition, our operating partnership issued 333,360 series b redeemable preferred units ("series b units"). during august and september 2013, as part of a portfolio acquisition, our operating partnership issued 1,342,727 series b units. the series b units have a liquidation value of $25.00 per unit and receive distributions at an annual rate of 6.0%.
income allocated to the preferred operating partnership noncontrolling interests for the years ended december 31, 2015 and 2014 represents the fixed distributions paid to the holders of the series a units, series b units, series c units and series d units, plus approximately 0.7% of the remaining net income allocated to the holders of the series a units.
net income allocated to operating partnership and other noncontrolling interests-income allocated to the operating partnership represents approximately 4.2% and 3.5% of net income after the allocation of the fixed distribution paid to the preferred operating partnership unit holders for the years ended december 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. the percentage of net income allocated to the operating partnership noncontrolling interest increased due to op units issued in conjunction with acquisitions during 2015.
funds from operations ffo provides relevant and meaningful information about our operating performance that is necessary, along with net income and cash flows, for an understanding of our operating results. we believe ffo is a meaningful disclosure as a supplement to net earnings. net earnings assume that the values of real estate assets diminish predictably over time as reflected through depreciation and amortization expenses. the values of real estate assets fluctuate due to market conditions and we believe ffo more accurately reflects the value of our real estate assets. ffo is defined by the national association of real estate investment trusts, inc. ("nareit") as net income computed in accordance with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles ("gaap"), excluding gains or losses on sales of operating stores and impairment write-downs of depreciable real estate assets, plus real estate related depreciation and amortization and after adjustments to record unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures on the same basis. we believe that to further understand our performance, ffo should be considered along with the reported net income and cash flows in accordance with gaap, as presented in the consolidated financial statements. ffo should not be considered a replacement of net income computed in accordance with gaap.
the computation of ffo may not be comparable to ffo reported by other reits or real estate companies that do not define the term in accordance with the current nareit definition or that interpret the current nareit definition differently. ffo does not represent cash generated from operating activities determined in accordance with gaap, and should not be considered as an alternative to net income as an indication of our performance, as an alternative to net cash flow from operating activities as a measure of our liquidity, or as an indicator of our ability to make cash distributions.

same-store results our same-store pool for the periods presented consists of 564 stores that are wholly-owned and operated and that were stabilized by the first day of the earliest calendar year presented. we consider a store to be stabilized once it has been open for three years or has sustained average square foot occupancy of 80% or more for one calendar year. we believe that by providing same-store results from a stabilized pool of stores, with accompanying operating metrics including, but not limited to: occupancy, rental revenue growth, operating expense growth, net operating income growth, etc., stockholders and potential investors are able to evaluate operating performance without the effects of non-stabilized occupancy levels, rent levels, expense levels, acquisitions or completed developments. same-store results should not be used as a basis for future same-store performance or for the performance of our stores as a whole. the following table presents operating data for our same-store portfolio.

the increases in same-store rental and tenant reinsurance revenues for the three months and year ended december 31, 2016, as compared to the same periods ended december 31, 2015, were due primarily to higher rental rates for both new and existing customers. expenses were lower for the three months ended december 31, 2016 due to decreases year-over-year across most expense categories, primarily due to comparably higher expenses in the three months ended december 31, 2015. the most significant decreases were in repairs and maintenance and utilities. decreases in these expenses were partially offset by increases in property taxes. for the year ended december 31, 2016, expenses were higher due to increases in property taxes and credit card processing fees. these increases in expenses were partially offset by decreases in utilities and repairs and maintenance expense.

the increases in same-store rental and tenant reinsurance revenues for the three months and year ended december 31, 2015, as compared to the same periods ended december 31, 2014, were due primarily to an increase in occupancy, an increase in rental rates to new and existing customers, and reduced customer discounts. expenses were higher for the year ended december 31, 2015 due to increases in tenant reinsurance expense, credit card merchant fees and property taxes. increases were offset by decreases in utility expenses and property insurance expense.
cash flows comparison of the year ended december 31, 2016 to the year ended december 31, 2015
cash provided by operating activities was $539,263 and $367,329 for the years ended december 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. the change when compared to the prior year was primarily due to a $187,553 increase in net income and an increase in depreciation and amortization expense of $49,103. these increases were offset by an increase in the gain on sale of real estate assets and purchase joint venture partners' interests of $66,342. this gain was primarily the result of three step acquisitions of stores that were previously owned by our vrs, prisa ii and wcot joint ventures, along with the gain on the sale of our remaining interest in the prisa ii joint venture to prudential.

cash used in investing activities was $1,032,035 and $1,625,664, for the years ended december 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. the decrease was primarily due to a decrease in total cash paid for the acquisition of real estate assets of $464,227. we purchased 99 stores during the year ended december 31, 2016, compared to 171 stores purchased during 2015. there was also an increase in proceeds from sale of real estate assets, investments in real estate ventures and other assets of $60,013, a decrease in cash paid on the purchase/issuance of notes receivable of $57,902 and an increase in cash received from principal payments on notes receivable of $42,785 for the year ended december 31, 2016 when compared to 2015.
cash provided by financing activities was $460,831 and $1,286,471, for the years ended december 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. the change related primarily to a decrease in proceeds from notes payable and revolving lines of credit of $221,445, a decrease in net proceeds from the issuance of exchangeable senior notes of $563,500, and a decrease in net proceeds from the sale of common stock of $323,453 for the year ended december 31, 2016 when compared to the prior year. these decreases were partially offset by a decrease in principal payments on notes payable and revolving lines of credit of $191,128 and a decrease in the cash paid for the repurchase of exchangeable senior notes of $205,017.
comparison of the year ended december 31, 2015 to the year ended december 31, 2014
cash provided by operating activities was $367,329 and $337,581 for the years ended december 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. the change when compared to the prior year was primarily due to a $13,640 increase in net income and an increase in depreciation and amortization expense of $18,381. these increases were partially offset by a decrease in the change in accounts payable and accrued liabilities of $4,812.
cash used in investing activities was $1,625,664 and $564,948 for the years ended december 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. the change was primarily the result of an increase of $1,200,853 paid for the acquisition of smartstop in october 2015. there was also an increase of $55,073 in cash used to purchase/issue notes receivable. these increases in cash outflows were partially offset by an increase of $45,080 in cash received as returns of investments in unconsolidated real estate ventures.
cash provided by financing activities was $1,286,471 and $148,307 for the years ended december 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. the net increase was due to a number of factors, including an increase of $1,204,138 in the cash proceeds received from the issuance of notes payable and revolving lines of credit, an increase of $446,877 in the cash proceeds received from the sale of common stock, and an increase of $563,500 in the net proceeds from the issuance of exchangeable senior notes. these increases in cash inflows were offset by an increase of $780,442 of cash paid for principal payments on notes payable and revolving lines of credit, an increase of $227,212 in cash paid to repurchase existing exchangeable senior notes, and an increase of $59,211 in cash paid as dividends on our common stock.
liquidity and capital resources as of december 31, 2016, we had $43,858 available in cash and cash equivalents. we are required to distribute at least 90% of our net taxable income, excluding net capital gains, to our stockholders on an annual basis to maintain our qualification as a reit.
our cash and cash equivalents are held in accounts managed by third party financial institutions and consist of invested cash and cash in our operating accounts. during 2016 and 2015, we experienced no loss or lack of access to our cash or cash equivalents; however, there can be no assurance that access to our cash and cash equivalents will not be impacted by adverse conditions in the financial markets.

(3) unsecured. two six-month extensions available.
(4) basis rate as of december 31, 2016. rate is subject to change based on our consolidated leverage ratio.
as of december 31, 2016, we had $4,363,697 face value of debt, resulting in a debt to total enterprise value ratio of 29.6%. as of december 31, 2016, the ratio of total fixed-rate debt and other instruments to total debt was 70.0% (including $2,198,275 on which we have interest rate swaps that have been included as fixed-rate debt). the weighted average interest rate of the total of fixed- and variable-rate debt at december 31, 2016 was 3.0%. certain of our real estate assets are pledged as collateral for our debt. we are subject to certain restrictive covenants relating to our outstanding debt. we were in compliance with all financial covenants at december 31, 2016.
we expect to fund our short-term liquidity requirements, including operating expenses, recurring capital expenditures, dividends to stockholders, distributions to holders of operating partnership units and interest on our outstanding indebtedness, out of our operating cash flow, cash on hand and borrowings under our revolving lines of credit, including undrawn portions of our unsecured facility. in addition, we are pursuing additional sources of financing based on anticipated funding needs.
our liquidity needs consist primarily of cash distributions to stockholders, store acquisitions, principal payments under our borrowings and non-recurring capital expenditures. we may from time to time seek to repurchase our outstanding debt, shares of common stock or other securities in open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions or otherwise. such repurchases, if any, will depend on prevailing market conditions, our liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors. in addition, we evaluate, on an ongoing basis, the merits of strategic acquisitions and other relationships, which may require us to raise additional funds. we do not expect that our operating cash flow or cash balances will be sufficient to fund our liquidity needs and instead expect to fund such needs out of additional borrowings of secured or unsecured indebtedness, joint ventures with third parties, and from the proceeds of public and private offerings of equity and debt. additional capital may not be available on terms favorable to us or at all. any additional issuance of equity or equity-linked securities may result in dilution to our stockholders. in addition, any new securities we issue could have rights, preferences and privileges senior to holders of our common stock. we may also use operating partnership units as currency to fund acquisitions from self-storage owners who desire tax-deferral in their exiting transactions.
off-balance sheet arrangements except as disclosed in the notes to our financial statements, we do not currently have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purposes entities, which typically are established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes. further, except as disclosed in the notes to our financial statements, we have not guaranteed any obligations of unconsolidated entities nor do we have any commitments or intent to provide funding to any such entities. accordingly, we are not materially exposed to any financing, liquidity, market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in these relationships.

the operating leases above include minimum future lease payments on leases for 22 of our operating stores as well as leases of our corporate offices. three ground leases include additional contingent rental payments based on the level of revenue achieved at the store.
as of december 31, 2016, the weighted average interest rate for all fixed rate loans was 3.3%, and the weighted average interest rate on all variable rate loans was 2.3%.
financing strategy we will continue to employ leverage in our capital structure in amounts reviewed from time to time by our board of directors. although our board of directors has not adopted a policy which limits the total amount of indebtedness that we may incur, we will consider a number of factors in evaluating our level of indebtedness from time to time, as well as the amount of such indebtedness that will be either fixed or variable rate. in making financing decisions, we will consider factors including but not limited to:
•   the interest rate of the proposed financing;
•   the extent to which the financing impacts flexibility in managing our stores;
•   prepayment penalties and restrictions on refinancing;
•   the purchase price of stores acquired with debt financing;
•   long-term objectives with respect to the financing;
•   target investment returns;
•   the ability of particular stores, and our company as a whole, to generate cash flow sufficient to cover expected debt service payments;
•   overall level of consolidated indebtedness;
•   timing of debt and lease maturities;
•   provisions that require recourse and cross-collateralization;
•   corporate credit ratios including debt service coverage, debt to total capitalization and debt to undepreciated assets; and
•   the overall ratio of fixed and variable rate debt.
our indebtedness may be recourse, non-recourse, cross-collateralized, cross-defaulted, secured or unsecured. if the indebtedness is non-recourse, the collateral will be limited to the particular stores to which the indebtedness relates. in addition, we may invest in stores subject to existing loans collateralized by mortgages or similar liens on our stores, or may refinance stores acquired on a leveraged basis. we may use the proceeds from any borrowings to refinance existing indebtedness, to refinance investments, including the redevelopment of existing stores, for general working capital or to purchase additional interests in partnerships or joint ventures or for other purposes when we believe it is advisable.
we may from time to time seek to retire or repurchase our outstanding debt, as well as shares of common stock or other securities in open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions or otherwise. such repurchases, if any, will depend on prevailing market conditions, our liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors. the amounts involved may be material.

seasonality the self-storage business is subject to seasonal fluctuations. a greater portion of revenues and profits are realized from may through september. historically, our highest level of occupancy has been at the end of july, while our lowest level of occupancy has been in late february and early march. results for any quarter may not be indicative of the results that may be achieved for the full fiscal year.

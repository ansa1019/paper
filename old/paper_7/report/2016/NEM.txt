management's discussion and analysis ("md&a") provides information that management believes is relevant to an assessment and understanding of the consolidated financial condition and results of operations of newmont mining corporation and its affiliates and subsidiaries (collectively, "newmont," the "company," "our" and "we"). we use certain non-gaap financial measures in our md&a. for a detailed description of each of the non-gaap measures used in this md&a, please see the discussion under non-gaap financial measures beginning on page 77. references to "a$" refer to australian currency. this item should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included in this annual report.
overview        newmont is one of the world's largest gold producers and is the only gold company included in the s&p 500 index and fortune 500. we have been included in the dow jones sustainability index-world for ten consecutive years and have adopted the world gold council's conflict-free gold policy. we are also engaged in the exploration for and acquisition of gold and copper properties. we have significant operations and/or assets in the united states ("u.s."), australia, peru, ghana and suriname.
on november 2, 2016, newmont completed the sale of its 48.5% economic interest in pt newmont nusa tenggara ("ptnnt"), which operated the batu hijau copper and gold mine ("batu hijau") in indonesia (the "batu hijau transaction"). as a result, newmont presents batu hijau as a discontinued operation for all periods presented. in the following discussion and analysis, the operating statistics, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition that we present and discuss are those of our continuing operations unless otherwise indicated. for additional information regarding our discontinued operations, see note 3 to the consolidated financial statements and the discussion in our results of consolidated operations below.
we continue to focus on improving safety and efficiency at our operations, maintaining leading environmental, social and governance practices, and building a stronger portfolio of longer-life, lower cost mines to generate the financial flexibility we need to fund our best projects, reduce debt, and return cash to shareholders. as part of these efforts, we launched the full potential program ("full potential") in 2013 which continues to deliver results in the current year. full potential is designed to leverage our industry experience and discipline to accelerate the delivery of business improvement opportunities across our operations and support areas, resulting in improved levels of operating cash flow.

our global project pipeline projects included in our global pipeline comprise an important part of the company's growth strategy and reflect opportunities throughout the development cycle. the most advanced projects, including early stage development and projects in or near the execution phase are described below. the exploration, construction and execution of these projects may require significant funding to complete.        long canyon, north america. commercial production for the long canyon project in north america was reached in november 2016. we expect average estimated gold production of 100,000 to 150,000 ounces per year over an eight year mine life. development capital costs (excluding capitalized interest) since approval were $209, of which $17 were related to the fourth quarter. at december 31, 2016, we reported 19.2 million tons of probable reserves, grading 0.061 ounce per ton for 1.2 million ounces of gold reserves at long canyon.
tanami expansion, australia. the board of directors approved full funding of the tanami expansion project on october 28, 2015. the scope for this project includes a ventilation upgrade, additional mining equipment, additional mine access and increasing process plant capacity and recovery. we expect the tanami expansion to reach commercial production by mid-2017, which will maintain tanami production of between 425,000 and 475,000 gold ounces for the first five years. development capital costs (excluding capitalized interest) since approval were $74, of which $23 were related to the fourth quarter of 2016.
subika underground, africa. subika underground is in the definitive feasibility stage of development as work continues to optimize the mine plan and reduce costs. the project would increase profitable production by an average of 150,000 to 200,000 ounces of gold per year for the first five years and an investment decision is expected in the first half of 2017.
ahafo mill expansion, africa. ahafo mill expansion is in the definitive feasibility stage of development as work continues to refine the scope and reduce costs. the project would increase profitable production by an average of 75,000 to 100,000 ounces of gold per year for the first five years, while lowering costs and off-setting the impacts of lower grades and harder ore. an investment decision is expected in the first half 2017.
quecher main, south america. quecher main is a potential brownfield development within the existing footprint of yanacocha. the oxide deposit extends the life of the yanacocha operation to 2025, with average annual gold production of about 200,000 ounces between 2020 and 2025. the project is currently in the definitive feasibility stage of development. an investment decision is expected in the second half of 2017.
twin underground, north america. twin underground is in the definitive feasibility stage of development. the project is located below and north of the historic vista pit at twin creeks in north america. twin underground is a profitable expansion project that would contribute 30,000 ounces of gold per year for the first five years. an investment decision is expected in the second half of 2017.
we manage our wider project portfolio to maintain flexibility to address the development risks associated with our projects including permitting, local community and government support, engineering and procurement availability, technical issues, escalating costs and other associated risks that could adversely impact the timing and costs of certain opportunities.

results in 2016 compared to 2015 were impacted most significantly by a $970 impairment charge ($512 attributable to newmont) taken in 2016 related to assets in south america that were evaluated in connection with management's review of the yanacocha long-term mining and closure plans, an increase in the company's valuation allowances against deferred tax assets, a prior-year gain resulting from the deconsolidation of tmac resources, inc. ("tmac") and a prior-year gain resulting from the sale of the company's investment in european gold refinery holdings ("egr"), partially offset by higher gold sales volumes and
57
realized prices and the positive impact of a gain from sale of the company's investment in regis resources ltd ("regis") during 2016.
results in 2015 compared to 2014 were impacted by lower gold sales volumes and realized prices, higher taxes, increased reclamation and remediation expense, decreased earnings at yanacocha and the deconsolidation of our ownership interest in tmac, partially offset by decreased costs applicable to sales.

depreciation and amortization increased in 2016, compared to 2015, primarily due to the acquisition of cc&v in 2015, the addition of merian and long canyon in 2016, higher stockpile and leach pad inventory adjustments at ahafo and yanacocha and higher gold sales volumes, partially offset by the sale of waihi in 2015. depreciation and amortization expense increased in 2015, compared to 2014, primarily due to the acquisition of cc&v in 2015, partially offset by lower gold sales volumes, lower stockpile and leach pad inventory adjustments and the sales of waihi in 2015 and midas, jundee and la herradura in 2014. depreciation and amortization expense fluctuates as capital expenditures increase or decrease and as production levels increase or decrease due to the use of the units-of-production amortization method for mineral interests and mine development.
for a complete discussion regarding variations in operations, see results of consolidated operations.
reclamation and remediation expense decreased to $179 in 2016 from $253 in 2015 primarily due to the prior year increase in remediation costs arising from revisions made to the remediation plan of the midnite mine in washington state, partially offset with the current year increase in reclamation costs related to yanacocha. reclamation and remediation expense increased to $253 in 2015
61
from $142 in 2014 primarily due to increased remediation costs from revised estimates to the remediation plan of the midnite mine in washington state.
the company is conducting a comprehensive study of the current yanacocha long-term mining and closure plans as part of the requirement to submit an updated closure plan to peruvian regulators every five years. the revised closure plan will be submitted to peruvian regulators in the second half of 2017. the revised closure plan may require the company to provide additional reclamation bonding for yanacocha.
as discussed in note 6 of the consolidated financial statements, after completing its review of preliminary changes to the yanacocha closure plan based on revised long-term mining plans, the study work completed to date and in connection with the company's annual process to evaluate and update all asset retirement obligations, the company recorded a non-cash charge to reclamation expense for the quarter ended december 31, 2016 of $77 related to operations no longer in production. the increase is primarily due to higher estimated long-term water management costs, heap leach earthworks and related support activities.
exploration expense decreased to $148 in 2016 from $156 in 2015 primarily due to the deconsolidation of tmac in 2015 and lower expenditures at yanacocha, partially offset by increased expenditures at various projects as we continue to focus on developing future reserves. exploration expense decreased to $156 in 2015 from $163 in 2014 primarily due to the deconsolidation of tmac in 2015, partially offset by increased expenditures at long canyon.
for additional information about proven and probable reserves, including additions and reductions, see the discussion in gold, copper and silver reserves in item 1, business, and proven and probable reserves in item 2, properties.
advanced projects, research and development expense includes development project management costs, feasibility studies and other project expenses that do not qualify for capitalization. advanced projects, research and development expense increased to $134 in 2016 from $126 in 2015 primarily due to increased costs to develop various studies and merian pre-production expenses, partially offset by the sale of waihi in 2015 and reduced spend on conga care and maintenance. advanced projects, research and development expense decreased to $126 in 2015 from $159 in 2014 primarily due to the sale of waihi in 2015 and la herradura in 2014, deferment of various studies, the decision to advance merian, turf vent shaft and tanami expansion projects to execution as most costs are capitalized in that stage, and general reductions in project and technical service costs. these decreases were partially offset by an increase in costs from  placing conga on care and maintenance in the fourth quarter of 2014.
general and administrative expense decreased to $233 in 2016, compared to $241 in 2015, primarily due to lower regional administrative costs, lower contracted services and lower non-cash stock compensation expense, partially offset by higher legal costs. general and administrative expense increased to $241 in 2015, compared to $237 in 2014, primarily due to higher non-cash stock compensation expense and contracted services, partially offset by headcount reductions resulting in lower corporate direct costs. general and administrative expense as a percentage of sales was 3.5% in 2016, compared to 4.0% and 3.5% in 2015 and 2014, respectively.
impairment of long-lived assets totaled $977, $56 and $26 for 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. the 2016 impairments were primarily related to the impairment of long-lived assets at yanacocha in south america, due to an increase in asset retirement obligations and related asset as a result of the updated long-term mining and closure plans which was determined to be an impairment indicator. for additional information regarding our review of the yanacocha long-term mining and closure plans, see note 6 to our consolidated financial statements. the 2015 impairments were primarily related to assets in south america, non-essential equipment unrelated to operations at corporate and other and an intangible asset in africa. the 2014 impairments were primarily related to non-essential equipment at carlin and phoenix in north america, corporate and other and south america, specifically for certain assets at conga that have been sold.
other expense, net was $58, $116, and $92 for 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively. the decrease in 2016 from 2015 is primarily due to the prior year charge from the ratification of the ghana investment agreement, acquisition costs related to cc&v in 2015 and lower current year power plant costs in western australia. the increase in 2015 from 2014 is primarily due to a charge from the ratification of the ghana investment agreement and acquisition costs related to cc&v in 2015, partially offset by lower restructuring and power plant costs.
other income, net was $69, $135, and $158 for 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively. the decrease in 2016 from 2015 is primarily due to the gain on the deconsolidation of tmac in 2015, gains from the sale of non-core assets, such as hemlo and egr during 2015, and losses recognized on debt repayments in 2016. these decreases were partially offset by a current year gain on the sale of our investment in regis and lower other-than-temporary impairments on marketable security investments. the decrease in 2015 from
62
2014 is primarily due to higher other-than-temporary impairments on marketable security investments and lower refinery income from the sale of egr, partially offset by the gain on the deconsolidation of tmac in 2015 and gains on the sales of egr and waihi during 2015.
interest expense, net was $273, $297 and $330 for 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. capitalized interest totaled $33, $40 and $23 in each year, respectively. interest expense, net decreased in 2016 compared to 2015 due to lower debt discount amortization and reduced debt balances due to the partial early extinguishment of the 2017, 2019 and 2039 senior notes and repayment of the 2019 term loan in 2016. capitalized interest decreased compared to 2015 primarily due to merian project completion. interest expense, net decreased in 2015 compared to 2014 due to increased capitalized interest and lower debt discount amortization. capitalized interest increased compared to 2014 primarily due the merian project and the addition of cc&v.
income and mining tax expense was $563, $391 and $204 for 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. the effective tax rate is driven by a number of factors as illustrated in the table below. the rate is also influenced by variables such as the company's income, the geographic distribution of that income, the non-recognition of tax assets, percentage depletion, changes in tax laws, and the impact of specific transactions and assessments. as a result, the effective tax rate will fluctuate, sometimes significantly, year to year. this trend is expected to continue in future periods. for additional information regarding our income and mining taxes, including details of our deferred tax assets, see note 10 to our consolidated financial statements.

during 2016, the holt property royalty obligation increased due to increases in gold prices and decreases in discount rates. during 2015, the holt property royalty obligation decreased due to decreases in gold prices and increases in discount rates.
during 2016, the income from batu hijau operations increased primarily due to higher gold sale volumes, higher average realized gold prices and lower operating costs, partially offset by lower copper sale volumes and lower realized copper prices. in addition, 2016 did not include a full year of operations as the sale of batu hijau was completed in november 2016. during 2015, the income from batu hijau operations increased primarily due to higher gold and copper sales volumes, partially offset by higher operating costs and lower average realized gold and copper prices.
the batu hijau transaction was completed on november 2, 2016. newmont recognized a loss on sale of $600 in 2016. there was no loss recorded during 2015 and 2014.
for additional information regarding our discontinued operations, see note 3 to our consolidated financial statements. for discussion regarding batu hijau's operating results, see the discontinued operations section in results of consolidated operations below.
net loss (income) attributable to noncontrolling interests, net of tax was $570, $140, and $37 in 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively. the loss from noncontrolling interests increased in 2016 from 2015 due to decreased earnings at yanacocha, primarily from the impairment of long-lived assets. the loss from noncontrolling interests increased in 2015 from 2014 due to decreased earnings at yanacocha and the deconsolidation of our ownership interest in tmac in 2015.
other comprehensive income (loss) was $-, $144, and ($301) in 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively. the decrease in 2016 from 2015 was primarily due to the sale of regis in the current year compared to unrealized gains in regis in the prior year. the increase in 2015 from 2014 was primarily due to unrealized gains in regis compared to unrealized losses in the prior year, which were subsequently recognized as other-than-temporary impairment in 2015, in addition to unrealized gains from a decrease of the pension liability compared to unrealized losses in the prior year.

consolidated gold ounces produced increased 4% due to:
·   higher production from north america due to a full year of operation at cc&amp;v, long canyon achieving commercial production in november 2016, and higher ore tons, grade, and leach recoveries at carlin, partially offset by a planned stripping campaign at twin creeks;

·   higher production from africa due to higher throughput as a result of higher mill utilization and slightly higher mill recovery rates, partially offset by lower ore grades milled and a build-up of mill in-circuit inventory;

·   lower production from asia pacific due to the sale of waihi in 2015, partially offset by higher throughput and higher ore grade milled at kalgoorlie, higher ore tons mined and milled at tanami, and higher throughput and mill recovery rates at boddington; and

·   lower production from south america primarily due to lower mill throughput, recovery and grade at yanacocha, partially offset by merian achieving commercial production in october 2016.

consolidated copper production decreased 5% primarily due to lower heap leach recoveries and lower ore grade milled at phoenix and lower ore grade milled at boddington, partially offset by higher throughput and recovery at boddington.
costs applicable to sales per consolidated gold ounce and copper pound increased 3% and 8%, respectively, due to higher stockpile inventory adjustments at yanacocha and ahafo and lower ore grade mined and milled, partially offset by higher ounces sold as a result of more ore tons mined and higher mill throughput.
depreciation and amortization increased 8% and 22% per gold ounce and copper pound, respectively, due to higher stockpile inventory adjustments, higher amortization rates, capitalization of additional assets, and lower copper pounds sold.
all-in sustaining costs per consolidated gold ounce decreased 2% primarily due to higher ounces sold and lower sustaining capital spend. all-in sustaining costs per copper pound increased 7% primarily due to lower copper pounds sold.
2015 compared to 2014

·   lower production from africa primarily due to lower grade at ahafo;

·   lower production from south america primarily due to lower mill recovery, partially offset by higher grade;

·   higher production at our asia pacific operations due to higher grade, throughput and recovery at boddington and tanami, partially offset by the sale of waihi in 2015 and the sale of jundee in 2014;

·   higher production from north america primarily due to the completion of a stripping campaign at twin creeks, the purchase of cc&amp;v, partially offset by the sale of la herradura and midas in 2014;

consolidated copper production increased 9% primarily due to higher ore grade milled and higher mill throughput and recovery at boddington.
costs applicable to sales per consolidated gold ounce decreased 6% due to lower direct operating costs primarily as a result of lower fuel prices and a favorable australian dollar/u.s. dollar exchange rate, and lower stockpile and leach pad inventory adjustments, partially offset by lower gold ounces sold. costs applicable to sales per consolidated copper pound decreased 24% due to lower direct operating costs primarily as a result of lower fuel prices and a favorable australian dollar/u.s. dollar exchange rate, in addition to higher copper pounds sold and lower stockpile inventory adjustments.
depreciation and amortization per consolidated gold ounce increased 3% due to lower gold ounces sold and asset sales. depreciation and amortization per consolidated copper pound decreased 5% primarily due to higher copper pounds sold and lower stockpile inventory adjustments.

(2)   amounts represent principal of $16 and estimated interest payments of $1.

(3)   mining operations are subject to extensive environmental regulations in the jurisdictions in which they operate. pursuant to environmental regulations, we are required to close our operations and reclaim and remediate the lands that operations have disturbed. the estimated undiscounted cash outflows of these reclamation and remediation liabilities are reflected here. for more information regarding reclamation and remediation liabilities, see note 6 to the consolidated financial statements.

75
(4)   contractual obligations for employee-related benefits include severance, workers' participation, pension and other benefit plans. pension plan benefit payments beyond 2025 cannot be reasonably estimated given variable market conditions and actuarial assumptions and are not included.

(5)   we are unable to reasonably estimate the timing of our uncertain income tax liabilities and interest payments beyond 2016 due to uncertainties in the timing of the effective settlement of tax positions.

other liquidity matters at december 31, 2016, the company had $2,756 in cash and cash equivalents, of which $1,044 was held in foreign subsidiaries and is primarily held in u.s. dollar denominated accounts with the remainder in foreign currencies readily convertible to u.s. dollars. at december 31, 2016, $346 of the consolidated cash and cash equivalents was attributable to noncontrolling interests primarily related to our yanacocha and merian operations which is being held to fund those operations and development projects. at december 31, 2016, $982 in consolidated cash and cash equivalents ($653 attributable to newmont) was held at certain foreign subsidiaries that, if repatriated, may be subject to withholding taxes. the repatriation of this cash and the applicable withholding taxes would generate foreign tax credits in the u.s. as a result, we expect that there would be no additional tax burden upon repatriation after considering the cash cost associated with the withholding taxes.
we believe that our liquidity and capital resources from u.s. operations and flow-through foreign subsidiaries are adequate to fund our u.s. operations and corporate activities.
environmental        our mining and exploration activities are subject to various federal and state laws and regulations governing the protection of the environment. we have made, and expect to make in the future, expenditures to comply with such laws and regulations, but cannot predict the full amount of such future expenditures. at december 31, 2016 and 2015, $1,792 and $1,300, respectively, were accrued for reclamation costs relating to currently or recently producing or development stage mineral properties, of which $28 and $29, respectively, were classified as current liabilities.
in addition, we are involved in several matters concerning environmental obligations associated with former mining activities. based upon our best estimate of our liability for these matters, $298 and $318 were accrued for such obligations at december 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. we spent $30, $41 and $43 during 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively, for environmental obligations related to the former, primarily historic, mining activities and have classified $33 and $34 as a current liability at december 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. expenditures during 2016 relate primarily to the midnite mine site and dawn mill site in washington state and the con mine in canada. expenditures during 2015 relate primarily to the settlement payment with the state of california related to the empire star mine remediation and past costs, midnite mine site and dawn mill site and the con mine. expenditures during 2014 relate primarily to the midnite mine site and dawn mill site, the con mine and the resurrection mine in colorado.
during the year ended 2016, 2015, and 2014, capital expenditures were approximately $79, $137, and $122, respectively, to comply with environmental regulations.

the company is conducting a comprehensive study of the yanacocha long-term mining and closure plans consistent with the requirement to submit an updated closure plan to peruvian regulators every five years. the revised closure plan will be submitted to peruvian regulators in the second half of 2017. the revised closure plan may require the company to provide additional reclamation bonding for yanacocha.
on december 7, 2016, the company presented its current assessment of the yanacocha closure plan to the board of directors after completing its review of preliminary changes to the yanacocha closure plan based on revised long-term mining plans, the study work completed to date and in connection with the company's annual process to evaluate and update all asset retirement obligations. as a result, the company recorded an increase to the reclamation obligation at yanacocha of $425. this increase to the reclamation obligation resulted in an increase to the recorded asset retirement cost asset of $348 related to the producing portions of the mine and a non-cash charge to reclamation expense for the quarter ended december 31, 2016 of $77 related to operations no longer in production. the increase to the reclamation liability is primarily due to higher estimated long-term water management costs, heap leach earthworks and related support activities.
the company determined that an impairment indicator existed as a result of the updated yanacocha long-term mining and closure plans and the related increases in estimated future closure costs that resulted in the increase to the asset retirement cost asset. as such, yanacocha's long-lived assets were tested for recoverability and an assessment of impairment was performed, which resulted in a non-cash impairment charge of $970. see note 7 to our consolidated financial statements for further information regarding impairment of long-lived assets recorded for yanacocha as of december 31, 2016.
for more information on the company's reclamation and remediation liabilities, see notes 6 and 29 to the consolidated financial statements.
forward-looking statements        the foregoing discussion and analysis, as well as certain information contained elsewhere in this annual report, contain "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of section 27a of the securities act of 1933, as amended, and section 21e of the securities exchange act of 1934, as amended, and are intended to be covered by the safe harbor created thereby. see the discussion in forward-looking statements in item 1, business.
non-gaap financial measures        non-gaap financial measures are intended to provide additional information only and do not have any standard meaning prescribed by u.s. generally accepted accounting principles ("gaap"). these measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with gaap. unless otherwise noted, we present the non-gaap financial measures of our continuing operations in the tables below. for additional information regarding our discontinued operations, see note 3 to the consolidated financial statements.

earnings before interest, taxes and depreciation and amortization and adjusted earnings before interest, taxes and depreciation and amortization management uses earnings before interest, taxes and depreciation and amortization ("ebitda") and ebitda adjusted for non-core or certain items that have a disproportionate impact on our results for a particular period ("adjusted ebitda") as non-gaap measures to evaluate the company's operating performance. ebitda and adjusted ebitda do not represent, and should not be considered an alternative to, net income (loss), operating income (loss), or cash flow from operations as those terms are defined by gaap, and do not necessarily indicate whether cash flows will be sufficient to fund cash needs. although adjusted ebitda and similar measures are frequently used as measures of operations and the ability to meet debt service requirements by other companies, our calculation of adjusted ebitda is not necessarily comparable to such other similarly titled captions of other companies. the company believes that adjusted ebitda provides useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our operating results in the same manner as our management and board of directors. management's determination of the components of adjusted ebitda are evaluated periodically and based, in part, on a review of non-gaap financial measures used by mining industry analysts. net income (loss) attributable to newmont stockholders is reconciled to ebitda and adjusted ebitda as follows:

free cash flow management uses free cash flow as a non-gaap measure to analyze cash flows generated from operations. free cash flow is net cash provided by operating activities less net cash provided by operating activities of discontinued operations less additions to property, plant and mine development as presented on the statements of consolidated cash flows. the company believes free cash flow is also useful as one of the bases for comparing the company's performance with its competitors. although free cash flow and similar measures are frequently used as measures of cash flows generated from operations by other companies, the company's calculation of free cash flow is not necessarily comparable to such other similarly titled captions of other companies.
the presentation of non-gaap free cash flow is not meant to be considered in isolation or as an alternative to net income as an indicator of the company's performance, or as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities as a measure of liquidity as those terms are defined by gaap, and does not necessarily indicate whether cash flows will be sufficient to fund cash needs. the company's definition of free cash flow is limited in that it does not represent residual cash flows available for discretionary expenditures due to the fact that the measure does not deduct the payments required for debt service and other contractual obligations or payments made for business acquisitions. therefore, the company believes it is important to view free cash flow as a measure that provides supplemental information to the company's statements of consolidated cash flows.
the following table sets forth a reconciliation of free cash flow, a non-gaap financial measure, to net cash provided by operating activities, which the company believes to be the gaap financial measure most directly comparable to free cash flow, as well as information regarding net cash used in investing activities and net cash provided by (used in) financing activities.

costs applicable to sales per ounce/pound costs applicable to sales per ounce/pound are non-gaap financial measures. these measures are calculated by dividing the costs applicable to sales of gold and copper by gold ounces or copper pounds sold, respectively. these measures are calculated on a consistent basis for the periods presented on a consolidated basis. costs applicable to sales per ounce/pound statistics are intended to provide additional information only and do not have any standardized meaning prescribed by gaap and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with gaap. the measures are not necessarily indicative of operating profit or cash flow from operations as determined under gaap. other companies may calculate these measures differently.
the following tables reconcile these non-gaap measures to the most directly comparable gaap measures.

all-in sustaining costs        newmont has worked to develop a metric that expands on gaap measures, such as cost of goods sold, and non-gaap measures, such as costs applicable to sales per ounce, to provide visibility into the economics of our mining operations related to expenditures, operating performance and the ability to generate cash flow from our continuing operations.
current gaap-measures used in the mining industry, such as cost of goods sold, do not capture all of the expenditures incurred to discover, develop and sustain production. therefore, we believe that all-in sustaining costs is a non-gaap measure that provides additional information to management, investors and analysts that aid in the understanding of the economics of our operations and performance compared to other producers and in the investor's visibility by better defining the total costs associated with production.
all-in sustaining cost ("aisc") amounts are intended to provide additional information only and do not have any standardized meaning prescribed by gaap and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with gaap. the measures are not necessarily indicative of operating profit or cash flow from operations as determined under gaap. other companies may calculate these measures differently as a result of differences in the underlying accounting principles, policies applied and in accounting frameworks such as in international financial reporting standards ("ifrs"), or by reflecting the benefit from selling non-gold metals as a reduction to aisc. differences may also arise related to definitional differences of sustaining versus development capital activities based upon each company's internal policies.
the following disclosure provides information regarding the adjustments made in determining the all-in sustaining costs measure:
costs applicable to sales - includes all direct and indirect costs related to current production incurred to execute the current mine plan. we exclude certain exceptional or unusual amounts from costs applicable to sales ("cas"), such as significant revisions to recovery amounts. cas includes by-product credits from certain metals obtained during the process of extracting and processing the primary ore-body. cas is accounted for on an accrual basis and excludes depreciation and amortization and reclamation and remediation, which is consistent with our presentation of cas on the statements of consolidated operations. in determining aisc, only the cas associated with producing and selling an ounce of gold or a pound of copper is included in the measure. therefore, the amount of gold cas included in aisc is derived from the cas presented in the company's statements of consolidated operations less the amount of cas attributable to the production of copper at our phoenix and boddington mines. the copper cas at those mine sites is disclosed in note 5 to the consolidated financial statements. the allocation of cas between gold and copper at the phoenix and boddington mines is based upon the relative sales value of copper and gold produced during the period.
reclamation costs - includes accretion expense related to asset retirement obligation ("aro") and the amortization of the related asset retirement cost ("arc") for the company's operating properties. accretion related to the aro and the amortization of the arc assets for reclamation does not reflect annual cash outflows but are calculated in accordance with gaap. the accretion and
82
amortization reflect the periodic costs of reclamation associated with current production and are therefore included in the measure. the allocation of these costs to gold and copper is determined using the same allocation used in the allocation of cas between gold and copper at the phoenix and boddington mines.
advanced projects, research and development and exploration - includes incurred expenses related to projects that are designed to increase or enhance current production and exploration. we note that as current resources are depleted, exploration and advanced projects are necessary for us to replace the depleting reserves or enhance the recovery and processing of the current reserves. as this relates to sustaining our production, and is considered a continuing cost of a mining company, these costs are included in the aisc measure. these costs are derived from the advanced projects, research and development and exploration amounts presented in the statements of consolidated operations less the amount attributable to the production of copper at our phoenix and boddington mines. the allocation of these costs to gold and copper is determined using the same allocation used in the allocation of cas between gold and copper at the phoenix and boddington mines.
general and administrative - includes costs related to administrative tasks not directly related to current production, but rather related to support our corporate structure and fulfill our obligations to operate as a public company. including these expenses in the aisc metric provides visibility of the impact that general and administrative activities have on current operations and profitability on a per ounce basis.
other expense, net - includes administrative costs to support current production. we exclude certain exceptional or unusual expenses from other expense, net, such as restructuring, as these are not indicative to sustaining our current operations. furthermore, this adjustment to other expense, net is also consistent with the nature of the adjustments made to net income (loss) attributable to newmont stockholders as disclosed in the company's non-gaap financial measure adjusted net income (loss). the allocation of these costs to gold and copper is determined using the same allocation used in the allocation of cas between gold and copper at the phoenix and boddington mines.
treatment and refining costs - includes costs paid to smelters for treatment and refining of our concentrates to produce the salable metal. these costs are presented net as a reduction of sales on our statements of consolidated operations.
sustaining capital - we determined sustaining capital as those capital expenditures that are necessary to maintain current production and execute the current mine plan. capital expenditures to develop new operations, or related to projects at existing operations where these projects will enhance production or reserves, are considered development. we determined the classification of sustaining and development capital projects based on a systematic review of our project portfolio in light of the nature of each project. sustaining capital costs are relevant to the aisc metric as these are needed to maintain the company's current operations and provide improved transparency related to our ability to finance these expenditures from current operations. the allocation of these costs to gold and copper is determined using the same allocation used in the allocation of cas between gold and copper at the phoenix and boddington mines.

accounting developments        for a discussion of recently adopted accounting pronouncements and recently issued accounting pronouncements, see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements.
critical accounting policies        listed below are the accounting policies that we believe are critical to our financial statements due to the degree of uncertainty regarding the estimates or assumptions involved and the magnitude of the asset, liability, revenue or expense being reported. our discussion of financial condition and results of operations is based upon the information reported in our consolidated financial statements. the preparation of these consolidated financial statements in conformity with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles ("gaap") requires us to make assumptions and estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses, as well as the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of our financial statements. we base our assumptions and estimates on historical experience and various other sources that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. actual results may differ from the estimates we calculate due to changes in circumstances, global economics and
86
politics, and general business conditions. a summary of our significant accounting policies is detailed in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements. we have outlined below those policies identified as being critical to the understanding of our business and results of operations and that require the application of significant management judgment.
depreciation and amortization expenditures for new facilities or equipment and expenditures that extend the useful lives of existing facilities or equipment are capitalized and depreciated using the straight-line method at rates sufficient to amortize such costs over the estimated future lives of such facilities or equipment and their components. these lives do not exceed the estimated mine life based on proven and probable reserves as the useful lives of these assets are considered to be limited to the life of the relevant mine.
costs incurred to develop new properties are capitalized as incurred where it has been determined that the property can be economically developed based on the existence of proven and probable reserves. at our surface mines, these costs include costs to further delineate the ore body and remove overburden to initially expose the ore body. at our underground mines, these costs include the cost of building access ways, shaft sinking and access, lateral development, drift development, ramps and infrastructure development. all such costs are amortized using the units-of-production ("uop") method over the estimated life of the ore body based on estimated recoverable ounces to be produced from proven and probable reserves.
major mine development costs incurred after the commencement of production are amortized using the uop method based on estimated recoverable ounces to be produced from proven and probable reserves. to the extent that such costs benefit the entire ore body, they are amortized over the estimated recoverable ounces or pounds in proven and probable reserves of the entire ore body. costs incurred to access specific ore blocks or areas that only provide benefit over the life of that block or area are amortized over the estimated recoverable ounces or pounds in proven and probable reserves of that specific ore block or area.
capitalized asset retirement costs incurred are amortized according to how the related assets are being depreciated. open pit and underground mining costs are amortized using the uop method based on recoverable ounces by source. other costs, including leaching facilities, tailing facilities, and mills and other infrastructure costs, are amortized using the straight-line method over the same estimated future lives of the associated assets.
the calculation of the uop rate of amortization, and therefore the annual amortization charge to operations, could be materially impacted to the extent that actual production in the future is different from current forecasts of production based on proven and probable reserves. this would generally occur to the extent that there were significant changes in any of the factors or assumptions used in determining reserves. these changes could include: (i) an expansion of proven and probable reserves through exploration activities; (ii) differences between estimated and actual costs of production, due to differences in grade, metal recovery rates and foreign currency exchange rates; and (iii) differences between actual commodity prices and commodity price assumptions used in the estimation of reserves. if reserves decreased significantly, amortization charged to operations would increase; conversely, if reserves increased significantly, amortization charged to operations would decrease. such changes in reserves could similarly impact the useful lives of assets depreciated on a straight-line basis, where those lives are limited to the life of the mine, which in turn is limited to the life of the proven and probable reserves.
the expected useful lives used in depreciation and amortization calculations are determined based on applicable facts and circumstances, as described above. significant judgment is involved in the determination of useful lives, and no assurance can be given that actual useful lives will not differ significantly from the useful lives assumed for the purpose of depreciation and amortization calculations.
carrying value of stockpiles stockpiles represent ore that has been extracted from the mine and is available for further processing. mine sequencing may result in mining material at a faster rate than can be processed. we generally process the highest ore grade material first to maximize metal production; however, a blend of gold ore stockpiles may be processed to balance hardness and/or metallurgy in order to maximize throughput and recovery. processing of lower grade stockpiled ore may continue after mining operations are completed. sulfide copper ores are subject to oxidation over time which can reduce expected future recoveries. stockpiles are measured by estimating the number of tons added and removed from the stockpile, the number of contained ounces or pounds (based on assay data), and the estimated metallurgical recovery rates (based on the expected processing method). stockpile ore tonnages are verified by periodic surveys. costs are added to stockpiles based on current mining costs, including applicable overhead and depreciation and amortization relating to mining operations and removed at each stockpile's average cost per recoverable unit as material is processed.
87
we record stockpiles at the lower of average cost or net realizable value, and carrying values are evaluated at least quarterly. net realizable value represents the estimated future sales price based on short-term and long-term metals price assumptions that are applied to expected short-term (12 months or less) and long-term sales from stockpiles, less estimated costs to complete production and bring the product to sale. the primary factors that influence the need to record write-downs of stockpiles include declines in short-term or long-term metals prices, increases in costs for production inputs such as labor, fuel and energy, materials and supplies, as well as realized ore grades and recovery rates. we recorded write-downs to reduce the carrying value of stockpiles to net realizable value of $144, $70 and $154 in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively, as components of cost applicable to sales and depreciation and amortization. the significant assumption in determining the stockpile net realizable value for each mine site at december 31, 2016 is a long-term gold price of $1,300 per ounce. a decrease of $100 per ounce in the long-term gold price assumption could result in a write-down to the carrying value of stockpiles of $150.
other less significant assumptions include future operating and capital costs, metal recoveries, production levels, commodity prices, proven and probable reserve quantities, engineering data and other factors unique to each operation based on the life of mine plans, as well as a long-term copper price of $3.00 per pound and a u.s. to australian dollar long-term exchange rate of $0.80. if short-term and long-term commodity prices decrease, estimated future processing costs increase, or other negative factors occur, it may be necessary to record a write-down of ore on stockpiles. a high degree of judgment is involved in determining such assumptions and estimates and no assurance can be given that actual results will not differ significantly from those estimates and assumptions.

carrying value of ore on leach pads ore on leach pads represent ore that has been mined and placed on leach pads where a solution is applied to the surface of the heap to dissolve the gold or copper. costs are added to ore on leach pads based on current mining costs, including applicable depreciation and amortization relating to mining operations. costs are removed from ore on leach pads as ounces are recovered based on the average cost per estimated recoverable ounce of gold or pound of copper on the leach pad.
estimates of recoverable ore on the leach pads are calculated from the quantities of ore placed on the leach pads (measured tons added to the leach pads), the grade of ore placed on the leach pads (based on assay data) and a recovery percentage (based on ore type). in general, leach pads recover between 50% and 95% of the recoverable ounces in the first year of leaching, declining each year thereafter until the leaching process is complete.
although the quantities of recoverable ore placed on the leach pads are reconciled by comparing the grades of ore placed on pads to the quantities of metal actually recovered (metallurgical balancing), the nature of the leaching process inherently limits the ability to precisely monitor inventory levels. as a result, the metallurgical balancing process is constantly monitored and estimates are refined based on actual results over time. historically, our operating results have not been materially impacted by variations between the estimated and actual recoverable quantities of metal on our leach pads. variations between actual and estimated quantities resulting from changes in assumptions and estimates that do not result in write-downs to net realizable value are accounted for on a prospective basis. we recorded write-downs to reduce the carrying value of leach pads to net realizable value of $270, $272 and $253 in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively, as components of cost applicable to sales and depreciation and amortization. the significant assumption in determining the net realizable value for each mine site at december 31, 2016 is a long-term gold price of $1,300 per ounce. a decrease of $100 per ounce in the long-term gold price assumption could result in a write-down to the carrying value of leach pads of $50.
89
other less significant assumptions include future operating and capital costs, metal recoveries, production levels, proven and probable reserve quantities, engineering data and other factors unique to each operation based on the life of mine plans, as well as a long-term copper price of $3.00 per pound. if short-term and long-term commodity prices decrease, estimated future processing costs increase, or other negative factors occur, it may be necessary to record a write-down of ore on leach pads to net realizable value.

carrying value of long-lived assets we review and evaluate our long-lived assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the related carrying amounts may not be recoverable. an impairment loss is measured and recorded based on the estimated fair value of the long-lived assets being tested for impairment and their carrying amounts. fair value is typically determined through the use of an income
90
approach utilizing estimates of discounted pre-tax future cash flows or a market approach utilizing recent transaction activity for comparable properties. these approaches are considered level 3 measurements. occasionally, such as when an asset is held for sale, market prices are used. we believe our estimates and models used to determine fair value are similar to what a market participant would use.
the estimated undiscounted cash flows used to assess recoverability of long-lived assets and to measure the fair value of our mining operations are derived from current business plans, which are developed using short-term price forecasts reflective of the current price environment and our projections for long-term average metal prices. in addition to short- and long-term metal price assumptions, other assumptions include estimates of commodity-based and other input costs; proven and probable mineral reserves estimates, including the timing and cost to develop and produce the reserves; value beyond proven and probable estimates; estimated future closure costs; and the use of appropriate discount rates.
the significant assumption in determining the future cash flows for each mine site at december 31, 2016 is a long-term gold price of $1,300 per ounce. a decrease of $100 per ounce in the long-term gold price assumption could result in an impairment of our long lived assets of $- to $1,300 before consideration of other value beyond proven and probable reserves which may significantly decrease the amount of any potential impairment charge.
other less significant assumptions include proven and probable mineral reserve estimates, value beyond proven and probable estimates, the timing and cost to develop and produce the reserves, commodity-based and other input costs, future closure costs and discount rates unique to each operation, as well as a long-term copper price of $3.00 per pound and u.s. to australian dollar long-term exchange rate of $0.80.
during 2016, 2015 and 2014, we recorded impairments of $977, $56, and $26, respectively, to reduce the carrying value of long-lived assets in impairment of long-lived assets. refer to note 7 to the consolidated financial statements for further information regarding impairments.
as discussed above under depreciation and amortization, various factors could impact our ability to achieve our forecasted production schedules from proven and probable reserves which could impact the carrying value of our long-lived assets. the ability to achieve the estimated quantities of recoverable minerals from exploration stage mineral interests involves further risks in addition to those factors applicable to mineral interests where proven and probable reserves have been identified, due to the lower level of confidence that the identified mineralized material could ultimately be mined economically. assets classified as exploration potential have the highest level of risk that the carrying value of the asset can be ultimately realized, due to the still lower level of geological confidence and economic modeling.
events that could result in additional impairment of our long-lived assets include, but are not limited to, decreases in future metal prices, unfavorable changes in foreign exchange rates, increases in future closure costs, and any event that might otherwise have a material adverse effect on mine site cash flows.
assets held for sale and discontinued operations we report a business as held for sale when management has approved or received approval to sell the business and is committed to a formal plan, the business is available for immediate sale, the business is being actively marketed, the sale is probable and recognition of a completed sale is expected to occur within one year, the sales price is reasonable in relation to its current fair value and actions required to complete the sale indicate that it is unlikely that significant changes to the plan will be made or the plan will be withdrawn, in accordance with accounting standard codification ("asc") 360, property, plant and equipment. a business classified as held for sale is recorded at the lower of its carrying amount or estimated fair value less cost to sell. if the carrying amount of the business exceeds its estimated fair value less cost to sell, a loss is recognized. assets and liabilities related to a business classified as held for sale are segregated in the current and prior balance sheets in the period in which the business is classified as held for sale.
we report the results of operations of a business as discontinued operations if a disposal represents a strategic shift that has (or will have) a major effect on our operations and financial results when the business is classified as held for sale, in accordance with asc 360, property, plant and equipment and asc 205-20, presentation of financial statements - discontinued operations. the results of discontinued operations are reported in net income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of tax in the accompanying statements of consolidated operations for current and prior periods, including any gain or loss recognized on closing or adjustment of the carrying amount to fair value less cost to sell.
91
derivative instruments with the exception of the call spread transactions (as described in note 13 to the consolidated financial statements), all financial instruments that meet the definition of a derivative are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value. changes in the fair value of derivatives are recorded in the statements of consolidated operations, except for the effective portion of the change in fair value of derivatives that are designated as cash flow hedges. management applies judgment in estimating the fair value of instruments that are highly sensitive to assumptions such as commodity prices, market volatilities, foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. variations in these factors could materially affect amounts credited or charged to earnings to reflect the changes in fair value of derivatives. certain derivative contracts are accounted for as cash flow hedges, whereby the effective portion of changes in fair value of these instruments are deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and will be recognized in the statements of consolidated operations when the underlying transaction designated as the hedged item impacts earnings. the derivative contracts accounted for as cash flow hedges are designated against foreign currency expenditures and diesel purchases where management believes the forecasted transaction is probable of occurring. to the extent that management determines that the forecasted transactions are no longer probable of occurring, gains and losses deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) would be reclassified to the statements of consolidated operations immediately.
reclamation and remediation obligations reclamation costs are allocated to expense over the life of the related assets and are periodically adjusted to reflect changes in the estimated present value resulting from the passage of time and revisions to the estimates of either the timing or amount of the reclamation costs. reclamation obligations are based on when the spending for an existing environmental disturbance will occur. changes in reclamation estimates at non-operating mines are reflected in earnings in the period an estimate is revised. we review, on at least an annual basis, the reclamation obligation at each mine.
remediation costs are accrued based on management's best estimate at the end of each period of the costs expected to be incurred at a site. such cost estimates may include ongoing care, maintenance and monitoring costs. changes in remediation estimates at inactive mines are reflected in earnings in the period an estimate is revised. water treatment costs included in environmental remediation obligations are discounted to their present value as cash flows are readily estimable. all other costs of future expenditures for environmental remediation obligations are not discounted to their present value.
accounting for reclamation and remediation obligations requires management to make estimates unique to each mining operation of the future costs we will incur to complete the reclamation and remediation work required to comply with existing laws and regulations. any such changes in future costs, the timing of reclamation activities, scope, or the exclusion of certain costs not considered reclamation and remediation costs, could materially impact the amounts charged to earnings for reclamation and remediation. additionally, future changes to environmental laws and regulations could increase the extent of reclamation and remediation work required.
income and mining taxes we account for income taxes using the liability method, recognizing certain temporary differences between the financial reporting basis of our liabilities and assets and the related income tax basis for such liabilities and assets. this method generates either a net deferred income tax liability or asset for us, as measured by the statutory tax rates in effect. we derive our deferred income tax charge or benefit by recording the change in either the net deferred income tax liability or asset balance for the year. mining taxes represent state and provincial taxes levied on mining operations and are classified as income taxes as such taxes are based on a percentage of mining profits. with respect to the earnings that we derive from the operations of our consolidated subsidiaries, in those situations where the earnings are indefinitely reinvested, no deferred taxes have been provided on the unremitted earnings (including the excess of the carrying value of the net equity of such entities for financial reporting purposes over the tax basis of such equity) of our consolidated companies.
our operations are in multiple jurisdictions where uncertainties arise in the application of complex tax regulations. some of these tax regimes are defined by contractual agreements with the local government, while others are defined by general tax laws and regulations. we are subject to reviews of our income tax filings and other tax payments, and disputes can arise with the taxing authorities over the interpretation of its contracts or laws. we recognize potential liabilities and record tax liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the u.s. and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes will be due. we adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances; however, due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the tax liabilities. if our estimate of tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment, an additional charge to expense would result. if the
92
estimate of tax liabilities proves to be greater than the ultimate assessment, a tax benefit would result. we recognize interest and penalties, if any, related to unrecognized tax benefits in income and mining tax benefit (expense). in certain jurisdictions, we must pay a portion of the disputed amount to the local government in order to formally appeal the assessment. such payment is recorded as a receivable if we believe the amount is ultimately collectible.
valuation of deferred tax assets our deferred income tax assets include certain future tax benefits. we record a valuation allowance against any portion of those deferred income tax assets when we believe, based on the weight of available evidence, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred income tax asset will not be realized. we review the likelihood that we will realize the benefit of our deferred tax assets and therefore the need for valuation allowances on a quarterly basis, or more frequently if events indicate that a review is required. in determining the requirement for a valuation allowance, the historical and projected financial results of the legal entity or consolidated group recording the net deferred tax asset is considered, along with all other available positive and negative evidence.
certain categories of evidence carry more weight in the analysis than others based upon the extent to which the evidence may be objectively verified. we look to the nature and severity of cumulative pretax losses (if any) in the current three-year period ending on the evaluation date and the existence and frequency of prior cumulative pretax losses.
we utilize a rolling twelve quarters of pre-tax income or loss as a measure of our cumulative results in recent years. concluding that a valuation allowance is not required is difficult when there is significant negative evidence which is objective and verifiable, such as cumulative losses in recent years. however, a cumulative three year loss is not solely determinative of the need for a valuation allowance. we also consider all other available positive and negative evidence in our analysis.
other factors considered in the determination of the probability of the realization of the deferred tax assets include, but are not limited to:
·   earnings history;

·   projected future financial and taxable income based upon existing reserves and long-term estimates of commodity prices;

·   the duration of statutory carry forward periods;

·   prudent and feasible tax planning strategies readily available that may alter the timing of reversal of the temporary difference;

·   nature of temporary differences and predictability of reversal patterns of existing temporary differences; and

·   the sensitivity of future forecasted results to commodity prices and other factors.

the united states and australia are not in a cumulative three year historical loss as write-downs that occurred at boddington and long canyon in 2013 are no longer included in the analysis. other available positive and negative evidence was considered in our analysis. this analysis, which incorporated recent earnings history and forecasted future results, driven by its existing reserves and the forecasted long-term commodity prices, points to the full realization of those deferred tax assets not previously subject to a valuation allowance with one exception. that exception is the u.s. deferred tax asset related to the investment in yanacocha. it was determined that a full valuation allowance against this deferred tax asset was necessary in the amount of $290. we continue to believe it is more likely than not that other net deferred tax assets that do not currently carry a valuation allowance in the united states and australia will be fully realized in the future. accordingly, a valuation allowance related to those net deferred tax assets is not required.
a similar analysis was conducted in peru. based upon the same factors above and the declining production profile at yanacocha, it is more likely than not that the net deferred tax assets in peru will not be realized in the future. accordingly, an additional valuation allowance of $402 on these assets was recognized at december 31, 2016.
no corresponding deferred income tax benefit is recognized with respect to losses incurred and no corresponding deferred income tax expense is recognized with respect to earnings generated in jurisdictions with a valuation allowance. this causes variability in the effective tax rate. changes in the valuation allowance in peru, and in the u.s. related to the investment in peru, will continue to be recorded until the company determines that it is more likely than not that the net deferred tax assets will be realized. if
93
peruvian operating results improve on a sustained basis, or if certain tax planning strategies are implemented, conclusions could change, possibly resulting in a future decrease of the valuation allowance. this could have a significant impact on income tax expense in the period the valuation allowance is decreased and in subsequent periods.
the company determined that the realization of deferred tax assets related to certain carry forwards such as tax losses and tax pools in canada, capital losses in the u.s. and australia and foreign tax credits and alternative minimum tax credits in the u.s., does not meet the more likely than not standard. accordingly, these assets continue to be subject to a valuation allowance. at december 31, 2016, the valuation allowance related to these assets was $2,754. realization is dependent not only on generating sufficient taxable income in the period that net deferred tax assets reverse but also on the character/classification of that income. during 2016, the company completed transactions that created significant capital losses and some offsetting capital gains; an additional valuation allowance was placed on the created net capital loss carry forward, and made tax elections in order to utilize foreign tax credits and alternative minimum tax credits.
a decrease of $100 per ounce in the long-term gold price assumption could result in a write-down to our deferred income tax assets of $1,500. for additional risk factors that could impact the company's ability to realize the deferred tax assets, see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements.

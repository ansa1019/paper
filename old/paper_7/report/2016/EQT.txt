item 7.                     management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read the following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements, and the notes thereto, included in item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k.
consolidated results of continuing operations
2016 eqt highlights:
•   annual production sales volumes of 759.0 bcfe, 26% higher than 2015
•   marcellus sales volumes of 660.1 bcfe, 31% higher than 2015
•   the company completed two underwritten public offerings of common stock
•   the company increased its marcellus acreage position by acquiring approximately 145,500 net marcellus acres located primarily in northern west virginia and southwestern pennsylvania, including 122,100 net marcellus acres acquired through the statoil acquisition, the republic transaction, the trans energy merger and the pennsylvania acquisition
•   eqm issued common units through its $750 million atm program, receiving proceeds of $217.1 million
•   eqm issued $500.0 million of 4.125% senior notes due december 1, 2026
net loss from continuing operations attributable to eqt corporation for 2016 was $453.0 million, a loss of $2.71 per diluted share, compared with income from continuing operations attributable to eqt corporation of $85.2 million, $0.56 per diluted share, in 2015. the $538.2 million decrease in income from continuing operations attributable to eqt corporation was primarily attributable to a loss on derivatives not designated as hedges, a 20% decrease in the average realized price, higher operating expenses and higher net income attributable to noncontrolling interests of eqm and eqgp, partially offset by a 26% increase in production sales volumes and lower income tax expense.
eqt production received $279.4 million and $172.1 million of net cash settlements for derivatives not designated as hedges for the years ended december 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, that are included in the average realized price but are not in gaap operating revenues.
during the year ended december 31, 2016, the company recorded an impairment of long-lived assets of approximately $59.7 million related to certain gathering assets sold to eqm in october 2016. the impairment was a result of a reduction in estimated future cash flows caused by the low commodity price environment and the related reduced producer drilling activity and throughput. this impairment is reflected in unallocated expenses and not recorded on any operating segment.
income from continuing operations attributable to eqt corporation for 2015 was $85.2 million, $0.56 per diluted share, compared with $385.6 million, $2.53 per diluted share, in 2014. the $300.4 million decrease in income from continuing operations attributable to eqt corporation was primarily attributable to a 31% decrease in the average realized price, higher operating expenses, higher net income attributable to noncontrolling interests of eqm and eqgp and a gain on sale / exchange of assets in 2014, partially offset by a 27% increase in production sales volumes, increased gains on derivatives not designated as hedges and lower income tax expense.
eqt production received $172.1 million and $34.2 million of net cash settlements for derivatives not designated as hedges for the years ended december 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. these net cash settlements are included in the average realized price but are not in gaap operating revenues.

consolidated operational data the following table presents detailed natural gas and liquids operational information to assist in the understanding of the company's consolidated operations, including the calculation of the company's average realized price ($/mcfe), which is based on eqt production adjusted operating revenues, a non-gaap supplemental financial measure. eqt production adjusted operating revenues is presented because it is an important measure used by the company's management to evaluate period-to-period comparisons of earnings trends. eqt production adjusted operating revenues should not be considered as an alternative to eqt corporation total operating revenues as reported in the statements of consolidated operations, the most directly comparable

reconciliation of non-gaap measures the table below reconciles eqt production adjusted operating revenues, a non-gaap supplemental financial measure, to eqt corporation total operating revenues as reported in the statements of consolidated operations, its most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with gaap.
eqt production adjusted operating revenues (also referred to as total natural gas & liquids sales, including cash settled derivatives) is presented because it is an important measure used by the company's management to evaluate period-over-period comparisons of earnings trends. eqt production adjusted operating revenues as presented excludes the revenue impact of changes in the fair value of derivative instruments prior to settlement and the revenue impact of certain pipeline and net marketing services.  management utilizes eqt production adjusted operating revenues to evaluate earnings trends because the measure reflects only the impact of settled derivative contracts and thus does not impact the revenue from natural gas sales with the often volatile fluctuations in the fair value of derivatives prior to settlement.  eqt production adjusted operating revenues also excludes "pipeline and net marketing services" because management considers these revenues to be unrelated to the revenues for its natural gas and liquids production. "pipeline and net marketing services" primarily includes revenues for gathering services provided to third-parties as well as both the cost of and recoveries on third-party pipeline capacity not used for eqt production sales volumes. management further believes that eqt production adjusted operating revenues as presented provides useful information to investors for evaluating period-over-period earnings trends.

business segment results of operations business segment operating results from continuing operations are presented in the segment discussions and financial tables on the following pages.  operating segments are evaluated on their contribution to the company's consolidated results based on operating income.  other income, interest and income taxes are managed on a consolidated basis.  headquarters' costs are billed to the operating segments based upon a fixed allocation of the headquarters' annual operating budget.  unallocated expenses consist primarily of incentive compensation and administrative costs. in 2016, unallocated expenses also included impairment of long-lived assets of approximately $59.7 million related to certain gathering assets sold to eqm in october 2016. this impairment was recorded by eqt midstream prior to the sale and change in segments discussed below and does not relate to any of the recast segments.
the company has reported the components of each segment's operating income from continuing operations and various operational measures in the sections below, and where appropriate, has provided information describing how a measure was derived. eqt's management believes that presentation of this information provides useful information to management and investors regarding the financial condition, operations and trends of each of eqt's business segments without being obscured by the financial condition, operations and trends for the other segments or by the effects of corporate allocations of interest, income taxes and other income.  in addition, management uses these measures for budget planning purposes. the company has reconciled each segment's operating income to the company's consolidated operating income and net income in note 5 to the consolidated financial statements.
prior to the october 2016 sale, the company reported its results of operations through two business segments: eqt production and eqt midstream. eqt midstream included the company's gathering, transmission and storage businesses as well as the company's marketing operations that were conducted for the benefit of third-parties. marketing operations for the benefit of eqt production were reported in the eqt production segment. these reporting segments reflected the company's lines of business and were reported in the same manner in which the company evaluated its operating performance through september 30, 2016. following the october 2016 sale, the company adjusted its internal reporting structure to align with eqm's operations. these adjustments included transferring to eqt production (i) the operation of all midstream assets not owned by eqm and (ii) marketing operations conducted for the benefit of third-parties and resulted in changes to the company's reporting segments effective for this annual report on form 10-k. under the new reporting structure, the eqt production segment now includes the company's production activities, all of the company's marketing operations and certain non-core midstream operations primarily supporting the company's production activities. the eqt gathering segment contains the company's gathering assets that are included in eqm. the eqt transmission segment includes the company's ferc-regulated interstate pipeline and storage operations. the eqt gathering and eqt transmission segments are composed entirely of eqm's operations and no eqm activities are included within the eqt production segment. therefore, the financial and operational disclosures related to eqt gathering and eqt transmission in this annual report on form 10-k are the same as eqm's disclosures in its annual report on form 10-k for the year ended december 31, 2016. the segment disclosures and discussions contained within this report have been recast to reflect the current reporting structure for all periods presented.

year ended december 31, 2016 vs. december 31, 2015
eqt production's operating loss totaled $719.7 million for 2016 compared to operating income of $132.0 million for 2015.  the $851.7 million decrease in operating income was primarily due to a loss on derivatives not designated as hedges in 2016 compared to gains on derivatives not designated as hedges in 2015, a lower average realized price, increased operating expenses and decreased pipeline and net marketing services partly offset by increased sales volumes of produced natural gas and ngls.
total operating revenues were $1,387.1 million for 2016 compared to $2,131.7 million for 2015. sales of natural gas, oil and ngls decreased as a result of a lower average realized price, partly offset by a 26% increase in production sales volumes in 2016. eqt production received $279.4 million and $172.1 million of net cash settlements for derivatives not designated as hedges for the years ended december 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, that are included in the average realized price but are not in gaap operating revenues. changes in fair market value of derivative instruments prior to settlement are recognized in gain (loss) on derivatives not designated as hedges. the increase in production sales volumes was primarily the result of increased production from the 2014 and 2015 drilling programs, primarily in the marcellus play, partially offset by the normal production decline in the company's producing wells.
the $0.62 per mcfe decrease in the average realized price for the year ended december 31, 2016 was primarily due to the decrease in the average nymex natural gas price net of cash settled derivatives of $0.53 per mcf and a decrease in the average natural gas differential of $0.12 per mcf. the decrease in the average differential primarily related to lower basis partly offset by favorable cash settled basis swaps. while appalachian basin basis improved slightly for the year ended december 31, 2016 compared to the year ended december 31, 2015, basis in the united states northeast was significantly lower, particularly in the first quarter of 2016 compared to the first quarter of 2015, due to reduced demand attributable to warmer than normal weather conditions. additionally, the impact of changes in natural gas prices on physical basis sales contracts and fixed price sales contracts reduced basis year over year. the company started flowing eqt production's produced volumes to its rockies express pipeline capacity and texas eastern transmission gulf markets pipeline capacity in the fourth quarter of 2016, which resulted in a favorable impact to basis in 2016.
pipeline and net marketing services primarily includes gathering revenues for gathering services provided to third-parties and both the cost of and recoveries on third-party pipeline capacity not used to transport the company's produced volumes. the $14.5 million decrease in these revenues primarily related to reduced spreads on the company's tennessee gas pipeline capacity.
eqt production total operating revenues for the year ended december 31, 2016 included a $249.0 million loss on derivatives not designated as hedges compared to a $385.8 million gain on derivatives not designated as hedges for the year ended december 31, 2015. the losses for the year ended december 31, 2016 primarily related to unfavorable changes in the fair market value of eqt production's nymex swaps, partly offset by favorable changes in the fair market value of its basis swaps. during the year ended december 31, 2016, forward nymex prices increased while basis prices decreased.
operating expenses totaled $2,114.8 million for 2016 compared to $1,999.7 million for 2015. the increase in operating expenses primarily resulted from increases in dd&a, gathering, transmission and processing, partly offset by reductions in non-cash impairments of long-lived assets and exploration expense. gathering expense increased by $56.1 million due to increased affiliate firm capacity and volumetric charges and by $27.1 million due to increased third-party volumetric charges. transmission expense increased by $39.9 million related to increased third-party costs incurred to move eqt production's natural gas out of the appalachian basin and by $33.3 million primarily due to increased affiliate firm capacity charges. processing expenses increased $24.5 million due to increased production volumes.
the decrease in loe was primarily due to a $3.4 million decrease in salt water disposal costs as a result of increased recycling in the marcellus shale and certain operational cost savings in the huron operations, partly offset by $1.8 million of costs related to the consolidation of the company's huron operations. production taxes were essentially flat as a higher pennsylvania impact fee and severance tax settlement were offset by lower unhedged sales prices, a favorable property tax settlement and the expiration of the west virginia volume based tax in 2016. the state of west virginia previously imposed a $0.047 per mcf additional volume based severance tax that was terminated on july 1, 2016.
exploration expense decreased primarily due to a $28.6 million decrease in lease expirations related to acreage that the company does not intend to drill prior to expiration and expenses related to exploratory wells in 2015. sg&a expense increased $7.7 million due to an increase in litigation costs of $10.4 million, a $9.4 million charge related to the termination of the eqt corporation retirement plan for employees incurred in 2016, a $5.7 million increase to the reserve for uncollectible accounts, $2.6 million of non-recurring costs related to the consolidation of the company's huron operations and acquisition related expenses in 2016. these increases were partly offset by $11.2 million for drilling program reduction charges in the permian and huron basins in 2015, $4.5 million of decreased personnel costs, $3.2 million of decreased professional service costs and $1.9 million
42
of charges to write off expired right of ways options in 2015. the increase in depletion expense within dd&a expense was the result of higher produced volumes partly offset by a lower overall depletion rate in 2016. depreciation expense within dd&a increased as a result of additional assets in service.
impairment of long-lived assets decreased $115.5 million for the year ended december 31, 2016 compared to the year ended december 31, 2015. the 2016 impairment charge of $6.9 million primarily consisted of lease impairments on acreage that the company did not intend to drill prior to expiration. the 2015 impairment charge consisted of impairments of proved properties in the permian basin of texas of $94.3 million and impairments of proved properties in the utica shale of ohio of $4.3 million, as well as unproved property impairments of $19.7 million and a $4.2 million impairment of field level ngls processing equipment that was not being used. the proved properties impairments in 2015 were a result of continued declines in commodity prices and insufficient recovery of hydrocarbons to support continued development. the 2016 and 2015 impairments related to the unproved properties resulted from operational decisions to focus near-term development activities in the company's marcellus, upper devonian and utica acreage.
during the fourth quarter of 2016, eqt production sold a gathering system that primarily gathered gas for third-parties for $75.0 million. in conjunction with this transaction, the company realized a pre-tax gain of $8.0 million, which is included in gain on sale / exchange of assets in the statements of consolidated operations.
year ended december 31, 2015 vs. december 31, 2014
eqt production's operating income totaled $132.0 million for 2015 compared to $556.9 million for 2014.  the $424.9 million decrease in operating income was primarily due to a lower average realized price and increased operating expenses partly offset by increased sales volumes of produced natural gas and ngls and increased gains on derivatives not designated as hedges.
total operating revenues were $2,131.7 million for 2015 compared to $2,285.1 million for 2014. sales of natural gas, oil and ngls decreased as a result of a lower average realized price, partly offset by a 27% increase in production sales volumes in 2015. eqt production received $172.1 million and $34.2 million of net cash settlements for derivatives not designated as hedges for the years ended december 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively that are included in the average realized price but are not in gaap operating revenues. changes in fair market value of derivative instruments prior to settlement are recognized in gain (loss) on derivatives not designated as hedges. the increase in production sales volumes was primarily the result of increased production from the 2013 and 2014 drilling programs, primarily in the marcellus play. this increase was partially offset by the normal production decline in the company's producing wells.
the $1.41 per mcfe decrease in the average realized price for the year ended december 31, 2015 was primarily due to the decrease in the average nymex natural gas price net of cash settled derivatives of $1.07 per mcf, lower ngls prices and a decrease in the average natural gas differential of $0.08 per mcf. the decrease in the average differential primarily related to decreased basis in the appalachian basin and the united states northeast that was partly offset by the impact of changes in natural gas prices on fixed price sales contracts.
the $16.2 million decrease in pipeline and net marketing services primarily related to costs, net of recoveries, of $15.3 million for the company's rockies express pipeline capacity contract that started in the third quarter of 2015 and other decreased net marketing activity, including lower revenues on ngls marketed for non-affiliate producers.
eqt production total operating revenues for the year ended december 31, 2015 included a $385.8 million gain on derivatives not designated as hedges compared to an $80.9 million gain on derivatives not designated as hedges for the year ended december 31, 2014. the increased gains for the year ended december 31, 2015 primarily related to favorable changes in the fair market value of eqt production's nymex swaps due to a decrease in forward nymex prices during the year ended december 31, 2015. for the year ended december 31, 2014, eqt production total operating revenues also included a $24.8 million gain for hedging ineffectiveness. the company discontinued hedge accounting in 2015.
operating expenses totaled $1,999.7 million for 2015 compared to $1,762.4 million for 2014. the increase in operating expenses was the result of increases in dd&a, gathering, transmission, exploration, processing and sg&a expenses, partly offset by decreases in non-cash impairments of long-lived assets and production taxes. gathering expense increased by $96.0 million due to increased affiliate firm capacity and volumetric charges and by $2.3 million due to increased third-party volumetric charges. transmission expense increased by $35.5 million due to increased third-party costs incurred to move eqt production's natural gas out of the appalachian basin and by $22.9 million due to increased affiliate firm capacity charges. processing expense increased by $36.0 million due to increased production volumes. production taxes decreased primarily due to a $16.7 million decrease in severance taxes due to lower market sales prices, partly offset by higher production sales volumes in certain jurisdictions subject

to these taxes and a $4.8 million increase in property taxes. production taxes also decreased due to a $1.4 million decrease in the pennsylvania impact fee, primarily as a result of a decrease in the number of wells drilled in pennsylvania in 2015. exploration expense increased $40.3 million due to increased lease expirations of acreage that the company did not intend to drill prior to expiration totaling $22.8 million and expenses related to exploratory wells. the increase in sg&a expense was primarily due to higher personnel costs of $17.6 million, $11.2 million of drilling program reduction charges, including rig release penalties and $1.9 million of charges to write off expired right of ways options, partly offset by $3.8 million of higher litigation and environmental remediation costs in 2014 and a $1.9 million reduction to the reserve for uncollectible accounts. the increase in depletion expense within dd&a was the result of higher produced volumes partly offset by a lower overall depletion rate in 2015. depreciation expense within dd&a increased as a result of additional assets in service.
operating expenses included non-cash impairment charges of $122.5 million in 2015 and $267.3 million in 2014. the 2015 impairment charge consisted of (i) impairments of proved properties in the permian basin of texas of $94.3 million and in the utica shale of ohio of $4.3 million, (ii) unproved property impairments of $19.7 million and (iii) a $4.2 million impairment of field level ngls processing equipment that was not being used in operations. the 2014 impairment charge consisted of impairments of proved properties in the permian basin of texas of $105.2 million and in the utica shale of ohio of $75.5 million, as well as impairments of $86.6 million associated with undeveloped properties. the proved properties impairments in 2015 and 2014 were a result of declines in commodity prices and insufficient recovery of hydrocarbons to support continued development. the 2015 and 2014 impairments related to the unproved properties resulted from operational decisions to focus near-term development activities in the company's marcellus and utica acreage.

year ended december 31, 2016 vs. december 31, 2015
gathering revenues increased by $62.4 million primarily as a result of higher affiliate and third party volumes gathered in 2016 compared to 2015, driven by production development in the marcellus shale. eqt gathering increased firm reservation fee revenues in 2016 compared to 2015 as a result of affiliates and third parties contracting for additional capacity under firm contracts, which resulted in increased firm gathering capacity of approximately 300 mmcf per day following the completion of the nwv and jupiter expansion projects in the fourth quarter of 2015. the decrease in usage fees under interruptible contracts was primarily due to these additional contracts for firm capacity.
operating expenses increased by $16.6 million for the year ended december 31, 2016 compared to the year ended december 31, 2015. selling, general and administrative expenses increased as a result of higher allocations and personnel costs from eqt. the increase in depreciation and amortization expense resulted from additional assets placed in-service including those associated with the nwv gathering and jupiter expansion projects (defined in note 4 to the consolidated financial statements).
year ended december 31, 2015 vs. december 31, 2014
gathering revenues increased by $101.2 million primarily as a result of higher affiliate volumes gathered driven by production development in the marcellus shale. eqt gathering significantly increased firm reservation fee revenues in 2015 compared to 2014 as a result of increased capacity under firm contracts with affiliates. the decrease in usage fees was primarily due to affiliates contracting for additional firm capacity.
operating expenses increased by $5.3 million for the year ended december 31, 2015 compared to the year ended december 31, 2014. operating and maintenance expense increased as a result of higher allocations, including personnel costs, from eqt of $2.7 million and higher repairs and maintenance expenses associated with increased throughput.

year ended december 31, 2016 vs. december 31, 2015
transmission and storage revenues increased by $40.3 million. firm reservation revenues increased due to affiliates contracting for additional capacity under firm contracts, primarily on the ovc, as well as higher contractual rates on existing contracts in the current year. higher usage fees under firm contracts were driven by an increase in affiliate volumes in excess of firm capacity associated with increased production development in the marcellus shale, partly offset by lower usage fees from third party producers which is reflected in reduced firm capacity reservation throughput for the year ended december 31, 2016 compared to the year ended december 31, 2015. these volumes also decreased as a result of warmer weather in the first quarter of 2016. this decrease in transported volumes did not have a significant impact on firm reservation fee revenues. usage fees under interruptible contracts for the year ended december 31, 2016 increased as a result of higher third party volumes transported or stored on an interruptible basis.
operating expenses increased by $10.1 million for the year ended december 31, 2016 compared to the year ended december 31, 2015. the increase in operating and maintenance expense resulted primarily from higher repairs and maintenance expenses associated with increased throughput. selling, general and administrative expenses increased primarily as a result of higher allocations and personnel costs from eqt. the increase in depreciation and amortization expense was primarily a result of higher depreciation on the increased investment in transmission infrastructure, including those associated with the ovc and the avc facilities.

year ended december 31, 2015 vs. december 31, 2014
transmission and storage revenues increased by $42.6 million reflecting production development in the marcellus shale by affiliate and third party producers. the increase primarily resulted from higher firm reservation fees of $45.1 million partly offset by lower usage fees under interruptible contracts. the decrease in usage fees was primarily due to customers contracting for additional firm capacity.
operating expenses increased $19.9 million for the year ended december 31, 2015 compared to the year ended december 31, 2014. the increase in operating and maintenance expense resulted from higher repairs and maintenance expenses of $4.3 million associated with increased throughput, higher property taxes of $2.3 million and higher allocations, including personnel costs, from eqt.  selling, general and administrative expense increased primarily as a result of higher allocations and personnel costs from eqt.

interest expense increased $10.0 million in 2015 compared to 2014, primarily as a result of additional interest expense of approximately $11.7 million related to eqm's 4.00% senior notes due 2024 in the aggregate principal amount of $500.0 million issued during the third quarter of 2014, partially offset by lower interest expense resulting from the company's repayment of $150.0 million of 5.00% senior notes and $10.0 million of 7.55% series b notes, both of which matured in the fourth quarter of 2015.
the weighted average annual interest rates on the company's long-term debt, excluding eqm's long-term debt, was 6.5%, 6.5%, and 6.4% for 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.  the weighted average annual interest rate on eqm's long-term debt was 4.0% for each of 2016, 2015 and 2014.
the company did not have any borrowings outstanding at any time under its revolving credit facility during the years ended december 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014. the maximum amount of outstanding borrowings under eqm's $750 million credit facility
47
at any time during the years ended december 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 was $401 million, $404 million and $450 million, respectively. the average daily balance of borrowings outstanding under eqm's $750 million credit facility was approximately $77 million, $261 million and $119 million during the years ended december 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. interest was incurred on such borrowings at weighted average annual interest rates of approximately 2.0%, 1.7% and 1.7% for the years ended december 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.

all of eqgp's income is included in the company's pre-tax income (loss). however, the company is not required to record income tax expense with respect to the portions of eqgp's income allocated to the noncontrolling public limited partners of eqgp and eqm, which reduces the company's effective tax rate in periods when the company has consolidated pre-tax income and increases the company's effective tax rate in periods when the company has consolidated pre-tax loss.
for federal income tax purposes, the company may deduct a portion of its drilling costs as intangible drilling costs (idcs) in the year incurred. idcs, however, are sometimes limited for purposes of the alternative minimum tax (amt) and can result in the company paying amt even when generating large tax deductions or utilizing a net operating loss (nol) carryforward.
for 2016, the company is in a breakeven federal taxable income position and is paying a small amount of tax. for 2015 and 2014, the company paid a larger amount of tax as a result of the large tax gains generated from eqgp's ipo in 2015, the nwv gathering transaction in 2015 and the jupiter transaction in 2014 (defined in note 4 to the consolidated financial statements).
see note 10 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the company's income tax (benefit) expense.

the increase in net income attributable to noncontrolling interests for all periods was primarily the result of increased net income at eqm, increased ownership of eqm common units by third-parties and eqgp's ipo in 2015.
outlook the company is committed to profitably developing its natural gas and ngls reserves through environmentally responsible, cost-effective and technologically advanced horizontal drilling.  the company's revenues, earnings, liquidity and ability to grow are substantially dependent on the prices it receives for, and the company's ability to develop its reserves of natural gas and ngls. despite the continued low price environment for natural gas and ngls, the company believes the long-term outlook for its business is favorable due to the company's resource base, low cost structure, financial strength, risk management, including commodity hedging strategy, and disciplined investment of capital. the company believes the combination of these factors provide it with an opportunity to exploit and develop its positions and maximize efficiency through economies of scale in its strategic operating area.
the daily spot prices for nymex henry hub natural gas ranged from a high of $3.76 per mmbtu to a low of $1.49 per mmbtu from january 1, 2015 through december 31, 2016. in addition, the market price for natural gas in the appalachian basin was lower relative to nymex henry hub as a result of the significant increases in the supply of natural gas in the northeast region in recent years. due to the volatility of commodity prices, we are unable to predict future potential movements in the market prices for natural gas, including appalachian basis, and ngls and thus cannot predict the ultimate impact of prices on our operations.

the company's 2017 capital expenditure forecast for well development is $1.3 billion, which is 66% higher than its 2016 capital expenditures for well development. changes in natural gas, ngls and oil prices could affect, among other things, the company's development plans, which would increase or decrease the pace of the development and the level of the company's reserves, as well as the company's revenues, earnings or liquidity. significant changes in prices may result in an increase or decrease in capital spending. lower prices could result in additional non-cash impairments in the book value of the company's oil and gas properties or additional downward adjustments to the company's estimated proved reserves. any such additional impairment and/or downward adjustment to the company's estimated reserves could potentially be material to the company. see "impairment of oil and gas properties" below.
in july 2015, the company turned in-line its first dry gas focused utica well, which experienced prolific initial results. the company has subsequently turned in-line 4 additional utica wells located in greene county, pennsylvania and wetzel county, west virginia, with 2 additional wells spud but not yet complete as of december 31, 2016. given the results of its initial utica wells, the company will continue development of its utica acreage in 2017.
total capital investment by eqt in 2017, excluding acquisitions, is expected to be approximately $2.0 billion (including eqm). capital spending for well development (primarily drilling and completion) of approximately $1.3 billion in 2017 is expected to support the drilling of approximately 207 gross wells, including 119 marcellus wells, 81 upper devonian wells and 7 utica wells. estimated sales volumes are expected to be 810 - 830 bcfe, which includes volume growth of approximately 60 bcfe, the majority of which stems from the previous year's drilling program. the majority of the volume expected from the 2017 drilling program will be realized in 2018, at which time eqt forecasts production volume growth of 15 - 20% per year for several years. the anticipated production sales volume growth is approximately 8% in 2017, while total ngls volumes are expected to be 13,200 - 13,800 mbbls. to support continued growth in production, the company plans to invest approximately $0.5 billion on midstream infrastructure through eqm. the 2017 capital investment plan for eqt production is expected to be funded by cash generated from operations, cash on hand and sales of trading securities. eqm's available sources of liquidity include cash generated from operations, borrowings under its credit facilities, cash on hand, debt offerings and issuances of additional eqm partnership interests.
the company continues to focus on creating and maximizing shareholder value through the implementation of a strategy that economically accelerates the monetization of its asset base and prudently pursues investment opportunities, all while maintaining a strong balance sheet with solid cash flow.  the company monitors current and expected market conditions, including the commodity price environment, and its liquidity needs and may adjust its capital investment plan accordingly. while the tactics continue to evolve based on market conditions, the company periodically considers arrangements to monetize the value of certain mature assets for re-deployment into its highest value development opportunities. the company continues to pursue transactions that would add to its marcellus, upper devonian and utica positions and would consider purchasing assets or companies of various sizes within those positions.
impairment of oil and gas properties see "critical accounting policies and estimates" below and note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the company's accounting policies and significant assumptions related to impairment of the company's oil and gas properties. due to declines in the five-year nymex forward strip prices during 2015 and into 2016, the company determined that indicators of potential impairment existed for certain of the company's proved oil and gas properties as of december 31, 2016. in accordance with its normal procedures, the company estimated the future undiscounted cash flows from these oil and gas properties and compared these estimates to the carrying value of the properties. based on these evaluations, the company determined that no impairment existed during 2016. although the company did not record an impairment on its oil and gas producing properties during 2016, all other things being equal, a further decline in the average five-year nymex forward strip price in a future period may cause the company to recognize impairments on non-core assets, including the company's assets in the huron play, which had a carrying value of approximately $3 billion at december 31, 2016.
as described under "critical accounting policies and estimates" below, the company makes a number of assumptions related to its evaluation of its oil and gas properties for impairment, many of which require the company's management to make significant judgments. these assumptions, which are generally consistent with the assumptions utilized by the company's management for internal planning and budgeting purposes, include, among other things, anticipated production from reserves; future market prices for natural gas, ngls and oil adjusted accordingly for basis differentials; future operating and capital costs; and inflation. future market prices for natural gas, ngls and oil are often volatile, and assumptions regarding basis differentials, future production and future operating costs are highly judgmental and in some cases difficult to predict. due to the uncertainty inherent in, and the interdependence of these factors, the company cannot predict if future impairment charges, including impairment charges related to its huron oil and gas properties, will be recognized and, if so, an estimate of the impairment charges that would be recorded in any future period. see "recent natural gas, ngls and oil price declines have resulted in impairment of certain of our non-core assets. future declines in commodity prices, increases in operating costs or adverse changes in well

performance may result in additional write-downs of the carrying amounts of our assets, which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations in future periods." under item 1a, "risk factors."
capital resources and liquidity the company's primary sources of cash for the year ended december 31, 2016 were proceeds from the public offerings of eqt common stock and cash flows from operating activities, while the primary use of cash was for capital expenditures.
operating activities the company's net cash provided by operating activities decreased $152.6 million from full year 2015 to full year 2016 and by $197.8 million from full year 2014 to full year 2015. decreases in cash flows provided by operating activities in both periods were primarily the result of a lower commodity price and higher operating expenses, partly offset by higher production sales volumes, cash settlements on derivatives not designated as hedges, decreases in cash paid for income taxes and the timing of payments between periods.
the company's cash flows from operating activities will be impacted by future movements in the market price for commodities. the company is unable to predict these future price movements. see "natural gas, ngls and oil price volatility, or a prolonged period of low natural gas, ngls and oil prices may have an adverse effect upon our revenue, profitability, future rate of growth, liquidity and financial position" under item 1a, "risk factors" for further information.
investing activities cash flows used in investing activities totaled $2,961.5 million for 2016 as compared to $2,525.6 million for 2015. the $435.9 million increase was primarily due to an increase in capital expenditures for acquisitions of $1,051.2 million and investments in trading securities of $288.8 million, partly offset by a reduction in the drilling and completions capital expenditures. during 2016, the company invested in trading securities, which consist of liquid debt securities carried at fair value, to maximize returns. the company also placed $75.0 million of the proceeds received from the sale of a gathering system into restricted cash for a potential like-kind exchange for tax purposes.
cash flows used in investing activities totaled $2,525.6 million for 2015 as compared to $2,444.2 million for 2014. the $81.4 million increase was primarily attributable to a $156.7 million increase in capital expenditures and $74.5 million of net capital contributions made to the mvp joint venture through eqm during 2015, partly offset by $174.2 million of capital expenditures in 2014 in connection with the 2014 exchange of assets with range resources.

the company has forecast a 2017 capital expenditure spending plan of approximately $2.0 billion (excluding acquisitions), which includes $1.3 billion for well development (primarily drilling and completion), an eqm 2017 capital expenditure spending
50
plan of approximately $0.5 billion and $0.2 billion for other items. the company does not forecast property acquisitions within its capital spending plan.
capital expenditures for drilling and development totaled $783 million and $1,670 million during 2016 and 2015, respectively. the company spud 135 gross wells in 2016, including 117 horizontal marcellus wells, 13 horizontal upper devonian wells and 4 utica wells. the company spud 161 gross wells in 2015, including 133 horizontal marcellus wells, 24 horizontal upper devonian wells and 4 other wells, including 2 utica wells. the decrease in capital expenditures for well development in 2016 was driven primarily by the timing of drilling and completions activities between years, a decrease in wells spud, lower costs per well and operational efficiencies. capital expenditures for 2016 also included $1,284 million for property acquisitions, compared to $182 million of capital expenditures in 2015 for property acquisitions. the company executed multiple large transactions during 2016 that resulted in the company's acquisition of approximately 122,100 net marcellus acres located primarily in northern west virginia and southwestern pennsylvania discussed in note 8 to the consolidated financial statements.
capital expenditures for drilling and development totaled $1,670 million and $1,717 million during 2015 and 2014, respectively. the company spud 345 gross wells in 2014, including 196 horizontal marcellus wells, 41 horizontal upper devonian wells, 103 horizontal huron wells and 5 other wells. the $47 million decrease in capital expenditures for well development in 2015 was driven primarily by a decrease in wells spud partly offset by increased costs of utica drilling. capital expenditures for 2015 also included $182 million for property acquisitions, compared to $724 million of capital expenditures in 2014 for property acquisitions.
capital expenditures for the gathering and transmission operations totaled $587 million for 2016 and $430 million for 2015, primarily related to expansion capital expenditures. expansion capital expenditures are expenditures incurred for capital improvements that eqm expects to increase its operating income or operating capacity over the long term. this increase in expansion capital expenditures primarily related to ovc, which was placed into service in the fourth quarter of 2016.
capital expenditures for the gathering, transmission and storage operations totaled $430 million for 2015 and $391 million for 2014, primarily related to expansion capital expenditures.
financing activities cash flows provided by financing activities totaled $1,399.5 million for 2016 as compared to $1,832.5 million for 2015. during 2016, the company's primary sources of financing cash flows were net proceeds from its public offerings of common stock and from eqm's public offerings of common units under the $750 million atm program, as well as proceeds received from the issuance of eqm debt. the primary financing uses of cash during 2016 were net credit facility repayments under the eqm credit facility, distributions to noncontrolling interests, taxes related to the vesting or exercise of equity awards and dividends.
on january 18, 2017, the board of directors of the company declared a regular quarterly cash dividend of three cents per share, payable march 1, 2017, to the company's shareholders of record at the close of business on february 17, 2017.
on january 19, 2017, the board of directors of eqgp's general partner declared a cash distribution to eqgp's unitholders for the fourth quarter of 2016 of $0.177 per common unit, or approximately $47.1 million. the cash distribution will be paid on february 23, 2017 to unitholders of record, including the company, at the close of business on february 3, 2017.
on january 19, 2017, the board of directors of eqm's general partner declared a cash distribution to eqm's unitholders for the fourth quarter of 2016 of $0.85 per common unit. the cash distribution will be paid on february 14, 2017 to unitholders of record, including eqgp, at the close of business on february 3, 2017. based on the 80,581,758 eqm common units outstanding on february 9, 2017, the aggregate cash distributions by eqm to eqgp will be approximately $47.9 million consisting of: $18.5 million in respective to its limited partner interest, $1.8 million in respect of its general partner interest and $27.6 million in respect of its idrs in eqm.
cash flows provided by financing activities totaled $1,832.5 million for 2015 as compared to $1,261.3 million for 2014. during 2015, the company's primary sources of financing cash flows were net proceeds from eqm's public offerings of common units, including sales under the $750 million atm program, net proceeds from eqgp's ipo and net borrowings on eqm's revolving credit facility. the primary financing uses of cash during 2015 were payments on maturing long-term debt, distributions to noncontrolling interests and taxes related to the vesting or exercise of equity awards.
on april 30, 2014, the company's board of directors approved a share repurchase authorization of up to 1,000,000 shares of the company's outstanding common stock. the company may repurchase shares from time to time in open market or in privately negotiated transactions. the share repurchase authorization does not obligate the company to acquire any specific number of
51
shares, has no pre-established end date and may be discontinued by the company at any time. during the year ended december 31, 2014, the company repurchased and retired 300,000 shares of common stock for $32.4 million under the authorization. the company made no repurchases under the authorization during 2016 and 2015.
the company may from time to time seek to repurchase its outstanding debt securities. such repurchases, if any, will depend on prevailing market conditions, the company's liquidity requirements, contractual and legal restrictions and other factors.
revolving credit facilities eqt primarily utilizes borrowings under its revolving credit facilities to fund capital expenditures in excess of cash flow from operating activities until the expenditures can be permanently financed and to fund required margin deposits on derivative commodity instruments. margin deposit requirements vary based on natural gas commodity prices, the company's credit ratings and the amount and type of derivative commodity instruments.
the company has a $1.5 billion unsecured revolving credit facility that expires in february 2019. the company may request two one-year extensions of the expiration date, the approval of which is subject to satisfaction of certain conditions.
the revolving credit facility may be used for working capital, capital expenditures, share repurchases and any other lawful corporate purposes.  the credit facility is underwritten by a syndicate of 18 financial institutions, each of which is obligated to fund its pro-rata portion of any borrowings by the company.
under the terms of the revolving credit facility, the company may obtain base rate loans or fixed period eurodollar rate loans.  base rate loans are denominated in dollars and bear interest at a base rate plus a margin based on the company's then current credit ratings.  fixed period eurodollar rate loans bear interest at a eurodollar rate plus a margin based on the company's then current credit ratings.
the company had no borrowings or letters of credit outstanding under its revolving credit facility as of december 31, 2016 and 2015 or at any time during the years ended december 31, 2016 and 2015. for the years ended december 31, 2016 and 2015, the company incurred commitment fees averaging approximately 23 basis points to maintain credit availability under its revolving credit facility.
eqm has a $750 million credit facility that expires in february 2019. the credit facility is available to fund working capital requirements and capital expenditures, to purchase assets, to pay distributions and repurchase units and for general partnership purposes. the credit facility is underwritten by a syndicate of 18 financial institutions, each of which is obligated to fund its pro-rata portion of any borrowings by eqm.  the company is not a guarantor of eqm's obligations under the credit facility.
under the terms of its revolving credit facility, eqm may obtain base rate loans or fixed period eurodollar rate loans.  base rate loans are denominated in dollars and bear interest at a base rate plus a margin based on eqm's then current credit rating.  fixed period eurodollar rate loans bear interest at a eurodollar rate plus a margin based on eqm's then current credit ratings.
eqm had no borrowings and no letters of credit outstanding under its revolving credit facility as of december 31, 2016. eqm had $299 million of borrowings and no letters of credit outstanding under its revolving credit facility as of december 31, 2015. for the years ended december 31, 2016 and 2015, eqm incurred commitment fees averaging approximately 23 basis points to maintain credit availability under the revolving credit facility.
the maximum amount of outstanding borrowings at any time under eqm's credit facility during the year ended december 31, 2016 was $401 million, and the average daily balance of borrowings outstanding was approximately $77 million at a weighted average annual interest rate of 2.0%. the maximum amount of outstanding borrowings at any time under eqm's credit facility during the year ended december 31, 2015 was $404 million, and the average daily balance of borrowings outstanding was approximately $261 million at a weighted average annual interest rate of 1.7%.

the company's debt agreements and other financial obligations contain various provisions that, if not complied with, could result in termination of the agreements, require early payment of amounts outstanding or similar actions.  the most significant covenants and events of default under the debt agreements relate to maintenance of a debt-to-total capitalization ratio, limitations on transactions with affiliates, insolvency events, nonpayment of scheduled principal or interest payments, acceleration of other financial obligations and change of control provisions.  the company's credit facility contains financial covenants that require a total debt-to-total capitalization ratio no greater than 65%.  the calculation of this ratio excludes the effects of accumulated other comprehensive income (oci). as of december 31, 2016, the company was in compliance with all debt provisions and covenants.
eqm's debt agreements and other financial obligations contain various provisions that, if not complied with, could result in termination of the agreements, require early payment of amounts outstanding or similar actions. the covenants and events of default under the debt agreements relate to maintenance of a permitted leverage ratio, limitations on transactions with affiliates, limitations on restricted payments, insolvency events, nonpayment of scheduled principal or interest payments, acceleration of and certain other defaults under other financial obligations and change of control provisions. under eqm's $750 million credit facility, eqm is required to maintain a consolidated leverage ratio of not more than 5.00 to 1.00 (or not more than 5.50 to 1.00 for certain measurement periods following the consummation of certain acquisitions). as of december 31, 2016, eqm was in compliance with all debt provisions and covenants.

eqm atm program during 2015, eqm entered into an equity distribution agreement that established the $750 million atm program. eqm had approximately $443 million in remaining capacity under the program as of february 9, 2017.
commodity risk management the substantial majority of the company's commodity risk management program is related to hedging sales of the company's produced natural gas.  the company's overall objective in this hedging program is to protect cash flow from undue exposure to the risk of changing commodity prices. the derivative commodity instruments currently utilized by the company are primarily nymex swaps and collars.
as of january 31, 2017, the approximate volumes and prices of the company's derivative commodity instruments hedging sales of produced gas for 2017 through 2019 were:

(a)     the company also sold calendar year 2017 and 2018 calls for approximately 32 bcf and 16 bcf, respectively, at strike prices of $3.53 per mcf and $3.48 per mcf, respectively.
(b)     for 2017 and 2018, the company also sold puts for approximately 3 bcf each year at a strike price of $2.63 per mcf.
(c)   the average price is based on a conversion rate of 1.05 mmbtu/mcf.
the company also enters into fixed price natural gas sales agreements that are satisfied by physical delivery. the difference between these sales prices and nymex are included in average differential on the company's price reconciliation under "consolidated operational data". the company has fixed price physical sales for 2017 and 2018 of 44 bcf and 5 bcf, respectively, at average prices of $3.16 per mcf and $3.29 per mcf, respectively. for 2017 and 2018, the company has a natural gas sales agreement for approximately 35 bcf per year that includes a nymex ceiling price of $4.88 per mcf. for 2018 and 2019, the company has a natural gas sales agreement for approximately 7 bcf per year that includes a nymex floor price of $2.16 per mcf and a ceiling price of $4.47 per mcf. currently, the company has also entered into derivative instruments to hedge basis and a limited number of contracts to hedge its ngls exposure. the company may also use other contractual agreements in implementing its commodity hedging strategy.
see item 7a, "quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk," and note 6 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the company's hedging program.
other items off-balance sheet arrangements in connection with the sale of its noresco domestic operations in december 2005, the company agreed to maintain in place guarantees of certain warranty obligations of noresco.  the savings guarantees provided that once the energy-efficiency construction was completed by noresco, the customer would experience a certain dollar amount of energy savings over a period of years.  the undiscounted maximum aggregate payments that may be due related to these guarantees were approximately $115 million as of december 31, 2016, extending at a decreasing amount for approximately 12 years.
as of december 31, 2016, eqm had issued a $91 million performance guarantee (the initial guarantee) in connection with the obligations of mvp holdco, llc (mvp holdco) to fund its proportionate share of the construction budget for the mvp. upon the ferc's initial release to begin construction of the mvp, the initial guarantee will terminate, and eqm will be obligated to issue a new guarantee in an amount equal to 33% of mvp holdco's remaining obligations to make capital contributions to the mvp joint venture in connection with the then remaining construction budget, less, subject to certain limits, any credit assurances issued by an affiliate of eqm under such affiliate's precedent agreement with the mvp joint venture.
54
the noresco guarantees and the initial guarantee are exempt from asc topic 460, guarantees.  the company has determined that the likelihood it will be required to perform on these arrangements is remote and any potential payments are expected to be immaterial to the company's financial position, results of operations and liquidity.  as such, the company has not recorded any liabilities in its consolidated balance sheets related to these guarantees.
rate regulation as described under "regulation" in item 1, "business," the company's transmission and storage operations and a portion of its gathering operations are subject to various forms of rate regulation.  as described in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, regulatory accounting allows the company to defer expenses and income as regulatory assets and liabilities which reflect future collections or payments through the regulatory process.  the company believes that it will continue to be subject to rate regulation that will provide for the recovery of the deferred costs.
schedule of contractual obligations the table below presents the company's long-term contractual obligations as of december 31, 2016 in total and by periods. purchase obligations exclude the company's contractual obligations relating to its binding precedent agreements and other natural gas transmission and gathering capacity agreements with eqm, for which future payments related to such agreements totaled $6.0 billion as of december 31, 2016. these capacity commitments have terms extending up to 20 years. for a description of the transportation agreements, see note 20 to the consolidated financial statements. purchase obligations also exclude future capital contributions to the mvp joint venture and purchase obligations of the mvp joint venture.

(a)   interest payments exclude interest due related to the credit facility borrowings as the interest rate on eqm's credit facility agreement is variable.
purchase obligations are primarily commitments for demand charges under existing long-term contracts and binding precedent agreements with various unconsolidated pipelines, including commitments from the company to the mvp joint venture, some of which extend up to approximately 20 years. the company has entered into agreements to release some of its capacity to various third parties. purchase obligations also include commitments with third parties for processing capacity in order to extract heavier liquid hydrocarbons from the natural gas stream. operating leases are primarily entered into for various office locations and warehouse buildings, as well as dedicated drilling rigs in support of the company's drilling program. the obligations for the company's various office locations and warehouse buildings totaled approximately $44.1 million as of december 31, 2016. the company has agreements with several drillers to provide drilling equipment and services to the company over the next four years. these obligations totaled approximately $60.9 million as of december 31, 2016.
the other liabilities line represents commitments for total estimated payouts for the 2016 eqt value driver award program and 2016 restricted stock unit liability awards. see "critical accounting policies and estimates" below and note 18 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion regarding factors that affect the ultimate amount of the payout of these obligations.
as discussed in note 10 to the consolidated financial statements, the company had a total reserve for unrecognized tax benefits at december 31, 2016 of $252.4 million, of which $75.4 million is offset against deferred tax assets since it would primarily reduce the alternative minimum tax credit carryforwards. the company is currently unable to make reasonably reliable estimates of the period of cash settlement of these potential liabilities with taxing authorities; therefore, this amount has been excluded from the schedule of contractual obligations.
55
commitments and contingencies in the ordinary course of business, various legal and regulatory claims and proceedings are pending or threatened against the company.  while the amounts claimed may be substantial, the company is unable to predict with certainty the ultimate outcome of such claims and proceedings.  the company accrues legal and other direct costs related to loss contingencies when actually incurred.  the company has established reserves it believes to be appropriate for pending matters and, after consultation with counsel and giving appropriate consideration to available insurance, the company believes that the ultimate outcome of any matter currently pending against the company will not materially affect the company's financial position, results of operations or liquidity.
see note 20 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the company's commitments and contingencies. see also the discussion of the revolving loan agreement between eqt and eqm in note 4 to the consolidated financial statements.
56
recently issued accounting standards the company's recently issued accounting standards are described in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k.
critical accounting policies and estimates the company's significant accounting policies are described in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements.  the discussion and analysis of the consolidated financial statements and results of operations are based upon the company's consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with united states gaap.  the preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities.  the following critical accounting policies, which were reviewed by the company's audit committee, relate to the company's more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements.  actual results could differ from those estimates.
accounting for oil and gas producing activities:  the company uses the successful efforts method of accounting for its oil and gas producing activities.
the carrying values of the company's proved oil and gas properties are reviewed for impairment generally on a field-by-field basis when events or circumstances indicate that the remaining carrying value may not be recoverable. the estimated future cash flows used to test those properties for recoverability are based on proved and, if determined reasonable by management, risk-adjusted probable reserves, utilizing assumptions generally consistent with the assumptions utilized by the company's management for internal planning and budgeting purposes, including, among other things, the intended use of the asset, anticipated production from reserves, future market prices for natural gas, ngls and oil, adjusted accordingly for basis differentials, future operating costs and inflation, some of which are interdependent.  proved oil and gas properties that have carrying amounts in excess of estimated future cash flows are written down to fair value, which is estimated by discounting the estimated future cash flows using discount rates and other assumptions that marketplace participants would use in their estimates of fair value.
capitalized costs of unproved properties are evaluated at least annually for recoverability on a prospective basis.  indicators of potential impairment include changes in development plans resulting from economic factors, potential shifts in business strategy employed by management and historical experience.  if it is determined that the properties will not yield proved reserves prior to their expirations, the related costs are expensed in the period in which that determination is made.
the company believes that the accounting estimate related to the accounting for oil and gas producing activities is a "critical accounting estimate" as the evaluations of impairment of proved properties involve significant judgment about future events such as future sales prices of natural gas and ngls, future production costs, estimates of the amount of natural gas and ngls recorded and the timing of those recoveries. see "impairment of oil and gas properties" above and note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the company's impairments of proved and unproved oil and gas properties.
oil and gas reserves:  proved oil and gas reserves, as defined by sec regulation s-x rule 4-10, are those quantities of oil and gas which, by analysis of geoscience and engineering data, can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible from a given date forward, from known reservoirs and under existing economic conditions, operating methods and government regulations prior to the time at which contracts providing the right to operate expire, unless evidence indicates that renewal is reasonably certain, regardless of whether deterministic or probabilistic methods are used for the estimation.
the company's estimates of proved reserves are made and reassessed annually using geological and reservoir data as well as production performance data. reserve estimates are prepared and updated by the company's engineers and audited by the company's independent engineers.  revisions may result from changes in, among other things, reservoir performance, development plans, prices, operating costs, economic conditions and governmental restrictions.  decreases in prices, for example, may cause a reduction in some proved reserves due to reaching economic limits sooner.  a material change in the estimated volumes of reserves could have an impact on the depletion rate calculation and the company's financial statements, including strength of the balance sheet.
the company estimates future net cash flows from natural gas, ngls and oil reserves based on selling prices and costs using a 12-month average price, calculated as the unweighted arithmetic average of the first-day-of-the-month price for each month within the 12-month period, which is subject to change in subsequent periods.  operating costs, production and ad valorem taxes and future development costs are based on current costs with no escalation.  income tax expense is computed using statutory future tax rates and giving effect to tax deductions and credits available under current laws and which relate to oil and gas producing activities.
57
the company believes that the accounting estimate related to oil and gas reserves is a "critical accounting estimate" because the company must periodically reevaluate proved reserves along with estimates of future production rates, production costs and the estimated timing of development expenditures.  future results of operations and strength of the balance sheet for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by changes in the company's assumptions. see "impairment of oil and gas properties" above for additional information regarding the company's oil and gas reserves.
income taxes:  the company recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the company's consolidated financial statements or tax returns.
the company has recorded deferred tax assets principally resulting from federal and state nol carryforwards, an alternative minimum tax credit carryforward, incentive compensation, unrealized hedge losses and investment in eqgp. the company has established a valuation allowance against a portion of the deferred tax assets related to the federal and state nol carryforwards, as it is believed that it is more likely than not that these deferred tax assets will not all be realized.  no other significant valuation allowances have been established, as it is believed that future sources of taxable income, reversing temporary differences and other tax planning strategies will be sufficient to realize these deferred tax assets.  any determination to change the valuation allowance would impact the company's income tax expense and net income in the period in which such a determination is made.
the company also estimates the amount of financial statement benefit to record for uncertain tax positions as described in note 10 to the company's consolidated financial statements.
the company believes that accounting estimates related to income taxes are "critical accounting estimates" because the company must assess the likelihood that deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and exercise judgment regarding the amount of financial statement benefit to record for uncertain tax positions.  when evaluating whether or not a valuation allowance must be established on deferred tax assets, the company exercises judgment in determining whether it is more likely than not (a likelihood of more than 50%) that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.  the company considers all available evidence, both positive and negative, to determine whether, based on the weight of the evidence, a valuation allowance is needed, including carrybacks, tax planning strategies, reversal of deferred tax assets and liabilities and forecasted future taxable income.  in making the determination related to uncertain tax positions, the company considers the amounts and probabilities of the outcomes that could be realized upon ultimate settlement of an uncertain tax position using the facts, circumstances and information available at the reporting date to establish the appropriate amount of financial statement benefit.  to the extent that an uncertain tax position or valuation allowance is established or increased or decreased during a period, the company must include an expense or benefit within tax expense in the income statement.  future results of operations for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by changes in the company's assumptions.
derivative instruments: the company enters into derivative commodity instrument contracts primarily to mitigate exposure to commodity price risk associated with future sales of natural gas production. the company also enters into derivative instruments to hedge basis and to hedge exposure to fluctuations in interest rates.
the company estimates the fair value of all derivative instruments using quoted market prices, where available. if quoted market prices are not available, fair value is based upon models that use market-based parameters as inputs, including forward curves, discount rates, volatilities and nonperformance risk. nonperformance risk considers the effect of the company's credit standing on the fair value of liabilities and the effect of the counterparty's credit standing on the fair value of assets. the company estimates nonperformance risk by analyzing publicly available market information, including a comparison of the yield on debt instruments with credit ratings similar to the company's or counterparty's credit rating and the yield of a risk-free instrument, and credit default swap rates where available. the values reported in the financial statements change as these estimates are revised to reflect actual results, or market conditions or other factors change, many of which are beyond the company's control.
the company believes that the accounting estimates related to derivative instruments are "critical accounting estimates" because the company's financial condition and results of operations can be significantly impacted by changes in the market value of the company's derivative instruments due to the volatility of natural gas prices, both nymex and basis. future results of operations for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by changes in the company's assumptions.
contingencies and asset retirement obligations:  the company is involved in various regulatory and legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business.  the company records a liability for contingencies based upon its assessment that a loss is probable and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated.  the company considers many factors in making these assessments, including history and specifics of each matter.  estimates are developed in consultation with legal counsel and are based upon an analysis of potential results.
58
the company also accrues a liability for asset retirement obligations based on an estimate of the timing and amount of their settlement.  for oil and gas wells, the fair value of the company's plugging and abandonment obligations is required to be recorded at the time the obligations are incurred, which is typically at the time the wells are spud. the company is required to operate and maintain its natural gas pipeline and storage systems, and intends to do so as long as supply and demand for natural gas exists, which the company expects for the foreseeable future. therefore, the company believes that the substantial majority of its natural gas pipeline and storage system assets have indeterminate lives.
the company believes that the accounting estimates related to contingencies and asset retirement obligations are "critical accounting estimates" because the company must assess the probability of loss related to contingencies and the expected amount and timing of asset retirement obligations.  in addition, the company must determine the estimated present value of future liabilities.  future results of operations for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by changes in the company's assumptions.
share-based compensation: the company awards share-based compensation in connection with specific programs established under the 2009 and 2014 long-term incentive plans.  awards to employees are typically made in the form of performance-based awards, time-based restricted stock, time-based restricted units and stock options. awards to directors are typically made in the form of phantom units that vest upon grant.
restricted units and performance-based awards expected to be satisfied in cash are treated as liability awards.  for liability awards, the company is required to estimate, on grant date and on each reporting date thereafter until vesting and payment, the fair value of the ultimate payout based upon the expected performance through, and value of the company's common stock on, the vesting date.  the company then recognizes a proportionate amount of the expense for each period in the company's financial statements over the vesting period of the award.  the company reviews its assumptions regarding performance and common stock value on a quarterly basis and adjusts its accrual when changes in these assumptions result in a material change in the fair value of the ultimate payouts.
performance-based awards expected to be satisfied in company common stock are treated as equity awards. for equity awards, the company is required to determine the grant date fair value of the awards, which is then recognized as expense in the company's financial statements over the vesting period of the award.  determination of the grant date fair value of the awards requires judgments and estimates regarding, among other things, the appropriate methodologies to follow in valuing the awards and the related inputs required by those valuation methodologies.  most often, the company is required to obtain a valuation based upon assumptions regarding risk-free rates of return, dividend yields, expected volatilities and the expected term of the award.  the risk-free rate is based on the u.s. treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant.  the dividend yield is based on the historical dividend yield of the company's common stock adjusted for any expected changes and, where applicable, of the common stock of the peer group members at the time of grant.  expected volatilities are based on historical volatility of the company's common stock and, where applicable, the common stock of the peer group members at the time of grant.  the expected term represents the period of time elapsing during the applicable performance period.
for time-based restricted stock awards, the grant date fair value of the awards is recognized as expense in the company's financial statements over the vesting period, historically three years.  for director phantom units (which vest on date of grant) expected to be satisfied in equity, the grant date fair value of the awards is recognized as an expense in the company's financial statements in the year of grant. the grant date fair value, in both cases, is determined based upon the closing price of the company's common stock on the date of the grant.
for non-qualified stock options, the grant date fair value is recognized as expense in the company's financial statements over the vesting period, typically two or three years.  the company utilizes the black-scholes option pricing model to measure the fair value of stock options, which includes assumptions for a risk-free interest rate, dividend yield, volatility factor and expected term.  the risk-free rate for periods within the contractual life of the option is based on the u.s. treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant.  the dividend yield is based on the dividend yield of the company's common stock at the time of grant.  the expected volatility is based on historical volatility of the company's common stock at the time of grant.  the expected term represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding based on historical option exercise experience at the time of grant.
the company believes that the accounting estimates related to share-based compensation are "critical accounting estimates" because they may change from period to period based on changes in assumptions about factors affecting the ultimate payout of awards, including the number of awards to ultimately vest and the market price and volatility of the company's common stock.  future results of operations for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by changes in the company's assumptions.  see note 18 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the company's share-based compensation.

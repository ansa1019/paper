management's discussion and analysis overview we are one of the nation's oldest and largest financial institutions, with $149.5 billion of total assets as of december 31, 2016. headquartered in providence, rhode island, we deliver a broad range of retail and commercial banking products and services to individuals, institutions and companies. our approximately 17,600 colleagues strive to meet the financial needs of customers and prospects through approximately 1,200 branches and approximately 3,200 atms operated in 11 states in the new england, mid-atlantic and midwest regions and through our online, telephone and mobile banking platforms. we conduct our banking operations through two wholly-owned banking subsidiaries, citizens bank, n.a. and citizens bank of pennsylvania and we operate our businesses through two operating segments: consumer banking and commercial banking.
consumer banking average loans and leases totaled $55.1 billion in 2016 compared with $51.5 billion in 2015 and represented approximately 55% of average total operating segment loan and lease balances (including loans held for sale) compared with 55% of average total operating segment loan and lease balances (including loans held for sale) in 2015. consumer banking serves retail customers and small businesses with annual revenues of up to $25 million with products and services that include deposit products, mortgage and home equity lending, student loans, auto financing, credit cards, business loans and wealth management and investment services.
commercial banking average loans and leases totaled $45.9 billion in 2016 compared with $41.6 billion in 2015, and represented approximately 45% of average total operating segment loan and lease balances (including loans held for sale) compared with 45% of average total operating segment loan and lease balances (including loans held for sale) in 2015. commercial banking offers corporate, institutional and not-for-profit clients a full range of wholesale banking products and services including lending and deposits, capital markets, treasury services, foreign exchange and interest hedging, leasing and asset finance, specialty finance and trade finance.
non-core assets are primarily loans that are not aligned to our strategic priorities, generally as a result of geographic location, industry, product type, or risk level and are included in other. non-core assets of $2.8 billion as of december 31, 2016 increased $422 million, or 18%, from december 31, 2015. these results were driven by a $909 million increase in total commercial non-core loans related to the transfer of a $1.2 billion lease and loan portfolio tied to legacy rbs aircraft leasing borrowers that we placed in runoff following a review of asset finance in third quarter 2016. the increase in commercial non-core loans was partially offset by a $616 million decrease in total retail non-core loans.
the largest component of our retail non-core portfolio is the home equity products serviced by others portfolio (a portion of which we now service internally). non-core assets are included in other along with the treasury function, securities portfolio, wholesale funding activities, goodwill, community development assets and other unallocated assets, liabilities, capital, revenues, provision for credit losses and expenses not attributed to the consumer banking or commercial banking segments.
for 2016, we recorded income before income tax expense and net income of $1.5 billion and $1.0 billion, respectively. 2016 results included a $31 million pre-tax, or $19 million after-tax, benefit from notable items, presented below.

key factors affecting our business macroeconomic conditions our business is affected by national and regional economic conditions, as well as the perception of future conditions and economic prospects. the significant macroeconomic factors that impact our business include the rate of economic expansion, the health of the housing market, unemployment levels, and interest rates.

management's discussion and analysis the u.s. economy continued to expand at a moderate pace, with annual real gdp rising by 1.6% in 2016, compared with an increase of 2.6% in 2015. the housing sector remained steady as compared to previous quarters with three month average existing home sales of 5.6 million units.
the labor market continued to improve, with moderate job gains and lower levels of unemployment. the u.s. unemployment rate declined to 4.7% at december 31, 2016 from 5.0% at december 31, 2015. average monthly nonfarm employment increased by 180,000 in 2016, compared to a revised increase of 229,000 in 2015.
the frb maintained very accommodative monetary policy conditions during 2016, notwithstanding the 0.25% rate increase in december, and continues to target a 0.50% to 0.75% federal funds rate range at the short end of the yield curve. interest rates have risen but still remain relatively low on an historical basis. see "-interest rates" below for further discussion of the impact of interest rates on our results. observable inflation levels have risen closer to the frb's longer-term objective of 2.0%. further labor market improvement and the dissipation of the effects of a decline in energy and import prices are expected to bring inflation closer to the frb's inflation objective.
interest rates net interest income is our largest source of revenue and is the difference between the interest earned on interest-earning assets (usually loans and investment securities) and the interest expense incurred in connection with interest-bearing liabilities (usually deposits and borrowings). the level of net interest income is primarily a function of the average balance of interest-earning assets, the average balance of interest-bearing liabilities and the spread between the effective yield on such assets and the effective cost of such liabilities. these factors are influenced by the pricing and mix of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities which, in turn, are impacted by external factors such as local economic conditions, competition for loans and deposits, monetary policy of the frb and market interest rates. for further discussion, refer to "-risk governance" and "-market risk - non-trading risk," included in this report.
the cost of our deposits and short-term wholesale borrowings is largely based on short-term interest rates, which are primarily driven by the frb's actions. however, the yields generated by our loans and securities are typically driven by both short-term and long-term interest rates, which are set by the market or, at times, by the frb's actions. the level of net interest income is therefore influenced by movements in such interest rates and the pace at which such movements occur. in the fourth quarter of 2016, short-term and long-term interest rates increased, including benchmark rates such as the federal funds rate and one-and three-month libor, due to the frb's decision to raise rates in december and to changes in growth and inflation expectations. longer-term yields rose more than short-term yields (a steeper yield curve), which would have a beneficial impact on our margin and net interest income given our asset sensitive position.
in 2016 and 2015, the frb maintained a highly accommodative monetary policy, and indicated that this policy would remain in effect for a considerable time after its asset purchase program ended on october 29, 2014 and the economic recovery strengthens in the united states. more recently, the frb has started to move down the path of interest rate normalization by raising the federal funds rate by 25 basis points in december 2016. however, the frb will likely continue to target an accommodative monetary policy for some time to come with interest rates expected to gradually increase to more normal levels.
regulatory trends we are subject to extensive regulation and supervision, which continue to evolve as the legal and regulatory framework governing our operations continues to change. the current operating environment reflects heightened regulatory expectations around many regulations including consumer compliance, the bank secrecy act, anti-money laundering compliance, and increased internal audit activities.
dodd-frank regulation as described under "regulation and supervision" in part i, item 1 - business included in this report, we are subject to a variety of laws and regulations, including the dodd-frank act. the dodd-frank act is complex, and many aspects of the dodd-frank act are subject to final rulemaking or phased implementation that will take effect over several years. the dodd-frank act may continue to impact our earnings through fee reductions, higher costs and imposition of new restrictions on us. the dodd-frank act may also continue to have a material adverse impact on the value of certain assets and liabilities held on our balance sheet. the ultimate impact of the dodd-frank act on our business will depend on regulatory interpretation and rulemaking as well as the success of any of our actions to mitigate the negative impacts of certain provisions. one part of the dodd-frank act that specifically impacts our business is the frbg's capital planning and stress-testing framework known as ccar and dfast, which continues to evolve. under this supervisory framework, we are required to submit annual capital plans to the frb and are subject to annual supervisory and semiannual internal stress tests requirements.
consistent with these requirements, we must submit our annual capital plan and the results of our annual company-run stress tests to the frb by april 5th of each year and disclose certain results within 15 days of the date the frb discloses the results

management's discussion and analysis of its supervisory-run tests. we submitted our 2016 capital plan and related annual stress test results to the frb on april 5, 2016. we published our estimated results under the supervisory severely adverse scenario on the investor relations regulatory filings and disclosures page of our corporate website on june 23, 2016. the annual dfast process projects net income, loan losses and capital ratios during a nine-quarter horizon under hypothetical, stressful macroeconomic and financial market scenarios developed by the frbg as well as certain mandated assumptions about capital distributions prescribed in the dfast rule. consistent with the purpose of these exercises and the assumptions used to assess our performance during hypothetical economic conditions, the projected results under the required stress scenarios show severe negative impacts on earnings and decline in capital ratios. however, these pro forma results should not be interpreted as management expectations but rather as a possible result under hypothetical, severely adverse economic conditions that do not take into account capital conservation actions that would be mandated by internal policy if such conditions were actually to occur.
similarly, we are required to submit the results of our mid-cycle company-run dfast stress tests by october 5th of each year and disclose the results under an internally developed severely adverse scenario between october 5th and november 4th. we submitted the results of our 2016 mid-cycle stress test to the frb on october 3, 2016 and disclosed a summary of the results on october 5, 2016. we publish estimated impacts of stress, as required by applicable regulation processes, which may be accessed on our regulatory filings and disclosures page on http://investor.citizensbank.com.
the dodd-frank act also requires each of our bank subsidiaries to conduct stress tests on an annual basis and to disclose the stress test results. cbna submitted its 2016 annual stress tests to the occ on april 5, 2016 and published a summary of the results along with the stress test result of the bank holding company parent on june 23, 2016. cbpa submitted its 2016 annual stress tests to the fdic on april 5, 2016 and published its summary results as an update to the parent company/cbna dodd-frank act company-run stress test disclosure on our investor relations site on october 17, 2016, prior to the october 31, 2016 deadline that the fdic sets for banks with $10 to $50 billion in total assets.
comprehensive capital analysis and review ccar is an annual exercise by the frbg to ensure that the largest bank holding companies have sufficient capital to continue operations throughout times of economic and financial stress and robust forward-looking capital planning processes that account for their unique risks.
as part of ccar, the frbg evaluates institutions' capital adequacy for non-complex institutions, internal capital adequacy assessment processes and their plans to make capital distributions, such as dividend payments or stock repurchases. the frbg may either object to our capital plan, in whole or in part, or provide a notice of non-objection. if the frbg objects to our capital plan, we may not make any capital distribution other than those with respect to which the frbg has indicated its non-objection.
credit trends overall credit quality continued to improve reflecting growth in lower risk retail loans and modest increases in commercial categories. nonperforming loans and leases of $1.0 billion as of december 31, 2016 decreased $15 million from december 31, 2015, reflecting improvements in retail real estate secured categories offset by an increase in commercial nonperforming assets, largely driven by commodities-related businesses. net charge-offs of $335 million increased $51 million, or 18%, from $284 million in 2015, as a $59 million increase in commercial, largely tied to commodities-related businesses and a reduction in commercial real estate recoveries more than offset an $8 million decrease in retail. net charge-offs of 0.32% of average total loans and leases remained relatively stable with 0.30% in 2015.
heloc payment shock attention has been given by regulators, rating agencies, and the general press regarding the potential for increased exposure to credit losses associated with helocs that were originated during the period of rapid home price appreciation between 2003 and 2007. industry wide, many of the helocs originated during this timeframe were structured with an extended interest-only payment period followed by a requirement to convert to a higher payment amount that would begin fully amortizing both principal and interest beginning at a certain date in the future. to help manage this exposure, in september 2013, we launched a comprehensive program designed to provide heightened customer outreach to inform, educate and assist customers through the reset process as well as to offer alternative financing and forbearance options. results of this program indicate that our efforts to assist customers at risk of default have successfully reduced delinquency and charge-off rates compared to our original expectations. as of december 31, 2016, approximately 18% of our $14.3 billion heloc portfolio, or $2.6 billion in drawn balances were subject to a payment reset or balloon payment between january 1, 2017 and december 31, 2018.
as of december 31, 2016, for the $1.7 billion of our heloc portfolio that reached the end of the interest-only draw period and entered repayment of principal and interest in 2014 and 2015, 94% of the balances have been refinanced, paid off or were current on payments, 3% are past due and 3% have been charged off. as of december 31, 2016, for the $738 million of our heloc portfolio that reached the end of the interest-only draw period and entered repayment of principal and interest in 2016, 95% of the balances have been refinanced, paid off or were current on payments, 4% are past due and 1% have been charged off.

citizens financial group, inc.
management's discussion and analysis a total of $1.1 billion of heloc balances are scheduled to reach the end of the interest-only draw period and enter repayment of principal and interest in 2017. for the $5.3 billion heloc portfolio scheduled to reach the end of the interest-only draw period and enter repayment of principal and interest between december 31, 2016 and december 31, 2021, 44% was secured by a first lien, with a the weighted average fico score of the borrowers of 764 and a loan-to-value ratio of 61.3%. those results compare to the total heloc portfolio of $14.3 billion that was 50% secured by a first lien, with a weighted average fico score of the borrowers of 767 and a loan-to-value ratio of 61.3%. factors that affect our future expectations for continued relatively low charge-off risk in the face of rising interest rates for the portion of our heloc portfolio subject to reset in future periods include a relatively high level of first lien collateral positions, improved loan-to-value ratios resulting from continued home price appreciation, relatively stable portfolio credit score profiles and continued robust loss mitigation efforts.
principal components of operations and key performance metrics used by management as a banking institution, we manage and evaluate various aspects of our results of operations and our financial condition. we evaluate the levels and trends of the line items included in our balance sheet and statement of operations, as well as various financial ratios that are commonly used in our industry. we analyze these ratios and financial trends against our own historical performance, our budgeted performance and the financial condition and performance of comparable banking institutions in our region and nationally.
the primary line items we use in our key performance metrics to manage and evaluate our statement of operations include net interest income, noninterest income, total revenue, provision for credit losses, noninterest expense, net income and net income available to common stockholders. the primary line items we use in our key performance metrics to manage and evaluate our balance sheet data include loans and leases, securities, allowance for credit losses, deposits, borrowed funds and derivatives.
net interest income net interest income is the difference between the interest earned on interest-earning assets (usually loans and investment securities) and the interest expense incurred in connection with interest-bearing liabilities (usually deposits and borrowings). the level of net interest income is primarily a function of the average balance of interest-earning assets, the average balance of interest-bearing liabilities and the spread between the effective yield on such assets and the effective cost of such liabilities. net interest income is impacted by the relative mix of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, movements in market interest rates, levels of nonperforming assets and pricing pressure from competitors. the mix of interest-earning assets is influenced by loan demand and by management's continual assessment of the rate of return and relative risk associated with various classes of interest-earning assets.
the mix of interest-bearing liabilities is influenced by management's assessment of the need for lower cost funding sources weighed against relationships with customers and growth requirements and is impacted by competition for deposits in our market and the availability and pricing of other sources of funds.
noninterest income the primary components of our noninterest income are service charges and fees, card fees, trust and investment services fees and mortgage banking fees.
total revenue total revenue is the sum of our net interest income and our noninterest income.
provision for credit losses the provision for credit losses is the amount of expense that, based on our judgment, is required to maintain the allowance for credit losses at an amount that reflects probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio at the balance sheet date and that, in management's judgment, is appropriate under relevant accounting guidance. the provision for credit losses includes the provision for loan and lease losses as well as the provision for unfunded commitments. the determination of the amount of the allowance for credit losses is complex and involves a high degree of judgment and subjectivity. for additional information regarding the provision for credit losses, see "-critical accounting estimates - allowance for credit losses," note 1 "significant accounting policies" and note 5 "allowance for credit losses, nonperforming assets, and concentrations of credit risk" to our audited consolidated financial statements in part ii, item 8 - financial statements and supplementary data, included in this report.
noninterest expense noninterest expense includes salaries and employee benefits, outside services, occupancy expense, equipment expense, amortization of software and other operating expenses.
net income and net income available to common stockholders we evaluate our net income and net income available to common stockholders based on measures including return on average common equity, return on average total assets and return on average tangible common equity.

management's discussion and analysis loans and leases we classify our loans and leases pursuant to the following classes: commercial, commercial real estate, leases, residential mortgages, home equity loans, home equity lines of credit, home equity loans serviced by others, home equity lines of credit serviced by others, automobile, student, credit cards and other retail. our sbo portfolio consists of purchased home equity loans and lines that were originally serviced by others, which we now service a portion of internally.
loans are reported at the amount of their outstanding principal, net of charge-offs, unearned income, deferred loan origination fees and costs and unamortized premiums or discounts (on purchased loans). deferred loan origination fees and costs and purchase discounts and premiums are amortized as an adjustment of yield over the life of the loan, using the effective interest method. unamortized amounts remaining upon prepayment or sale are recorded as interest income or gain (loss) on sale, respectively. credit card receivables include billed and uncollected interest and fees.
leases are classified at the inception of the lease by type. lease receivables, including leveraged leases, are reported at the aggregate of lease payments receivable and estimated residual values, net of unearned and deferred income, including unamortized investment credits. lease residual values are reviewed at least annually for other-than-temporary impairment, with valuation adjustments for direct financing and leveraged leases recognized currently against other income. leveraged leases are reported net of non-recourse debt. unearned income is recognized to yield a level rate of return on the net investment in the leases.
loans held for sale, at fair value mortgage loans and commercial loans held for sale are carried at fair value.
other loans held for sale balances represent loans that were transferred to other loans held for sale are reported at the lower of cost or fair value.
securities our securities portfolio is managed to seek return while maintaining prudent levels of quality, market risk and liquidity. investments in debt and equity securities are carried in four portfolios: afs, htm, trading securities and other investment securities. we determine the appropriate classification at the time of purchase. securities in our afs portfolio will be held for indefinite periods of time and may be sold in response to changes in interest rates, changes in prepayment risk or other factors relevant to our asset and liability strategy. securities in our afs portfolio are carried at fair value, with unrealized gains and losses reported in oci, as a separate component of stockholders' equity, net of taxes. securities are classified as htm because we have the ability and intent to hold the securities to maturity, and securities in our htm portfolio are carried at amortized cost. other investment securities are composed mainly of fhlb stock and frb stock (which are carried at cost), and money market mutual fund investments held by our broker-dealer (which are carried at fair value, with changes in fair value recognized in other income).
allowance for credit losses our estimate of probable losses in the loan and lease portfolios is recorded in the alll and the reserve for unfunded lending commitments. together these are referred to as the allowance for credit losses. we evaluate the allowance for credit losses using the following ratios: alll as a percentage of total loans and leases; alll as a percentage of nonperforming loans and leases; and nonperforming loans and leases as a percentage of total loans and leases. for additional information, see "-critical accounting estimates - allowance for credit losses," and note 1 "significant accounting policies" and note 5 "allowance for credit losses, nonperforming assets and concentrations of credit risk" to our audited consolidated financial statements in part ii, item 8 - financial statements and supplementary data, included in this report.
deposits our deposits include: on demand checking, checking with interest, regular savings accounts, money market accounts and term deposits.
borrowed funds as of december 31, 2016, our total short-term borrowed funds included federal funds purchased, securities sold under agreement to repurchase, the current portion of fhlb advances, long-term debt that matures within one year, and other short-term borrowed funds. as of december 31, 2016, our long-term borrowed funds included subordinated debt, unsecured notes, federal home loan advances and other long-term borrowed funds. for additional information, see "-analysis of financial condition - borrowed funds," and note 12 "borrowed funds" to our audited consolidated financial statements in part ii, item 8 - financial statements and supplementary data, included in this report.

management's discussion and analysis derivatives we use pay-fixed swaps to lengthen liabilities synthetically and offset duration in fixed-rate assets. we also use pay-fixed swaps to hedge floating-rate wholesale funding.
we use receive-fixed interest rate swaps to manage the interest rate exposure on our medium term borrowings. we also use receive-fixed swaps to minimize the exposure to variability in the interest cash flows on our floating rate assets. the carrying amount of assets and liabilities recorded for derivatives designated as hedges reflect the market value of these hedge instruments.
we sell interest rate swaps and foreign exchange forwards to commercial customers. offsetting swap and forward agreements are generally transacted to minimize our market risk associated with the customer derivative contracts. the carrying amount of assets and liabilities recorded for derivatives not designated as hedges reflect the market value of these transactions. for additional information, see "-analysis of financial condition - derivatives," and note 16 "derivatives" to our audited consolidated financial statements in part ii, item 8 - financial statements and supplementary data, included in this report.
key performance metrics and non-gaap financial measures we consider various measures when evaluating our performance and making day-to-day operating decisions, as well as evaluating capital utilization and adequacy, including:
•   return on average common equity, which we define as net income available to common stockholders divided by average common equity;
•   return on average tangible common equity, which we define as net income available to common stockholders divided by average common equity excluding average goodwill (net of related deferred tax liability) and average other intangibles;
•   return on average total assets, which we define as net income divided by average total assets;
•   return on average total tangible assets, which we define as net income divided by average total assets excluding average goodwill (net of related deferred tax liability) and average other intangibles;
•   efficiency ratio, which we define as the ratio of our total noninterest expense to the sum of net interest income and total noninterest income. we measure our efficiency ratio to evaluate the efficiency of our operations as it helps us monitor how costs are changing compared to our income. a decrease in our efficiency ratio represents improvement;
•   net interest margin, which we calculate by dividing net interest income for the period by average total interest-earning assets, is a key measure that we use to evaluate our net interest income; and
•   common equity tier 1 capital ratio (basel iii fully phased-in basis), represents cet1 divided by total risk-weighted assets as defined under basel iii standardized approach.
we present and provide reconciliations of our non-gaap measures. these reconciliations are adjusted for restructuring charges, special items and/or notable items, which are included, where applicable, in the financial results presented in accordance with gaap. restructuring charges and special items include revenues and expenses related to our efforts to improve processes and enhance efficiencies, as well as rebranding, separation from rbs and regulatory expenses. notable items include certain revenue or expense items that may occur in a reporting period which management does not consider indicative of on-going financial performance.
we believe these non-gaap measures provide useful information to investors because these are among the measures used by our management team to evaluate our operating performance and make day-to-day operating decisions. in addition, we believe restructuring charges, special items and/or notable items in any period do not reflect the operational performance of the business in that period and, accordingly, it is useful to consider these line items with and without restructuring charges, special items and/or notable items. we believe this presentation also increases comparability of period-to-period results.
other companies may use similarly titled non-gaap financial measures that are calculated differently from the way we calculate such measures. accordingly, our non-gaap financial measures may not be comparable to similar measures used by other companies. we caution investors not to place undue reliance on such non-gaap measures, but instead to consider them with the most directly comparable gaap measure. non-gaap financial measures have limitations as analytical tools, and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for our results reported under gaap.
non-gaap measures are denoted throughout "-results of operations" by the use of the term "adjusted" and are followed by an asterisk (*).

highlights for the year ended december 31, 2016:
•   net income of $1.0 billion increased $205 million, or 24%, from $840 million in 2015;
•   net income included the benefit of $19 million in after-tax notable items compared to a reduction of $31 million after-tax restructuring charges and special items in 2015. excluding notable items, adjusted net income* increased $155 million, or 18%, to $1.0 billion from $871 million in 2015;
•   net income available to common stockholders of $1.0 billion increased $198 million, or 24%, from $833 million in 2015. net income available to common stockholders was impacted by preferred stock dividends of $14 million, compared to $7 million in 2015. excluding notable items, adjusted net income available to common stockholders* increased $148 million, or 17%, to $1.0 billion from $864 million in 2015;
•   net interest income of $3.8 billion increased $356 million, or 10%, from $3.4 billion in 2015 driven by 8% average loan growth, the benefit of balance sheet optimization strategies and higher rates;
•   net interest margin of 2.86% increased 11 basis points from 2.75% in 2015. results reflect improved loan yields given continued pricing and portfolio optimization initiatives, as well as higher short-term interest rates. these benefits were partially offset by a reduction in investment portfolio yields, including a reduction in frb stock dividends, as well as higher deposit and borrowing costs;
•   noninterest income of $1.5 billion increased $75 million, or 5%, from 2015, largely reflecting the $72 million benefit of the tdr transaction gain. excluding this impact, adjusted noninterest income increased $8 million as strength in capital market fees, service charges and fees and mortgage banking fees was partially offset by lower card fees, securities gains, trust and investment service fees and other income;
•   noninterest expense of $3.4 billion increased $93 million, or 3%, compared to $3.3 billion in 2015 that included $50 million in restructuring, special items and notable items, $14 million more than 2016. excluding the impact of restructuring, special items and notable items, adjusted noninterest expense* increased $107 million driven by higher salaries and employee benefits including the impact of continued investment in strategic growth initiatives partially offset by the benefit of our efficiency initiatives, as well as increased software amortization expense, outside services expense and equipment expense, partially offset by lower other operating expense.
•   provision for credit losses of $369 million increased $67 million, or 22%, from $302 million in 2015, largely reflecting the impact of higher commercial loan charge-offs and the impact of loan growth;
•   return on average common equity of 5.23% compared to 4.30% in 2015;
•   return on average tangible common equity of 7.74% compared with 6.45% in 2015, and adjusted return on average tangible common equity* of 7.60%, compared to 6.69% in 2015;
•   average loans and leases of $103.4 billion increased $7.2 billion, or 8%, from $96.2 billion in 2015 reflecting a $4.4 billion increase in commercial loans and a $2.8 billion increase in retail loans;
•   average deposits of $105.4 billion increased $6.3 billion, or 6%, driven by growth in every category including a $5.3 billion increase in interest-bearing and a $1.0 billion increase in demand deposits;
•   net charge-offs of $335 million increased $51 million, or 18%, from $284 million in 2015 largely as an increase in commercial charge-offs tied to commodity-related credits and the impact of lower commercial real estate recoveries was partially offset by a reduction in retail. the alll of $1.2 billion increased $20 million compared to 2015. alll to total loans and leases ratio of 1.15% as of december 31, 2016, compared with 1.23% as of december 31, 2015. alll to nonperforming loans and leases ratio of 118% as of december 31, 2016 compared with 115% as of december 31, 2015; and

management's discussion and analysis net interest income of $3.8 billion in 2016 increased $356 million, or 10%, compared to $3.4 billion in 2015, reflecting 8% average loan growth and the benefit of balance sheet optimization strategies and higher rates.
average interest-earning assets of $130.5 billion increased $7.6 billion, or 6%, from 2015, driven by a $4.4 billion increase in average commercial loans, a $2.8 billion increase in average retail loans, and a $185 million increase in average interest-bearing cash and due from banks and deposits in banks. commercial loan growth was driven by strength in commercial and commercial real estate. retail loan growth was driven by strength in student, residential mortgage, automobile and other retail loan balances.
average deposits of $105.4 billion increased $6.3 billion from 2015 with particular strength in checking with interest, money market accounts, demand deposits and regular savings. total interest-bearing deposit costs of $270 million increased $33 million, or 14%, from $237 million in 2015 and reflected a two basis point increase in interest-bearing deposit costs to 0.35%. checking with interest costs increased to 0.18% in 2016 compared with 0.11% in 2015, term deposit costs decreased to 0.78% in 2016 from 0.82% in 2015, money market account cost increased to 0.36% from 0.32% in 2015, and regular savings account costs increased to 0.04% from 0.03% in 2015.
total borrowed funds of $14.6 billion increased $918 million from 2015. total borrowed funds costs of $238 million increased $23 million from 2015. within the federal funds purchased and securities sold under agreements to repurchase and other short-term borrowed funds, pay-fixed swap expense declined to $20 million for 2016 compared to $58 million in 2015. including the impact of hedging costs, total borrowed funds rates increased to 1.62% from 1.56% in 2015. the increase in long-term borrowing expense of $64 million was driven by an increase in senior debt and fhlb borrowings as we continued to realign our liability and capital structure to better align with peers.
net interest margin of 2.86% increased 11 basis points compared to 2.75% in 2015 driven by the benefit of pricing and portfolio optimization initiatives on loan portfolio mix and yield partially offset by a modest increase in deposit and funding costs and a reduction in investment portfolio yields. results also reflected the benefit of lower pay-fixed swap expense.

noninterest income of $1.5 billion in 2016, increased $75 million, or 5%, compared to 2015, largely driven by a $67 million pre-tax benefit from notable items in other income. excluding the impact of these items, adjusted noninterest income* increased $8 million, or 1%, as strength in capital markets fees, service charges and fees and mortgage fees were partially offset by the impact of a reclassification of card reward costs, lower securities gains and trust and investment services fees. capital market fees increased $37 million reflecting underlying business momentum and the benefit of enhanced product capabilities. service charges increased $24 million, driven by both improved pricing and volume. mortgage banking fees increased $11 million from 2015 levels that included higher msr valuation gains driven by increased secondary origination volume and wider margins. card fees decreased $29 million from 2015 results, which were $28 million higher given the reclassification of card reward costs.
provision for credit losses provision for credit losses of $369 million increased $67 million, or 22%, from $302 million in 2015, largely reflecting the impact of higher commercial net charge-offs, primarily in commodities-related portfolios and commercial real estate driven by the impact of a reduction in recoveries as well as the impact of loan growth. 2016 results reflected a $34 million reserve build compared to an $18 million reserve build in 2015, as the impact of loan growth was partially offset by loan mix shifts into higher quality retail products.
the provision for loan and lease losses is the result of a detailed analysis performed to estimate an appropriate and adequate alll. the total provision for credit losses includes the provision for loan and lease losses as well as the provision for unfunded commitments. refer to "-analysis of financial condition - allowance for credit losses and nonperforming assets" for more information.

noninterest expense of $3.4 billion in 2016 increased $93 million, or 3%, compared to 2015 as the impact of higher salaries and employee benefits, amortization of software, equipment expense and outside services expense was partially offset by lower occupancy and other operating expense. results in 2016 reflected the impact of $36 million of notable items compared with $50 million of restructuring charges and special items in 2015. excluding the impact of restructuring charges, special items and

management's discussion and analysis notable items, adjusted noninterest expense* increased $107 million, driven by higher salaries and employee benefits as the impact of continued investment in strategic growth initiatives and revenue based incentives were partially offset by the benefit of our efficiency initiatives. results also reflect increased software amortization expense, outside services expense and equipment expense, partially offset by lower other operating expense.
income tax expense income tax expense was $489 million and $423 million in 2016 and 2015, respectively. this resulted in an effective tax rate of 31.9% and 33.5% in 2016 and 2015, respectively. the decrease in the effective income tax rate from 2015 to 2016 was primarily attributable to the impact of federal and state tax credits.
at december 31, 2016, we reported a net deferred tax liability of $714 million, compared to a $730 million liability at december 31, 2015. the decrease in the net deferred tax liability was primarily attributable to the tax effect of net unrealized losses on securities and derivatives arising during the period largely offset by the tax effect of current year timing adjustments. for further discussion, see note 15 "income taxes" to our consolidated financial statements in part ii, item 8 - financial statements and supplementary data, included in this report.

(1) includes the financial impact of non-core, liquidating loan portfolios and other non-core assets, our treasury activities, wholesale funding activities, securities portfolio, community development assets and other unallocated assets, liabilities, capital, revenues, provision for credit losses and expenses not attributed to our consumer banking or commercial banking segments. for a description of non-core assets, see "-analysis of financial condition - loans and leases-non-core assets."
(2) ratios include loans and leases held for sale.
(3)  operating segments are allocated capital on a risk-adjusted basis considering economic and regulatory capital requirements. we approximate that regulatory capital is equivalent to a sustainable target level for cet1 capital and then allocate that approximation to the segments based on economic capital.
we operate our business through two operating segments: consumer banking and commercial banking. segment results are derived from our business-line profitability reporting systems by specifically attributing managed assets, liabilities, capital and their related revenues, provision for credit losses and expenses. residual assets, liabilities, capital and their related revenues, provision for credit losses and expenses are attributed to other.
other results include our treasury function, securities portfolio, wholesale funding activities, goodwill and goodwill impairment, community development assets and other unallocated assets, liabilities, capital, revenues, provision for credit losses

management's discussion and analysis and expenses not attributed to consumer banking or commercial banking. other also includes our non-core assets. non-core assets are primarily loans and leases inconsistent with our strategic priorities, generally as a result of geographic location, industry, product type or risk level. non-core assets totaled $2.8 billion as of december 31, 2016, an increase of $422 million, or 18%, compared to december 31, 2015. this increase was a result of the transfer of a $1.2 billion lease and loan portfolio tied to legacy rbs aircraft leasing borrowers that we placed in runoff following a review of asset finance in third quarter 2016. this portfolio of largely investment-grade client aircraft leases do not meet go-forward business model strategic and risk-adjusted return parameters, and we plan to exit these non-strategic relationships. given recent deterioration in aircraft values, along with the impact of exiting these client relationships, we believe the underlying residual value has been impaired. see "-overview" for further discussion of the residual value impairment. the largest component of our retail non-core portfolio is our home equity products currently or formerly serviced by others portfolio.
our capital levels are evaluated and managed centrally, however, capital is allocated to the operating segments to support evaluation of business performance. operating segments are allocated capital on a risk-adjusted basis considering economic and regulatory capital requirements. we approximate that regulatory capital is equivalent to a sustainable target level for common equity tier 1 and then allocate that approximation to the segments based on economic capital. interest income and expense is determined based on the assets and liabilities managed by the business segment. because funding and asset liability management is a central function, funds transfer-pricing methodologies are utilized to allocate a cost of funds used, or credit for the funds provided, to all business segment assets, liabilities and capital, respectively, using a matched-funding concept. the residual effect on net interest income of asset/liability management, including the residual net interest income related to the funds transfer pricing process, is included in other.
provision for credit losses is allocated to each business segment based on actual net charge-offs that have been recognized by the business segment. the difference between the consolidated provision for credit losses and the business segments' net charge-offs is reflected in other.
noninterest income and expense directly managed by each business segment, including fees, service charges, salaries and benefits, and other direct revenues and costs are accounted for within each segment's financial results in a manner similar to our consolidated financial statements. occupancy costs are allocated based on utilization of facilities by the business segment. noninterest expenses incurred by centrally managed operations or business segments that directly support another business segment's operations are charged to the applicable business segment based on its utilization of those services.
income taxes are assessed to each business segment at a standard tax rate with the residual tax expense or benefit to arrive at the consolidated effective tax rate included in other.
developing and applying methodologies used to allocate items among the business segments is a dynamic process. accordingly, financial results may be revised periodically as management systems are enhanced, methods of evaluating performance or product lines change, or our organizational structure changes.

consumer banking net income of $345 million in 2016 increased $83 million, or 32%, from 2015, reflecting an increase in total revenue, partially offset by an increase in noninterest expense.
consumer banking total revenue of $3.3 billion in 2016 increased $218 million from 2015, as net interest income increased driven by loan and deposit growth.
net interest income of $2.4 billion increased 11% from 2015, driven by the benefit of $3.6 billion average loan growth, reflecting growth in student, residential mortgage, auto and other retail loans as well as improved loan yields.
noninterest income decreased $27 million, or 3%, largely as growth in service charges and fees and mortgage banking fees were more than offset by the impact of a reclassification of card reward costs and lower trust and investment services fees.
noninterest expense of $2.5 billion in 2016 increased $91 million, or 4%, from $2.5 billion in 2015, driven by higher salaries and benefits, outside services expense, amortization of software and other operating expense, partially offset by the impact of a reclassification of card reward costs.
provision for credit losses of $243 million in 2016 decreased $9 million, or 4%, from $252 million in 2015, largely reflecting the benefit of lower real estate secured net charge-offs.

(2)  operating segments are allocated capital on a risk-adjusted basis considering economic and regulatory capital requirements. we approximate that regulatory capital is equivalent to a sustainable target level for cet1 capital and then allocate that approximation to the segments based on economic capital.
commercial banking net income of $631 million increased $52 million, or 9%, from 2015, as an increase in total revenue was partially offset by an increase in noninterest expense and provision for credit losses.
net interest income of $1.3 billion in 2016 increased $126 million, or 11%, from 2015, reflecting the benefit of an increase of $4.3 billion in average loan balances and $3.3 billion in average deposits.
noninterest income of $466 million in 2016 increased $51 million, or 12%, from 2015, reflecting strength in capital markets fees, service charges and fees and interest rate products.
noninterest expense of $741 million in 2016 increased $32 million, or 5%, from $709 million in 2015, driven by an increase in salary and employee benefits largely tied to revenue based incentive costs as well as higher fdic insurance costs.
provision for credit losses of $47 million in 2016, increased $60 million, from a net recovery of prior period charge-offs of $13 million in 2015, driven by higher losses in the commercial loan portfolio largely tied to commodities-related credits.

other recorded net income of $69 million in 2016 compared to net loss of $1 million in 2015, driven by the net impact of notable items, restructuring charges and special items and lower noninterest expense, offset by an increase in provision for credit losses and a decrease in net interest income. on a quarterly basis, we review and refine our estimate of the allowance for credit losses, taking into consideration changes in portfolio size and composition, historical loss experience, internal risk ratings, current economic conditions, industry-performance trends and other pertinent information.
as mentioned previously, other includes the non-core portfolio. non-core assets of $2.8 billion as of december 31, 2016 increased $422 million, or 18%, from december 31, 2015. these results were driven by a $909 million increase in total commercial non-core loans related to the transfer of a $1.2 billion lease and loan portfolio tied to legacy rbs aircraft leasing borrowers that we placed in runoff following a review of asset finance in third quarter 2016. the increase in commercial non-core loans was partially offset by a $616 million decrease in total retail non-core loans.

net income net income totaled $840 million in 2015, down $25 million, or 3%, from $865 million in 2014, driven by a $106 million after-tax decrease in restructuring charges and special items. 2015 results included $31 million of after-tax restructuring charges. 2014 results included the benefit of a $180 million after-tax gain related to the chicago divestiture and $105 million of after-tax restructuring charges related to our separation from rbs and enhanced efficiencies across the organization. excluding restructuring charges and special items, adjusted net income* increased $81 million, or 10%, from 2014, driven by a pre-tax $133 million increase in revenue and a pre-tax $14 million decrease in noninterest expense.

(1) interest income and rates on loans include loan fees. additionally, $1.1 billion and $1.2 billion of average nonaccrual loans were included in the average loan balances used to determine the average yield on loans for december 2015 and 2014, respectively.
(2) balances are net of certain short-term receivables associated with reverse repurchase agreements. interest expense includes the full cost of the repurchase agreements and certain hedging costs. the rate on federal funds purchased is elevated due to the impact from pay-fixed interest rate swaps that ran off in 2016. see "-analysis of financial condition - derivatives" for further information.
(3) the rate on other short-term borrowed funds is elevated due to the impact from pay-fixed interest rate swaps. see "-analysis of financial condition - derivatives" for further information.

management's discussion and analysis net interest income of $3.4 billion in 2015 increased $101 million, or 3%, compared to $3.3 billion in 2014, as the benefit of earning asset growth and a reduction in pay-fixed swap costs was partially offset by continued pressure from the relatively persistent low-rate environment on loan yields and mix, higher borrowing costs related to debt issuances, and higher deposit costs.
average interest-earning assets increased $6.8 billion, or 6%, from 2014 due to a $3.9 billion increase in average commercial loans and leases, and a $3.2 billion increase in average retail loans as growth in auto, mortgage, and student loan balances, were partially offset by lower home equity outstandings, and a reduction in the non-core loan portfolio.
2015 net interest margin of 2.75% declined eight basis points compared to 2.83% in 2014 as the benefit of lower pay-fixed swap costs was more than offset by increased deposit costs, higher senior and subordinated debt borrowing costs and a modest decrease in loan yields. 2015 average interest-earning asset yields of 3.12% declined two basis points from 3.14% in 2014, reflecting the decline in the commercial loan and lease portfolio yields given the continued impact of the relatively persistent low-rate environment. investment portfolio income of $621 million in 2015 remained relatively stable compared to $619 million in 2014.
total interest-bearing deposit costs of $237 million in 2015 increased $81 million, or 52%, from $156 million in 2014 and reflected a nine basis point increase in the rate paid on deposits to 0.33% from 0.24%. the increase in deposit costs reflected a shift in mix to longer duration deposits, largely term and money market products. the cost of term deposits increased to 0.82% in 2015 from 0.65% in 2014, and money market accounts and savings accounts increased to 0.27% in 2015 from 0.19% in 2014.
total borrowed funds costs of $215 million in 2015 increased modestly from 2014. within the federal funds purchased and securities sold under agreements to repurchase and other short-term borrowed funds, pay-fixed swap expense declined to $58 million for 2015 compared to $99 million in 2014. including the impact of hedging costs, total borrowed funds rates increased to 1.56% from 1.51% in 2014. the increase in long-term borrowing expense of $50 million was driven by an increase in senior and subordinated debt as we continued to realign our liability and capital structure to better align with peers.

provision for credit losses provision for credit losses of $302 million in 2015 declined $17 million from $319 million in 2014, reflecting continued improvement in credit quality. net charge-offs for 2015 totaled $284 million, or 0.30% of average loans, compared to $323 million, or 0.36%, in 2014. the provision for credit losses includes the provision for loan and lease losses as well as the provision for unfunded commitments.
the provision for loan and lease losses is the result of a detailed analysis performed to estimate an appropriate and adequate alll. the total provision for credit losses included the provision for loan and lease losses as well as the provision for unfunded commitments. refer to "-analysis of financial condition - allowance for credit losses and nonperforming assets" for more information.

management's discussion and analysis income tax expense income tax expense of $423 million increased from $403 million in 2014, respectively and reflected an effective tax rate of 33.5%, which increased from 31.8% in 2014. the increase in the effective income tax rate related to the tax-rate impact of combined reporting legislation, non-deductible permanent expense items, and the adoption of asu no. 2014-01, "accounting for investments in qualified affordable housing projects." the application of this guidance resulted in the reclassification of the amortization of these investments to income tax expense from noninterest income. furthermore, these increases were partially offset by the tax rate impact of the gain on the chicago divestiture in the second quarter of 2014.
at december 31, 2015, we reported a net deferred tax liability of $730 million, compared to a $493 million liability at december 31, 2014. the increase in the net deferred tax liability was primarily attributable to the increase in the deferred tax liability related to temporary differences of $261 million. for further discussion, see note 15 "income taxes" to our consolidated financial statements in part ii, item 8 - financial statements and supplementary data, included in this report.
business segments we operate our business through two operating segments: consumer banking and commercial banking. segment results are derived from our business-line profitability reporting systems by specifically attributing managed assets, liabilities, capital and their related revenues, provision for credit losses and expenses. residual assets, liabilities, capital and their related revenues, provision for credit losses and expenses are attributed to other.
other includes our treasury function, securities portfolio, wholesale funding activities, goodwill and goodwill impairment, community development assets and other unallocated assets, liabilities, capital, revenues, provision for credit losses and expenses not attributed to consumer banking or commercial banking. other also includes our non-core assets. non-core assets are primarily loans inconsistent with our strategic goals, generally as a result of geographic location, industry, product type or risk level. the non-core portfolio totaled $2.3 billion as of december 31, 2015, down 25% from december 31, 2014. the largest component of our non-core portfolio is our home equity products currently or formerly serviced by others portfolio.

management's discussion and analysis our capital levels are evaluated and managed centrally, however, capital is allocated to the operating segments to support evaluation of business performance. operating segments are allocated capital on a risk-adjusted basis considering economic and regulatory capital requirements. we approximate that regulatory capital is equivalent to a sustainable target level for common equity tier 1 and then allocate that approximation to the segments based on economic capital. interest income and expense is determined based on the assets and liabilities managed by the business segment. because funding and asset liability management is a central function, funds transfer-pricing methodologies are utilized to allocate a cost of funds used, or credit for the funds provided, to all business segment assets, liabilities and capital, respectively, using a matched-funding concept. the residual effect on net interest income of asset/liability management, including the residual net interest income related to the funds transfer pricing process, is included in other.
provision for credit losses is allocated to each business segment based on actual net charge-offs that have been recognized by the business segment. the difference between the consolidated provision for credit losses and the business segments' net charge-offs is reflected in other.
noninterest income and expense directly managed by each business segment, including fees, service charges, salaries and benefits, and other direct revenues and costs are accounted for within each segment's financial results in a manner similar to our consolidated financial statements. occupancy costs are allocated based on utilization of facilities by the business segment. noninterest expenses incurred by centrally managed operations or business segments that directly support another business segment's operations are charged to the applicable business segment based on its utilization of those services.
income taxes are assessed to each business segment at a standard tax rate with the residual tax expense or benefit to arrive at the consolidated effective tax rate included in other.
developing and applying methodologies used to allocate items among the business segments is a dynamic process. accordingly, financial results may be revised periodically as management systems are enhanced, methods of evaluating performance or product lines change, or our organizational structure changes.

management's discussion and analysis consumer banking net income of $262 million in 2015 increased $80 million, or 44%, from 2014, reflecting higher revenue and lower expense.
consumer banking total revenue of $3.1 billion in 2015 increased $58 million from 2014 despite the impact of the chicago divestiture, driven by loan and deposit growth as well as growth in overall fee revenue tied to mortgage banking and service charges, net.
net interest income of $2.2 billion increased 2% from 2014, driven by the benefit of loan growth, with particular strength in auto, residential mortgage and student loans of $910 million partially offset by the effect of the relatively persistent low-rate environment as well as the impact of the chicago divestiture. noninterest income increased 1% driven by strength in mortgage banking and higher service charges, partially offset by the chicago divestiture.
noninterest expense of $2.5 billion in 2015 decreased $57 million, or 2%, from $2.5 billion in 2014, reflecting a combination of the chicago divestiture and cost saving actions, offset by the continued investment in the business to drive future growth.
provision for credit losses of $252 million in 2015 decreased $7 million, or 3%, from $259 million in 2014, reflecting continued improvement in credit quality, partially offset by the continued growth in loan balances.

commercial banking net income of $579 million increased $18 million, or 3%, from 2014, as an increase in net interest income driven by strong balance sheet growth, deposit cost improvement and reduced impairment costs more than offset lower noninterest income and an increase in noninterest expense.
net interest income of $1.2 billion in 2015 increased $89 million, or 8%, from 2014, reflecting the benefit of an increase of $3.9 billion in average loan balances and $3.6 billion in average deposits, partially offset by spread compression.
noninterest income of $415 million in 2015 decreased $14 million, or 3%, from 2014 as the benefit of an increase in service charges and fees, interest rate products, and card fees was more than offset by lower leasing income, foreign exchange and letter of credit fees, and capital markets fee income.

other recorded a net loss of $1 million in 2015 compared to net income of $122 million in 2014. the net loss in 2015 included $31 million of after-tax restructuring charges and special items. net income in 2014 included a $180 million after-tax gain related to the chicago divestiture partially offset by $105 million of after-tax restructuring charges and special items. excluding these items, adjusted net income* decreased by $17 million.
net interest income in 2015 decreased $35 million to $42 million compared to $77 million in 2014. the decrease was driven primarily by an increase in wholesale funding costs, and lower non-core loans, partially offset by a reduction in interest rate swap costs.
noninterest income in 2015 decreased $253 million driven by the $288 million pre-tax gain on the chicago divestiture. excluding the gain, adjusted noninterest income* increased $35 million driven by an accounting change for low-income housing investments, which is offset in income tax expense.
noninterest expense in 2015 of $94 million decreased $133 million from 2014, reflecting lower restructuring charges and special items of $119 million and lower employee incentive costs.
the provision for credit losses in 2015 decreased $3 million to $63 million compared to $66 million in 2014, reflecting stable credit quality and a decrease in non-core net charge-offs of $23 million to $44 million in 2015 compared to $67 million in 2014. on a quarterly basis, we review and refine our estimate of the allowance for credit losses, taking into consideration changes in portfolio size and composition, historical loss experience, internal risk ratings, current economic conditions, industry-performance trends and other pertinent information. the provision also reflected an increase in overall credit exposure associated with growth in our loan portfolio.
total assets as of december 31, 2015 included $2.1 billion and $4.7 billion of goodwill related to the consumer banking and commercial banking reporting units, respectively. for further information regarding the reconciliation of segment results to gaap results, see note 23 "business segments" to our audited consolidated financial statements in part ii, item 8 - financial statements and supplementary data, included in this report.

as of december 31, 2016, the fair value of the afs and htm securities portfolio increased $1.4 billion to $24.6 billion, compared with $23.2 billion as of december 31, 2015, driven by net purchases of $1.7 billion in securities that were bought for liquidity management purposes and offset by a decrease in market value of $300 million due to an increase in interest rates.
as of december 31, 2016, the portfolio's average effective duration was 4.3 years compared with 3.5 years as of december 31, 2015. higher long-term rates reduced prepayment speed forecasts on mortgages, extending the duration on mortgage backed securities. the increase in securities duration was most pronounced in the fourth quarter of 2016 as interest rates increased significantly in this period. we manage the securities portfolio duration through asset selection and securities structure which combine to limit the duration extension.
the securities portfolio includes high quality, highly liquid investments reflecting our ongoing commitment to maintaining appropriate contingent liquidity and pledging capacity. u.s. government-guaranteed notes and government-sponsored entity-issued mortgage-backed securities represent the vast majority of the securities portfolio holdings. the portfolio composition is also dominated by holdings backed by mortgages to facilitate our ability to pledge them to the fhlbs. this has become increasingly important due to the enhanced liquidity requirements of the liquidity coverage ratio. for further discussion of the liquidity coverage ratios, see "regulation and supervision - liquidity standards" in part i, item 1 - business, included in this report.

total loans and leases of $107.7 billion as of december 31, 2016, increased $8.6 billion, or 9%, from $99.0 billion as of december 31, 2015, reflecting growth in both commercial and retail products. total commercial loans and leases of $51.7 billion grew $5.4 billion, or 12%, from $46.2 billion as of december 31, 2015, reflecting commercial loan growth of $4.0 billion and commercial real estate loan growth of $1.7 billion. total retail loans of $56.0 billion increased by $3.2 billion, or 6%, from $52.8 billion as of december 31, 2015, largely driven by a $2.3 billion increase in student loans and a $1.8 billion increase in residential mortgages, partially offset by lower home equity balances.
loan purchases and sales in 2016, including loans held for sale, net of runoff of previously purchased loans, reduced loan growth by $202 million. see note 4 "loans and leases" to our audited consolidated financial statements in part ii, item 8 - financial statements and supplementary data, included in this report, for further information.

non-core assets are primarily loans and leases inconsistent with our strategic priorities, generally as a result of geographic location, industry, product type or risk level and are included in other. non-core assets of $2.8 billion as of december 31, 2016 increased $422 million, or 18%, from december 31, 2015. these results were driven by a $909 million increase in total commercial non-core loans related to the transfer of a $1.2 billion lease and loan portfolio tied to legacy rbs aircraft leasing borrowers that we placed in runoff following a review of asset finance in third quarter 2016. the increase in total commercial non-core loans was partially offset by a $616 million decrease in total retail non-core loans.
retail non-core loan balances of $1.5 billion decreased $616 million, or 29%, compared to december 31, 2015. the largest component of our retail non-core portfolio is the home equity sbo portfolio, which totaled $969 million as of december 31, 2016, compared to $1.4 billion as of december 31, 2015. the sbo portfolio is a liquidating portfolio consisting of pools of home equity loans and lines of credit purchased between 2003 and 2007. although our sbo portfolio consists of loans that were initially serviced by others, we now service a portion of this portfolio internally. sbo balances serviced externally totaled $505 million and $763 million as of december 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. the sbo portfolio has been closed to new purchases since the third quarter of 2007. the sbo portfolio represented 3% of the retail real estate secured portfolio and 2% of the overall retail loan portfolio as of december 31, 2016.
the credit profile of the sbo portfolio was weaker than the core real estate portfolio, with a weighted-average refreshed fico score of 711 and cltv of 87% as of december 31, 2016. the proportion of the portfolio in a second lien position was 96% with 71% of the portfolio in out-of-footprint geographies including 27% in california, nevada, arizona and florida.
sbo net charge-offs of $25 million in 2016 increased $4 million from 2015 and totaled 2.17% of the sbo portfolio in 2016 compared to 1.29% in 2015, driven by balance liquidation.
allowance for credit losses and nonperforming assets we and our banking subsidiaries, cbna and cbpa, maintain an allowance for credit losses, consisting of an alll and a reserve for unfunded lending commitments. this allowance is created through charges to income, specifically through the provision for credit loss account, and is maintained at an appropriate level adequate to absorb anticipated losses and is determined in accordance with gaap. for further information on our processes to determine our allowance for credit losses, see "-critical

(1) as discussed in note 1 "significant accounting policies" to our audited consolidated financial statements in part ii, item 8 - financial statements and supplementary data, included in this report, the alll is reviewed separately for commercial and retail loans, and the alll for each includes an adjustment for qualitative allowance that includes certain risks, factors and events that might not be measured in the statistical analysis. as a result of this adjustment, the unallocated allowance was absorbed into the separately measured commercial and retail qualitative allowance during 2013.
(2) during december 2016, changes to the incurred loss period were reflected as components of the provision for retail property secured products. during december 2013, we updated our estimate of the incurred loss period for certain residential mortgages. this change reflected an analysis of defaulted borrowers and aligned to management's view that incurred but unrealized losses emerge differently during various points of an economic/business cycle.

the allowance for credit losses totaled $1.3 billion at december 31, 2016 and 2015. our alll was 1.15% of total loans and leases and 118% of nonperforming loans and leases as of december 31, 2016 compared with 1.23% and 115%, respectively, as of december 31, 2015. there were no material changes in assumptions or estimation techniques compared with prior periods that impacted the determination of the current period's alll and the reserve for unfunded lending commitments. however, as part of the annual review of loss emergence periods, the incurred loss periods for retail property secured loans were extended.
overall credit quality continued to improve reflecting growth in lower risk retail loans and modest increases in commercial categories. nonperforming loans and leases of $1.0 billion as of december 31, 2016 decreased $15 million from december 31, 2015, reflecting improvements in retail real estate secured categories offset by an increase in commercial nonperforming assets, largely driven by commodities-related businesses. net charge-offs of $335 million increased $51 million, or 18%, from $284 million in 2015, as a $59 million increase in commercial, largely tied to commodities-related businesses, and a reduction in commercial real estate recoveries more than offset an $8 million decrease in retail. net charge-offs of 0.32% of average total loans and leases remained relatively stable with 0.30% in 2015. see note 5 "allowance for credit losses, nonperforming assets, and concentrations of credit risk" to our audited consolidated financial statements in part ii, item 8 - financial statements and supplementary data, included in this report.

potential problem loans and leases at december 31, 2016, we did not identify any potential problem loans or leases within the portfolio that were not already included in "-risk elements." potential problem loans or leases consist of loans and leases where information about a borrower's possible credit problems cause management to have serious doubts as to the ability of such borrowers to comply with the present repayment terms.
commercial loan asset quality our commercial loan and lease portfolio consists of traditional commercial loans, commercial real estate loans and leases. the portfolio is predominantly focused on customers in our footprint and adjacent states in which we have a physical presence where our local delivery model provides for strong client connectivity. additionally, we also do business in certain specialized industry sectors on a national basis.

management's discussion and analysis for commercial loans and leases, we use regulatory classification ratings to monitor credit quality. loans with a "pass" rating are those that we believe will be fully repaid in accordance with the contractual loan terms. commercial loans and leases that are "criticized" are those that have some weakness that indicates an increased probability of future loss. see note 5 "allowance for credit losses, nonperforming assets, and concentrations of credit risk" to our audited consolidated financial statements in part ii, item 8 - financial statements and supplementary data, included in this report.
nonperforming commercial loans and leases increased $239 million to $387 million as of december 31, 2016 from $148 million as of december 31, 2015, largely reflecting a $248 million increase tied to commodities-related businesses partially offset by a $27 million reduction in commercial real estate. these results also reflect the impact of revised regulatory guidance related to multi-tiered debt structures on the reserve-based lending portion of the oil and gas portfolio. as of december 31, 2016, total commercial nonperforming loans were 0.7% of the commercial loan portfolio compared to 0.3% as of december 31, 2015. total 2016 commercial loan and lease net charge-offs of $46 million increased from a net recovery of $13 million in 2015, largely reflecting an increase tied to commodities-related businesses and a reduction in commercial real estate recoveries of prior period charge-offs.
total commercial criticized loans and leases totaled $2.9 billion, or 5.6% of total commercial loans and leases as of december 31, 2016, compared to $2.6 billion, or 5.6%, as of december 31, 2015. commercial criticized balances of $2.3 billion, or 6.1% of commercial loans, as of december 31, 2016, increased modestly from $2.0 billion, or 6.0%, as of december 31, 2015. commercial real estate criticized balances of $478 million, or 4.5% of the commercial real estate portfolio, decreased from $521 million, or 5.8%, as of december 31, 2015. commercial criticized loans to total criticized loans of 78% as of december 31, 2016 compared to 76% as of december 31, 2015. commercial real estate accounted for 16% of criticized loans as of december 31, 2016 compared to 20% as of december 31, 2015.
retail loan asset quality for retail loans, we primarily utilize payment and delinquency status to monitor credit quality. historical experience indicates that the longer a loan is past due, the greater the likelihood of future credit loss. these credit quality indicators are continually updated and monitored. our retail loan portfolio remains focused on lending across the new england, mid-atlantic and midwest regions, with continued geographic expansion outside the footprint primarily in the auto finance, student lending and unsecured portfolios. retail assets increased $3.2 billion to $56.0 billion as of december 31, 2016, a 6.0% increase from december 31, 2015, driven by growth in the student lending, residential mortgage portfolios and other unsecured, offset by continued runoff in home equity.
nonperforming retail loans as a percentage of total retail loans were 1.2% as of december 31, 2016, a decrease of 50 basis points from december 31, 2015, driven primarily by the third quarter 2016 tdr transaction and the first quarter 2016 reclassification of residential mortgage loans guaranteed by government entities to accruing status in keeping with industry practice. nonperforming balances at december 31, 2016 also excluded $50 million of government guaranteed loans.
the credit composition of our retail loan portfolio at december 31, 2016 remained favorable and well-positioned across all product lines with an average refreshed fico score of 759, improving two points from december 31, 2015, as we continue to put high quality assets in our retail portfolio. the real estate secured portfolio cltv ratio, which is calculated as the mortgage and second lien loan balance divided by the appraised value of the property, was 62% as of december 31, 2016 compared to 64% as of december 31, 2015. retail asset quality continued to improve with a net charge-off rate (core and non-core) of 0.53% for the year ended december 31, 2016, a decrease of five basis points from the year ended december 31, 2015, driven by broad improvement in the home equity, student and other unsecured retail portfolios.

troubled debt restructurings tdr is the classification given to a loan that has been restructured in a manner that grants a concession to a borrower experiencing financial hardship that we would not otherwise make. tdrs typically result from our loss mitigation efforts and are undertaken in order to improve the likelihood of recovery and continuity of the relationship. our loan modifications are handled on a case-by-case basis and are negotiated to achieve mutually agreeable terms that maximize loan collectability and meet our borrower's financial needs. the types of concessions include interest rate reductions, term extensions, principal forgiveness and other modifications to the structure of the loan that fall outside our lending policy. depending on the specific facts and circumstances of the customer, restructuring can involve loans moving to nonaccrual, remaining on nonaccrual, or remaining on accrual status.
as of december 31, 2016, $799 million of retail loans were classified as retail tdrs, compared with $1.2 billion as of december 31, 2015. the decrease was driven by the impact of the third quarter 2016 sale of $310 million of retail tdrs, including

$255 million of residential mortgages and $55 million of home equity loans. as of december 31, 2016, $233 million of retail tdrs were in nonaccrual status with 55% current on payments compared to $379 million of retail tdrs at december 31, 2015, with 51% current on payments. tdrs generally return to accrual status once repayment capacity and appropriate payment history can be established. tdrs are evaluated for impairment individually. loans are classified as tdrs until paid off, sold or refinanced at market terms.

management's discussion and analysis derivatives we use pay-fixed swaps to hedge floating rate wholesale funding and to offset duration in fixed-rate assets. notional balances on wholesale funding hedges totaled $3.0 billion as of december 31, 2016 and $5.0 billion as of december 31, 2015. pay-fixed rates on the swaps ranged from 0.91% to 1.98% as of december 31, 2016 and 1.96% to 4.30% as of december 31, 2015. as of december 31, 2016, $1.0 billion are forward starting positions which begin accruing interest starting in january 2018. at december 31, 2015 we also had a $500 million hedge of forecasted term debt issuance at a 1.82% pay fixed rate which was unwound in july 2016.
we use receive-fixed swaps to minimize the exposure to variability in the interest cash flows on our floating rate assets, and to hedge market risk on fixed rate capital markets debt issuances. at december 31, 2016 and 2015, the notional amount of receive-fixed swap hedges totaled $10.4 billion and $11.3 billion, respectively. the fixed-rate ranges were 0.88% to 1.84% as of december 31, 2016 and 0.77% to 2.05% as of december 31, 2015. we paid one-month and three-month libor on these swaps.
in december 2016, we unwound $3.0 billion of receive-fixed swaps and $3.0 billion of pay-fixed swaps with offsetting cash flow and risk profiles. the $6.0 billion reduction of swaps will create unused hedge capacity and reduce collateral needs on the cleared portion.
in november 2016, we entered into $2.0 billion of short-term maturity (1.5 to 2.0 years) pay-fixed interest rate swaps to hedge short-term floating rate wholesale funding. we pay fixed at rates ranging from 0.91% to 1.03% and receive one-month libor.
in october 2016, we entered into a $500 million five-year receive-fixed interest rate swap designed to hedge the interest-rate exposure on floating rate commercial loans and modestly reduce longer-term net interest income sensitivity. we receive a fixed rate of 1.10% on the agreement and pay one month libor. additionally, $500 million in legacy pay-fixed swaps hedging wholesale funding matured during the month.
in third quarter 2016, we entered into $2.9 billion five-year receive-fixed interest rate swap designed to hedge the interest-rate exposure on floating rate commercial loans and modestly reduce longer-term net interest income sensitivity. we receive fixed at rates ranging from 0.88% to 1.07% on the agreements and pay one-month libor.
in july 2016, we unwound $1.0 billion in swaps related to a subordinated debt buy back, comprised of a $500 million fair value hedge of the notes bought back, and $500 million hedging the forecast senior debt issuance used to retire the debt.
in june 2016, we entered into a $500 million five-year receive-fixed interest rate swap designed to hedge the interest-rate exposure on floating rate commercial loans and modestly reduce longer-term net interest income sensitivity. we receive a fixed rate of 1.09% on the agreement and pay one-month libor.
in march and may 2016, we entered into receive-fixed interest-rate swaps totaling $750 million and $1.0 billion, respectively, to manage the interest rate exposure on a medium term debt issued in the same months. these agreements converted the fixed-rate debt coupon to three-month libor based floating funding. we receive a fixed rate of 1.06% and 1.17%, respectively, on the swap agreements and pay three-month libor.
in february 2016, we terminated $3.0 billion of two-year original term receive-fixed interest rate swaps that hedged the interest rate exposure on floating rate commercial loans. the transaction resulted in a $13 million gain which will be amortized over the remaining life of the swap.
we also sell interest rate swaps and foreign exchange forwards to commercial customers. interest rate and foreign exchange derivative contracts are transacted to effectively minimize our market risk associated with the customer derivative contracts. the assets and liabilities recorded for derivatives not designated as hedges reflect the market value of these transactions.

(1) the notional or contractual amount of interest rate derivatives and foreign exchange contracts is the amount upon which interest and other payments under the contract are based. for interest rate derivatives, the notional amount is typically not exchanged. therefore, notional amounts should not be taken as the measure of credit or market risk as they do not measure the true economic risk of these contracts.
(2) amounts represent the impact of legally enforceable master netting agreements that allow us to settle positive and negative positions.
(3) we also offset assets and liabilities associated with repurchase agreements on our consolidated balance sheets. see note 3, "securities," in our audited consolidated financial statements in part ii, item 8 - financial statements and supplementary data, included in this report.
at december 31, 2016, the overall derivative asset value increased $2 million and the liability balance increased by $174 million from december 31, 2015, primarily due to higher fixed interest rates at december 31, 2016, compared to december 31, 2015.

short-term borrowed funds of $4.4 billion as of december 31, 2016, increased $927 million from december 31, 2015, as a $581 million increase in other short-term borrowed funds, which was driven by a $749 million increase in senior debt that now matures in less than one year, and a $533 million increase in fed funds purchased were partially offset by a $187 million decrease in customer repurchase agreements.
as of december 31, 2016, our total contingent liquidity was $24.0 billion, consisting of $2.2 billion in net cash at the frb (which is defined as cash less overnight fed funds purchased), $19.0 billion in unencumbered high-quality liquid assets, and $2.8 billion in unused fhlb borrowing capacity. asset liquidity, a component of contingent liquidity, consisting of net cash at the frb and unencumbered high-quality and liquid securities, was $21.2 billion. additionally, $11.8 billion in secured discount window capacity from the frbs created total available liquidity of approximately $35.8 billion.

management's discussion and analysis capital as a bank holding company and a financial holding company, we are subject to regulation and supervision by the frbg. our primary subsidiaries are our two insured depository institutions, cbna, a national banking association whose primary federal regulator is the occ, and cbpa, a pennsylvania-charted savings bank regulated by the department of banking of the commonwealth of pennsylvania and supervised by the fdic as its primary federal regulator.
the u.s. adoption of the basel iii standardized approach by all primary regulators became effective for the parent company, cbna and cbpa on january 1, 2015 (subject to a phase-in period for certain provisions). among other changes, these regulations introduced a new capital conservation buffer ("ccb") on top of the following three minimum risk-based capital ratios: cet1 capital of 4.5%, tier 1 capital of 6.0% and total capital of 8.0%. the implementation of the capital conservation buffer began on january 1, 2016 at the 0.625% level and will increase by 0.625% on each subsequent january 1, until the buffer reaches its fully phased-in level of 2.5% on january 1, 2019. banking institutions for which any risk-based capital ratio falls below its effective minimum (required minimum plus the applicable capital conservation buffer) will be subject to constraints on capital distributions, including dividends, repurchases and certain executive compensation, based on the amount of the shortfall.

at december 31, 2016, our cet1 capital, tier 1 capital and total capital ratios were 11.2%, 11.4% and 14.0%, respectively compared with 11.7%, 12.0% and 15.3% as of december 31, 2015. the decrease in the respective ratios was largely driven by our 2016 capital plan actions which included common dividends of $241 million, preferred dividends of $14 million and the repurchase of $430 million of common shares and $625 million of subordinated debt. at december 31, 2016, our cet1 capital, tier 1 capital and total capital ratios were 4.2%, 2.9% and 3.5%, respectively, above their regulatory minimums plus the fully phased-in capital conservation buffer. based on both current and fully phased-in basel iii requirements, all ratios remained well above basel iii minima.

management's discussion and analysis standardized approach the parent company, cbna and cbpa calculate regulatory ratios using the basel iii standardized approach, as defined by u.s. regulators, for determining risk-weighted assets. under this approach no distinction is made for variations in credit quality for corporate exposures. additionally, the economic benefit of collateral is restricted to a limited list of eligible securities and cash. at december 31, 2016, we estimate our cet1 capital, cet1 capital ratio and total risk-weighted assets using the basel iii standardized approach, on a fully phased-in basis, to be $13.8 billion, 11.1% and $124.1 billion, respectively. our estimates may be refined over time because of further rulemaking or clarification by u.s. banking regulators or as our understanding and interpretation of rules evolve.
the following table provides a reconciliation of regulatory ratios and ratio components using the basel iii standardized transitional rules and basel iii standardized estimates on a fully-phased in basis for common equity tier 1 capital, total capital and risk-weighted assets.

regulatory capital ratios and capital composition cet1 capital under basel iii standardized transitional rules totaled $13.8 billion at december 31, 2016, and increased $433 million from $13.4 billion at december 31, 2015, as growth in net income and amortization of deferred tax related to goodwill was partially offset by the impact of share repurchases and dividend payments. tier 1 capital at december 31, 2016 totaled $14.1 billion, reflecting a $433 million increase from $13.6 billion at december 31, 2015, driven by the changes in cet 1 capital noted above. at december 31, 2016 and 2015, we had $247 million of 5.500% fixed-to-floating non-cumulative perpetual preferred stock outstanding which qualified as additional tier 1 capital. total capital of $17.3 billion at december 31, 2016, decreased $158 million from december 31, 2015 as the benefit of net income growth and amortization of deferred tax related to goodwill was more than offset by the impact of the redemption of subordinated debt, share repurchases and dividend payments.
risk-weighted assets based on basel iii standardized transitional rules at december 31, 2016 totaled $123.9 billion, up $9.8 billion from december 31, 2015. the primary drivers for this change were growth in commercial, commercial real estate and student loan portfolios.
as of december 31, 2016, the tier 1 leverage ratio decreased 52 basis points to 9.9% from 10.5% as of december 31, 2015. this decline reflected the net impact of an $11.2 billion increase in adjusted quarterly average total assets, which drove an 84 basis point decline in the ratio, and the previously noted increase in tier 1 capital, which added 32 basis points to the ratio.

capital adequacy process our assessment of capital adequacy begins with our risk appetite and risk management framework. this framework provides for the identification, measurement and management of material risks. capital requirements are determined for actual and forecasted risk portfolios using applicable regulatory capital methodologies. the assessment also considers the possible impacts of approved and proposed regulatory changes to future periods. key analytical frameworks, which enable assessment of capital adequacy versus unexpected loss, supplement our base case forecast. these supplemental frameworks include integrated stress testing, as well as an internal capital adequacy requirement that builds on internally assessed economic capital requirements. a robust governance framework supports our capital planning process. this process includes capital management policies and procedures that document capital adequacy metrics and limits, as well as our comprehensive capital contingency plan and the active engagement of both the legal-entity boards and senior management in oversight and decision-making.
forward-looking assessments of capital adequacy for us and for our banking subsidiaries feed development of capital plans that are submitted to the frbg and to bank regulators. we prepare these plans in full compliance with the frbg's capital plan rule and we participate annually in the frbg's ccar review process. in addition to the stress test requirements under ccar, we also participate in semiannual stress tests required by the dodd-frank act.
all distributions proposed under our 2016 capital plan were subject to consideration and approval by our board of directors prior to execution. the timing and exact amount of dividends and share repurchases will depend on various factors, including our capital position, financial performance and market conditions. all of the following capital actions were completed during the year ended december 31, 2016. these were part of the 2016 capital plan to which the federal reserve indicated no objection.

cbna cet1 capital under basel iii standardized transitional rules totaled $11.2 billion at december 31, 2016, up $494 million from $10.8 billion at december 31, 2015 reflecting the impact of net income growth partially offset by dividend payments. at december 31, 2016, cbna held minimal additional tier 1 capital. total capital was $13.4 billion at december 31, 2016, an increase of $311 million from december 31, 2015, driven primarily by the increase in cet1 capital net of the redemption of subordinated debt.
cbna risk-weighted assets based on basel iii standardized transitional rules at december 31, 2016 of $100.5 billion, increased $8.9 billion from december 31, 2015 driven by growth in commercial loans and commitments, commercial real estate, student, residential mortgage and unsecured retail loans.
as of december 31, 2016, cbna's tier 1 leverage ratio decreased approximately 43 basis points to 10.3% from 10.7% as of december 31, 2015, driven by a $9.0 billion increase in adjusted quarterly average total assets that drove a 90 basis point decline in the ratio, partially offset by a 47 basis point increase for higher cet1 capital described above.
cbpa cet1 capital under basel iii standardized transitional rules totaled $3.1 billion at december 31, 2016, and increased $77 million from $3.0 billion at december 31, 2015 as the impact of net income growth and amortization of deferred tax related to goodwill was partially offset by the impact of dividend payments. at december 31, 2016, there was no additional tier 1 capital. cbpa total capital of $3.3 billion at december 31, 2016 decreased $226 million from december 31, 2015 driven by the redemption of subordinated debt partially offset by an increase in cet1 capital.
cbpa risk-weighted assets based on basel iii standardized transitional rules at december 31, 2016 of $24.4 billion, increased $1.2 billion from december 31, 2015 largely reflecting the impact of growth in student, commercial, commercial real estate and mortgage backed securities partially offset by a reduction in residential mortgage and auto.

management's discussion and analysis as of december 31, 2016, the cbpa tier 1 leverage ratio decreased 30 basis points to 8.8% from 9.1% as of december 31, 2015, driven by an increase in adjusted quarterly average total assets of $2.0 billion resulting in a 53 basis point decline in the ratio, partially offset by a 23 basis point increase resulting from higher cet1 capital described above.
liquidity liquidity is defined as our ability to meet our cash-flow and collateral obligations in a timely manner, at a reasonable cost. an institution must maintain current liquidity to meet its expected daily and forecasted cash-flow requirements, as well as contingent liquidity to meet unexpected (stress scenario) funding requirements. as noted earlier, reflecting the importance of meeting all unexpected and stress-scenario funding requirements, we identify and manage contingent liquidity (consisting of excess cash balances at the frb, unencumbered high-quality and liquid securities, and unused fhlb borrowing capacity). separately, we also identify and manage asset liquidity as a subset of contingent liquidity (consisting of excess cash balances at the frb and unencumbered high-quality securities). at december 31, 2016, our net overnight position (which is defined as cash balance held at the frb less any overnight borrowings) totaled $2.2 billion, we held $19.0 billion in unencumbered high-quality liquid assets, and maintained undrawn fhlb borrowing capacity of $2.8 billion. this resulted in total contingent liquidity of $24.0 billion and total asset liquidity of $21.2 billion.
we manage liquidity at the consolidated enterprise level and at the legal entity level, including at the parent company, cbna and cbpa.
cfg liquidity our primary sources of cash are (i) dividends and interest received from our banking subsidiaries as a result of investing in bank equity and subordinated debt and (ii) externally issued senior and subordinated debt. our uses of liquidity include the following: (i) routine cash flow requirements as a bank holding company, including periodic share repurchases and payments of dividends, interest and expenses; (ii) needs of subsidiaries, including our banking subsidiaries, for additional equity and, as required, their needs for debt financing; and (iii) extraordinary requirements for cash.
in 2016, we utilized $350 million in proceeds from the issuance of senior notes and $275 million in excess cash to repurchase $334 million of our 4.082% subordinated notes, due 2025, and $291 million of our 4.023% subordinated notes, due 2024. in 2016, we paid $430 million to repurchase 17,332,684 common shares at an average price of $24.81; $405 million was recorded in treasury stock and $25 million was recorded in additional paid in capital. the repurchased shares are held in treasury stock.
our cash and cash equivalents represent a source of liquidity that can be used to meet various needs and totaled $551 million as of december 31, 2016 compared with $400 million as of december 31, 2015.
our liquidity risk is low for the following reasons: (i) we have no material non-banking subsidiaries, and our banking subsidiaries are self-funding; (ii) the capital structures of our banking subsidiaries are similar to our capital structure. as of december 31, 2016, our double leverage ratio (the combined equity of our subsidiaries divided by our equity) was 102.1%; and, (iii) our other cash flow requirements, such as operating expenses, are relatively small.
banking subsidiaries' liquidity in the ordinary course of business, the liquidity of cbna and cbpa is managed by matching sources and uses of cash. the primary sources of bank liquidity include (i) deposits from our consumer and commercial franchise customers; (ii) payments of principal and interest on loans and debt securities; and (iii) wholesale borrowings, as needed, and as described under "-liquidity risk management and governance." the primary uses of bank liquidity include (i) withdrawals and maturities of deposits; (ii) payment of interest on deposits; (iii) funding of loans and related commitments; and (iv) funding of securities purchases. to the extent that the banks have relied on wholesale borrowings, uses also include payments of related principal and interest.
our banking subsidiaries' major businesses involve taking deposits and making loans. hence, a key role of liquidity management is to ensure that customers have timely access to funds from deposits and loans. liquidity management also involves maintaining sufficient liquidity to repay wholesale borrowings, pay operating expenses and support extraordinary funding requirements when necessary.
from an external issuance perspective, during 2014, we created a $3.0 billion global note program for cbna. this debt represents a key source of unsecured, term and stable funding, that further diversifies the funding sources of cbna and creates a more peer-like funding structure for the consolidated enterprise. on march 14, 2016, we increased the size of this program from $3.0 billion to $5.0 billion. also, on march 14, 2016, cbna issued $750 million in three-year fixed-rate senior notes, and on may 13, 2016, cbna issued $1.0 billion in five-year fixed-rate senior notes. on december 3, 2015, cbna issued $750 million in three-year fixed-rate senior notes, and on december 4, 2014, cbna issued $1.5 billion in fixed-rate senior notes, consisting of $750 million of three-year notes and $750 million in five-year notes.

management's discussion and analysis liquidity risk we define liquidity risk as the risk that an entity will be unable to meet its payment obligations in a timely manner. we manage liquidity risk at the consolidated enterprise level and at the legal entity level, including at the parent company, cbna and cbpa. liquidity risk can arise due to contingent liquidity risk and/or funding liquidity risk.
contingent liquidity risk is the risk that market conditions may reduce an entity's ability to liquidate, pledge and/or finance certain assets and thereby substantially reduce the liquidity value of such assets. drivers of contingent liquidity risk include general market disruptions as well as specific issues regarding the credit quality and/or valuation of a security or loan, issuer or borrower and/or asset class.
funding liquidity risk is the risk that market conditions and/or entity-specific events may reduce an entity's ability to raise funds from depositors and/or wholesale market counterparties. drivers of funding liquidity risk may be idiosyncratic or systemic, reflecting impediments to operations and/or damaged market confidence.
factors affecting liquidity given the composition of their assets and borrowing sources, contingent liquidity risk at both cbna and cbpa would be materially affected by such events as deterioration of financing markets for high-quality securities (e.g., mortgage-backed securities and other instruments issued by the gnma, fnma and the fhlmc), by any inability of the fhlbs to provide collateralized advances and/or by a refusal of the frb to act as lender of last resort in systemic stress.
similarly, given the structure of their balance sheets, the funding liquidity risk of cbna and cbpa would be materially affected by an adverse idiosyncratic event (e.g., a major loss, causing a perceived or actual deterioration in its financial condition), an adverse systemic event (e.g., default or bankruptcy of a significant capital markets participant), or a combination of both (e.g., the financial crisis of 2008-2010). however, during the financial crisis, our banking subsidiaries reduced their dependence on unsecured wholesale funding to virtually zero. consequently, and despite ongoing exposure to a variety of idiosyncratic and systemic events, we view our contingent liquidity risk and our funding liquidity risk to be relatively modest.
an additional variable affecting our access, and the access of our banking subsidiaries, to unsecured wholesale market funds and to large denomination (i.e., uninsured) customer deposits is the credit ratings assigned by such agencies as moody's, standard & poor's and fitch. the following table presents our credit ratings:

nr = not rated changes in our public credit ratings could affect both the cost and availability of our wholesale funding. as a result and in order to maintain a conservative funding profile, our banking subsidiaries continue to minimize reliance on unsecured wholesale funding. at december 31, 2016, the majority of wholesale funding consisted of secured borrowings from the fhlbs collateralized by high-quality residential mortgages.
existing and evolving regulatory liquidity requirements represent another key driver of systemic liquidity conditions and liquidity management practices. the frbg, the occ, and the fdic regularly evaluate our liquidity as part of the overall supervisory process, and the u.s. version of the lcr was effective for us beginning january 2016.
98
citizens financial group, inc.
management's discussion and analysis the lcr was developed to ensure banks have sufficient high-quality liquid assets to cover expected net cash outflows over a 30-day liquidity stress period. in september 2014, the u.s. federal banking regulators published the final rule to implement the lcr. this rule also introduced a modified version of the lcr in the united states, which generally applies to bhcs not active internationally (institutions with less than $10 billion of on-balance sheet foreign exposure), with total assets of greater than $50 billion but less than $250 billion. under this definition, we are designated as a modified lcr financial institution. as compared to the basel committee's version of the lcr, the version of the lcr issued by the u.s. federal banking regulators includes a narrower definition of high-quality liquid assets, different prescribed cash inflow and outflow assumptions for certain types of instruments and transactions and a shorter phase-in schedule that began on january 1, 2015 and ends on january 1, 2017. notably, as a modified lcr financial institution, we were required to be 90% compliant beginning in january 2016, and 100% compliant beginning in january 2017. achieving sustainable lcr compliance may require changes in the size and/or composition of our investment portfolio, the configuration of our discretionary wholesale funding portfolio, and our average cash position. we remain fully compliant with the lcr as of december 31, 2016.
the u.s. federal bank regulatory agencies have issued a notice of proposed rulemaking to implement the nsfr, along with a modified version with similar parameters as the lcr, that would designate us as a modified nsfr financial institution. the nsfr is one of the two basel iii-based liquidity measures, distinctly separate from the lcr, and is designed to promote medium- and long-term stable funding of the assets and off-balance sheet activities of banks and bank holding companies over a one-year time horizon. generally consistent with the basel committee's framework, under the proposed rule banking organizations would be required to hold an amount of available stable funding ("asf") over a one-year time horizon that equals or exceeds the institution's amount of required stable funding ("rsf"), with the asf representing the numerator and the rsf representing the denominator of the nsfr. the banking organizations subject to the modified nsfr would multiply the rsf amount by 70%, such that the rsf amount required for these companies would be required to maintain asf of at least 70% of its rsf. generally, these modified nsfr companies are defined as institutions with total assets of greater than $50 billion but less than $250 billion, and less than $10 billion of on-balance sheet foreign exposure. the proposed rule includes detailed descriptions of the items that would comprise asf and rsf and standardized factors that would apply to asf and rsf items, and would require any institution whose applicable modified nsfr falls under 100% to notify the appropriate federal regulator and develop a remediation plan.
we are currently evaluating the impact of the u.s. federal bank regulatory agencies' nsfr framework. if ultimately adopted as currently proposed, the implementation of the nsfr could impact our liquidity and funding requirements and practices in the future.
we continue to review and monitor these liquidity requirements to develop appropriate implementation plans and liquidity strategies. we expect to be fully compliant with the final rules on or prior to the applicable effective date.
liquidity risk management and governance liquidity risk is measured and managed by the funding and liquidity unit within our treasury unit in accordance with policy guidelines promulgated by our board and the asset and liability management committee. in managing liquidity risk, the funding and liquidity unit delivers regular and comprehensive reporting, including current levels versus threshold limits for a broad set of liquidity metrics and early warning indicators, explanatory commentary relating to emerging risk trends and, as appropriate, recommended remedial strategies.
the mission of our funding and liquidity unit is to deliver and otherwise maintain prudent levels of operating liquidity (to support expected and projected funding requirements), contingent liquidity (to support unexpected funding requirements resulting from idiosyncratic, systemic, and combination stress events), and regulatory liquidity (to address current and emerging requirements such as the lcr and the nsfr). additionally, we will deliver this liquidity from stable funding sources, in a timely manner and at a reasonable cost, without significant adverse consequences.
we seek to accomplish this mission by funding loans with stable deposits; by prudently controlling dependence on wholesale funding, particularly short-term unsecured funding; and by maintaining ample available liquidity, including a contingent liquidity buffer of unencumbered high-quality loans and securities. as of december 31, 2016:
•   core deposits continued to be our primary source of funding and our consolidated year-end loan-to-deposit ratio was 98.6%;
•   our net overnight position (which is defined as cash balance held at the frb less any overnight borrowings) totaled $2.2 billion;
•   contingent liquidity was $24.0 billion; consisting of our net overnight position (defined above) of $2.2 billion; unencumbered high-quality liquid assets of $19.0 billion; and unused fhlb capacity of $2.8 billion. asset liquidity (a component of contingent liquidity) was $21.2 billion consisting of our net overnight position of $2.2 billion and unencumbered high-quality and liquid securities of $19.0 billion; and
99
citizens financial group, inc.
management's discussion and analysis
•   available discount window capacity, defined as available total borrowing capacity from the frb based on identified collateral, is secured by non-mortgage commercial and consumer loans and totaled $11.8 billion. use of this borrowing capacity would likely be considered only during exigent circumstances.
the funding and liquidity unit monitors a variety of liquidity and funding metrics and early warning indicators, including specific risk thresholds limits. these monitoring tools are broadly classified as follows:
•   current liquidity sources and capacities, including excess cash at the frbs, free and liquid securities and available and secured fhlb borrowing capacity;
•   liquidity stress sources, including idiosyncratic, systemic and combined stresses, in addition to evolving regulatory requirements such as the lcr and the nsfr; and
•   current and prospective exposures, including secured and unsecured wholesale funding and spot and cumulative cash-flow gaps across a variety of horizons.
further, certain of these metrics are monitored for each of us, our banking subsidiaries, and for our consolidated enterprise on a daily basis, including net overnight position, unencumbered securities, internal liquidity, and available fhlb borrowing capacity. in order to identify emerging trends and risks and inform funding decisions, specific metrics are also forecasted over a one-year horizon.
money-fund reform and other factors have incrementally increased borrowing rates for short-term and unsecured bank liabilities. however, our utilization of unsecured and short-term wholesale funding continues to be de minimis, given our significant portfolio of high quality liquid assets, our access to alternative funding sources including the fhlbs and the long-term capital markets, and our strong franchise deposit base.
cash flows from operating activities contributed $1.5 billion in 2016. net cash used by investing activities was $11.3 billion, primarily reflecting a net increase in loans and leases of $9.1 billion and securities available for sale portfolio purchases of $7.7 billion, partially offset by proceeds from maturities, paydowns and sales of securities available for sale of $5.8 billion. cash provided by financing activities was $10.5 billion, driven by proceeds from issuance of long-term borrowed funds of $15.1 billion and a net increase in deposits of $7.3 billion, partially offset by repayments of long-term borrowed funds of $8.4 billion and a net decrease in other short-term borrowed funds of $3.2 billion. the $15.1 billion proceeds included $1.3 billion from issuances of medium term debt and $13.8 billion in fhlb advances. the $8.4 billion of repayments includes $7.8 billion in repayments of fhlb advances and $625 million paid to repurchase subordinated debt. these activities represented a cumulative increase in cash and cash equivalents of $619 million, which, when added to the cash and cash equivalents balance of $3.1 billion at the beginning of the year, resulted in an ending balance of cash and cash equivalents of $3.7 billion as of december 31, 2016.
cash flows from operating activities contributed $1.2 billion in 2015. net cash used by investing activities was $5.9 billion, primarily reflecting net securities available for sale portfolio purchases of $6.8 billion and a net increase in loans and leases of $6.0 billion, partially offset by proceeds from maturities, paydowns and sales of securities available for sale of $7.3 billion. cash provided by financing activities was $4.5 billion, driven by a net increase in deposits of $6.8 billion and proceeds from long-term borrowed funds of $6.8 billion, partially offset by a decrease in federal funds purchased and securities sold under agreement to repurchase of $3.5 billion, a decrease in other short-term borrowed funds of $4.4 billion and repayments of long-term borrowed funds of $766 million. these activities represented a cumulative decrease in cash and cash equivalents of $191 million, which, when added to the cash and cash equivalents balance of $3.3 billion at the beginning of the year, resulted in an ending balance of cash and cash equivalents of $3.1 billion as of december 31, 2015.

critical accounting estimates our audited consolidated financial statements, which are included in this report, are prepared in accordance with gaap. the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires us to establish accounting policies and make estimates that affect amounts reported in our audited consolidated financial statements.
an accounting estimate requires assumptions and judgments about uncertain matters that could have a material effect on our audited consolidated financial statements. estimates are made using facts and circumstances known at a point in time. changes in those facts and circumstances could produce results substantially different from those estimates. the most significant accounting policies and estimates and their related application are discussed below.
see note 1 "significant accounting policies" to our audited consolidated financial statements in part ii, item 8 - financial statements and supplementary data, included in this report, for further discussion of our significant accounting policies.

management's discussion and analysis allowance for credit losses management's estimate of probable losses in our loan and lease portfolios including unfunded lending commitments is recorded in the alll and the reserve for unfunded lending commitments, at levels that we believe to be appropriate as of the balance sheet date. the reserve for unfunded lending commitments are reported as a component of other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets. our determination of such estimates is based on a periodic evaluation of the loan and lease portfolios and unfunded credit facilities, as well as other relevant factors. this evaluation is inherently subjective and requires significant estimates and judgments of underlying factors, all of which are susceptible to change.
the alll and reserve for unfunded lending commitments could be affected by a variety of internal and external factors. internal factors include portfolio performance such as delinquency levels, assigned risk ratings, the mix and level of loan balances, differing economic risks associated with each loan category and the financial condition of specific borrowers. external factors include fluctuations in the general economy, unemployment rates, bankruptcy filings, developments within a particular industry, changes in collateral values and factors particular to a specific commercial credit such as competition, business and management performance. the alll may be adjusted to reflect our current assessment of various qualitative risks, factors and events that may not be measured in our statistical procedures. there is no certainty that the alll and reserve for unfunded lending commitments will be appropriate over time to cover losses because of unanticipated adverse changes in any of these internal, external or qualitative factors.
the evaluation of the adequacy of the commercial, commercial real estate, and lease alll and reserve for unfunded lending commitments is primarily based on risk rating models that assess probability of default ("pd"), loss given default ("lgd") and exposure at default on an individual loan basis. the models are primarily driven by individual customer financial characteristics and are validated against historical experience. additionally, qualitative factors may be included in the risk rating models. after the aggregation of individual borrower incurred loss, additional overlays can be made based on back-testing against historical losses and forward loss curve ratios.
for nonaccruing commercial and commercial real estate loans with an outstanding balance of $3 million or greater and for all commercial and commercial real estate tdrs (regardless of size), we conduct specific analysis on a loan level basis to determine the probable amount of credit loss. if appropriate, a specific alll is established for the loan through a charge to the provision for credit losses. for all classes of impaired loans, individual loan measures of impairment may result in a charge-off to the alll, if deemed appropriate. in such cases, the provision for credit losses is not affected when a specific reserve for at least that amount already exists. techniques utilized include comparing the loan's carrying amount to the estimated present value of its future cash flows, the fair value of its underlying collateral, or the loan's observable market price. the technique applied to each impaired loan is based on the workout officer's opinion of the most probable workout scenario. historically, this has generally led to the use of the estimated present value of future cash flows approach. the fair value of underlying collateral will be used if the loan is deemed collateral dependent. for loans that use the fair value of underlying collateral approach, a charge-off assessment is performed quarterly to write the loans down to fair value.
for most non-impaired retail loan portfolio types, the alll is based upon the incurred loss model utilizing the pd, lgd and exposure at default on an individual loan basis. when developing these factors, we may consider the loan product and collateral type, delinquency status, ltv ratio, lien position, borrower's credit, time outstanding, geographic location and incurred loss period. incurred loss periods are reviewed and updated at least annually, and potentially more frequently when economic situations change rapidly, as they tend to fluctuate with economic cycles. incurred loss periods are generally longer in good economic times and shorter in bad times. certain retail portfolios, including sbo home equity loans, student loans, and credit card receivables utilize roll rate models to estimate the alll. for the portfolios measured using the incurred loss model, roll rate models are also used to support management overlays if deemed necessary.
for home equity lines and loans, a number of factors impact the pd. specifically, the borrower's current fico score, the utilization rate, delinquency statistics, borrower income, current cltv ratio and months on books are all used to assess the borrower's creditworthiness. similarly, the loss severity is also impacted by various factors, including the utilization rate, the cltv ratio, the lien position, the housing price index change for the location (as measured by the case-shiller index), months on books and current loan balance.
when we are not in a first lien position, we use delinquency information on the first lien exposures obtained from third-party credit information providers in the credit assessment. for all first liens, whether owned by a third party or by us, an additional assessment is performed on a quarterly basis. in this assessment, the most recent three months' performance of the senior liens is reviewed for delinquency (90 days or more past due), modification, foreclosure and/or bankruptcy statuses. if any derogatory status is present, the junior lien will be placed on nonaccrual status regardless of its delinquency status on our books. this subsequent change to nonaccrual status will alter the treatment in the pd model, thus affecting the reserve calculation.
102
citizens financial group, inc.
management's discussion and analysis in addition, the first lien exposure is combined with the second lien exposure to generate a cltv. the cltv is a more accurate reflection of the leverage of the borrower against the property value, as compared to the ltv from just the junior lien(s). the cltv is used for modeling both the junior lien pd and lgd. this also impacts the alll rates for the junior lien helocs.
the above measures are all used to assess the pd and lgd for heloc borrowers for whom we originated the loans. there is also a portfolio of home equity products that were originated and serviced by others; however, we currently service some of the loans in this portfolio. the sbo portfolio is modeled as a separate class and the reserves for this class are generated by using the delinquency roll rate models as described below.
for retail tdrs that are not collateral-dependent, allowances are developed using the present value of expected future cash flows, compared to the recorded investment in the loans. expected re-default factors are considered in this analysis. retail tdrs that are deemed collateral-dependent are written down to the fair market value of the collateral less costs to sell. the fair value of collateral is periodically monitored subsequent to the modification.
changes in the levels of estimated losses can significantly affect management's determination of an appropriate alll. for consumer loans, losses are affected by such factors as loss severity, collateral values, economic conditions, and other factors. a 1% and 5% increase in the estimated loss rate for consumer loans at december 31, 2016 would have increased the alll by $6 million and $28 million, respectively. the alll for our commercial banking segment is sensitive to assigned credit risk ratings and inherent loss rates. if 10% and 20% of the december 31, 2016 year end loan balances (including unfunded commitments) within each risk rating category of our commercial banking segment had experienced downgrades of two risk categories, the alll would have increased by $47 million and $93 million, respectively.
commercial loans and leases are charged off to the alll when there is little prospect of collecting either principal or interest. charge-offs of commercial loans and leases usually involve receipt of borrower-specific adverse information. for commercial collateral-dependent loans, an appraisal or other valuation is used to quantify a shortfall between the fair value of the collateral less costs to sell and the recorded investment in the commercial loan. retail loan charge-offs are generally based on established delinquency thresholds rather than borrower-specific adverse information. when a loan is collateral-dependent, any shortfalls between the fair value of the collateral less costs to sell and the recorded investment is promptly charged off. placing any loan or lease on nonaccrual status does not by itself require a partial or total charge-off; however, any identified losses are charged off at that time.
for additional information regarding the alll and reserve for unfunded lending commitments, see note 1 "significant accounting policies" and note 5 "allowance for credit losses, nonperforming assets and concentrations of credit risk" to our audited consolidated financial statements in part ii, item 8 - financial statements and supplementary data, included in this report.
fair value we measure fair value using the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. fair value is based upon quoted market prices in an active market, where available. if quoted prices are not available, observable market-based inputs or independently sourced parameters are used to develop fair value, whenever possible. such inputs may include prices of similar assets or liabilities, yield curves, interest rates, prepayment speeds and foreign exchange rates.
we classify our assets and liabilities that are carried at fair value in accordance with the three-level valuation hierarchy:
•   level 1. quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;
•   level 2. observable inputs other than level 1 prices, such as quoted prices for similar instruments; quoted prices in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by market data for substantially the full term of the asset or liability; and
•   level 3. unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market information and that are significant to the fair value measurement.
classification in the hierarchy is based upon the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement of the asset or liability. for instruments classified in level 1 and 2 where inputs are primarily based upon observable market data, there is less judgment applied in arriving at the fair value. for instruments classified in level 3, management judgment is more significant due to the lack of observable market data.
significant assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis include our mortgage-backed securities available for sale. these instruments are priced using an external pricing service and are classified as level 2 within the fair value hierarchy. the service's pricing models use predominantly observable valuation inputs to measure the fair value of these securities under both the market and income approaches. the pricing service utilizes a matrix pricing methodology to price our u.s. agency pass-through securities, which involves making adjustments to to-be-announced security prices based on a matrix of various mortgage-backed
103
citizens financial group, inc.
management's discussion and analysis securities characteristics such as weighted-average maturities, indices and other pool-level information. other agency and non-agency mortgage-backed securities are priced using a discounted cash flow methodology. this methodology includes estimating the cash flows expected to be received for each security using projected prepayment speeds and default rates based on historical statistics of the underlying collateral and current market conventions. these estimated cash flows are then discounted using market-based discount rates that incorporate characteristics such as average life, volatility, ratings, performance of the underlying collateral, and prevailing market conditions.
we review and update the fair value hierarchy classifications on a quarterly basis. changes from one quarter to the next related to the observability of inputs in fair value measurements may result in a reclassification between the fair value hierarchy levels and are recognized based on year-end balances. we also verify the accuracy of the pricing provided by our primary external pricing service on a quarterly basis. this process involves using a secondary external vendor to provide valuations for our securities portfolio for comparison purposes. any securities with discrepancies beyond a certain threshold are researched and, if necessary, valued by an independent outside broker.
fair value is also used on a nonrecurring basis to evaluate certain assets for impairment or for disclosure purposes. examples of nonrecurring uses of fair value include mortgage servicing rights accounted for by the amortization method, loan impairments for certain loans and goodwill.
the fair value of assets under operating leases is determined using collateral specific pricing digests, external appraisals, broker opinions, recent sales data from industry equipment dealers, and the discounted cash flows derived from the underlying lease agreement.  as market data for similar assets and lease agreements is available and used in the valuation, these assets are classified as level 2.
for additional information regarding our fair value measurements, see note 1 "significant accounting policies," note 3 "securities," note 10 "mortgage banking," note 16 "derivatives," and note 19 "fair value measurements" to our audited consolidated financial statements in part ii, item 8 - financial statements and supplementary data, included in this report.
goodwill goodwill is an asset that represents the future economic benefits arising from other assets acquired in a business combination that are not individually identified and separately recognized. goodwill is not amortized, but is subject to annual impairment tests. goodwill is assigned to reporting units at the date the goodwill is initially recorded. a reporting unit is a business operating segment or a component of a business operating segment. citizens has two reporting units with assigned goodwill; the consumer segment and the commercial segment. once goodwill has been assigned to reporting units, it no longer retains its association with a particular acquisition, and all of the activities within a reporting unit, whether acquired or organically grown, are available to support the value of the goodwill.
the goodwill impairment analysis is a two-step test. the first step, used to identify potential impairment, involves comparing each reporting unit's fair value to its carrying value including goodwill. if the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, applicable goodwill is deemed to be not impaired. if the carrying value exceeds fair value, there is an indication of impairment and the second step is performed to measure the amount of impairment.
the second step involves calculating an implied fair value of goodwill for each reporting unit for which the first step indicated impairment. the implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner as the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination, which is the excess of the fair value of the reporting unit, as determined in the first step, over the aggregate fair values of the individual assets, liabilities and identifiable intangible assets. if the implied fair value of goodwill exceeds the carrying value of goodwill assigned to the reporting unit, there is no impairment. if the carrying value of goodwill assigned to a reporting unit exceeds the implied fair value of the goodwill, an impairment charge is recorded for the excess. the impairment loss recognized cannot exceed the amount of goodwill assigned to a reporting unit, and the loss establishes a new basis in the goodwill. subsequent reversal of goodwill impairment losses is not permitted.
we review goodwill for impairment annually as of october 31 or more often if events or circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value of one or more reporting units is below its carrying value. we rely on the income approach (discounted cash flow method) as the primary method for determining fair value. market-based methods are used as benchmarks to corroborate the value determined by the discounted cash flow method.
we rely on several assumptions when estimating the fair value of our reporting units using the discounted cash flow method. these assumptions include the discount rate, loan loss provisions, tax rate, earnings and balance sheet growth rates, terminal growth rate, target capital ratios, and a terminal value multiple. discount rates are estimated based on the capital asset pricing model, which considers the risk-free interest rate, market risk premium, and beta for the reporting units. the discount rates are also calibrated on the assessment of the risks related to the projected cash flows of each reporting unit. multi-year financial forecasts are developed for each reporting unit by considering several key business drivers such as new business initiatives, customer retention standards, market share changes, anticipated loan and deposit growth, forward interest rates, historical performance and
104
citizens financial group, inc.
management's discussion and analysis industry and economic trends, among other considerations. the long-term growth rate used in determining the terminal value of each reporting unit is estimated based on management's assessment of the minimum expected terminal growth rate of each reporting unit, as well as broader economic considerations such as gross domestic product and inflation.
we corroborate the fair value of our reporting units determined by the discounted cash flow method using market-based methods: a comparable company method and a comparable transaction method. the comparable company method measures the fair value of a reporting unit by comparing it to publicly traded companies in similar lines of business. this involves identifying and selecting the comparable companies based on a number of factors (i.e., size, growth, profitability, and risk), calculating the market multiples (i.e., price-to-tangible book value, price-to-earnings) of these comparable companies and then applying these multiples to our operating results to estimate the value of the reporting unit's equity on a marketable, minority basis. a control premium is then applied to this value to estimate the fair value of the reporting unit on a marketable, controlling basis. the comparable transaction method measures fair value of a reporting unit based on exchange prices in actual transactions that have comparable factors to the reporting units. adjustments for differences in factors described earlier (i.e., size, growth, profitability, and risk) are also considered.
we also corroborate the fair value of our reporting units determined by the discounted cash flow method by adding the aggregated sum of these fair value measurements to the fair value of our other segment operations and comparing this total to our observed market capitalization. as part of this process, we analyze the implied control premium to evaluate its reasonableness. both positive and negative facts and circumstances are considered when completing this analysis, including company and market-specific factors, observed transaction data and any additional external evidence supporting the implied control premium. since none of our reporting units are publicly traded, individual reporting unit fair value determinations cannot be directly correlated to our common stock price. although we believe it is reasonable to conclude that market capitalization could be an indicator of fair value over time, it may not reflect the aggregate fair value of our individual reporting units at a specific point in time. the sum of the fair values of the reporting units at october 31, 2016 exceeded the overall market capitalization of cfg as of october 31, 2016.
we performed an annual test for impairment of goodwill for both reporting units as of october 31, 2016 and assessed the indicators of goodwill impairment through december 31, 2016. as of the testing date, the percentage by which the fair value of our consumer banking reporting unit exceeded its carrying value was 19%, and the percentage by which the fair value of our commercial banking reporting unit exceeded its carrying value was 12%. therefore, the results of this annual test indicated that the goodwill of each reporting unit was not impaired as of the testing date.
we based the fair value estimates used in our annual goodwill impairment testing on assumptions we believe to be representative of assumptions that a market participant would use in valuing the reporting units but that are unpredictable and inherently uncertain, including estimates of future growth rates and operating margins and assumptions about the overall economic climate and the competitive environment for our reporting units. there can be no assurances that future estimates and assumptions made for purposes of goodwill testing will prove accurate predictions of the future. if the assumptions regarding business plans, competitive environments, market conditions or anticipated growth rates are not achieved, or a market participant view of our total fair value declines, we may be required to record goodwill impairment charges in future periods.
for additional information regarding our goodwill impairment testing, see note 1 "significant accounting policies," and note 9 "goodwill" to our audited consolidated financial statements in part ii, item 8 - financial statements and supplementary data, included in this report.
income taxes accrued income taxes are reported as a component of either other assets or other liabilities, as appropriate, in the consolidated balance sheets and reflect our estimate of income taxes to be paid or that effectively have been prepaid. deferred income tax assets and liabilities represent the amount of future income taxes to be paid or that effectively have been prepaid, and the net balance is reported as an asset or liability in the consolidated balance sheets. we determine the realization of the deferred tax asset based upon an evaluation of the four possible sources of taxable income: (1) the future reversals of taxable temporary differences; (2) future taxable income exclusive of reversing temporary differences and carryforwards; (3) taxable income in prior carryback years; and (4) tax planning strategies. in projecting future taxable income, we utilize forecasted pre-tax earnings, adjust for the estimated book tax differences and incorporate assumptions, including the amount of income allocable to taxing jurisdictions. these assumptions require significant judgment and are consistent with the plans and estimates that we use to manage the underlying businesses. the realization of the deferred tax assets could be reduced in the future if these estimates are significantly different than forecasted.
we are subject to income tax in the united states and multiple state and local jurisdictions. the tax laws and regulations in each jurisdiction may be interpreted differently in certain situations, which could result in a range of outcomes. thus, we are required to exercise judgment regarding the application of these tax laws and regulations. we evaluate and recognize tax liabilities related to any tax uncertainties. due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may differ from the current estimate of tax liabilities or refunds.

risk governance we are committed to maintaining a strong, integrated and proactive approach to the management of all risks to which we are exposed in pursuit of our business objectives. a key aspect of our board's responsibility as the main decision making body is setting our risk appetite to ensure that the levels of risk that we are willing to accept in the attainment of our strategic business and financial objectives are clearly understood.
to enable our board to carry out its objectives, it has delegated authority for risk management activities, as well as governance and oversight of those activities, to a number of board and executive management level risk committees. the key committees that specifically consider risk across the enterprise are set out in the diagram below.
chief risk officer the cro directs our overall risk management function overseeing the credit, interest rate , market, liquidity, operational, compliance, strategic and reputational risk management. the cro reports to our ceo and to the board risk committee.
risk framework our risk management framework is embedded in our business through a "three lines of defense" model which defines responsibilities and accountabilities.
first line of defense the business lines (including their associated support functions) are the first line of defense and are accountable for owning and managing, within our defined risk appetite, the risks which exist in their respective business areas. the business lines are responsible for performing regular risk assessments to identify and assess the material risks that arise in their area of responsibility, complying with relevant risk policies, testing and certifying the adequacy and effectiveness of their controls on a regular basis, establishing and documenting operating procedures and establishing and owning a governance structure for identifying and managing risk.
106
citizens financial group, inc.
management's discussion and analysis second line of defense the second line of defense includes independent monitoring and control functions accountable for developing and ensuring implementation of risk and control frameworks and related policies. this centralized risk function is appropriately independent from the business and is accountable for overseeing and challenging our business lines on the effective management of their risks. this risk function utilizes training, communications and awareness to provide expert support and advice to the business lines. this includes interpreting the risk policy standards and risk management framework, overseeing compliance by the businesses with policies and responsibilities, including providing relevant management information and escalating concerns where appropriate.
the executive risk committee, chaired by the cro, actively considers our inherent material risks, analyzes our overall risk profile and seeks confirmation that the risks are being appropriately identified, assessed and mitigated.
third line of defense our internal audit function is the third line of defense providing independent assurance with a view of the effectiveness of citizens' internal controls, governance practices, and culture so that risk is managed appropriately for the size, complexity, and risk profile of the organization. internal audit has complete and unrestricted access to any and all bank records, physical properties and personnel. internal audit issues a report following each internal review and provides an audit opinion to citizens' audit committees on a quarterly basis.
credit quality assurance also reports to the chief audit executive and also provides the legal-entity boards, senior management and other stakeholders with independent assurance on the quality of credit portfolios and adherence to agreed credit risk appetite and credit policies and processes. in line with its procedures and regulatory expectations, the credit quality assurance function undertakes a program of portfolio testing, assessing and reporting through four risk pillars of asset quality, rating and data integrity, risk management and credit risk appetite.
risk appetite risk appetite is a strategic business and risk management tool. we define our risk appetite as the maximum limit of acceptable risk beyond which we would either be unable to achieve our strategic objectives and capital adequacy obligations or would assume an unacceptable amount of risk to do so. the board risk committee advises our board of directors in relation to current and potential future risk strategies, including determination of risk appetite and tolerance.
the principal non-market risks to which we are subject are: credit risk, operational risk, liquidity risk, strategic risk and reputational risk. we are also subject to market risks. market risk refers to potential losses arising from changes in interest rates, foreign exchange rates, equity prices, commodity prices and/or other relevant market rates or prices. modest market risk arises from trading activities that serve customer needs, including hedging of interest rate and foreign exchange risk. as described below, more material market risk arises from our non-trading banking activities, such as loan origination and deposit gathering. we have established enterprise-wide policies and methodologies to identify, measure, monitor and report market risk. we actively manage both trading and non-trading market risks. we are also subject to liquidity risk, discussed under "-liquidity."
our risk appetite framework and risk limit structure establishes guidelines to determine the balance between existing and desired levels of risk and supports the implementation, measurement and management of our risk appetite.
credit risk overview credit risk represents the potential for loss arising from a customer, counterparty, or issuer failing to perform in accordance with the contractual terms of the obligation. while the majority of our credit risk is associated with lending activities, we do engage with other financial counterparties for a variety of purposes including investing, asset and liability management, and trading activities. given the financial impact of credit risk on our earnings and balance sheet, the assessment, approval and management of credit risk represents a major part of our overall risk-management responsibility.
objective the credit risk management organization is responsible for approving credit transactions, monitoring portfolio performance, identifying problem loans, and ensuring remedial management.
107
citizens financial group, inc.
management's discussion and analysis organizational structure management and oversight of credit risk is the responsibility of both the line of business and the second line of defense. the second line of defense, the independent credit risk function, is led by the chief credit officer who oversees all of our credit risk. the cco reports to the chief risk officer. the cco, acting in a manner consistent with board policies, has responsibility for, among other things, the governance process around policies, procedures, risk acceptance criteria, credit risk appetite, limits and authority delegation. the cco and his team also have responsibility for credit approvals for larger and higher risk transactions and oversight of line of business credit risk activities. reporting to the cco are the heads of the second line of defense credit functions specializing in: consumer banking; commercial banking; citizens restructuring management; portfolio and corporate reporting; alll analytics; and credit policy and administration. each team under these leaders is composed of highly experienced credit professionals.
the credit risk teams operate independently from the business lines to ensure decisions are not influenced by unbalanced objectives.
governance the primary mechanisms used to govern our credit risk function are our consumer and commercial credit policies. these policies outline the minimum acceptable lending standards that align with our desired risk appetite. material issues or changes are identified by the individual committees and presented to the credit policy committee, executive risk committee and the board risk committee for approval as appropriate.
key management processes to ensure credit risks are managed within our risk appetite and business and risk strategies are achieved, we employ a comprehensive and integrated control program. the program's objective is to proactively (1) identify, (2) measure, (3) monitor, and (4) mitigate existing and emerging credit risks across the credit lifecycle (origination, account management/portfolio management, and loss mitigation and recovery).
consumer on the consumer banking side of credit risk, our teams use models to evaluate consumer loans across the lifecycle of the loan. starting at origination, credit scoring models are used to forecast the probability of default of an applicant. these models are embedded in the loan origination system, which allows for real-time scoring and automated decisions for many of our products. periodic validations are performed on our purchased and proprietary scores to ensure fit for purpose. when approving customers for a new loan or extension of an existing credit line, credit scores are used in conjunction with other credit risk variables such as affordability, length of term, collateral value, collateral type, and lien subordination.
the origination process is supported by dedicated underwriting teams that reside in the business line. the size of each team depends on the intensity of the approval process as the number of handoffs, documentation, and verification requirements differ substantially depending on the loan product.
to ensure proper oversight of the underwriting teams, lending authority is granted by the second line of defense credit risk function to each underwriter. the amount of delegated authority depends on the experience of the individual. we periodically evaluate the performance of each underwriter and annually reauthorize their delegated authority. only senior members of the second line of defense credit risk team are authorized to approve significant exceptions to credit policies. it is not uncommon to make exceptions to established policies when compensating factors are present. there are exception limits which, when reached, trigger a comprehensive analysis.
once an account is established, credit scores and collateral values are refreshed at regular intervals to allow for proactive identification of increasing or decreasing levels of credit risk. for accounts with contingent liability (revolving feature), credit policies have been developed that leverage the refreshed customer data to determine if a credit line should be increased, decreased, frozen, or closed. lastly, behavioral modeling, segmentation, and loan modifications are used to cure delinquency, reduce the severity of loss, and maximize recoveries. our approach to managing credit risk is highly analytical and, where appropriate, is automated, to ensure consistency and efficiency.
the credit risk team is constantly evaluating current and projected economic conditions, internal credit performance in relation to budget and predefined risk tolerances, and current and expected regulatory guidance to determine the optimal balance of expansion and contraction policies. all policy change proposals receive intense scrutiny and discussion prior to approval and implementation. this process ensures decisions are made based on risk-based analytics with full adherence to regulatory requirements.

management's discussion and analysis commercial on the commercial banking side of credit risk, the structure is broken into c&i loans and leases and cre. within c&i loans and leases there are separate verticals established for certain specialty products (e.g., asset-based lending, leasing, franchise finance, health care, technology, mid-corporate). a "specialty vertical" is a stand-alone team of industry or product specialists. substantially all activity that falls under the ambit of the defined industry or product is managed through a specialty vertical when one exists. cre also operates as a specialty vertical.
commercial credit risk management begins with defined credit products and policies.
commercial transactions are subject to individual analysis and approval at origination and, with few exceptions, are subject to a formal annual review requirement. the underwriting process includes the establishment and approval of credit grades that confirm the pd and lgd. approval then requires both a business line approver and an independent credit approver with the requisite level of delegated authority. the approval level of a particular credit facility is determined by the size of the credit relationship as well as the pd. the checks and balances in the credit process and the independence of the credit approver function are designed to appropriately assess and sanction the level of credit risk being accepted, facilitate the early recognition of credit problems when they occur, and to provide for effective problem asset management and resolution. all authority to grant credit is delegated through the independent credit risk function and is closely monitored and regularly updated.
the primary factors considered in commercial credit approvals are the financial strength of the borrower, assessment of the borrower's management capabilities, cash flows from operations, industry sector trends, type and sufficiency of collateral, type of exposure, transaction structure, and the general economic outlook. while these are the primary factors considered, there are a number of other factors that may be considered in the decision process. in addition to the credit analysis conducted during the approval process at origination and annual review, our credit quality assurance group performs testing to provide an independent review and assessment of the quality of the portfolio and new originations. this group conducts portfolio reviews on a risk-based cycle to evaluate individual loans, validate risk ratings, as well as test the consistency of the credit processes and the effectiveness of credit risk management.
the maximum level of credit exposure to individual credit borrowers is limited by policy guidelines based on the perceived risk of each borrower or related group of borrowers. concentration risk is managed through limits on industry (sector), loan type (asset class), and loan quality factors. we focus predominantly on extending credit to commercial customers with existing or expandable relationships within our primary markets (for this purpose defined as our 11 state footprint plus contiguous states), although we do engage in lending opportunities outside our primary markets if we believe that the associated risks are acceptable and aligned with strategic initiatives.
apart from industrials and cre (which together make up 30% of the commercial outstandings as of december 31, 2016), there are no material sector concentrations. as of december 31, 2016, our cre outstandings amounted to 10% of total loans and leases. the industrial sector includes basic c&i lending focused on general manufacturing. the sector is diversified and not managed as a specialized vertical. our customers are local to our market and present no significant concentration.
our credit grading system considers many components that directly correlate to loan quality and likelihood of repayment. our assessment of a borrower's credit strength is reflected in our risk ratings for such loans, which are also an integral component of our alll methodology. when deterioration in credit strength is noted, a loan becomes subject to watch review. the watch review process involves senior representatives from the business line portfolio management team, the independent credit risk team and our citizens restructuring management group. as appropriate and consistent with regulatory definitions, the credit may be subject to classification as either criticized or classified, which would also trigger a credit rating downgrade. as such, the loan and relationship would be subject to more frequent review.
substantially all loans categorized as classified are managed by citizens restructuring management, a specialized group of credit professionals that handles the day-to-day management of workouts, commercial recoveries and problem loan sales. its responsibilities include developing and implementing action plans, assessing risk ratings, determining the appropriateness of specific reserves relating to the loan, accrual status of the loan, and the ultimate collectability of loans in their portfolio.
market risk market risk refers to potential losses arising from changes in interest rates, foreign exchange rates, equity prices, commodity prices and/or other relevant market rates or prices. modest market risk arises from trading activities that serve customer needs, including hedging of interest rate and foreign exchange risk. as described below, more material market risk arises from our non-trading banking activities, such as loan origination and deposit-gathering. we have established enterprise-wide policies and methodologies to identify, measure, monitor and report market risk. we actively manage both trading and non-trading market risks.

management's discussion and analysis non-trading risk we are exposed to market risk as a result of non-trading banking activities. this market risk is composed entirely of interest rate risk, as we have no direct currency or commodity risk and de minimis equity risk. this interest rate risk emerges from the balance sheet after the aggregation of our assets, liabilities and equity. we refer to this non-trading risk embedded in the balance sheet as "structural interest rate risk" or "interest rate risk in the banking book." our mortgage servicing rights assets also contain interest rate risk as the value of the fee stream is impacted by the level of long-term interest rates.
a major source of structural interest rate risk is a difference in the repricing of assets, on the one hand, and liabilities and equity, on the other. first, there are differences in the timing of rate changes reflecting the maturity and/or repricing of assets and liabilities. for example, the rate earned on a residential mortgage may be fixed for 30 years; the rate paid on a certificate of deposit may be fixed only for a few months. due to these timing differences, net interest income is sensitive to changes in the level and shape of the yield curve. second, there are differences in the drivers of rate changes of various assets and liabilities. for example, commercial loans may reprice based on one-month libor or prime; the rate paid on retail money market demand accounts may be only loosely correlated with libor and depend on competitive demand for funds. due to these basis differences, net interest income is sensitive to changes in spreads between certain indices or repricing rates.
another important source of structural interest rate risk relates to the potential exercise of explicit or embedded options. for example, most consumer loans can be prepaid without penalty; and most consumer deposits can be withdrawn without penalty. the exercise of such options by customers can exacerbate the timing differences discussed above.
a primary source of our structural interest rate risk relates to faster repricing of floating rate loans relative to the retail deposit funding. this source of asset sensitivity is concentrated at the short end of the yield curve. for the past seven years with the federal funds rate near zero, this risk has been asymmetrical with significantly more upside benefit than potential exposure. with interest rates starting to rise, the risk position will become more symmetrical over time as rates can decline further before becoming floored at zero.
the secondary source of our interest rate risk is driven by longer term rates comprising the rollover or reinvestment risk on fixed rate loans as well as the prepayment risk on mortgage related loans and securities funded by non-rate sensitive deposits and equity.
the primary goal of interest rate risk management is to control exposure to interest rate risk within policy limits approved by the board. these limits and guidelines reflect our tolerance for interest rate risk over both short-term and long-term horizons. to ensure that exposure to interest rate risk is managed within this risk appetite, we must both measure the exposure and, as necessary, hedge it. the treasury asset and liability management team is responsible for measuring, monitoring and reporting on the structural interest rate risk position. these exposures are reported on a monthly basis to the asset and liability committee ("alco") and at board meetings.
we measure structural interest rate risk through a variety of metrics intended to quantify both short-term and long-term exposures. the primary method that we use to quantify interest rate risk is simulation analysis in which we model net interest income from assets, liabilities and hedge derivative positions under various interest rate scenarios over a three-year horizon. exposure to interest rate risk is reflected in the variation of forecasted net interest income across scenarios.
key assumptions in this simulation analysis relate to the behavior of interest rates and spreads, the changes in product balances and the behavior of loan and deposit clients in different rate environments. the most material of these behavioral assumptions relate to the repricing characteristics and balance fluctuations of deposits with indeterminate (i.e., non-contractual) maturities as well as the pace of mortgage prepayments. assessments are periodically made by running sensitivity analysis of the impact of key assumptions. the results of these analyses are reported to alco.
as the future path of interest rates cannot be known in advance, we use simulation analysis to project net interest income under various interest rate scenarios including a "most likely" (implied forward) scenario as well as a variety of deliberately extreme and perhaps unlikely scenarios. these scenarios may assume gradual ramping of the overall level of interest rates, immediate shocks to the level of rates and various yield curve twists in which movements in short- or long-term rates predominate. generally, projected net interest income in any interest rate scenario is compared to net interest income in a base case where market forward rates are realized.
the table below reports net interest income exposures against a variety of interest rate scenarios. exposures are measured as a percentage change in net interest income over the next year due to either instantaneous, or gradual parallel +/- 200 basis point moves in the market implied forward yield curve. the net interest income simulation analyses do not include possible future actions that management might undertake to mitigate this risk. the current limit is a decrease in net interest income of 13% related to an instantaneous +/- 200 basis point move. as the table illustrates, our balance sheet is asset-sensitive: net interest income would benefit from an increase in interest rates. exposure to a decline in interest rates is well within limit. it should be noted that the magnitude of any possible decline in interest rates is constrained by the low absolute starting levels of rates. while an instantaneous

management's discussion and analysis and severe shift in interest rates was used in this analysis, we believe that any actual shift in interest rates would likely be more gradual and would therefore have a more modest impact.

asset sensitivity was 5.9% at december 31, 2016, down modestly from 6.1% at december 31, 2015. the core asset sensitivity is the result of a faster repricing of the loan book relative to the deposits. the asset sensitive risk position is managed within our risk limits through occasional adjustments to securities investments, interest rate swaps and mix of funding.
we use a valuation measure of exposure to structural interest rate risk, economic value of equity ("eve"), as a supplement to net interest income simulations. eve complements net interest income simulation analysis as it estimates risk exposure over a long-term horizon. eve measures the extent to which the economic value of assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet instruments may change in response to fluctuation in interest rates. this analysis is highly dependent upon assumptions applied to assets and liabilities with non-contractual maturities. the change in value is expressed as a percentage of regulatory capital. the current risk limit is set at a decrease of 20% of regulatory capital given an instantaneous +/- 200 basis point change in interest rates. we are operating within that limit as of december 31, 2016.
we also had market risk associated with the value of the mortgage servicing right assets, which are impacted by the level of interest rates. as of december 31, 2016 and 2015, our mortgage servicing rights had a book value of $162 million and $164 million, respectively, and were carried at the lower of cost or fair value. as of december 31, 2016 and 2015, the fair value of the mortgage servicing rights was $182 million and $178 million, respectively. given low interest rates over recent years, there is a valuation allowance of $5 million and $9 million on the asset as of december 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. depending on the interest rate environment, hedges may be used to stabilize the market value of the mortgage servicing right asset.
trading risk we are exposed to market risk primarily through client facilitation activities including derivatives and foreign exchange products. exposure is created as a result of changes in interest rates and related basis spreads and volatility, foreign exchange rates, and credit spreads on a select range of interest rates, foreign exchange and secondary loans instruments. these trading activities are conducted through our two banking subsidiaries, cbna and cbpa.
client facilitation activities consist primarily of interest rate derivatives and foreign exchange contracts where we enter into offsetting trades with a separate counterparty or exchange to manage our market risk exposure. in addition to the aforementioned activities, we operate a secondary loan trading desk with the objective to meet secondary liquidity needs of our issuing clients' transactions and investor clients. we do not engage in any trading activities with the intent to benefit from short term price differences.
we record interest rate derivatives and foreign exchange contracts as derivative assets and liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets. trading assets and liabilities are carried at fair value with income earned related to these activities included in net interest income. changes in fair value of trading assets and liabilities are reflected in other income, a component of noninterest income on the consolidated statements of operations.

management's discussion and analysis market risk governance the market risk limit setting process is established in line with the formal enterprise risk appetite process and policy. this appetite reflects the strategic and enterprise level articulation of opportunities for creating franchise value set to the boundaries of how much market risk to take. dealing authorities represent the key control tool in the management of market risk that allows the cascading of the risk appetite throughout the enterprise. a dealing authority sets the operational scope and tolerances within which a business is permitted to operate and this is reviewed at least annually. dealing authorities are structured to accommodate the client facing trades and hedges needed to manage the risk profile. primary responsibility for keeping within established tolerances resides with the business. key risk indicators, including var, open foreign currency positions and single name risk, are monitored on a daily basis and reported against tolerances consistent with our risk appetite and business strategy to relevant business line management and risk counterparts.
market risk measurement we use var as a statistical measure for estimating potential exposure of our traded market risk in normal market conditions. our var framework for risk management and regulatory reporting is the same. risk management var is based on a one day holding period to a 99% confidence level, whereas regulatory var is based on a ten day holding period to the same confidence level. additional to var, non-statistical measurements for measuring risk are employed, such as sensitivity analysis, market value and stress testing.
our market risk platform and associated market risk and valuation models for our foreign exchange, interest rate products, and traded loans capture correlation effects and allow for aggregation of market risk across risk types, business lines and legal entities. we measure, monitor and report market risk for both management and regulatory capital purposes.
value-at-risk overview the market risk measurement model is based on historical simulation. the var measure estimates the extent of any fair value losses on trading positions that may occur due to broad market movements (general var) such as changes in the level of interest rates, foreign exchange rates, equity prices and commodity prices. it is calculated on the basis that current positions remain broadly unaltered over the course of a given holding period. it is assumed that markets are sufficiently liquid to allow the business to close its positions, if required, within this holding period. var's benefit is that it captures the historic correlations of a portfolio. based on the composition of our "covered positions," we also use a standardized add-on approach for the loan trading desk's specific risk capital which estimates the extent of any losses that may occur from factors other than broad market movements. in addition, for our secondary traded loans we calculate the var on the general interest rate risk embedded within the loans using a standalone model that replicates the general var methodology (the related capital is reflected on the "de minimis" line in the following section). the general var approach is expressed in terms of a confidence level over the past 500 trading days. the internal var measure (used as the basis of the main var trading limits) is a 99% confidence level with a one day holding period, meaning that a loss greater than the var is expected to occur, on average, on only one day in 100 trading days (i.e., 1% of the time). theoretically, there should be a loss event greater than var two to three times per year. the regulatory measure of var is done at a 99% confidence level with a 10-day holding period. the historical market data applied to calculate the var is updated on a ten business day lag. refer to "market risk regulatory capital" below for details of our ten-day var metrics for the quarters ended december 31, 2016 and 2015, including high, low, average and period end value-at-risk for interest rate and foreign exchange rate risks, as well as total var.

management's discussion and analysis market risk regulatory capital effective january 1, 2013, the u.s. banking regulators adopted "risk-based capital guidelines: market risk" as the regulations covering the calculation of market risk capital (the "market risk rule"). the market risk rule, commonly known as basel 2.5, substantially modified the determination of market risk-weighted assets and implemented a more risk sensitive methodology for the risk inherent in certain trading positions categorized as "covered positions." for the purposes of the market risk rule, all of our client facing trades and associated hedges needed to maintain a low risk profile to qualify as "covered positions." the internal management var measure is calculated based on the same population of trades that is utilized for regulatory var. the following table presents the results of our modeled and non-modeled measures for regulatory capital calculations:

stressed var svar is an extension of var, but uses a longer historical look back horizon that is fixed from january 3, 2005. this is done not only to identify headline risks from more volatile periods, but also to provide a counter balance to var which may be low during periods of low volatility. the holding period for profit and loss determination is ten days. svar is also a component of market risk regulatory capital. svar for us is calculated daily under its own dynamic window regime. in a dynamic window regime, values of the ten-day, 99% var are calculated over all possible 260-day periods that can be obtained from the complete historical data set. refer to "market risk regulatory capital" above for details of svar metrics, including high, low, average and period end svar for the combined portfolio.
sensitivity analysis sensitivity analysis is the measure of exposure to a single risk factor, such as a one basis point change in rates or credit spread. we conduct and monitor sensitivity on interest rates, basis spreads, foreign exchange exposures, option prices and credit spreads. whereas var is based on previous moves in market risk factors over recent periods, it may not be an accurate predictor of future market moves. sensitivity analysis complements var as it provides an indication of risk relative to each factor irrespective of historical market moves and is an effective tool in evaluating the appropriateness of hedging strategies.
stress testing conducting a stress test of a portfolio consists of running risk models with the inclusion of key variables that simulate various historical or hypothetical scenarios. for historical stress tests, profit and loss results are simulated for selected time periods corresponding to the most volatile underlying returns while hypothetical stress tests aim to consider concentration risk, illiquidity under stressed market conditions and risk arising from the bank's trading activities that may not be fully captured by its other models. hypothetical scenarios also assume that the market moves happen simultaneously and that no repositioning or hedging activity takes place to mitigate losses as events unfold. we generate stress tests of our trading positions on a daily basis. for example, we currently include a stress test that simulates a lehman-type crisis scenario by taking the worst 20-trading day peak to trough moves for the various risk factors that go into var from that period, and assumes they occurred simultaneously.

management's discussion and analysis var model review and validation market risk measurement models used are independently reviewed and subject to ongoing performance analysis by the model owner. the independent review and validation focuses on the model methodology and performance. independent review of market risk measurement models is the responsibility of citizens' model risk management and validation team. aspects covered include challenging the assumptions used, the quantitative techniques employed and the theoretical justification underpinning them and an assessment of the soundness of the required data over time. where possible, the quantitative impact of the major underlying modeling assumptions will be estimated (e.g., through developing alternative models). results of such reviews are shared with u.s. banking regulators. the market risk models may be periodically enhanced due to changes in market price levels and price action regime behavior. the market risk management and validation team will conduct internal validation before a new or changed model element is implemented and before a change is made to a market data mapping.
var backtesting backtesting is one form of validation of the var model. the market risk rule requires a comparison of our internal var measure to the actual net trading revenue (excluding fees, commissions, reserves, intra-day trading and net interest income) for each day over the preceding year (the most recent 250 business days). any observed loss in excess of the var number is taken as an exception. the level of exceptions determines the multiplication factor used to derive the var and svar-based capital requirement for regulatory reporting purposes. we perform sub-portfolio backtesting as required under the market risk rule, and as approved by our banking regulators, for interest rate and foreign exchange positions. the following graph shows our daily net trading revenue and total internal, modeled var for the quarters ended december 31, 2016, september 30, 2016, june 30, 2016 and march 31, 2016.

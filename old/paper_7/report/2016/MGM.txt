item 7.   management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations

executive overview our primary business is the ownership and operation of casino resorts, which offer gaming, hotel, convention, dining, entertainment, retail and other resort amenities. we own or invest in several of the finest casino resorts in the world and we continually reinvest in our resorts to maintain our competitive advantage. most of our revenue is cash-based, through customers wagering with cash or paying for non-gaming services with cash or credit cards. we rely heavily on the ability of our resorts to generate operating cash flow to fund capital expenditures, provide excess cash flow for future development and repay debt financings. we make significant investments in our resorts through newly remodeled hotel rooms, restaurants, entertainment and nightlife offerings, as well as other new features and amenities.
during the year ended december 31, 2016, las vegas visitor volume increased 1%, las vegas strip revpar increased 6% and las vegas strip gaming revenue increased by less than 1% compared to the prior year period according to information published by the las vegas convention and visitors authority. results of operations for our domestic resorts during 2016 benefited from an increase in operating margins resulting from increases in gaming revenue and revpar, and the results of our profit growth plan, discussed below. our rooms revenue benefited from increased visitation to the las vegas market and robust convention business at our las vegas strip resorts, which allowed us to yield higher room rates across our portfolio of resorts.
gross gaming revenues in the macau market decreased 3% in 2016 compared to 2015, and gross gaming revenues decreased 34% in 2015 compared to 2014. as a significant number of mgm macau's customers are from mainland china, we believe operating results were negatively affected by economic conditions in mainland china as well as certain policy initiatives in mainland china and macau. specifically, a continuing slowdown in china's economic growth rate, the chinese government's restrictions on travel and cross-border currency transactions, new compliance regulations for gaming promoters and gaming operators enacted by the macau government and implemented in late 2015 and in 2016 and a ban on mobile phone usage at gaming tables in an attempt to eliminate "proxy" bets have all negatively affected mgm macau's high-end customers and the gaming promoters with which we conduct our vip casino gaming operations. in addition, the chinese government's anti-corruption campaign has changed consumption patterns and affected the propensity of our clients to spend on certain areas like gaming or luxury items. the macau government also implemented a full main floor casino smoking ban in october 2014. these factors led to a continued decrease in gross gaming revenues for the macau market beginning in the second half of 2014 and lasted into 2016 primarily impacting vip casino gaming operations and, to a lesser extent, main floor operations throughout the macau market. despite concerns over the recent events and the sustainability of economic growth in china, we expect the macau market to grow on a long-term basis due to further development, penetration of the mainland china market and infrastructure improvements expected to facilitate more convenient travel to and within macau, and we believe recent trends reflect stabilization within the macau market. according to statistics published by the statistics and census service of the macau government, after several quarters of declines in visitation throughout 2015, visitor arrivals increased slightly by 1% and overnight visitors increased 10% in 2016 compared to 2015. additionally, gross gaming revenue increased year over year in each of the months from august 2016 through december 2016.
our results of operations are affected by decisions we make related to our capital allocation, our access to capital and our cost of capital. while we continue to be focused on improving our financial position, we are also dedicated to capitalizing on development opportunities. in macau, we estimate costs to develop mgm cotai will be approximately $3.3 billion, excluding development fees eliminated in consolidation, capitalized interest and land related costs. mgm cotai is a casino resort with capacity for up to 500 gaming tables and up to 1,500 slots, and featuring approximately 1,500 hotel rooms, built on an approximately 18 acre site on the cotai strip in macau. the actual number of gaming tables allocated to mgm cotai will be determined by the macau government prior to opening, and such allocation is expected to be less than our 500 gaming table capacity. mgm cotai is expected to open in the second half of 2017.
we were awarded a casino license to build and operate mgm springfield in springfield, massachusetts. mgm springfield will be developed on approximately 14 acres of land in downtown springfield. mgm's plans for the resort currently include a casino with approximately 3,000 slots and 100 table games including poker; a 250-room hotel; 100,000 square feet of retail and restaurant space; 44,000 square feet of meeting and event space; and a 3,375-space parking garage; with an expected development and construction cost of approximately $865 million, excluding capitalized interest and land-related costs. construction of mgm springfield is expected to be completed in late 2018.
in august 2015, we announced the implementation of a profit growth plan for sustained growth and margin enhancement. the profit growth plan's initiatives focused on improving business processes to leverage our scale for greater efficiency and lower costs, and to identify areas of opportunity to organically drive incremental revenue growth. the profit growth plan included a large number of initiatives to optimize operations and we continue to explore additional opportunities to drive further improvement. in june 2016,
32
we announced that we expect to achieve approximately $400 million of annualized adjusted ebitda benefit compared to our baseline, which we expect to be fully realized by the end of 2017.
formation and initial public offering of mgp on april 25, 2016, mgm growth properties llc ("mgp") completed its ipo of 57,500,000 of its class a shares representing limited liability company interests (inclusive of the full exercise by the underwriters of their option to purchase 7,500,000 class a shares) at an initial offering price of $21 per share. mgp used the proceeds from the ipo to purchase operating partnership units in mgm growth properties operating partnership lp (the "operating partnership"), to which we contributed the real estate assets associated with the mirage, mandalay bay, luxor, new york-new york, monte carlo, excalibur, the park, gold strike tunica, mgm grand detroit and beau rivage in exchange for operating partnership units in the operating partnership in connection with the ipo.
mgp is organized as an umbrella partnership reit (commonly referred to as an "upreit") structure in which substantially all of its assets are owned by, and substantially all of its businesses are conducted through the operating partnership. mgp contributed the proceeds from the ipo to the operating partnership in exchange for 26.7% of the units in the operating partnership. the general partner of the operating partnership is also a wholly-owned subsidiary of mgp. as a result, mgp controls and consolidates the operating partnership. mgp has two classes of authorized and outstanding voting common shares (collectively, the "shares"): class a shares and a single class b share. we own mgp's class b share, which does not provide its holder any rights to profits or losses or any rights to receive distributions from operations of mgp or upon liquidation or winding up of mgp. mgp's class a shareholders are entitled to one vote per share, while we, as the owner of the class b share, are entitled to an amount of votes representing a majority of the total voting power of mgp's shares so long as our and our controlled affiliates' (excluding mgp) aggregate beneficial ownership of the combined economic interests in mgp and the operating partnership does not fall below 30%. as such, we control mgp through our majority voting rights and consolidate mgp in our financial results. subsequent to our acquisition of borgata and subsequent contribution of borgata's real estate assets to mgp as discussed below, our ownership in the operating partnership, increased from 73.3% to 76.3%. as a result of the borgata transaction, mgp's ownership in the operating partnership was correspondingly reduced from 26.7% to 23.7%.
in connection with the formation of mgp, we borrowed $4.0 billion under certain bridge facilities, the proceeds of which were used to repay outstanding obligations under our prior senior credit facility and to redeem our 7.5% senior notes due 2016 and our 10% senior notes due 2016. the bridge facilities were subsequently assumed by the operating partnership pursuant to the master contribution agreement. the operating partnership repaid the bridge facilities with a combination of proceeds from certain financing transactions and the proceeds from the ipo.
acquisition of borgata hotel casino & spa on august 1, 2016, we completed the acquisition of boyd gaming corporation's ("boyd gaming") ownership interest in borgata, at which time borgata became a consolidated subsidiary of ours. accordingly, we recorded a gain of approximately $430 million as a result of the acquisition of borgata and resulting consolidation of borgata, which we previously accounted for under the equity method. see note 4 in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional information. following completion of the acquisition, mgp subsequently acquired borgata's real property from a subsidiary of ours in exchange for mgp's assumption of $545 million of indebtedness from our subsidiary and the issuance of $27.4 million operating partnership units to our subsidiary. in connection with the borgata transaction, we borrowed $545 million under certain bridge facilities, which were subsequently contributed to the operating partnership. the operating partnership repaid the bridge facilities with a combination of cash on hand and a draw down on their revolving credit facility, which it subsequently refinanced with proceeds from its offering of its 4.5% senior notes due 2026. pursuant to an amendment to the master lease, mgp leased back the real property of borgata to a subsidiary of ours and as a result, initial rent payments to mgp increased by $100 million, prorated for the remainder of the first lease year after the borgata transaction. consistent with the master lease terms, 90% of this rent is fixed and will contractually grow at 2% per year until 2022.
reportable segments we have two reportable segments: domestic resorts and mgm china. we currently own and operate 14 resorts in the united states. mgm china's operations consist of mgm macau resort and the development of mgm cotai on the cotai strip in macau. we have additional business activities including investments in unconsolidated affiliates, and certain other corporate and management operations. citycenter is our most significant unconsolidated affiliate, which we also manage for a fee. our operations that are not segregated into separate reportable segments are reported as "corporate and other" operations in our reconciliations of segment results to consolidated results.

domestic resorts. at december 31, 2016, our domestic resorts consisted of the following casino resorts:
las vegas, nevada:              bellagio, mgm grand las vegas (including the signature), mandalay bay (including delano and four seasons), the mirage, luxor, new york-new york, excalibur, monte carlo and circus circus las vegas.

other:               mgm grand detroit in detroit, michigan; beau rivage in biloxi, mississippi; gold strike tunica in tunica, mississippi; borgata in atlantic city, new jersey; and mgm national harbor in prince george's county, maryland.
over half of the net revenue from our domestic resorts is derived from non-gaming operations including hotel, food and beverage, entertainment and other non-gaming amenities. we market to different customer groups and utilize our significant convention and meeting facilities to maximize hotel occupancy and customer volumes which also leads to better labor utilization. our operating results are highly dependent on demand for our services, and the volume of customers at our resorts, which in turn affects the price we can charge for our hotel rooms and other amenities. also, we generate a significant portion of our revenue from our domestic resorts in las vegas, nevada, which exposes us to certain risks, such as increased competition from new or expanded las vegas resorts, and from the expansion of gaming in the united states generally.
key performance indicators related to gaming and hotel revenue at our domestic resorts are:
•   gaming revenue indicators: table games drop and slots handle (volume indicators); "win" or "hold" percentage, which is not fully controllable by us. our normal table games hold percentage is in the range of 19% to 23% of table games drop and our normal slots hold percentage is in the range of 8.5% to 9% of slots handle; and

•   hotel revenue indicators: hotel occupancy (a volume indicator); average daily rate ("adr," a price indicator); and revenue per available room ("revpar," a summary measure of hotel results, combining adr and occupancy rate). our calculation of adr, which is the average price of occupied rooms per day, includes the impact of complimentary rooms. complimentary room rates are determined based on an analysis of retail or "cash" rates for each customer segment and each type of room product to estimate complimentary rates which are consistent with retail rates. complimentary rates are reviewed at least annually and on an interim basis if there are significant changes in market conditions. because the mix of rooms provided on a complimentary basis, particularly to casino customers, includes a disproportionate suite component, the composite adr including complimentary rooms is slightly higher than the adr for cash rooms, reflecting the higher retail value of suites.

mgm china. subsequent to the acquisition of an additional 4.95% of the outstanding common shares of our mgm china subsidiary in september 2016, we own an approximate 56% controlling interest in mgm china, which owns mgm grand paradise, the macau company that owns and operates mgm macau and the related gaming subconcession and land concessions, and is in the process of developing mgm cotai. we believe our investment in mgm china plays an important role in extending our reach internationally and will foster future growth and profitability.
revenues at mgm macau are generated from three primary customer segments in the macau gaming market: vip casino gaming operations, main floor gaming operations, and slot machine operations. vip players play mostly in dedicated vip rooms or designated gaming areas. vip customers can be further divided into customers sourced by in-house vip programs and those sourced through gaming promoters. a significant portion of our vip volume is generated through the use of gaming promoters. gaming promoters introduce vip gaming players to mgm macau, assist these customers with travel arrangements, and extend gaming credit to these players. in exchange for their services, gaming promoters are compensated through payment of revenue-sharing arrangements or rolling chip turnover based commissions. in-house vip players also typically receive a commission based on the program in which they participate. mgm macau main floor operations primarily consist of walk-in and day trip visitors. unlike gaming promoters and in-house vip players, main floor players do not receive commissions. the profit contribution from the main floor segment exceeds the vip segment due to commission costs paid to gaming promoters. gaming revenues from the main floor segment have become an increasingly significant portion of total gaming revenues in recent years and we believe this segment represents the most potential for sustainable growth in the future.
vip gaming at mgm macau is conducted by the use of special purpose nonnegotiable gaming chips. gaming promoters purchase these nonnegotiable chips from mgm macau and in turn they sell these chips to their players. the nonnegotiable chips allow mgm macau to track the amount of wagering conducted by each gaming promoters' clients in order to determine vip gaming play. gaming promoter commissions are based on a percentage of the gross table games win or a percentage of the table games turnover they generate. they also receive a complimentary allowance based on a percentage of the table games turnover they generate, which can be applied to hotel rooms, food and beverage and other discretionary customers-related expenses. the estimated portion of the gaming promoter payments that represent amounts passed through to vip customers is recorded as a reduction of casino revenue, and the estimated portion retained by the gaming promoter for its compensation is recorded as casino expense. in-house vip commissions are based on a percentage of rolling chip turnover and are recorded as a reduction of casino revenue.
34
in addition to the key performance indicators used by our domestic resorts, mgm macau utilizes "turnover," which is the sum of nonnegotiable chip wagers won by mgm macau calculated as nonnegotiable chips purchased plus nonnegotiable chips exchanged less nonnegotiable chips returned. turnover provides a basis for measuring vip casino win percentage. win for vip gaming operations at mgm macau is typically in the range of 2.7% to 3.0% of turnover.
corporate and other. corporate and other includes our investments in unconsolidated affiliates and certain management and other operations. see note 1 and note 7 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for discussion of the company's unconsolidated affiliates.
results of operations the following discussion is based on our consolidated financial statements for the years ended december 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014.
summary operating results the following table summarizes our operating results:
year ended december 31,

net revenues                  $9,455,123                    $9,190,068                   $10,081,984
operating income (loss)               2,079,787                     (156,232   )                 1,323,538
consolidated net revenues for 2016 increased 3% compared to 2015 due primarily to the borgata transaction on august 1, 2016, the opening of mgm national harbor in december 2016 and an increase in casino revenue, rooms revenue, food and beverage revenue, and other revenue including parking fee revenue at our domestic resorts, partially offset by a decrease in casino revenue at mgm china. consolidated net revenues for 2015 decreased 9% compared to 2014 due primarily to a decrease in casino revenue at mgm china, offset by increases in casino and non-casino revenue at our domestic resorts. see "operating results - detailed segment information" below for additional information related to segment revenues.
consolidated operating income of $2.1 billion in 2016 compared to an operating loss of $156 million in 2015. operating income in 2016 benefited from $39 million of operating income from borgata subsequent to the acquisition, a $430 million gain recognized on the borgata transaction, and an increase in income from unconsolidated affiliates primarily due to a $401 million gain related to the sale of crystals at citycenter (see "operating results - income (loss) from unconsolidated affiliates" for further discussion). operating income in 2016 was also negatively affected by charges of $152 million of nv energy exit expense associated with the company's strategic decision to exit the fully bundled sales system of nv energy, which includes expense at our domestic resorts as well as our 50% share of expense recognized at citycenter, an increase in preopening expense, and an increase in corporate expense. see "operating results - details of certain charges" below for additional detail on our preopening expense. corporate expense increased to $313 million in 2016, due primarily to costs incurred to implement initiatives related to the profit growth plan of $23 million, costs associated with the initial public offering of mgp of $25 million, transaction costs incurred in connection with the borgata transaction, incremental performance-based compensation expense, and costs associated with a litigation settlement.
consolidated operating loss of $156 million in 2015 was negatively affected by an operating loss for mgm china that included a $1.5 billion non-cash impairment charge to goodwill recognized in the acquisition of a controlling interest in mgm china in 2011. in connection with that acquisition, we recorded a $3.5 billion non-cash gain. the 2015 impairment charge, which represents approximately 42% of the amount of the previously recognized gain, resulted from our annual review of our goodwill carrying values and was incurred as a result of reduced cash flow forecasts for mgm china's resorts based on market conditions at that time and lower valuation multiples for gaming assets in the macau market. in addition, the operating loss was affected by a decrease in operating results at mgm macau. the operating loss for mgm china was partially offset by an increase in operating income at our domestic resorts and an increase in income from unconsolidated affiliates, primarily from citycenter, which included $80 million related to our share of the gain recognized by citycenter as a result of the final resolution of its construction litigation and related settlements. in addition, corporate expense increased 15% to $275 million in 2015, due primarily to costs incurred to implement initiatives in relation to the profit growth plan of $24 million and $20 million in costs associated with the mgp transaction. preopening expense, primarily related to our mgm cotai, mgm springfield and mgm national harbor development projects, increased to $71 million in 2015 compared to $39 million in 2014. consolidated operating loss in 2015 was also negatively affected by impairment charges and losses on disposal of certain assets recorded in "property transactions, net." see "operating results - details of certain changes" below for additional detail related to property transactions.

in 2016, interest cost related to mgm resorts, excluding mgm china, decreased compared to 2015 primarily as a result of a decrease in the average long-term debt outstanding, and also due to a decrease in the weighted average interest rate, partially offset by an increase in amortization of debt issuance cost associated with the mgp related financing transactions in april 2016. interest cost related to mgm china increased in 2016 compared to 2015 due to an increase in the average outstanding amounts borrowed under the mgm china credit facility partially offset by a decrease in amortization of debt issuance costs. in 2015, interest cost related to mgm resorts, excluding china, decreased compared to 2014 as a result of a decrease in the average long-term debt outstanding during the year related to our senior notes. interest cost related to mgm china increased in 2015 compared to 2014 due to an increase in the average outstanding amounts borrowed under the mgm china credit facility and an increase in the amortization of debt issuance costs resulting from costs incurred associated with the refinancing of the mgm china credit facility in june 2015.

non-operating items from unconsolidated affiliates. non-operating expense from unconsolidated affiliates decreased $23 million in 2016 compared to 2015, due primarily to the acquisition of borgata on august 1, 2016, at which time the subsidiary operating borgata became a consolidated subsidiary of our company. prior to the acquisition, we held a 50% ownership interest in borgata, which was accounted for under the equity method. non-operating expense from unconsolidated affiliates decreased $11 million in 2015 compared to 2014, due primarily to a decrease in interest expense at citycenter.

our effective tax rate in 2016 was favorably impacted by income tax benefits attributable to a decrease in valuation allowance on foreign tax credit carryovers and permanent exclusion of a portion of the gain on the borgata transaction, partially offset by income tax expense attributable to the remeasurement of macau deferred tax liabilities resulting from a change in assumption concerning renewal of the exemption from the macau complementary tax on gaming profits. our effective tax rate in 2015 was unfavorably impacted by the non-cash impairment charge on mgm china goodwill for which we did not record income tax benefit. our effective tax rate decreased in 2015 compared to 2014 primarily as a result of providing greater tax benefit in 2015 than in 2014 for foreign tax credits, net of valuation allowance, partially offset by tax benefit resulting from audit settlements in 2014.

cash taxes paid increased in 2016 compared to 2015 primarily as a result of an increase in federal income taxes paid due to increased u.s. taxable income. cash taxes paid decreased in 2015 compared to 2014 primarily as a result of a $16 million refund of taxes and associated interest received in 2015 on the closure of the irs examination of citycenter, which is treated as a partnership for income tax purposes which partially offset federal income tax estimated tax payments of $23 million made during the year. the remaining $5 million of cash taxes paid in 2015 consist of state and foreign income taxes.
non-gaap measures
"adjusted ebitda" is earnings before interest and other non-operating income (expense), taxes, depreciation and amortization, preopening and start-up expenses, nv energy exit expense, gain on borgata transaction, goodwill impairment charges, and property transactions, net. "adjusted property ebitda" is adjusted ebitda before corporate expense and stock compensation expense related to both the mgm resorts and mgp stock-based compensation plans, which are not allocated to each reportable segment or operating segment, as applicable. mgm china recognizes stock compensation expense related to its stock-based compensation plan which is included in the calculation of adjusted ebitda for mgm china. "same-store adjusted property ebitda" is adjusted property ebitda related to the operating resorts which were consolidated by the company for both the entire current and prior year periods presented. adjusted ebitda and adjusted property ebitda information is presented solely as a supplemental disclosure to reported gaap measures because management believes these measures are 1) widely used measures of operating performance in the gaming and hospitality industry, and 2) a principal basis for valuation of gaming and hospitality companies. we present adjusted property ebitda on a "same-store" basis as supplemental information for investors because management believes that providing performance measures on a "same-store" basis is useful for evaluating the period-to-period performance of our domestic casino resorts.
we believe that while items excluded from adjusted ebitda, adjusted property ebitda and same-store adjusted property ebitda may be recurring in nature and should not be disregarded in evaluation of our earnings performance, it is useful to exclude such items when analyzing current results and trends compared to other periods because these items can vary significantly depending on specific underlying transactions or events that may not be comparable between the periods being presented. also, we believe excluded items may not relate specifically to current operating trends or be indicative of future results. for example, preopening and start-up expenses will be significantly different in periods when we are developing and constructing a major expansion project and will depend on where the current period lies within the development cycle, as well as the size and scope of the project(s). property transactions, net includes normal recurring disposals, gains and losses on sales of assets related to specific assets within our resorts, but also includes gains or losses on sales of an entire operating resort or a group of resorts and impairment charges on entire asset groups or investments in unconsolidated affiliates, which may not be comparable period over period. in addition, capital allocation, tax planning, financing and stock compensation awards are all managed at the corporate level. therefore, we use adjusted property ebitda and same-store adjusted property ebitda as the primary measure of domestic resorts operating performance.
adjusted ebitda, adjusted property ebitda or same-store adjusted property ebitda should not be construed as an alternative to operating income or net income, as an indicator of our performance; or as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities, as a measure of liquidity; or as any other measure determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. we have significant uses of cash flows, including capital expenditures, interest payments, taxes and debt principal repayments, which are not reflected in adjusted ebitda, adjusted property ebitda, or same-store adjusted property ebitda. also, other companies in the gaming and hospitality industries that report adjusted ebitda, adjusted property ebitda or same-store adjusted property ebitda information may calculate adjusted ebitda, adjusted property ebitda or same-store adjusted property ebitda in a different manner.

in april 2016, the operating partnership entered into a credit agreement comprised of a $300 million senior secured term loan a facility, a $1.85 billion senior secured term loan b facility, and a $600 million senior secured revolving credit facility. the term loan b facility was originally issued at 99.75% to initial leaders. the revolving credit facility and term loan a facility bear interest determined by reference to a total net leverage ratio pricing grid which results in an interest rate of libor plus 2.25% to 2.75%. on october 26, 2016 the term loan b facility was re-priced at par and bore interest at libor plus 2.75%, with a libor floor of 0.75%, which represented a 50 basis point reduction compared to the prior rate. in addition, the operating partnership received a further reduction in pricing to libor plus 2.50%, with a libor floor of 0.75%, as a result of it achieving a minimum corporate family rating of ba3/bb- in february 2017. the revolving credit facility and the term loan a facility will mature in 2021 and the term loan b facility will mature in 2023. the term loan facilities are subject to amortization of principal in equal quarterly installments, with 5.0% of the initial aggregate principal amount of the term loan a facility and 1.0% of the initial aggregate principal amount of the term loan b facility to be payable each year.
the operating partnership credit agreement contains customary representations and warranties, events of default, and positive, negative and financial covenants, including that the operating partnership maintain compliance with a maximum senior secured net debt to adjusted total assets ratio, maximum total net debt to adjusted assets ratio and a minimum interest coverage ratio. the operating partnership was in compliance with its credit agreement covenants at december 31, 2016.
mgm china and mgm grand paradise, as co-borrowers, are parties to a fourth amended and restated credit facility which consists of $1.55 billion of term loans and a $1.45 billion revolving credit facility. the interest rate on the facility fluctuates annually based on hibor plus a margin that ranges between 1.375% and 2.5% based on mgm china's leverage ratio. the credit facility matures in april 2019, with scheduled amortization payments of the term loans beginning in october 2017. the mgm china credit facility is secured by mgm grand paradise's interest in the cotai land use right, and mgm china, mgm grand paradise and their guarantor subsidiaries have granted a security interest in substantially all of their assets to secure the facility.
the mgm china credit facility contains customary representations and warranties, events of default, and positive, negative and financial covenants, including that mgm china maintains compliance with a maximum leverage ratio and a minimum interest coverage ratio. mgm china was in compliance with its credit facility covenants at december 31, 2016. in february 2017, the mgm china credit facility was amended to increase the maximum total leverage ratio to 6.00 to 1.00 through december 31, 2017, declining to 5.50 to 1.00 at march 31, 2018, 5.00 to 1.00 at june 30, 2018 and 4.50 to 1.00 at september 30, 2018 and thereafter.
in january 2016, mgm national harbor, llc entered into a credit agreement consisting of a $100 million revolving credit facility and a $425 million term loan facility. the revolving and term loan facilities bear interest at libor plus an applicable rate determined by mgm national harbor, llc's total leverage ratio (2.25% as of december 31, 2016). the term loan and revolving facilities are scheduled to mature in january 2021 and the term loan facilities are subject to scheduled amortization payments on the last day of each calendar quarter beginning the fourth full fiscal quarter following the opening date of mgm national harbor, initially in an amount equal to 1.25% of the aggregate principal balance and increasing to 1.875% and 2.50% of the aggregate principal balance on the last day of the twelfth and sixteenth full fiscal quarters, respectively.
the mgm national harbor credit agreement is secured by a leasehold mortgage on mgm national harbor and substantially all of the existing and future property of mgm national harbor. mandatory prepayments will be required upon the occurrence of certain events, including sales of certain assets, casualty events and the incurrence of certain additional indebtedness, subject to certain exceptions and reinvestment rights. in addition, to the extent mgm national harbor generates excess cash flow (as defined in the mgm national harbor credit agreement), a percentage of such excess cash flow (ranging from 0% to 50% based on a total leverage ratio) will be required to be used to prepay the term loan facilities commencing with the fiscal year ending 2017.
the mgm national harbor credit agreement contains customary representations and warranties, events of default, and positive, negative and financial covenants, including that mgm national harbor, llc and its restricted subsidiaries maintain compliance with a maximum total leverage ratio and a minimum interest coverage ratio. mgm national harbor, llc was in compliance with its credit agreement covenants at december 31, 2016.

off balance sheet arrangements our off-balance sheet arrangements consist primarily of investments in unconsolidated affiliates, which consist primarily of our investments in citycenter, grand victoria, and las vegas arena company, llc. we have not entered into any transactions with special purpose entities, nor have we engaged in any derivative transactions, other than our mgp cash flow hedges. see note 11 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional information. our unconsolidated affiliate investments allow us to realize the proportionate benefits of owning a full-scale resort or other entertainment properties in a manner that minimizes our initial investment. we guarantee the t-mobile arena credit facility as described below. in addition, there are no other provisions in the agreements with our investees which we believe are unusual or subject us to risks to which we would not be subjected if we had full ownership of the resort.
in conjunction with the las vegas arena company, llc entering into a senior secured credit facility in september 2014, we and aeg each entered into joint and several completion guarantees for the project (which were subsequently terminated in february 2017), as well as a repayment guarantee for the term loan b (which is subject to increases and decreases in the event of a rebalancing of the principal amount of indebtedness between the term loan a and term loan b facilities). as of december 31, 2016, term loan a was $150 million and term loan b was $50 million.
commitments and contractual obligations the following table summarizes our scheduled contractual obligations as of december 31, 2016:

(1)   estimated interest payments are based on principal amounts and expected maturities of debt outstanding at december 31, 2016 and management's forecasted libor rates for our senior credit facility and hibor rates for the mgm china credit facility. in december 2016, the operating partnership entered into interest rate swap agreements to mitigate the interest rate risk inherent in its senior secured term loan b facility. these interest rate swaps are designated as cash flow hedges and have a notional value of $500 million and mature on november 30, 2021. the weighted average fixed rate paid is 1.825%, and the variable rate received resets monthly to the one-month libor subject to a minimum rate of 0.75%.

(2)   the amount for 2017 includes $471 million related to mgm cotai and $39 million and $76 million related to mgm national harbor and mgm springfield, respectively.

(3)   the table above excludes our future lease obligations to a subsidiary of the operating partnership pursuant to the master lease agreement discussed in note 19 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements. we own 76.3% of the operating partnership units as of december 31, 2016. mgm national harbor is located on land subject to a long-term ground lease. see note 13 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further discussion.

(4)   approximately $12 million of liabilities related to uncertain tax positions and other tax liabilities are excluded from the table as we cannot reasonably estimate when examination and other activity related to these amounts will conclude or when these amounts will be paid, if ever.

(5)   the amount for 2017 includes $124 million related to employment agreements, $129 million for entertainment agreements and $120 million of open purchase orders. other commitments include various contracted amounts, including information technology, advertising, maintenance and other service agreements. our largest entertainment commitments consist of minimum contractual payments to cirque du soleil, which performs shows at several of our resorts. our contractual commitments for these shows generally do not exceed 12 months and are based on our ability to exercise certain termination rights; however, we expect these shows to continue for longer periods.

while we have significant indebtedness and other obligations, we believe we have the ability to meet known obligations, including principal and interest obligations as well as planned capital expenditures over the next twelve months from the balance sheet date with existing cash and cash deposits, cash flows from operations, dividends and distributions from mgm china and the
50
operating partnership, and availability under our senior credit facility, the mgm china credit facility, the operating partnership credit facility and the mgm national harbor credit facility. we have $138 million of maturities of long-term debt in 2017. see "liquidity and capital resources - other factors affecting liquidity" for further discussion of anticipated uses of cash.
critical accounting policies and estimates management's discussion and analysis of our results of operations and liquidity and capital resources are based on our consolidated financial statements. to prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america, we must make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements. we regularly evaluate these estimates and assumptions, particularly in areas we consider to be critical accounting estimates, where changes in the estimates and assumptions could have a material effect on our results of operations, financial position or cash flows. senior management and the audit committee of the board of directors have reviewed the disclosures included herein about our critical accounting estimates, and have reviewed the processes to determine those estimates. however, by their nature, judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty and therefore actual results can differ from our estimates.
allowance for doubtful casino accounts receivable marker play represents a significant portion of the table games volume at certain of our las vegas resorts. our other casinos do not emphasize marker play to the same extent, although we offer markers to customers at those casinos as well. mgm china extends credit to certain in-house vip gaming customers and gaming promoters. we maintain strict controls over the issuance of markers and aggressively pursue collection from our customers who fail to pay their marker balances timely. these collection efforts are similar to those used by most large corporations when dealing with overdue customer accounts, including the mailing of statements and delinquency notices, personal contacts, the use of outside collection agencies and civil litigation. markers are generally legally enforceable instruments in the united states and macau. at december 31, 2016 and 2015, approximately 53% and 42%, respectively, of our casino accounts receivable at our domestic resorts were owed by customers from the united states. markers are not legally enforceable instruments in some foreign countries, but the united states assets of foreign customers may be reached to satisfy judgments entered in the united states. at december 31, 2016 and 2015, approximately 35% and 37%, respectively, of our casino accounts receivable at our domestic resorts were owed by customers from the far east. we consider the likelihood and difficulty of enforceability, among other factors, when we issue credit to customers at our domestic resorts who are not residents of the united states. mgm china performs background checks and investigates the credit worthiness of gaming promoters and casino customers prior to issuing credit.
we maintain an allowance, or reserve, for doubtful casino accounts at all of our operating casino resorts. the provision for doubtful accounts, an operating expense, increases the allowance for doubtful accounts. we regularly evaluate the allowance for doubtful casino accounts. at domestic resorts where marker play is not significant, the allowance is generally established by applying standard reserve percentages to aged account balances. at domestic resorts where marker play is significant, we apply standard reserve percentages to aged account balances under a specified dollar amount and specifically analyze the collectability of each account with a balance over the specified dollar amount, based on the age of the account, the customer's financial condition, collection history and any other known information. mgm china specifically analyzes the collectability of casino receivables on an individual basis taking into account the age of the account, the financial condition and the collection history of the gaming promoter or casino customer.
in addition to enforceability issues, the collectability of unpaid markers given by foreign customers at our domestic resorts is affected by a number of factors, including changes in currency exchange rates and economic conditions in the customers' home countries. because individual customer account balances can be significant, the allowance and the provision can change significantly between periods, as information about a certain customer becomes known or as changes in a region's economy occur.
the following table shows key statistics related to our casino receivables:

percentage of casino accounts outstanding over 180 days                  21    %                   26   %
approximately $35 million and $40 million of casino receivables and $8 million and $9 million of the allowance for doubtful casino accounts receivable relate to mgm china at december 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. casino receivables increased in the
51
current year as a result of the borgata transaction and the opening of mgm national harbor. the allowance for doubtful accounts as a percentage of casino accounts receivable has decreased in the current year due to a decrease in the age of outstanding account balances. at december 31, 2016, a 100 basis-point change in the allowance for doubtful accounts as a percentage of casino accounts receivable would change income before income taxes by $3 million.
fixed asset capitalization and depreciation policies property and equipment are stated at cost. for the majority of our property and equipment, cost was determined at the acquisition date based on estimated fair values in connection with the august 2016 borgata acquisition, the june 2011 mgm china acquisition, the april 2005 mandalay acquisition and the may 2000 mirage resorts acquisition. maintenance and repairs that neither materially add to the value of the property nor appreciably prolong its life are charged to expense as incurred. depreciation and amortization are provided on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets. when we construct assets, we capitalize direct costs of the project, including fees paid to architects and contractors, property taxes, and certain costs of our design and construction subsidiaries. in addition, interest cost associated with major development and construction projects is capitalized as part of the cost of the project. interest is typically capitalized on amounts expended on the project using the weighted-average cost of our outstanding borrowings. capitalization of interest starts when construction activities begin and ceases when construction is substantially complete or development activity is suspended for more than a brief period.
we must make estimates and assumptions when accounting for capital expenditures. whether an expenditure is considered a maintenance expense or a capital asset is a matter of judgment. when constructing or purchasing assets, we must determine whether existing assets are being replaced or otherwise impaired, which also may be a matter of judgment. in addition, our depreciation expense is highly dependent on the assumptions we make about our assets' estimated useful lives. we determine the estimated useful lives based on our experience with similar assets, engineering studies, and our estimate of the usage of the asset. whenever events or circumstances occur which change the estimated useful life of an asset, we account for the change prospectively.
impairment of long-lived assets, goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets we evaluate our property and equipment and other long-lived assets for impairment based on our classification as held for sale or to be held and used. several criteria must be met before an asset is classified as held for sale, including that management with the appropriate authority commits to a plan to sell the asset at a reasonable price in relation to its fair value and is actively seeking a buyer. for assets classified as held for sale, we recognize the asset at the lower of carrying value or fair market value less costs of disposal, as estimated based on comparable asset sales, offers received, or a discounted cash flow model. for assets to be held and used, we review for impairment whenever indicators of impairment exist. we then compare the estimated future cash flows of the asset, on an undiscounted basis, to the carrying value of the asset. if the undiscounted cash flows exceed the carrying value, no impairment is indicated. if the undiscounted cash flows do not exceed the carrying value, then an impairment is recorded based on the fair value of the asset. for operating assets, fair value is typically measured using a discounted cash flow model whereby future cash flows are discounted using a weighted-average cost of capital, developed using a standard capital asset pricing model, based on guideline companies in our industry. if an asset is still under development, future cash flows include remaining construction costs. all recognized impairment losses, whether for assets to be held for sale or assets to be held and used, are recorded as operating expenses.
there are several estimates, assumptions and decisions in measuring impairments of long-lived assets. first, management must determine the usage of the asset. to the extent management decides that an asset will be sold, it is more likely that an impairment may be recognized. assets must be tested at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows exist. this means that some assets must be grouped, and management has some discretion in the grouping of assets. future cash flow estimates are, by their nature, subjective and actual results may differ materially from our estimates.
on a quarterly basis, we review our major long-lived assets to determine if events have occurred or circumstances exist that indicate a potential impairment. potential factors which could trigger an impairment include underperformance compared to historical or projected operating results, negative industry or economic factors, significant changes to our operating environment, or changes in intended use of the asset group. we estimate future cash flows using our internal budgets and probability weight cash flows in certain circumstances to consider alternative outcomes associated with recoverability of the asset group, including potential sale. historically, undiscounted cash flows of our significant operating asset groups have exceeded their carrying values by a substantial margin.
we review indefinite-lived intangible assets and goodwill at least annually and between annual test dates in certain circumstances. we perform our annual impairment test for indefinite-lived intangible assets in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year. indefinite-lived intangible assets consist primarily of license rights, which are tested for impairment using a discounted cash flow approach, and trademarks, which are tested for impairment using the relief-from-royalty method. see note 8 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further discussion of goodwill and other intangible assets.
52
goodwill represents the excess of purchase price over the fair market value of net assets acquired in business combinations. we test goodwill for relevant reporting units for impairment in the fourth quarter of each year and in interim periods if circumstances exist such that it is more likely than not that the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value. accounting guidance provides entities the option to perform a qualitative assessment of goodwill (commonly referred to as "step zero") in order to determine whether further impairment testing is necessary. in performing the step zero analysis we take into account macroeconomic conditions, industry and market considerations, current and forecasted financial performance, entity-specific events, and changes in the composition or carrying amount of net assets of reporting units. in addition, management takes into consideration the amount of excess of fair value over carrying value determined in the last quantitative analysis that was performed, as well as the period of time that has passed since the last quantitative analysis. if the step zero analysis indicates that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, further quantitative analysis is not required. if the step zero analysis indicates that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, the entity would proceed to a two-step quantitative analysis.
under the two-step quantitative analysis, goodwill for relevant reporting units is tested for impairment using a discounted cash flow analysis based on our budgeted future results discounted using a weighted average cost of capital, developed using a standard capital asset pricing model based on guideline companies in our industry, and market indicators of terminal year capitalization rates, as well as a market approach that utilizes business enterprise value multiples based on a range of multiples in our peer group. if the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, an indication of impairment exists and we must proceed to measure an impairment loss, if any. in measuring an impairment loss, the implied fair value of a reporting unit's goodwill is compared to the carrying value of that goodwill. the implied fair value of goodwill is determined by allocating the fair value of the reporting unit to its assets and liabilities and the amount remaining, if any, is the implied fair value of goodwill. if the implied fair value of goodwill is less than its carrying value then it must be written down to its implied fair value.
with the exception of our mgm china reporting unit, discussed below, none of our other reporting units incurred any goodwill impairment charges in 2016, 2015 or 2014. for our 2016 annual impairment test, we utilized the option to perform a step zero analysis for certain of our domestic resorts reporting units and concluded it was more likely than not that the fair values of such reporting units exceeded their carrying values by a substantial margin. the estimated fair values of reporting units for which we elected to forego the step zero analysis and instead utilized the two-step quantitative analysis were substantially in excess of their carrying values. as discussed below, management makes significant judgments and estimates as part of these analyses. if future operating results of our reporting units do not meet current expectations it could cause carrying values of our reporting units to exceed their fair values in future periods, potentially resulting in a goodwill impairment charge.
during the fourth quarter of 2015, we conducted our annual impairment tests of goodwill by reviewing each of our reporting units, including our mgm china reporting unit. the step one goodwill analysis of the mgm china reporting unit indicated the fair value was less than its carrying value by 4%. the decrease in fair value resulted from a decrease in forecasted cash flows based on then current market conditions and a sustained decline in the enterprise value multiples of the mgm china reporting unit as well as those of the mgm china reporting unit's peer group. as a result of the indication of impairment from the step one analysis, we proceeded to perform a step two impairment analysis to measure the impairment loss. as such, we determined the fair values of all assets of the mgm china reporting unit, including its separately identifiable intangible assets. the fair values of each of the separately identifiable intangible assets exceeded their respective carrying values by a significant amount, leading to a lower implied fair value of goodwill. therefore, we recorded a $1.5 billion non-cash impairment charge to reduce the historical carrying value of goodwill related to the mgm china reporting unit to its implied fair value in 2015.
there are several estimates inherent in evaluating these assets for impairment. in particular, future cash flow estimates are, by their nature, subjective and actual results may differ materially from our estimates. in addition, the determination of multiples, capitalization rates and the discount rates used in the impairment tests are highly judgmental and dependent in large part on expectations of future market conditions.
see note 8 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further discussion of goodwill impairment.
impairment of investments in unconsolidated affiliates we evaluate our investments in unconsolidated affiliates for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of our investment may have experienced an other-than-temporary decline in value. if such conditions exist, we compare the estimated fair value of the investment to its carrying value to determine whether an impairment is indicated and determine whether the impairment is other-than-temporary based on our assessment of relevant factors, including consideration of our intent and ability to retain our investment. we estimate fair value using a discounted cash flow analysis based on estimates of future cash flows and market indicators of discount rates and terminal year capitalization rates, as well as a market approach that utilizes business enterprise value multiples based on a range of multiples in our peer group. see note 7 and note 17 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for discussion of other-than-temporary impairment charges.
53
income taxes we recognize deferred tax assets, net of applicable reserves, related to net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards and certain temporary differences with a future tax benefit to the extent that realization of such benefit is more likely than not. otherwise, a valuation allowance is applied.
as of december 31, 2016, we have a foreign tax credit carryover of $2.8 billion against which we have recorded a valuation allowance of $2.5 billion based upon our assessment of future realization. the foreign tax credits are attributable to the macau special gaming tax which is 35% of gross gaming revenue in macau. because mgm grand paradise is presently exempt from the macau 12% complementary tax on gaming profits, we believe that payment of the macau special gaming tax qualifies as a tax paid in lieu of an income tax that is creditable against u.s. taxes.
on september 7, 2016, mgm grand paradise was granted an additional extension of the complementary tax exemption through march 31, 2020, concurrent with the end of the term of its current gaming subconcession. a competitor of mgm grand paradise subsequently received an additional extension of its exemption through march 31, 2020, which also runs concurrent with the end of the term of its current gaming concession. based upon these developments and the uncertainty concerning taxation after the concession renewal process, we have concluded that we can no longer assume that mgm grand paradise will be entitled to additional exemption periods beyond the end of the extension recently granted. thus, for all periods beyond march 31, 2020, we have assumed that mgm grand paradise will pay the macau 12% complementary tax on gaming profits and will thus not be able to credit the macau special gaming tax in such years, and have factored that assumption into our assessment of the realization of the foreign tax credit deferred tax asset and the measurement of macau deferred tax liabilities.
due to improvements in our u.s. operations, we have generated u.s. operating profits for the past eight consecutive quarters and as of june 30, 2016 we no longer had cumulative u.s. losses in recent years. consequently, during 2016 we began to rely on future u.s. source operating income in assessing future foreign tax credit realization during the 10-year foreign tax credit carryover period.
our assessment of realization of our foreign tax credit deferred tax asset is based on available evidence, including assumptions about future profitability of and distributions from mgm china and assumptions concerning future u.s. operating profits. as a result, significant judgment is required in assessing the possible need for a valuation allowance and changes to our assumptions may have a material impact on the amount of the valuation allowance. for example, a change to our forecasts of future profitability of and distributions from mgm china or a change in our assumptions concerning u.s. profitability could result in a material change in the valuation allowance with a corresponding impact on the provision for income taxes in such period. in addition, should we in a future period actually receive an additional exemption from the complementary tax, an additional valuation allowance would likely need to be provided on some portion or all of the foreign tax credit deferred tax asset, resulting in an increase in the provision for income taxes in such period and such increase may be material.
in addition, there is a $3 million valuation allowance, after federal effect, provided on certain state deferred tax assets, a valuation allowance of $71 million on certain macau deferred tax assets, and a valuation allowance of $2 million on hong kong net operating losses because we believe these assets do not meet the "more likely than not" criteria for recognition.
we file income tax returns in the u.s. federal jurisdiction, various state and local jurisdictions, and foreign jurisdictions, although the income taxes paid in foreign jurisdictions are not material. our income tax returns are subject to examination by the internal revenue service ("irs") and other tax authorities. positions taken in tax returns are sometimes subject to uncertainty in the tax laws and may not ultimately be accepted by the irs or other tax authorities. see note 12 in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the status and impact of examinations by tax authorities.
we assess our tax positions using a two-step process. a tax position is recognized if it meets a "more likely than not" threshold, and is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than fifty percent likely of being realized. uncertain tax positions must be reviewed at each balance sheet date. liabilities we record as a result of this analysis are recorded separately from any current or deferred income tax accounts, and are classified as current in "other accrued liabilities" or long-term in "other long-term liabilities" based on the time until expected payment. additionally, we recognize accrued interest and penalties, if any, related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense.
stock-based compensation we account for stock options and stock appreciation rights ("sars") measuring fair value using the black-scholes model. for restricted share units ("rsus"), compensation expense is calculated based on the fair market value of our stock on the date of grant.

we account for performance stock units ("psus") measuring fair value using the monte carlo valuation model. there are several management assumptions required to determine the inputs into the black-scholes model and monte carlo valuation model. our volatility and expected term assumptions used in the black-scholes model can significantly affect the fair value of stock options and sars. the monte carlo valuation model also utilizes multiple assumptions, including volatility, to determine the fair value of the award. changes in the subjective assumptions can materially affect the estimate of the fair value of share-based compensation and consequently, the related amount recognized in the consolidated financial statements. the extent of the impact will depend, in part, on the extent of awards in any given year.
market risk in addition to the inherent risks associated with our normal operations, we are also exposed to additional market risks. market risk is the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices, such as interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. our primary exposure to market risk is interest rate risk associated with our variable rate long-term debt. we attempt to limit our exposure to interest rate risk by managing the mix of our long-term fixed rate borrowings and short-term borrowings under our bank credit facilities. a change in interest rates generally does not have an impact upon our future earnings and cash flow for fixed-rate debt instruments. as fixed-rate debt matures, however, and if additional debt is acquired to fund the debt repayment, future earnings and cash flow may be affected by changes in interest rates. this effect would be realized in the periods subsequent to the periods when the debt matures. we do not hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes and do not enter into derivative transactions that would be considered speculative positions.
in december 2016, the operating partnership entered into interest rate swap agreements to mitigate the interest rate risk inherent in its senior secured term loan b facility. these interest rate swaps are designated as cash flow hedges and have a notional value of $500 million and mature on november 30, 2021. the weighted average fixed rate paid is 1.825%, and the variable rate received resets monthly to the one-month libor subject to a minimum rate of 0.75%. in january 2017, the operating partnership entered into additional interest rate swap agreements through november 2021 with a total $700 million notional amount to pay a fixed rate of 1.964% and receive the 1-month libor rate in order to mitigate the interest rate risk inherent in its senior secured term loan b facility. the company does not currently have any master netting arrangements related to its derivative contracts. see note 11 for additional information.
as of december 31, 2016, variable rate borrowings represented approximately 32% of our total borrowings after giving effect to the $500 million notional amount operating partnership interest rate swaps discussed above. assuming a 100 basis-point increase in libor (in the case of the mgp term loan b facility, over the 0.75% floor specified in the operating partnership credit facility and after giving effect to the $500 million notional amount operating partnership interest rate swaps discussed above), our annual interest cost would increase by $23 million based on gross amounts outstanding at december 31, 2016. assuming a 100 basis-point increase in hibor for the mgm china credit facility, our annual interest cost would increase by $19 million based on amounts outstanding at december 31, 2016. the following table provides additional information about our gross long-term debt subject to changes in interest rates excluding the effect of the operating partnership interest rate swaps discussed above:

in addition to the risk associated with our variable interest rate debt, we are also exposed to risks related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates, mainly related to mgm china and to our operations at mgm macau and the development of mgm cotai. while recent fluctuations in exchange rates have not been significant, potential changes in policy by governments or fluctuations in the economies of the united states, china, macau or hong kong could cause variability in these exchange rates. we cannot assure you that the hong kong dollar will continue to be pegged to the u.s. dollar or the current peg rate for the hong kong dollar will remain at the same level. the possible changes to the peg of the hong kong dollar may result in severe fluctuations in the exchange rate thereof. as of december 31, 2016, a 1% increase in the hong kong dollar (the functional currency of mgm china) to the u.s. dollar exchange rate would impact the carrying value of our cash balance by $4 million and a 1% decrease in the exchange rate would impact the carrying value of our debt balance by $20 million.

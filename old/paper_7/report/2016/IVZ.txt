item 7.  management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations executive overview the following executive overview summarizes the significant trends affecting our results of operations and financial condition for the periods presented. this overview and the remainder of this management's discussion and analysis supplements and should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements of invesco ltd. and its subsidiaries (collectively, the "company" or "invesco") and the notes thereto contained elsewhere in this annual report on form 10-k.
global financial markets in 2016 were characterized by high levels of volatility and impacted by a number of geopolitical events that drove investor sentiment and changes in foreign currency exchange rates. equity markets began 2016 in sharp decline amidst
29
renewed concerns about the prospects for future global growth and declining commodity prices. after a rebound in the second quarter, the surprise result of the late-june u.k. referendum to leave the european union increased uncertainty and volatility in the markets and resulted in significant short-term declines in global indices and a steep decline in the pound sterling exchange rate relative to the u.s. dollar. a subsequent second-half rally drove indices to record levels late in the year as the results of the u.s. presidential election and outlook on federal reserve monetary policy positively impacted market sentiment and investor's outlook for earnings growth. the divergent global central bank policies saw the u.s. federal reserve increasing rates in contrast to accommodative monetary policy outside the u.s. these actions in conjunction with investor's views of the u.s. dollar as a safe haven in volatile markets drove u.s. dollar gains against all major currencies during 2016.
speculation of the potential for reduced regulation and corporate tax rates following the u.s. election along with signs from the federal reserve of a strengthening u.s. economy drove u.s. indices to all-time highs with the s&p 500 index finishing up 9.5% for 2016. despite the sharp mid-year decline following the results of the u.k. referendum, positive economic indicators drove european markets higher with the ftse 100 finishing the year up 14.4% in local currency. a decline in the pound sterling/u.s. dollar exchange rate offset the ftse 100 gains, causing the return to be down 4.1% for the year on an as-converted to u.s. dollars basis. ongoing favorable monetary policy by the japanese government and central bank and adoption of a negative interest rate policy weighed on markets early in the year but saw markets rebound in the second half on a more positive growth outlook for domestic exporters on the strength of the u.s. currency, driving the nikkei higher to finish the year up 0.4% in local currency terms.
bond markets were likewise volatile during 2016 with the barclay's u.s. aggregate bond index finishing up 2.7%. gains early in the year from investors moving to the relative safety of bonds were reversed as the results from the u.s. presidential election drove expectations for future inflation, growth and increased interest rates.

the company's 2016 financial results were significantly negatively impacted by the appreciation of the u.s. dollar, as discussed in the "foreign exchange impact on balance sheet, assets under management and results of operations" section and the "results of operations for the years ended december 31, 2016 compared to december 31, 2015 compared to december 31, 2014" section below.
throughout 2016, we continued to execute on our long-term strategic objectives, which further improved our ability to serve clients, strengthened our investment performance and helped us deliver competitive levels of operating income and margins, despite volatile financial markets. we also took advantage of opportunities in the market and invested in our products and capabilities, our global platform and our people in ways that strengthened our business and further differentiated us in the marketplace to help ensure our long-term success.
in addition, we benefited from our long-term efforts to ensure a diversified base of assets under management. one of invesco's core strengths, and a key differentiator for the company within the industry, is our broad diversification across client domiciles, asset classes and distribution channels. our geographical diversification allows us to recognize growth opportunities in various markets in different parts of the world. this broad diversification mitigates the impact on invesco of different market cycles.
as of the filing of this report, invesco held credit ratings of a/stable, a2/stable and a-/positive from standard & poor's ratings service ("s&p"), moody's investor services ("moody's") and fitch ratings ("fitch"), respectively.

one of the company's strategic objectives is to harness the power of our global platform by improving effectiveness and efficiency by allocating our resources to the opportunities that will best benefit clients and our business. consistent with this objective, business optimization charges of $49.9 million were recorded in 2016, including $26.4 million of staff severance costs recorded in employee compensation associated with a business transformation initiative. this is a continuation of efforts to transform several key business support functions to become more effective and efficient by leveraging shared service centers, outsourcing, automation of key processes and optimization of the company's office footprint. incremental implementation costs in 2017 are estimated to be up to $30 million and the initiative is expected to generate ongoing cost savings that will more than fully offset the implementation expense within a three year time frame after completion. during 2016, the company purchased the remaining 51% of invesco asset management (india) private limited (formerly our joint venture, religare invesco asset management company), increasing our interest to 100%, replacing the equity method investment with a fully consolidated subsidiary, and also purchased jemstep. the business optimization savings have helped offset acquisition-related increases in operating expenses.
during 2015, the company acquired deutsche bank's u.s. commodity u.s. etf business for a purchase price composed of contingent consideration payable in future periods. during 2016, changes in the fair value of the contingent consideration liability generated a loss of $7.4 million, which was recorded in other gains and losses, net.
the investment management industry is subject to extensive levels of ongoing regulatory oversight and examination. in the u.s., u.k., and other jurisdictions in which the company operates, governmental authorities regularly make inquiries, conduct investigations and administer examinations with respect to compliance with applicable laws and regulations.
presentation of management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations -- impact of consolidated investment products the company provides investment management services to, and has transactions with, various private equity, real estate, fund-of-funds, collateralized loan obligation products (clos), and other investment entities sponsored by the company for the investment of client assets in the normal course of business. the company serves as the investment manager, making day-to-day investment decisions concerning the assets of the products. the company is required to consolidate certain managed funds from time-to-time, as discussed more fully in item 8, financial statements and supplementary data, note 1 -- "accounting policies -- basis of accounting and consolidation."
investment products that are consolidated are referred to in this report as either consolidated sponsored investment products (csip) or consolidated investment products (cip). the majority of the company's cip balances are clo-related. the collateral assets of the clos are held solely to satisfy the obligations of the clos. the company has no right to the benefits from, nor does it bear the risks associated with, the collateral assets held by the clos, beyond the company's direct investments in, and management and performance fees generated from, the clos. if the company were to liquidate, the collateral assets would not be available to the general creditors of the company, and as a result, the company does not consider them to be company assets. likewise, the investors in the clos have no recourse to the general credit of the company for the notes issued by the clos. the company therefore does not consider this debt to be a company liability.
the impact of cip is so significant to the presentation of the company's consolidated financial statements that the company has elected to deconsolidate these products in its non-gaap disclosures. this management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contains four distinct sections, which follow after the assets under management discussion:
•   results of operations (years ended december 31, 2016 compared to december 31, 2015 compared to december 31, 2014);
•   schedule of non-gaap information;
•   balance sheet discussion; and
•   liquidity and capital resources.
to assess the impact of cip on the company's results of operations and balance sheet discussion, refer to part ii, item 8, financial statements, note 20, "consolidated investment products." the impact is illustrated by a column which shows the dollar-value change in the consolidated figures caused by the consolidation of cip. for example, the impact of cip on operating revenues for the year ended december 31, 2016 was a reduction of $22.3 million. this indicates that their consolidation reduced consolidated revenues by this amount, reflecting the elimination upon their consolidation of the operating revenues earned by invesco for managing these investment products.
wherever a non-gaap measure is referenced, a disclosure will follow in the narrative or in the note referring the reader to the schedule of non-gaap information, where additional details regarding the use of the non-gaap measure by the company are disclosed, along with reconciliations of the most directly comparable u.s. gaap measures to the non-gaap measures. to further

assets under management the following presentation and discussion of aum includes passive and active aum. passive aum includes etfs, uits, leveraged fund balances upon which we do not earn a fee, and other passive mandates. active aum are total aum less passive aum.
the aum tables and the discussion below refer to aum as long-term. long-term aum excludes institutional money market and invesco powershares qqq aum. long-term inflows and the underlying reasons for the movements in this line item include investments from new clients, existing clients adding new accounts/funds or contributions/subscriptions into existing accounts/funds, and new funding commitments into private equity funds. long-term outflows reflect client redemptions from accounts/funds and include the return of invested capital on the maturity or liquidation of private equity funds. we present net flows into institutional money market funds separately because shareholders of those funds typically use them as short-term funding vehicles and because their flows are particularly sensitive to short-term interest rate movements. the net flows in invesco powershares qqq aum can also be relatively short-term in nature and, due to the relatively low revenue yield, these can have a significant impact on overall net revenue yield.
changes in aum were as follows:

(1)   gross revenue yield on aum is equal to annualized total operating revenues divided by average aum, excluding joint venture (jv) aum. our share of the average aum in 2016 for our jvs in china was $9.2 billion (2015: $6.1 billion, 2014: $4.9 billion). it is appropriate to exclude the average aum of our jvs for purposes of computing gross revenue yield on aum, because the revenues resulting from these aum are not presented in our operating revenues. under u.s. gaap, our share of the net income of the jvs is recorded as equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates on our consolidated statements of income. additionally, the numerator of the gross revenue yield measure, operating revenues, excludes the management fees earned from cip; however, the denominator of the measure includes the aum of these investment products. therefore, management does not consider the gross revenue yield measure to be representative of the company's true effective fee rate from aum.
(2)   net revenue yield on aum is equal to annualized net revenues divided by average aum. see "schedule of non-gaap information" for a reconciliation of operating revenues to net revenues.

flows there are numerous drivers of aum inflows and outflows, including individual investor decisions to change investment preferences, fiduciaries and other gatekeepers making broad asset allocation decisions on behalf of their clients and reallocation of investments within portfolios. we are not a party to these asset allocation decisions, as the company does not generally have access to the underlying investor's decision-making process, including their risk appetite or liquidity needs. therefore, the company is not in a position to provide meaningful information regarding the drivers of inflows and outflows.
aum at december 31, 2016 were $812.9 billion (december 31, 2015: $775.6 billion; december 31, 2014: $792.4 billion). during the year ended december 31, 2016, long-term net inflows and net inflows of institutional money market funds increased aum by $12.7 billion and $12.8 billion, respectively, offset by net outflows of the invesco powershares qqq fund of $2.6 billion. during the year ended december 31, 2015, long-term net inflows increased aum by $16.2 billion, offset by net outflows in institutional money market funds of $11.9 billion and the invesco powershares qqq fund of $1.8 billion. during the year ended december 31, 2014, long-term net inflows increased aum by $8.1 billion, offset by net outflows in institutional money market funds of $5.8 billion and the invesco powershares qqq fund of $10.7 billion.
net inflows during the year ended december 31, 2016 include long-term net active inflows of $6.9 billion and inflows of passive aum of $5.8 billion. long-term net inflows were split between our institutional distribution channel of $11.0 billion and our retail distribution channel of $1.7 billion. by asset class, long-term net flows were positive for the fixed income and alternatives classes, and were negative for the equity and balanced asset classes. long-term net inflows included $15.5 billion and $2.1 billion from clients domiciled in asia and the u.s., respectively, offset by long-term net outflows of $3.3 billion, $1.1 billion, and $0.5 billion from clients domiciled in continental europe, canada and the u.k., respectively.
net inflows during the year ended december 31, 2015 included long-term net inflows of active aum of $14.1 billion and passive aum of $2.1 billion. net flows in 2015 were split between net inflows of $13.4 billion into our institutional distribution channel and $2.8 billion into our retail distribution channel. 2015 long-term net flows were positive for the fixed income, alternatives and balanced classes, and were negative for the equity asset classes. long-term net inflows included $8.3 billion, $5.7 billion, $1.8 billion and $0.9 billion from clients domiciled in continental europe, asia, the u.s. and the u.k., respectively. these inflows were offset by long-term outflows of $0.5 billion from clients domiciled in canada.
net inflows during the year ended december 31, 2014 included long-term net inflows of passive aum inflows of $6.0 billion and active aum of $2.1 billion. net flows in 2014 were split between net inflows of $5.0 billion into our retail distribution channel and $3.1 billion into our institutional distribution channel.
average aum during the year ended december 31, 2016 were $788.8 billion, compared to $794.7 billion for the year ended december 31, 2015 and $790.3 billion for the year ended december 31, 2014.
market returns market gains and losses/reinvestment of aum includes the net change in aum resulting from changes in market values of the underlying securities from period to period and reinvestment of client dividends. as discussed in the "executive overview" section of this management's discussion and analysis, 2016 markets were characterized by high levels of volatility throughout the year. on a year-to-date basis, the u.s. market finished strong, as did the u.k. market and the emerging markets (in their local currencies). see below for a discussion of the impact of foreign exchange rates on aum.
during the year ended december 31, 2016, positive market movement increased aum by $37.7 billion, with gains in each asset asset class. during the year ended december 31, 2015, negative market movement decreased aum by $2.6 billion, with declines in the alternatives, fixed income and balanced asset classes, partially offset by gains in the equity asset class. during the year ended december 31, 2014, market gains increased aum by $34.7 billion and included gains in our equity asset class of $26.0 billion.
foreign exchange rates during the year ended december 31, 2016, we experienced decreases in aum of $22.1 billion due to changes in foreign exchange rates. during the year ended december 31, 2015, aum decreased by $16.0 billion due to foreign exchange rate changes. during the year ended december 31, 2014, we experienced decreases in aum of $12.6 billion due to changes in foreign exchange rates. see the company's disclosures regarding the changes in foreign exchange rates in the "foreign exchange impact on balance sheet, assets under management and results of operations" section above for additional information regarding the movement of foreign exchange rates.

acquisitions and dispositions during the year ended december 31, 2016, dispositions of $2.7 billion related to the deconsolidation of certain securitization trusts by invesco mortgage capital inc. (ivr) and other aum dispositions were partially offset by the acquisition of the controlling interest of invesco asset management (india) private limited which added $2.4 billion to aum. for the year ended december 31, 2015, dispositions resulted in a $0.7 billion decrease in aum representing exchange traded notes that did not transfer over as part of the agreement with deutsche bank to transition the investment management of the powershares db suite of commodity exchange traded funds to invesco. for the year ended december 31, 2014, there were no acquisitions or dispositions.
revenue yield gross revenue yield on aum decreased 4.3 basis points to 60.7 basis points in the year ended december 31, 2016 from the year ended december 31, 2015 level of 65.0 basis points (december 31, 2014: 65.5 basis points). management does not consider gross revenue yield, the most comparable u.s. gaap-based measure to net revenue yield, to be a meaningful effective fee rate measure for the reasons outlined in footnote 1 to the changes in aum table above. see "schedule of non-gaap information" for a reconciliation of operating revenues (gross revenues) to net revenues.
net revenue yield on aum decreased 2.8 basis points to 43.0 basis points in the year ended december 31, 2016 from the year ended december 31, 2015 level of 45.8 basis points (december 31, 2014: 45.7 basis points). excluding performance fees, the net revenue yield decreased 2.2 basis points to 42.4 basis points in the year ended december 31, 2016 from the year ended december 31, 2015 level of 44.6 basis points (december 31, 2014: 44.8 basis points).
changes in our aum mix can significantly impact our net revenue yield. for example, on an asset class basis, our equity, alternative, and balanced aum generally earn a higher net revenue rate than money market and fixed income aum. the combination of average equity, average alternative and average balanced aum decreased to 65.7% of total average aum in 2016 from 67.7% in 2015. this asset class mix correlates with the decline in net revenue yield in 2016 when compared to 2015.
additionally, as a significant proportion of our aum is based outside of the u.s., changes in foreign exchange rates result in a change to the mix of u.s. dollar denominated aum with aum denominated in other currencies. as fee rates differ across geographic locations, changes to exchange rates have an impact on the net revenue yields. the strengthening of the u.s. dollar against the pound sterling during the year ended december 31, 2016 when compared to the prior year resulted in a reduction in the net revenue yield as it reduced the weighting of higher fee earning aum attributable to the u.k. products.
the tables that follow present aum by total aum and passive aum. passive aum generally earn a lower effective fee rate than active asset classes. at december 31, 2016, passive aum were $144.4 billion, representing 17.8% of total aum at that date; whereas at december 31, 2015, passive aum were $139.1 billion, representing 17.9% of our total aum at that date. the increase in passive aum during 2016 is driven by long-term net inflows and market gains, and is partially offset by outflows from the invesco powershares qqq fund and dispositions. the invesco powershares qqq fund aum decreased to $42.0 billion at december 31, 2016 compared to $42.9 billion at december 31, 2015 ($40.7 billion at december 31, 2014). the revenue yield for invesco on this product is less than 1 basis point, reimbursing invesco for the portfolio trading and marketing services provided to the fund. in the year ended december 31, 2016, the net revenue yield on passive aum was 15.3 basis points compared to 14.5 basis points in the year ended december 31, 2015, an increase of 0.8 basis points, due to changes in mix of passive aum.

*   net revenues are operating revenues less third-party distribution, service and advisory expenses, plus our proportional share of net revenues from joint venture arrangements, plus management and performance fees earned from, less other revenues recorded by, cip, plus other reconciling items. see "schedule of non-gaap information" for additional important disclosures regarding the use of net revenues.
operating revenues decreased by 7.6% in the year ended december 31, 2016 to $4,734.4 million (year ended december 31, 2015: $5,122.9 million). net revenues decreased by 6.9% in the year ended december 31, 2016 to $3,393.2 million (year ended december 31, 2015: $3,643.2 million). operating revenues decreased by 0.5% in the year ended december 31, 2015 to $5,122.9 million (year ended december 31, 2014: $5,147.1 million). net revenues increased by 1.0% in the year ended december 31, 2015 to $3,643.2 million (year ended december 31, 2014: $3,608.3 million).
the impact of foreign exchange rate movements decreased operating revenues by $136.8 million, equivalent to 2.9% of total operating revenues, during the year ended december 31, 2016 when compared to the year ended december 31, 2015 ($219.1 million decrease in 2015 as compared to 2014, or 4.3% of 2015 total operating revenues).
additionally, our revenues are directly influenced by the level and composition of our aum. therefore, movements in global capital market levels, net new business inflows (or outflows) and changes in the mix of investment products between asset classes and geographies may materially affect our revenues from period to period. market movements are discussed in the "executive overview" section of this management's discussion and analysis. during 2016 foreign exchange rate changes and volatile markets throughout the year combined for a 0.7% decrease in average aum when compared to 2015, while ending aum is higher by 4.8%.
see item 8., financial statements and supplementary data, note 1, "accounting policies -- revenue recognition" for more information regarding the components of each operating revenue category as well as third party distribution, service and advisory expenses.
investment management fees investment management fees decreased by $288.0 million (7.1%) in the year ended december 31, 2016, to $3,773.1 million (year ended december 31, 2015: $4,061.1 million). this compares to a 0.7% decrease in average aum. the impact of foreign
44
exchange rate movements decreased investment management fees by $133.9 million during the year ended december 31, 2016 as compared to the year ended december 31, 2015. the strengthening of the u.s. dollar against the pound sterling and euro has reduced the weighting of higher fee earning aum attributable to the u.k. and continental european products in 2016 when compared to 2015. in addition to foreign exchange rate movements, the change in product mix of aum results in changes in the average revenue yield derived from aum due to differing fee rates and structures, which impacts our management fees. after allowing for foreign exchange movements, investment management fees decreased by $154.1 million.
investment management fees increased by $7.0 million (0.2%) in the year ended december 31, 2015, to $4,061.1 million (year ended december 31, 2014: $4,054.1 million). the increase compares to a 0.6% increase in average aum and a 2.3% increase in average long-term aum. the impact of foreign exchange rate movements decreased investment management fees by $208.7 million during the year ended december 31, 2015 as compared to the year ended december 31, 2014. consistent with above, foreign exchange movements had a significant impact on 2015. this reduced yield due to the foreign currency mix of aum was offset by the transition during 2014 of our u.k business to a single fund management fee (fmf). this transition increased investment management fees and decreased service and distribution fees in 2015 as compared to 2014 by $29.0 million.
see the company's disclosures regarding the changes in aum and revenue yields during the years ended december 31, 2016, december 31, 2015 and december 31, 2014 in the "assets under management" section above for additional information regarding the movements in aum.
service and distribution fees in the year ended december 31, 2016, service and distribution fees decreased by $31.8 million (3.7%) to $823.6 million (year ended december 31, 2015: $855.4 million). the impact of foreign exchange rate movements decreased service and distribution fees by $1.0 million during the year ended december 31, 2016. after allowing for foreign exchange rate changes, the decrease in service and distribution fees was $30.8 million. the decrease in service and distribution fees during 2016 is due to decreases in administration fees of $16.3 million, distribution and redemption fees of $5.9 million, transfer agency fees of $8.0 million and service and custodial fees of $0.7 million. the decrease relates to decreases in aum that earn these fees.
in the year ended december 31, 2015, service and distribution fees decreased by $37.7 million (4.2%) to $855.4 million (year ended december 31, 2014: $893.1 million). the impact of foreign exchange rate movements decreased service and distribution fees by $4.5 million during the year ended december 31, 2015. after allowing for foreign exchange rate changes, the decrease in service and distribution fees was $33.2 million. the decrease was due primarily to decreases in administration fees of $19.2 million, distribution and redemption fees of $10.4 million and transfer agency fees of $3.6 million. these amounts include the impact of a full year of the single fmf in the u.k, which was effective beginning april 2014.
performance fees in the year ended december 31, 2016, performance fees decreased by $41.6 million (48.4%) to $44.3 million (year ended december 31, 2015: $85.9 million). foreign exchange movements decreased performance fees by $2.0 million in 2016 as compared to 2015. after allowing for foreign exchange movements, performance fees decreased by $39.6 million. the performance fees generated in 2016 arose primarily due to products managed by the following investment teams: u.k. investment teams ($17.6 million), u.s. bank loans ($8.4 million), global asset allocation ($6.7 million), direct real estate europe ($5.4 million) and quantitative strategies ($3.7 million). of our $812.9 billion in aum at december 31, 2016, approximately $45.8 billion or 5.6%, could potentially earn performance fees.
in the year ended december 31, 2015, performance fees increased by $24.8 million (40.6%) to $85.9 million (year ended december 31, 2014: $61.1 million). the performance fees generated in 2015 arose primarily due to products managed by the following investment teams: direct real estate ($51.0 million), u.k. equities ($25.4 million), asia pacific teams ($1.5 million), and global quantitative equity team ($5.6 million).
the performance fees generated in 2014 arose primarily due to products managed by the following investment teams: u.k. equities ($35.6 million), direct real estate ($9.8 million), asset allocation ($3.2 million), asia pacific teams ($3.1 million), and the global quantitative equity team ($2.9 million).
other revenues in the year ended december 31, 2016, other revenues decreased by $27.1 million (22.5%) to $93.4 million (year ended december 31, 2015: $120.5 million). the impact of foreign exchange rate movements increased other revenues $0.1 million during
45
the year ended december 31, 2016 as compared to the year ended december 31, 2015. after allowing for foreign exchange rate changes, the decrease in other revenues was $27.2 million. the decrease in other revenues includes decreases in mutual fund front end fees of $13.2 million, uit revenues of $12.7 million, other revenues and transaction fees of $1.3 million during the year ended december 31, 2016 compared to the year ended december 31, 2015. uit revenues declined due to decrease in net flows of short-term equity uits due to uncertainty surrounding the impact of the new fiduciary rules from the u. s. department of labor.
in the year ended december 31, 2015, other revenues decreased by $18.3 million (13.2%) to $120.5 million (year ended december 31, 2014: $138.8 million). the impact of foreign exchange rate movements decreased other revenues by $2.8 million during the year ended december 31, 2015 as compared to the year ended december 31, 2014. after allowing for foreign exchange rate changes, the decrease in other revenues was $15.5 million. the decrease in other revenues includes decreases in real estate acquisition and disposition fees of $5.5 million, mutual funds front end fees of $3.7 million, uit revenues of $1.7 million and other revenues of $4.6 million during the year ended december 31, 2015 as compared to the year ended december 31, 2014.
third-party distribution, service and advisory expenses third-party distribution, service and advisory expenses decreased by $172.7 million (10.9%) in the year ended december 31, 2016 to $1,407.2 million (year ended december 31, 2015: $1,579.9 million). the impact of foreign exchange rate movements decreased third-party distribution, service and advisory expenses by $29.6 million during the year ended december 31, 2016 as compared to the year ended december 31, 2015. after allowing for foreign exchange rate changes, third-party distribution, service and advisory expenses decreased by $143.1 million. the decrease includes decreases in rebates of $100.0 million, renewal commissions of $32.6 million, service fees of $15.4 million, front end commissions of $7.2 million, and other expenses of $2.6 million. these decreases include the continued impact of the fmf introduced in 2014 in the u.k., as investors move into share classes that do not pay distribution fees. the decreases are partially offset by an increase in asset and sales based fees of $13.1 million.
third-party distribution, service and advisory expenses decreased by $50.8 million (3.1%) in the year ended december 31, 2015 to $1,579.9 million (year ended december 31, 2014: $1,630.7 million). the impact of foreign exchange rate movements decreased third-party distribution, service and advisory expenses by $52.4 million during the year ended december 31, 2015 as compared to the year ended december 31, 2014. after allowing for foreign exchange rate changes, third-party distribution, service and advisory expenses increased by $1.6 million. such increase includes increases in renewal commissions of $28.0 million, unitary fees of $18.8 million, asset and sales based fees of $12.3 million and other expenses of $3.4 million. these increases are offset by decreases in rebates of $54.9 million, service fees of $3.9 million and front end commissions of $2.1 million.
proportional share of revenues, net of third-party distribution expenses, from joint venture investments management believes that the addition of our proportional share of revenues, net of third-party distribution expenses, from joint venture arrangements should be added to operating revenues to arrive at net revenues, as it is important to evaluate the contribution to the business that our joint venture arrangements are making. see "schedule of non-gaap information" for additional disclosures regarding the use of net revenues. the company's most significant joint venture arrangement is our 49% investment in invesco great wall fund management company limited (the "invesco great wall" joint venture).
our proportional share of revenues, net of third-party distribution expenses, from joint venture investments decreased by $17.3 million (28.4%) to $43.7 million for the year ended december 31, 2016 (year ended december 31, 2015: $61.0 million). our share of the invesco great wall joint venture's average aum for the year ended december 31, 2016 was $9.2 billion compared to $6.1 billion for the year ended december 31, 2015. although average aum has increased in the period, changes in the mix of these aum from higher fee-based equity aum into lower fee-based fixed income and other aum have resulted in a decrease in our proportional share of revenues.
our proportional share of revenues, net of third-party distribution expenses, from joint venture investments increased by $4.3 million (7.6%) to $61.0 million for the year ended december 31, 2015 (year ended december 31, 2014: $56.7 million). the increase moved in line with our share of the invesco great wall joint venture's average aum for the year ended december 31, 2015, which was $6.1 billion, compared to $4.9 billion at the year ended december 31, 2014.

management, performance and other fees earned from cip management believes that the consolidation of investment products may impact a reader's analysis of our underlying results of operations and could result in investor confusion or the production of information about the company by analysts or external credit rating agencies that is not reflective of the underlying results of operations and financial condition of the company. accordingly, management believes that it is appropriate to adjust operating revenues for the impact of cip in calculating net revenues. as management and performance fees earned by invesco from the consolidated products are eliminated upon consolidation of the investment products, management believes that it is appropriate to add these operating revenues back in the calculation of net revenues. see "schedule of non-gaap information" for additional disclosures regarding the use of net revenues.
management and performance fees earned from cip decreased by $16.9 million to $22.3 million in the year ended december 31, 2016 (year ended december 31, 2015: $39.2 million). the decrease is primarily due to the adoption of asu 2015-02, which resulted in the deconsolidation of certain vies (see note 1, "accounting policies," for the impact upon adoption), partially offset by the impact of newly consolidated funds, and decreased performance fees earned from cip in the period.
management and performance fees earned from cip increased by $3.4 million to $39.2 million in the year ended december 31, 2015 (year ended december 31, 2014: $35.8 million). the increase is due primarily to the impact of newly consolidated funds partially offset by note paydowns and funds that were liquidated.
operating expenses the main categories of operating expenses, and the dollar and percentage changes between periods, are as follows:

in the year ended december 31, 2015, interest and dividend income of cip increased by $46.5 million (22.5%) to $253.0 million (year ended december 31, 2014: $206.5 million). interest expense of cip increased by $55.0 million (41.1%) to $188.9 million (year ended december 31, 2014: $133.9 million). the increase in interest income and interest expense of cip in the 2015 period is due primarily to the impact of consolidation of clo notes issued, exceeding the impact of deconsolidation and paydowns of clo notes.
included in other gains/(losses) of cip, net, are realized and unrealized gains and losses on the underlying investments and debt of cip. in the year ended december 31, 2016, other gains and losses of cip were a net gain of $7.4 million, as compared to a net loss of $37.0 million in the year ended december 31, 2015. the net gains during during 2016 were attributable to market-driven changes in valuation of investments held by consolidated funds. in the year ended december 31, 2015, other gains and losses of cip were a net loss of $37.0 million, as compared to a net gain of $20.4 million in the year ended december 31, 2014.
in the year ended december 31, 2015 other income / (expense) of csip, net totaled $11.7 million and consists of $12.5 million of interest and dividend income and other net losses of $0.8 million. the decrease in other income/(expense) of csip during 2015 is primarily attributable to the net realized and unrealized losses on the underlying investments during the year.
net impact of cip and related noncontrolling interests in consolidated entities cip are taxed at the investor level and not at the product entity level; therefore, there is no tax provision reflected in the net impact of cip. the net impact to net income attributable to invesco ltd in each period primarily represents the changes in the value of the company's holding in its consolidated clos, which is reclassified into other gains/(losses) from accumulated other comprehensive income upon consolidation. the consolidation of investment products during the year ended december 31, 2016 resulted in an increase to net income attributable to invesco ltd of $3.0 million (year ended december 31, 2015: $40.4 million net decrease). the consolidation of investment products during the year ended december 31, 2014 resulted in an increase to net income attributable to invesco ltd of $7.8 million.
noncontrolling interests in consolidated entities represent the profit or loss amounts attributed to third party investors in cip. the impact of any gains or losses resulting from valuation changes in the investments of non-clo cip attributable to the interests of third parties are offset by resulting changes in gains and losses attributable to noncontrolling interests in consolidated entities and therefore do not have a material effect on the financial condition, operating results (including earnings per share), liquidity or capital resources of the company's common shareholders. similarly, any gains or losses resulting from valuation changes in the investments of clos attributable to the interests of third parties are offset by the calculated value of the notes issued by the clos (offsetting in other gains/(losses) of cip) and therefore also do not have a material effect on the financial condition, operating results (including earnings per share), liquidity or capital resources of the company's common shareholders.
additionally, cip represent less than 1% of the company's aum. therefore, the net gains or losses of cip are not indicative of the performance of the company's aggregate assets under management.
income before taxes total income before taxes includes income/losses of cip; however, the company's operating revenues earned from cip are not included in operating revenues under u.s. gaap, as such operating revenues are eliminated upon consolidation. therefore, total u.s. and foreign income before taxes in item 8. financial statements and supplementary data, note 15, "taxation,", which includes income/losses from cip, and u.s. and foreign operating revenues in item 8. financial statements and supplementary data, note 17, "geographic information.," in which cip has been eliminated, may not correlate. the table included in the taxation footnote is formatted such that the income of cip is separately stated so that the impact of cip is evident.
total u.s. income before taxes decreased $148.0 million during the year ended december 31, 2016 to $539.9 million from $687.9 million for the year ended december 31, 2015 and includes u.s. income of cip of $2.4 million (december 31, 2015: $26.0 million). u.s. income from cip decreased $23.6 million (90.8%) from 2015 due primarily to the impact of private equity partnerships that were deconsolidated upon the adoption of asu 2015-02. excluding cip, u.s. income before taxes in 2016 decreased $124.4 million (18.8%) from december 31, 2015 due to a larger decrease in u.s. operating revenues than operating expenses.
total foreign income before taxes decreased $7.5 million during the year ended december 31, 2016 to $666.7 million from $674.2 million during the year ended december 31, 2015 and includes foreign income of cip of $14.7 million (december 31,
52
2015: foreign losses of cip of $72.1 million). foreign income from cip increased $86.8 million due primarily to gains on consolidated clos and partnerships compared to losses in the prior period and the impact of newly consolidated funds in 2016. excluding cip, foreign income decreased by $94.3 million (12.6%) from 2015 due to a larger decrease in foreign operating revenues and other income than operating expenses.
total u.s. income before taxes decreased $34.7 million to $687.9 million during the year ended december 31, 2015 from $722.6 million during the year ended december 31, 2014 and includes income of cip of $26.0 million (december 31, 2014: $63.0 million). u.s. income of cip decreased $37.0 million (58.7%) from 2014 due primarily to greater investment gains generated by these private equity partnerships. excluding cip, u.s. income before taxes in 2015 increased $2.3 million (0.3%). income before taxes in 2015 increased due to a larger increase in u.s. operating revenues than operating expenses and other income and expenses.
total foreign income before taxes increased $1.7 million to $674.2 million during the year ended december 31, 2015 from $672.5 million during the year ended december 31, 2014 and includes losses of cip of $72.1 million (december 31, 2014: losses of cip of $51.9 million). excluding cip, foreign income before taxes in 2015 increased due to a larger increase in foreign operating revenues than operating expenses; slightly offset by a decrease in foreign other income.
income tax expense our effective tax rate for the year ended december 31, 2016 decreased to 28.0% (year ended december 31, 2015: 29.2%). the inclusion of income from non-controlling interests decreased our rate period-over-period by 0.4% (0.3% decrease to the effective tax rate in 2016 and 0.1% increase to the effective tax rate in 2015). 2016 included a 0.4% rate increase as a result of the non-cash impairment charge related to the 49% investment in invesco asset management (india) private limited. 2015 included a 0.2% rate increase as a result of tax legislation changes in new york city net of settlements, a 0.2% increase as a result of regulatory investigation charges and a 0.3% increase relating to unrecognized tax benefits. the remainder of the rate movement was primarily due to changes in the mix of pre-tax income.

schedule of non-gaap information we are presenting the following non-gaap performance measures: net revenue (and by calculation, net revenue yield on aum), adjusted operating income, adjusted operating margin, adjusted net income attributable to invesco ltd. and adjusted diluted earnings per share (eps). we believe these non-gaap measures provide greater transparency into our business on an ongoing operations basis and allow more appropriate comparisons with industry peers. management uses these performance measures to evaluate the business, and they are consistent with internal management reporting. the most directly comparable u.s. gaap measures are operating revenues (and by calculation, gross revenue yield on aum), operating income , operating margin, net income attributable to invesco ltd. and diluted eps. each of these measures is discussed more fully below.
these non-gaap measures should not be considered as substitutes for any measures derived in accordance with u.s. gaap and may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies. additional reconciling items may be added in the future to these non-gaap measures if deemed appropriate. the tax effects related to the reconciling items have been calculated based on the tax rate attributable to the jurisdiction to which the transaction relates.
the following are reconciliations of operating revenues, operating income (and by calculation, operating margin), and net income attributable to invesco ltd. (and by calculation, diluted eps) on a u.s. gaap basis to net revenues, adjusted operating income (and by calculation, adjusted operating margin), and adjusted net income attributable to invesco ltd. (and by calculation, adjusted diluted eps). notes to the reconciliations follow the tables.

(1)   proportional share of net revenues and operating income from joint venture investments the company has two joint venture investments in china. the invesco great wall joint venture is one of the largest sino-foreign managers of equity products in china, with aum of approximately $18.4 billion as of december 31, 2016. the company has a 49% interest in invesco great wall. the company also has a 50% joint venture with huaneng capital services to access private equity investment opportunities in power generation in china through huaneng invesco wlr investment consulting company ltd. enhancing our operations in china is one effort that we believe could improve our competitive position over time. accordingly, we believe that it is appropriate to evaluate the contribution of these joint venture investments to the operations of the business.
management believes that the addition of our proportional share of revenues, net of distribution expenses, from our chinese joint venture investments in the computation of net revenues and the addition of our proportional share of operating income in the related computations of adjusted operating income and adjusted operating margin also provide useful information to investors and other users of the company's consolidated financial statements, as management considers it appropriate to evaluate the contribution of its joint ventures to the operations of the business. it is also consistent with the presentation of aum and net flows (where our proportional share of the ending balances and related activity are reflected) and therefore provides a more meaningful calculation of net revenue yield on aum.
(2)   third-party distribution, service and advisory expenses third-party distribution, service and advisory expenses include renewal commissions, management fee rebates and distribution costs (12b-1 and marketing support) paid to brokers and independent financial advisors and other service and administrative fees paid to third parties. see item 8, financial statements and supplementary data - note 1, "accounting policies - revenue recognition" for additional details. while the terms used for these types of expenses vary by geography, they are all expense items that are closely linked to the value of aum and the revenue earned by invesco from aum; although, from time-to-time, distribution expenses may include commissions paid in connection with the launch of closed-end funds for which there is no corresponding revenue in the period. since the company has been deemed to be the principal in the third-party arrangements, the company must reflect these expenses gross of operating revenues under u.s. gaap.
management believes that the deduction of third-party distribution, service and advisory expenses from operating revenues in the computation of net revenues (and by calculation, net revenue yield on aum) and the related computation of adjusted operating income (and by calculation, adjusted operating margin) appropriately reflects the nature of these expenses as revenue-sharing activities, as these costs are passed through to external parties who perform functions on behalf of, and distribute, the company's managed funds. further, these expenses vary extensively by geography due to the differences in distribution channels. the net presentation assists in identifying the revenue contribution generated by the business, removing distortions caused by the differing distribution channel fees and allowing for a fair comparison with u.s. peer investment managers and within invesco's own investment units. additionally, management evaluates net revenue yield on aum, which is equal to net revenues divided by average aum during the reporting period. this financial measure is an indicator of the basis point net revenues we receive for each dollar of aum we manage and is useful when evaluating the company's performance relative to industry competitors and within the company for capital allocation purposes.
(3)   cip see item 8, financial statements and supplementary data, note 20 - "consolidated investment products" for a detailed analysis of the impact to the company's consolidated financial statements from the consolidation of cip. the reconciling items add back the management and performance fees earned by invesco from the consolidated products and remove the revenues and expenses recorded by the consolidated products that have been included in the u.s. gaap consolidated statements of income.
management believes that the consolidation of investment products may impact a reader's analysis of our underlying results of operations and could result in investor confusion or the production of information about the company by analysts or external credit rating agencies that is not reflective of the underlying results of operations and financial condition of the company. accordingly, management believes that it is appropriate to adjust operating revenues, operating income and net income for the impact of cip in calculating the respective net revenues, adjusted operating income and adjusted net income.

(4)   business combination related adjustments business combination related adjustments are comprised of amounts incurred by the company in connection with business combinations. management believes it is useful to investors and other users of our consolidated financial statements to adjust for the transaction and integration charges, tax cash flow benefits and other acquisition/disposition related adjustments in arriving at adjusted operating income, adjusted operating margin and adjusted diluted eps, as this will aid comparability of our results period to period, and aid comparability with peer companies that may not have similar acquisition and disposition related income or charges.

____________
a.   employee compensation expenses of $7.0 million incurred in 2016 are associated with the acquisition of jemstep, a market-leading provider of advisor-focused digital solutions. expenses in 2013 are related to employee severance expenses associated with the cessation of activities from a previous acquisition.
b.   transaction and integration expenses reflect the legal, regulatory, advisory, valuation, integration-related employee incentive awards, other professional or consulting fees and general and administrative costs, which includes travel costs related to transactions and the costs of temporary staff involved in executing the transaction, and the post-closing costs of integrating the acquired business into the company's existing operations, including incremental costs associated
56
with achieving synergy savings. additionally, transaction and integration expenses include legal costs related to the defense of legal challenges to auction rate preferred securities redemptions with respect to various closed-end funds included in a prior acquisition.
c.   intangible amortization expense is associated with intangible assets that are identified from acquisition of a business and are amortized on a straight-line basis over useful lives. see item 8, financial statements and supplementary data, note 5 - "intangible assets" for detail.
d.   changes in contingent consideration estimates of $2.3 million in 2012 are associated with a decrease in estimates of contingent earn-out liabilities booked from prior acquisitions. during 2015, the company acquired investment management contracts from deutsche bank and the purchase price was solely comprised of contingent considerations payable in future periods. adjustment to the fair value of contingent consideration liability is an increase of $7.4 million in 2016 and a decrease of $27.1 million in 2015. see item 8, financial statements and supplementary data, note 2 - "fair value of assets and liabilities" for detail.
e.   other business combination-related adjustments include acquisition and legal costs related to various business combination transactions.
f.   in 2012, the sale of the management contracts for certain european collateralized loan obligation products (clos) resulted in a loss of $8.3 million ($5.8 million, net of tax).
g.   other-than-temporary impairment includes an impairment charge of $17.8 million in 2016 that is related to the acquisition of invesco asset management (india) private limited.
h.   deferred taxation represents tax cash flow benefits resulting from tax amortization of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, and all related tax effects. while finite-lived intangible assets are amortized under u.s. gaap, there is no amortization charge on goodwill and indefinite-lived intangibles. in certain qualifying situations, these can be amortized for tax purposes, generally over a 15-year period, as is the case in the u.s. these cash flows (in the form of reduced taxes payable) represent tax benefits that are not included in the consolidated statements of income absent an impairment charge or the disposal of the related business. the company receives these cash flow benefits but does not anticipate a sale or impairment of these assets in the foreseeable future, and therefore the deferred tax liability recognized under u.s. gaap is not expected to be used either through a credit in the consolidated statements of income or through settlement of tax obligations.
i.   the results of the discontinued operations of atlantic trust have been excluded in arriving at adjusted net income attributable to invesco ltd., which is the basis of calculating adjusted diluted eps. accordingly, the company's non-gaap financial measures reflect only the continuing business of invesco.
57
(5)   market movement on deferred compensation plan liabilities certain deferred compensation plan awards involve a return to the employee linked to the appreciation (depreciation) of specified investments, typically the funds managed by the employee. invesco hedges economically the exposure to market movements by holding these investments on its balance sheet. u.s. gaap requires the appreciation (depreciation) in the compensation liability to be expensed over the award vesting period in proportion to the vested amount of the award as part of compensation expense. the full value of the investment appreciation (depreciation) is immediately recorded below operating income in other gains and losses. this creates a timing difference between the recognition of the compensation expense and the investment gain or loss impacting net income attributable to invesco ltd. and diluted eps which will reverse over the life of the award and net to zero at the end of the multi-year vesting period. during periods of high market volatility these timing differences impact compensation expense, operating income and operating margin in a manner which, over the life of the award, will ultimately be offset by gains and losses recorded below operating income on the consolidated statements of income. the non-gaap measures exclude the mismatch created by differing u.s. gaap treatments of the market movement on the liability and the investments.
since these plans are hedged economically, management believes it is useful to reflect the offset ultimately achieved from hedging the investment market exposure in the calculation of adjusted operating income (and by calculation, adjusted operating margin) and adjusted net income (and by calculation, adjusted diluted eps), to produce results that will be more comparable period to period. the related fund shares will have been purchased on or around the date of grant, eliminating any ultimate cash impact from market movements that occur over the vesting period.
additionally, dividend income from investments held to hedge economically deferred compensation plans is recorded as dividend income and as compensation expense on the company's consolidated statements of income on the record dates. this dividend income is passed through to the employee participants in the plan and is not retained by the company. the non-gaap measures exclude this dividend income and related compensation expense.

____________
a.   during the year ended december 31, 2013, the company reduced a management fee revenue accrual by $4.3 million to reflect a multi-year true-up. inclusion of this true-up in the company's non-gaap financial information would depress the derived metric of net revenue yield on aum from continuing operations, an important metric calculated from a non-gaap financial measure which is often contemplated by users of the company's financial information to evaluate the company with industry peers. the true-up is not indicative of a trend in future net revenue yield on aum;
59
therefore, it is not included in management's evaluation of the results of the business.  on this basis, the amount is added back to management fees to arrive at net revenue.
b.   european infrastructure transformational initiative: the company has outsourced its european transfer agency and has made certain structural changes to product and distribution platforms. expenses incurred related to the european infrastructure activities are excluded in arriving at the non-gaap financial information. in connection with the initiative, operational process changes resulted in an accounting adjustment recognizing additional distribution expense in the years ended december 31, 2012 and december 31, 2013.
c.   business optimization: operating expenses for 2016 and 2015 include costs associated with a business transformation initiative that include severance costs of $26.4 million, and consulting and temporary labor costs of $21.8 million (2015 : $12.2 million and $2.0 million, respectively).
operating expenses in 2014 include expenses related to a separate business optimization location strategy initiative. the company incurred property related charges of $33.1 million (2016: $1.7 million; 2015: $2.0 million) associated with vacating leased properties and severance costs of $7.2 million related to the initiative. lease credits of $6.4 million and $3.2 million were recorded in 2015 and 2016, respectively.
d.   employee benefit plan termination: operating expenses for 2016 include an incremental credit of $8.6 million related to an employee benefit plan termination.
e.   general and administrative expenses for 2015 include a provision of $12.6 million pertaining to regulatory actions and related legal fees of $0.5 million (2016: $1.0 million). this includes $7.6 million associated with our private equity business.
operating expenses for 2014 include a charge of $31.1 million (in respect of the penalty under a settlement of an enforcement proceeding reached with the u.k. financial conduct authority (fca) pertaining to the company's compliance with certain fca rules and regulations for the period from may 2008 to november 2012. this charge, together with settlement-related legal costs of $0.5 million, has been recorded in general and administrative expense.
f.   general and administrative expenses for 2015 includes a charge of $4.7 million (2014: $31.1 million) in respect of a multi-year fund reimbursement expense associated with historical private equity management fees. the charge resulted primarily from using a more appropriate methodology regarding the calculation of offsets to management fees.
g.   included within general and administrative expenses for 2014 is a credit of $4.7 million related to the partial refund of a $15.3 million levy in 2010 from the u.k. financial services compensation scheme. an additional $3.0 million charge was recorded in the year ended december 31, 2013 reflecting revised estimates of the levy.
h.   property, office and technology expenses includes a charge of $11.7 million in the year ended december 31, 2013 related to the write-off of capitalized it software development costs.
i.   included within other gains and losses, net is the mark-to-market of foreign exchange put option contracts intended to provide protection against the impact of a significant decline in the pound sterling/u.s. dollar and euro/u.s. dollar foreign exchange rates. these contracts provide coverage through december 31, 2017. the adjustment from u.s. gaap to non-gaap earnings removes the impact of market volatility; therefore, the company's non-gaap results include only the amortization of the cost of the contracts during the contract period.
j.   on december 31, 2013, at the time of creating a new trust company subsidiary to continue operating the company's institutional trust activities immediately following the disposition of atlantic trust, the company made a $31.9 million payment to a managed investment trust, which resulted in the subsequent termination of an outstanding support agreement. this expense was recorded in other gains/(losses) in the company's consolidated statement of income during the year ended december 31, 2013.
k.   other gains and losses, net included a charge of $23.5 million in the year ended december 31, 2012 related to the call premiums on the redemption of the $333.5 million principal amount of 5.375% senior notes due february 27, 2013 and the $197.1 million principal amount of the 5.375% senior notes due december 15, 2014.

balance sheet discussion cash and cash equivalents cash and cash equivalents decreased by $523.4 million from $1,851.4 million at december 31, 2015 to $1,328.0 million at december 31, 2016. see "cash flows discussion" in the following section within this management's discussion and analysis for additional discussion regarding the movements in cash flows during the periods. see item 8, financial statements and supplementary data - note 1, "accounting policies - cash and cash equivalents," regarding requirements to retain liquid resources in certain jurisdictions.
unsettled fund receivables and payables unsettled fund receivables increased by $106.6 million from $566.3 million at december 31, 2015 to $672.9 million at december 31, 2016, due primarily to higher transaction activity between funds and investors in late december 2016 when compared to late december 2015 in our u.k. and cross-border funds, offset by lower uit activity. in our u.k. and cross-border operations, unsettled fund receivables are created by the normal settlement periods on transactions initiated by certain clients. in the company's capacity as sponsor of uits, the company records receivables from brokers, dealers, and clearing organizations for unsettled sell trades of securities and uits in addition to receivables from customers for unsettled sell trades of uits. the presentation of the unsettled fund receivables and substantially offsetting payables ($659.3 million at december 31, 2016 up from $561.9 million at december 31, 2015) at trade date reflects the legal relationship between the underlying investor and the company.
investments as of december 31, 2016 we had $795.3 million in investments. included in investments are $249.8 million of seed money investments in affiliated funds used to seed funds as we launch new products, and $170.5 million of investments related to assets held for deferred compensation plans, which are also held primarily in affiliated funds. seed investments decreased by $167.3 million during the year ended december 31, 2016, primarily due to the adoption of asu 2015-02 (see note 1, "accounting policies," for impact upon adoption) along with seed redemptions and the negative impact of changes in foreign exchange rate movement, partially offset by seed money funding and positive market activity. investments held to hedge deferred compensation awards increased by $11.7 million during the year, primarily due to new purchases in affiliated funds to hedge economically employee plan awards and market gains, partially offset by redemptions of investments and the negative impact of changes in foreign exchange rate movement.
included in investments are $279.0 million in equity method investments in our chinese joint ventures and in certain of the company's private equity partnerships, real estate partnerships and other co-investments (december 31, 2015: $352.8 million). the decrease of $73.8 million in equity method investments was primarily driven by a decrease of $82.9 million in our joint venture investments primarily resulting from the company increasing its ownership of invesco asset management (india) private limited, previously a joint venture investment in india, from 49% to 100% on april 5, 2016 along with dividend distributions and the negative impact of changes in foreign exchange rate movement. these decreases were partially offset by current period earnings. the remaining change in equity method investments is due to an increase in our partnership investments of $9.1 million resulting from the impact of adoption of asu 2015-02 mentioned above, capital calls in co-investments and earnings and valuation adjustments of during the period. the increases in partnership investments were partially offset by distributions and capital returns of during the period.
assets of csip upon adoption of asu 2015-02 (see item 8, financial statements and supplementary data, note 1, "accounting policies,"), the funds consolidated in prior periods as csip became vies and are now consolidated as cip. see item 8, financial statements and supplementary data, note 19, "consolidated sponsored investment products," for additional information.
assets held for policyholders and policyholder payables one of our subsidiaries, invesco perpetual life limited, is an insurance company that was established to facilitate retirement savings plans in the u.k. the entity holds assets that are managed for its clients on its balance sheet with an equal and offsetting liability. the increase in the balance of these accounts from $6,051.5 million at december 31, 2015, to $8,224.2 million at december 31, 2016, was the result of new business net inflows of $3,093.5 million and an increase in the market values of these assets and liabilities of $270.2 million, offset by negative foreign exchange movements of $1,191.0 million. the new business inflows can be primarily attributed to pension and retirement funds investing into multi-asset products via this insurance company.
61
intangible assets, net intangible assets reflect a net increase of $45.4 million from $1,354.0 million at december 31, 2015, to $1,399.4 million at december 31, 2016. the increase in intangible assets, net is due to the acquisition of management contract and technology related intangible assets through the acquisitions of our indian asset management operations and jemstep of $63.4 million during 2016, partly offset by amortization of $13.9 million and foreign exchange movements of $4.1 million.
goodwill goodwill decreased from $6,175.7 million at december 31, 2015, to $6,129.2 million at december 31, 2016. the decrease is due to foreign exchange movements of $182.2 million. the decrease is offset by $135.7 million related to the preliminary valuations of the acquisitions of our indian asset management company and jemstep. see item 8, financial statements and supplementary data - note 6, "goodwill," for an analysis of the change in goodwill balances between periods. the company's annual goodwill impairment review is performed as of october 1 of each year. as a result of that analysis, the company determined that no impairment existed at that date. see "critical accounting policies - goodwill" for additional details of the company's goodwill impairment analysis process.
long-term debt long-term debt increased from $2,072.8 million at december 31, 2015, to $2,102.4 million at december 31, 2016, an increase of $29.6 million. as of december 31, 2016, there was $28.7 million outstanding on the credit facility (at december 31, 2015: none).
liquidity and capital resources our capital structure, together with available cash balances, cash flows generated from operations, existing capacity under our credit facility and further capital market activities, if necessary, should provide us with sufficient resources to meet present and future cash needs, including operating, debt and other obligations as they come due and anticipated future capital requirements. material changes in the company's capital structure over the last three years include:
2016: during 2016, we repurchased 18.1 million common shares in open market transactions utilizing $535.0 million in cash under the company's board-approved open market share repurchase program.
2015: during 2015, we repurchased 15.5 million common shares in open market transactions utilizing $548.8 million in cash under the company's board-approved open market share repurchase program. on october 14, 2015, the company completed the issuance of senior notes with aggregate principal amounts of $500 million at 3.750% due january 15, 2026. the proceeds were used, in part, to repay the outstanding balance on the credit facility at that date. separately, on august 7, 2015, the company amended the existing $1.25 billion credit facility to extend its maturity to august 7, 2020.
2014: during 2014, we repurchased 7.4 million common shares in open market transactions utilizing $296.6 million in cash under the company's board-approved open market share repurchase program.
our capital management priorities have evolved with the growth and success of our business and include:
•   reinvestment in the business;
•   moderate annual growth of dividends (as further discussed in the "dividends" section below);
•   share repurchase; and
•   establishment of an approximate $1 billion cash buffer in excess of european regulatory and liquidity requirements.
these priorities are executed in a manner consistent with our desire to maintain a strong, investment-grade credit rating. as of the date of this report, invesco held credit ratings of a/stable, a2/stable and a-/positive from s&p, moody's, and fitch, respectively. our ability to continue to access the capital markets in a timely manner depends on a number of factors, including our credit ratings, the condition of the global economy, investors' willingness to purchase our securities, interest rates, credit spreads and the valuation levels of equity markets. if we are unable to access capital markets in a timely manner, our business could be adversely impacted. see also item 1a - "risk factors," for more detailed discussion on reliance on credit ratings.
certain of our subsidiaries are required to maintain minimum levels of capital. such requirements may change from time-to-time as additional guidance is released based on a variety of factors, including balance sheet composition, assessment of risk
62
exposures and governance, and review from regulators. these and other similar provisions of applicable laws and regulations may have the effect of limiting withdrawals of capital, repayment of intercompany loans and payment of dividends by such entities. all of our regulated eu subsidiaries are subject to consolidated capital requirements under eu directives, including those arising from the eu's capital requirements directive iv (crd iv) and the u.k. fca's internal capital adequacy assessment process (icaap), and capital is maintained within this sub-group to satisfy these regulations. we meet these requirements in part by holding cash and cash equivalents. this retained cash can be used for general business purposes in the european sub-group in the countries where it is located. due to the capital restrictions, the ability to transfer cash between certain jurisdictions may be limited. in addition, transfers of cash between international jurisdictions may have adverse tax consequences. we are in compliance with all regulatory minimum net capital requirements. as of december 31, 2016, the company's minimum regulatory capital requirement was $590.8 million (december 31, 2015: $534.7 million). the total amount of non-u.s. cash and cash equivalents was $1,168.4 million at december 31, 2016 (december 31, 2015: $1,612.7 million).
in addition, the company is required to hold cash deposits with clearing organizations or to otherwise segregate cash to maintain compliance with federal and other regulations in connection with its uit broker dealer entity. at december 31, 2016, these cash deposits totaled $11.4 million (december 31, 2015: $11.4 million).
the consolidation of $6.0 billion and $4.4 billion of total assets and long-term debt of cip as of december 31, 2016, respectively, did not impact the company's liquidity and capital resources. the majority of cip balances related to consolidated clos.the collateral assets of the clos are held solely to satisfy the obligations of the clos. the company has no right to the benefits from, nor does it bear the risks associated with, the collateral assets held by the clos, beyond the company's direct investments in, and management and performance fees generated from, these products, which are eliminated upon consolidation. if the company were to liquidate, the collateral assets would not be available to the general creditors of the company, and as a result, the company does not consider them to be company assets. likewise, if the clos were to liquidate, their investors would have no recourse to the general credit of the company. the company therefore does not consider this debt to be an obligation of the company. see item 8, financial statements and supplementary data - note 20, "consolidated investment products," for additional details.
cash flows discussion the ability to consistently generate free cash flow from operations in excess of dividend payments, share repurchases, capital expenditures, and ongoing operating expenses is one of our company's fundamental financial strengths. operations continue to be financed from current earnings and borrowings. our principal uses of cash, other than for operating expenses, include dividend payments, capital expenditures, acquisitions, purchase of our shares in the open market and investments in certain new investment products.
cash flows of cip (discussed in item 8, financial statements and supplementary data - note 20, "consolidated investment products") are reflected in invesco's cash provided by or used in operating activities, investing activities and financing activities. cash held by cip is not available for general use by invesco, nor is invesco cash available for general use by its cip. accordingly, the table below presents the consolidated total cash flows of the company and separately presents the impact to the cash flows from cip. the impact is illustrated in the tables immediately below by a column which shows the dollar-value change in the consolidated figures, as caused by the consolidation of cip. for example, the impact of cip on net cash provided by/(used in) operating activities for the year ended december 31, 2016 reflects cash used of $714.2 million; however, this was not used as part of the company's corporate cash balances. excluding the impact of cip, cash provided by operations was $843.5 million for the year ended december 31, 2016. the cip cash flow variances from 2015 to 2016 on operating, investing and financing activities primarily result from the impact of the adoption of asu 2016-02, which is discussed in item 8. financial statements and supplementary data, note 1, "accounting policies -- accounting pronouncements recently adopted and pending accounting pronouncements," in addition to the impact of new funds consolidated in 2016 following the adoption. the adoption resulted in the consolidation of certain investment products in 2016 which were not previously consolidated. additionally, the funds consolidated in prior periods as csip became vies and are now consolidated as cip.
also as illustrated in the table below, the sum of the operating, investing and financing cash flows of cip offsets to a zero impact to the company's change in cash and cash equivalent balances from period to period. the cash flows of cip do not form part of the company's cash flow management processes, nor do they form part of the company's significant liquidity evaluations and decisions for the reasons noted. the discussion that follows the table focuses on the company's cash flows.

the discussion that follows identifies risks associated with the company's liquidity and capital resources. the item 1. business -- risk management section contains a broader discussion of the company's overall approach to risk management.
67
credit and liquidity risk capital management involves the management of the company's liquidity and cash flows. the company manages its capital by reviewing annual and projected cash flow forecasts and by monitoring credit, liquidity and market risks, such as interest rate and foreign currency risks (as discussed in item 7a, "quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk"), through measurement and analysis. the company is primarily exposed to credit risk through its cash and cash equivalent deposits, which are held by external firms. the company invests its cash balances in its own institutional money market products, as well as with external high credit-quality financial institutions. these arrangements create exposure to concentrations of credit risk.
credit risk credit risk is the risk that one party to a financial instrument will cause a financial loss for the other party by failing to meet an obligation. the company is subject to credit risk in the following areas of its business:
•   all cash and cash equivalent balances are subject to credit risk, as they represent deposits made by the company with external banks and other institutions. as of december 31, 2016, our maximum exposure to credit risk related to our cash and cash equivalent balances is $1,328.0 million. see item 8, financial statements and supplementary data - note 21, "related parties," for information regarding cash and cash equivalents invested in affiliated money market funds.
the company does not utilize credit derivatives or similar instruments to mitigate the maximum exposure to credit risk. the company does not expect any counterparties to its financial instruments to fail to meet their obligations.
liquidity risk liquidity risk is the risk that the company will encounter difficulty in meeting obligations associated with its financial liabilities as the same become due. the company is exposed to liquidity risk through its $2,102.4 million in total debt. the company actively manages liquidity risk by preparing cash flow forecasts for future periods, reviewing them regularly with senior management, maintaining a committed credit facility, scheduling significant gaps between major debt maturities and engaging external financing sources in regular dialogue.
effects of inflation inflation can impact our organization primarily in two ways. first, inflationary pressures can result in increases in our cost structure, especially to the extent that large expense components such as compensation are impacted. to the degree that these expense increases are not recoverable or cannot be counterbalanced through pricing increases due to the competitive environment, our profitability could be negatively impacted. secondly, the value of the assets that we manage may be negatively impacted when inflationary expectations result in a rising interest rate environment. declines in the values of these aum could lead to reduced revenues as management fees are generally calculated based upon the size of aum.
off balance sheet commitments see item 8, financial statements and supplementary data - note 18, "commitments and contingencies - off balance sheet commitments," for more information regarding undrawn capital commitments.

(1)   long-term debt includes $2,073.7 million of fixed rate debt. fixed interest payments are reflected in the table above in the periods they are due, and include any issuance discounts. the table above includes the company's debt; debt of cip is excluded from the table above, as the company is not obligated for these amounts. see item 8, financial statements and supplementary data - note 20, "consolidated investment products," for additional information.
(2)   operating leases reflect obligations for leased building space and other assets. see item 8, financial statements and supplementary data - note 13, "operating leases" for sublease information.
(3)   in the ordinary course of business, invesco enters into contracts or purchase obligations with third parties whereby the third parties provide services to or on behalf of invesco. purchase obligations included in the contractual obligations table above represent fixed-price contracts, which are either non-cancelable or cancelable with a penalty. at december 31, 2016, the company's obligations primarily reflect standard service contracts for portfolio, market data, office-related services and third-party marketing and promotional services. in addition, the company is a party to certain variable-price contractual arrangements (e.g. contingent future payments based on aum levels, number of accounts, transaction volume, etc.) for which the company is reimbursed by affiliated funds and as such are not included in the table above. purchase obligations are recorded as liabilities in the company's consolidated financial statements when services are provided. purchase obligations also include contingent consideration liabilities.
(4)   the company has capital commitments into co-invested funds that are to be drawn down over the life of the partnership as investment opportunities are identified. at december 31, 2016, the company's undrawn capital and purchase commitments were $204.1 million. these are not included in the above table. see item 8, financial statements and supplementary data - note 18, "commitments and contingencies" for additional details.
(5)   due to the uncertainty with respect to the timing of future cash flows associated with unrecognized tax benefits at december 31, 2016, the company is unable to make reasonably reliable estimates of the period of cash settlement with the respective taxing authorities. therefore, $10.5 million of gross unrecognized tax benefits have been excluded from the contractual obligations table above. see item 8, financial statements and supplementary data, note 15 - "taxation" for a discussion regarding income taxes.
(6)   in addition to the contractual obligations in the table above, we periodically make contributions to defined benefit pension and postretirement medical plans. for the years ended december 31, 2016 and 2015 we contributed $14.2 million and $15.5 million, respectively, to these plans. in 2017, we expect to contribute $11.2 million to our defined benefit pension plans and none to our postretirement medical plan. see item 8, financial statements and supplementary data - note 12, "retirement benefit plans" for detailed benefit pension and postretirement plan information. the company has various other compensation and benefit obligations, including bonuses, commissions and incentive payments payable, defined contribution plan matching contribution obligations, and deferred compensation arrangements, that are excluded from the table above.
critical accounting policies and estimates our significant accounting policies are disclosed in item 8, financial statements and supplementary data - note 1, "accounting policies." the accounting policies and estimates that we believe are the most critical to an understanding of our results of operations and financial condition are those that require complex management judgment regarding matters that are highly uncertain at the time policies were applied and estimates were made. these accounting policies and estimates are discussed below; however, the additional accounting policy detail in the footnote previously referenced is important to the discussion of each of the topics. different estimates reasonably could have been used in the current period that would have had a material effect on these consolidated financial statements, and changes in these estimates are likely to occur from period-to-period in the future.
taxation we operate in several countries and several states and other taxing jurisdictions through our various subsidiaries, and must allocate our income, expenses, and earnings under the various laws and regulations of each of these taxing jurisdictions. accordingly, our provision for income taxes represents our total estimate of the liability that we have incurred for doing business each year in all of our locations. annually we file tax returns that represent our filing positions within each jurisdiction and settle our return liabilities. each jurisdiction has the right to audit those returns and may take different positions with respect to income and expense allocations and taxable earnings determinations. because the determinations of our annual provisions are subject to judgments and estimates, it is possible that actual results will vary from those recognized in our consolidated financial statements. as a result, it is likely that additions to, or reductions of, income tax expense will occur each year for prior reporting periods as actual tax returns and tax audits are settled.
69
deferred tax assets, net of any associated valuation allowance, have been recognized based on management's belief that taxable income of the appropriate character, more likely than not, will be sufficient to realize the benefits of these assets over time. in the event that actual results differ from our expectations, or if our historical trends of positive operating income changes, we may be required to record a valuation allowance on some or all of these deferred tax assets, which may have a significant effect on our financial condition and results of operations. in assessing whether a valuation allowance should be established against a deferred income tax asset, the company considers the nature, frequency and severity of recent losses, forecasts of future profitability, the duration of statutory carry back and carry forward periods, among other factors.
the company utilizes a specific recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the consolidated financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. the prescribed two-step process for evaluating a tax position involves first determining whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination by the appropriate taxing authorities. if it is, the second step then requires a company to measure this tax position benefit as the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. the company recognizes any interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits on the consolidated statements of income as components of income tax expense.
see also item 8, financial statements and supplementary data - in note 15, "taxation," for additional discussion of these items.
goodwill our goodwill impairment testing conducted during 2016 and 2015 indicated that the fair value of the reporting unit exceeded its carrying value, indicating that step two of the goodwill impairment test was not necessary; however, the company cannot predict the occurrence of future events that might adversely affect the reported value of goodwill that totaled $6,129.2 million and $6,175.7 million at december 31, 2016 and december 31, 2015, respectively. such events include, but are not limited to, strategic decisions made in response to economic and competitive conditions, the impact of the economic environment on the company's aum, or any other material negative change in aum and related management fees.
the october 1, 2016 annual goodwill impairment test was performed using a consistent methodology to that used for the 2015 annual impairment test. fair value of the reporting unit is generally determined using an income approach where estimated future cash flows are discounted to arrive at a single present value amount. the income approach includes inputs that require significant management judgment, including aum growth rates, product mix, effective fee rates, pre-tax profit margins, effective tax rates and discount rates. the 2016 annual goodwill impairment test includes assumptions updated for current market conditions, including the company's updated forecasts for changes in aum due to market gains and long-term net flows and the corresponding changes in revenue and expenses. market gains are based upon historical returns of the s&p 500 index, treasury bond returns and treasury bill returns, as applicable to the company's aum mix on the testing date. the most sensitive of these assumptions are the estimated cash flows and the use of a weighted average cost of capital as the discount rate to determine present value. the most significant change in assumptions from 2015 related to an increase in the equity risk premium, which resulted in a discount rate of 13.0% for the october 1, 2016 analysis (2015: 11.6%). the discount rates used are estimates of the weighted average cost of capital for the investment management sector reflecting the overall industry risks associated with future cash flows and have been calculated consistently across the various tests dates. while the company believes all assumptions utilized in our assessment are reasonable and appropriate, changes in these estimates could produce different fair value amounts and therefore different goodwill impairment assessments.
intangible assets where evidence exists that the underlying arrangements have a high likelihood of continued renewal at little or no cost to the company, the intangible asset is assigned an indefinite life and reviewed for impairment on an annual basis. definite-lived intangible assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amount may not be recoverable (i.e. the carrying amount exceeds the fair value of the intangible asset). in addition, management judgment is required to estimate the period over which definite-lived intangible assets will contribute to the company's cash flows and the pattern in which these assets will be consumed. a change in the remaining useful life of any of these assets, or the reclassification of an indefinite-lived intangible asset to a definite-lived intangible asset, could have a significant impact on the company's amortization expense, which was $13.9 million, $10.6 million and $12.6 million for the years ended december 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.
intangible assets not subject to amortization are tested for impairment annually as of october 1 or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired. the impairment test consists of a comparison of the fair value of an intangible asset with its carrying amount. if the carrying amount of the intangible asset exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess. fair value is generally determined using an income approach where estimated
70
future cash flows are discounted to arrive at a single present value amount. the income approach includes inputs that require significant management judgment, including aum growth rates, product mix, effective fee rates, pre-tax profit margins, effective tax rates and discount rates. the most relevant of these assumptions to the determination of the estimated fair value are the aum growth rate and discount rate, which is a weighted average cost of capital including consideration of company size premiums. changes in these estimates could produce different fair value amounts and therefore different impairment conclusions. in 2016 and 2015, annual impairment reviews of indefinite-lived intangible assets determined that no impairment existed at the respective review dates, the classifications of indefinite-lived and definite-lived remain appropriate, and no changes to the expected lives of the definite-lived intangible assets were required.
investments a significant portion of our investments are carried at fair value on our balance sheet with the periodic mark-to-market recorded either in accumulated other comprehensive income in the case of available-for-sale investments, or directly to earnings, in the case of trading assets. since assumptions are made in determining the fair values of investments for which active markets do not exist, the actual value that may be realized upon the sale or other disposition of these investments could differ from the current carrying values. fair value calculations are also required in association with our quarterly impairment testing of investments. the accuracy of our other-than-temporary impairment assessments is dependent upon the extent to which we are able to accurately determine fair values. seed money investments are held in invesco managed funds with the purpose of providing capital to the funds during their development periods. these investments are recorded at fair value using quoted market prices in active markets; there is no modeling or additional information needed to arrive at the fair values of these investments.
the value of investments may decline for various reasons. the market price may be affected by general market conditions which reflect prospects for the economy as a whole or by specific information pertaining to an industry or individual company. such declines require further investigation by management, which considers all available evidence to evaluate the realizable value of the investment, including, but not limited to, the following factors:
•   the probability that the company will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of a debt security not impaired at acquisition;
•   the length of time and the extent to which the market value has been less than cost;
•   the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer, including any specific events which may influence the operations of the issuer;
•   the intent and ability of the company to retain its investment in the issuer for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value;
•   the decline in the security's value due to an increase in market interest rates or a change in foreign exchange rates since acquisition;
•   determination that the security is not realizable; or
•   an adverse change in estimated cash flows of a beneficial interest.
our other-than-temporary impairment analysis of available for sale seed money holdings includes a review of the market returns required for each fund portfolio to enable us to recover our original investment. as part of the review, we analyze the absolute amount of any loss to date, the trend of the losses, and percent declines in values of the seed money investments. along with intent and ability to hold, all of these scenarios are considered as part of our other-than-temporary impairment analysis of seed money holdings.
we also assess our equity method and other investments for impairment. if circumstances indicate that impairment may exist, a more detailed impairment analysis is performed which includes assessing many of the factors listed above.
cip assessing if an entity is a variable interest entity (vie) or voting interest entity (voe) involves judgment and analysis on a structure-by-structure basis. factors included in this assessment include the legal organization of the entity, the company's contractual involvement with the entity and any related party or de facto agent implications of the company's involvement with the entity. a vie, in the context of the company and its managed funds, is a fund that does not have sufficient equity to finance its operations without additional subordinated financial support, or a fund for which the risks and rewards of ownership are not directly linked to voting interests. if the company is deemed to have the power to direct the activities of the fund that most significantly impact the fund's economic performance, and the obligation to absorb losses/right to receive benefits from the fund that could potentially be significant to the fund, then the company is deemed to be the fund's primary beneficiary and is required to consolidate the fund.
71
determining if the company is the primary beneficiary of a vie also requires significant judgment judgment involved to assess if the company has the power to direct the activities that most significantly affect the fund's economic results and to assess if the company's interests could be deemed significant. if current financial statements are not available for consolidated vies or voes, estimation of investment valuation is required, which includes assessing available quantitative and qualitative data. significant changes in these estimates could impact the reported value of the investments held by cip and the related offsetting equity attributable to noncontrolling interests in consolidated entities on the consolidated balance sheets and the other gains and losses of cip, net, and related offsetting gains and losses attributable to noncontrolling interests in consolidated entities, net, amounts on the consolidated statements of income.
as of december 31, 2016, the company consolidated vies that held investments of $5,066.3 million (december 31, 2015: $5,373.2 million) and voe fund investments of $49.8 million (december 31, 2015: $719.1 million). as circumstances supporting estimates and factors change, the determination of vie and primary beneficiary status may change, as could the determination of the necessity of consolidation of voes. estimation is involved when determining investment and debt valuation for certain cip; however, changes in the fair values of these amounts are largely offset by noncontrolling interests.
contingencies contingencies arise when we have a present obligation as a result of a past event that is both probable and reasonably estimable. we must from time to time make material estimates with respect to legal and other contingencies. the nature of our business requires compliance with various laws and regulations, as well as various contractual obligations, and exposes us to a variety of legal proceedings and matters in the ordinary course of business. while the outcomes of matters such as these are inherently uncertain and difficult to predict, we maintain reserves reflected in accounts payable and accrued expenses, as appropriate, for identified losses that are, in our judgment, probable and reasonably estimable. we expense any related legal fees as they are incurred. management's judgment is based on the advice of legal counsel, ruling on various motions by the applicable court, review of the outcome of similar matters, if applicable, and review of guidance from governmental and other regulatory authorities, if applicable. contingent consideration payable in relation to a business acquisition is recorded as of the acquisition date as part of the fair value transferred in exchange for the acquired business.

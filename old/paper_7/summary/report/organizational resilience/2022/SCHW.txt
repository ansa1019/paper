Schwab's financial performance in 2022 reflected the resiliency of our diversified financial model in a challenging macroeconomic environment and impacts from higher market interest rates. The company continued its diligent approach to balance sheet management, maintaining appropriate capital and liquidity to support client activity and returning excess capital to stockholders. Despite facing significant external pressures, including inflation and geopolitical tensions, Schwab experienced core net new assets totaling $427.7 billion, representing an organic growth rate of 5%. The company has established liquidity policies to support the successful execution of business strategies while ensuring ongoing and sufficient liquidity to meet operational needs and satisfy applicable regulatory requirements under both normal and stressed conditions. Schwab's operations are highly dependent on the integrity and resilience of critical business functions and technology systems. To minimize business interruptions and ensure the capacity to continue operations during an incident, Schwab maintains a backup and recovery infrastructure, including facilities for backup and communications, a geographically dispersed workforce, and routine testing of business continuity and disaster recovery plans. The company has a comprehensive risk management program to identify and manage various risks, including operational, compliance, credit, market, and liquidity risks, which are essential for maintaining organizational health and performance. Schwab's risk management process involves risk identification and assessment, risk response, risk measurement and monitoring, and risk reporting and escalation. The company has aligned its risk management practices with those of TD Ameritrade, ensuring that operations remain consistent with its enterprise risk management framework. Schwab's ability to attract and retain clients, develop trusted relationships, and grow client assets is critical to its competitive advantage and overall organizational resilience. The integration of TD Ameritrade has necessitated increased technology work to support the expanded volumes of the combined client base, reflecting the company's adaptability and commitment to operational flexibility. Schwab's strategic initiatives include enhancing its technological infrastructure to support growth and improve service delivery, which are vital for maintaining performance under pressure. The company has also implemented a capital contingency plan to provide action plans for low probability/high impact capital events, ensuring preparedness for unexpected situations. Schwab's approach to resource management and allocation, including investments in human capital and technology, reinforces its resilience strategies and enhances its ability to confront adversity. The company's focus on maintaining a strong balance sheet, effective risk management, and operational continuity positions it to navigate complex situations and sustain performance amidst environmental disruptions.

We are a global technology leader that designs, develops, and supplies a broad range of semiconductor and infrastructure software solutions. Our infrastructure software solutions enable customers to plan, develop, automate, manage, and secure applications across mainframe, distributed, mobile, and cloud platforms, enhancing operational flexibility and resilience. The demand for our products has been affected by various factors, including general economic and market conditions, which may create pressures on our operations. The COVID-19 pandemic disrupted normal business activities, resulting in supply chain and market disruptions that impacted our workforce and operations. In response to these challenges, we have taken extensive measures to protect the health and safety of our employees and contractors, demonstrating our commitment to organizational resilience. We continue to monitor the implications of the pandemic on our operations and may modify our business practices and policies as needed to adapt to unexpected situations. Our strategy combines technology leadership with unmatched scale to deliver a comprehensive suite of infrastructure technology products, which supports our resilience in a competitive landscape. We recognize that our ability to predict the impact of external disturbances, such as the pandemic, remains limited, and its effects on our business may not be fully realized until future periods. Our operational management practices include extensive research and development investments, which are critical for maintaining our competitive advantage and ensuring the adaptability of our products. We have established strong relationships with leading OEM customers, which provide us with key insights into customer needs and enable us to better serve our target markets. Our collaboration with customers has been instrumental in developing critical expertise and system-level knowledge, enhancing our organizational capabilities. The pending acquisition of VMware is expected to further strengthen our position and resilience in the market by expanding our technology portfolio and capabilities. We believe that our cash and cash equivalents, along with cash flows from operations and available credit facilities, will provide sufficient liquidity to operate our business and fund our obligations, contributing to our operational continuity. Our working capital has increased, reflecting our proactive measures to support customer demand and manage resource allocation effectively. We recognize that significant customer concentration poses risks, and the loss of key customers could adversely affect our business. Therefore, we continuously assess our operational strategies to mitigate risks and enhance our organizational health. The ongoing evaluation of our financial performance and operational strategies is essential for maintaining our resilience and ensuring we can confront future challenges effectively.

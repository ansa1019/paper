Our 2022 operational and financial results reflect our mission to be North America's premier energy infrastructure company. Key events included significant progress in resolving legal and regulatory matters, which are essential for maintaining organizational health and operational continuity. We invested $5.7 billion in capital expenditures and investments, focusing on resource allocation to enhance resilience strategies and business continuity. The overall results of operations were impacted by external pressures, including changes in revenues, costs, and earnings due to environmental perturbations and inflation rates. Our earnings were influenced by operational flexibility and the ability to adapt to unexpected situations, which are critical for maintaining performance under pressure. 

The increase in earnings at SDG&E was primarily due to higher operating margins and regulatory interest income, reflecting effective resource management and strategic initiatives aimed at enhancing organizational resilience. Sempra Infrastructure's performance was affected by losses in asset optimization, highlighting the need for risk assessment and mitigation strategies in response to volatile market conditions. The decrease in earnings at Sempra Infrastructure underscores the complexity of managing operational resources amid external disturbances and the importance of strategic adaptation to ensure future success.

We continue to monitor the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on cash flows and results of operations, implementing measures to support customers facing financial challenges. The wildfire fund and associated mechanisms are designed to enhance crisis management capabilities, ensuring that we can confront and recover from adverse events effectively. Our capital structure is managed to maintain investment-grade credit ratings, which is vital for securing financial resources necessary for ongoing operations and strategic growth.

In addition, we are developing projects with a focus on sustainability and resilience, including the Cameron LNG Phase 2 project and the Port Arthur LNG Phase 1 project. These initiatives are designed to enhance our operational capabilities and adaptability in a rapidly changing energy landscape. The anticipated capital expenditures and investments reflect our commitment to evolving our organizational practices to meet customer needs and respond to market volatility.

The strategic foresight demonstrated in our planning processes aims to ensure that we can navigate complex situations and maintain organizational coherence. We recognize the importance of inter-organizational collaboration and stakeholder engagement in achieving our major objectives and sustaining performance amid varying conditions. Our approach to managing risks and uncertainties is integral to fostering an environment conducive to organizational learning and transformation, ultimately supporting our long-term resilience and success in the energy sector.

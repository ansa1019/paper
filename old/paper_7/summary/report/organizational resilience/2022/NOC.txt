The U.S. and its allies continue to face a global security environment of heightened tensions and instability, which impacts our operations and financial performance, as well as demand for our products and services. The conflict in Ukraine has increased global tensions and highlighted security requirements, leading to increased demand for defense products and services from allies and partner nations. We are actively exploring both opportunities and risks associated with these external pressures. Since March 2020, COVID-19 has dramatically impacted the global health and economic environments, resulting in business slowdowns, labor shortfalls, supply chain challenges, and market volatility. However, with extraordinary efforts by our employees and partners, direct COVID-19-related impacts on our business generally declined in 2022. The company continues to monitor and address the pandemic's impact on our operations and stakeholders, aiming to keep employees safe and lessen potential adverse impacts. The broader macroeconomic environment has experienced extraordinary challenges, including high rates of inflation and supply chain disruptions, which have contributed to increased costs and performance challenges. We continue to work hard to mitigate these challenges, including supporting our suppliers and enhancing our workforce through hiring and development efforts. The ongoing inflationary pressures and supply chain challenges adversely affected the company's results, and we expect these macroeconomic challenges to continue impacting our industry and company in 2023. The political environment and regulatory changes are expected to create further uncertainty regarding our operating environment. The results of these debates could have material impacts on defense spending and our programs. We believe that our capabilities should help our customers defend against current and future threats, allowing for long-term profitable business growth. The company is focused on the efficient conversion of operating income into cash to meet material cash requirements, including funding our pension and operational needs. We expect cash generated from operations, supplemented by borrowings, to provide liquidity in the short and long term. The company has a five-year senior unsecured credit facility and expects to satisfy capital expenditure commitments with cash on hand. We have seen an accelerated pace of new rulemakings and changes in the legal landscape, which impose additional obligations and risks. The political environment, federal budget, and regulatory environment are expected to continue to be subjects of considerable debate, particularly in light of ongoing conflicts and inflationary pressures. The broader macroeconomic environment will play a significant role in the outcome of these debates and their implications for our industry and company. We are committed to adapting our strategies and operations to maintain resilience in the face of these challenges, ensuring our long-term success and organizational health.

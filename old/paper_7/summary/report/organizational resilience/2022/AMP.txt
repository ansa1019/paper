Ameriprise operates in the broader context of macroeconomic forces, including the global and U.S. economies, the COVID-19 pandemic, financial market volatility, and geopolitical strain, which significantly impact our operating and performance results. The business, political, and regulatory environments are subject to elevated uncertainty and substantial, frequent change. We focus on our key strategic objectives and obtaining operational and strategic leverage from our core capabilities. The success of these strategies may be affected by various factors, including equity price fluctuations and interest rate changes, which can impact our results of operations. We have been operating in a historically low interest rate environment but have recently experienced substantial increases in rates, leading to uncertainty about future rate movements. Our management's priority is to increase shareholder value over a multi-year horizon by achieving our financial targets, which include adjusted operating earnings per diluted share growth and adjusted operating return on equity. We utilize adjusted operating measures to evaluate our financial performance, which exclude certain impacts that may obscure the underlying performance of our core operations. The results of operations reflect our ability to adapt to changing market conditions, including the impact of unlocking and mean reversion related impacts, which may affect our financial performance. We have implemented strategic initiatives to optimize our risk profile and shift our business mix to lower-risk offerings. Our approach includes actively managing our long-term care business and increasing rates on policies, which reflects our commitment to maintaining organizational health and resilience. We conduct regular reviews of our key reserve assumptions and ensure that our reserves are adequate to cover future policy benefits and claims. Our liquidity position remains strong, with substantial cash and cash equivalents available to meet our operational needs. We also have access to various sources of liquidity, including credit facilities and collateralized borrowings. The management of our subsidiaries is critical to our ability to meet cash requirements, including the payment of dividends. We have established a strategy for payments to our parent holding company from our subsidiaries, taking into account overall business health and capital levels. Our operational management practices emphasize the importance of maintaining flexibility and adaptability in response to environmental disruptions and market volatility. We continuously assess our performance under pressure and implement measures to enhance our operational continuity and crisis management capabilities. The ability to foresee and respond to adverse conditions is integral to our organizational resilience, ensuring we can navigate complex situations and maintain performance despite external pressures. Our commitment to strategic foresight and proactive measures positions us to confront challenges and leverage opportunities for growth and sustainability in a turbulent market environment.

The ongoing geopolitical uncertainties, particularly the Russia and Ukraine conflict, are introducing additional challenges that impact our operational flexibility and resilience strategies. We continue to experience inflation pressure in our supply chain, as well as delays in sourcing key materials needed for our products and skilled labor shortages, which have delayed our ability to convert remaining performance obligations to revenue and negatively impacted our profit margins. We are taking actions to limit this pressure, including lean initiatives to drive cost productivity, partnering with our suppliers, and adjusting the pricing of our products and services. Global material availability and labor shortages continue to cause disruptions for us and our suppliers, impacting our production and delivery across our businesses. We remain committed to investment in developing and maturing technologies that enable a more sustainable future of flight, which reflects our adaptability and strategic initiatives in response to external pressures. Our deep history of innovation and technology leadership positions us to drive long-term profitable growth and cash generation over time. The recovery trends in commercial air travel are in line with our recovery forecast, demonstrating our ability to maintain positive adjustment under challenging conditions. We are in frequent dialogue with our airline, airframe, and maintenance, repair, and overhaul customers about the outlook for commercial air travel, new aircraft production, fleet retirements, and after-market services, which underscores our organizational health and responsiveness to customer needs. Our renewable energy segment is uniquely positioned to lead the energy transition while building on advanced technologies that grow renewable energy generation, lower the cost of electricity, and modernize the grid, reflecting our commitment to sustainability and operational continuity. We are experiencing strong order growth in our healthcare equipment business, driven by government stimulus programs, which indicates our ability to absorb strain and preserve functioning despite adversity. The inflation reduction act of 2022 is expected to resolve recent U.S. policy uncertainty that resulted in project delays and deferral of customer investments, thereby enhancing our resilience in the renewable energy sector. Our focus on improving the durability of our wind turbine products and fleet availability demonstrates our commitment to operational management and strategic adaptation. We are undertaking a restructuring program to reduce fixed costs, reflecting our selectivity strategy to operate in fewer markets and to simplify and standardize product variants, which is essential for maintaining organizational coherence. The impact of inflation is expected to be challenging, but we continue to take actions to manage it effectively. Our financial results are dependent on costs to address fleet availability and quality, execution of cost reduction initiatives, and the inflationary environment, which necessitates a multifaceted approach to risk management and resource allocation. We believe that our strategic foresight and proactive measures will enable us to navigate complex situations and ensure our organizational survival in turbulent markets.

In 2022, our operating results were robust, and we ended the year in a solid financial position, demonstrating our ability to maintain positive adjustment under challenging conditions. Strong demand and low vacancy in the global logistics markets drove increases in market rents, translating into significant rent change on rollover and same-store growth in our operating portfolio. Despite challenging headwinds from capital markets, ongoing inflation, rising interest rates, and geopolitical crises, we believe we are well-positioned to organically grow revenues. We expect to be cautious as we manage our business in this uncertain environment, focusing on disciplined capital deployment activities and strategic initiatives to adapt to external pressures. Our total available liquidity of $4.1 billion and aggregate availability under credit facilities of $3.9 billion provide a strong foundation for operational flexibility and resource allocation in response to market conditions. 

The completion of the Duke transaction for $23.2 billion, primarily comprised of logistics real estate assets, reflects our strategic response to evolving market dynamics and our commitment to maintaining operational continuity. This acquisition, along with our net proceeds from property contributions to unconsolidated co-investment ventures, illustrates our capacity for resource generation and effective risk management. Our development portfolio, expected to be completed before November 2024, highlights our focus on future planning and adaptability to ensure performance maintenance.

We recognize the importance of organizational resilience in navigating environmental disruptions and maintaining our competitive advantage. Our strategic capital segment, which includes revenues from asset management and property management services, fluctuates based on the size of our portfolios and market conditions, underscoring the need for agility and responsiveness in our operations. The increase in general and administrative expenses due to inflationary pressures reflects the complexities of managing operational resources while striving for organizational effectiveness.

Our ability to absorb strain and preserve functioning despite adversity is further demonstrated by our proactive measures in managing foreign currency and derivative risks, ensuring we mitigate potential impacts on our financial performance. The strategic foresight in our capital expenditures and investments in sustainable building features illustrates our commitment to long-term resilience and adaptability in a turbulent market environment. 

We continuously evaluate our performance through metrics such as net operating income and same-store analysis, which allow us to assess our organizational health and operational dynamics effectively. Our focus on collaboration networks and inter-organizational collaboration enhances our capacity to confront unexpected situations and leverage collective processing for improved outcomes. The emphasis on learning organization principles and knowledge management supports our ongoing evolution and transformation, ensuring we remain resilient in the face of future challenges.

The company is managing the challenging supply chain environment through its "local for local" manufacturing strategy, ongoing supplier management process, and broadened supply base. We are also managing the inflationary cost environment through a variety of cost and pricing measures, including continuous improvement and lean initiatives. Additionally, we are strategically managing our workforce and discretionary spending while appropriately addressing the ongoing needs of our business to continue serving our customers. The company intends to focus primarily on business opportunities in areas such as energy, water, food, environment, defense, life sciences, infrastructure, and transportation. We believe we can meet our strategic objectives by serving the customer and continuously enhancing its experience with the company, successfully executing the win strategy initiatives relating to engaged people, premier customer experience, profitable growth, and financial performance. The diversified industrial segment operations experienced significant changes in net sales, reflecting higher demand from distributors and end users across various markets, including agriculture, life sciences, and construction equipment. Operating margins increased primarily due to higher sales volume and benefits from continuous improvement initiatives, although these increases were partially offset by operating costs resulting from ongoing disruption within the current supply chain environment and labor market. Business realignment activities aimed at reducing organizational and process complexity have been undertaken, which included severance costs and plant closures. The company anticipates that cost savings realized from workforce reduction measures will increase operating income in the future. The increase in backlog was primarily due to orders exceeding shipments, indicating a robust demand environment. The company is also addressing the impact of the global outbreak of COVID-19 and governmental actions taken in response, while the ongoing economic and political uncertainty resulting from the Russia-Ukraine war continues to pose challenges. The company has implemented heightened prevention, screening, and hygiene protocols to minimize the spread of COVID-19 in workplaces. The extent to which our business and results of operations will be impacted by these uncertainties depends on future developments that remain uncertain, including the severity and duration of the Russia-Ukraine war, distribution and effectiveness of vaccines, and the severity and spread of COVID-19 and its variants. The company is actively monitoring its liquidity position and remains focused on managing its inventory and working capital requirements, targeting two percent of sales for capital expenditures related to safety and strategic investments. The proposed acquisition of Meggitt is expected to strengthen the company’s portfolio and enhance its capabilities to respond to market demands. The company has entered into various financing agreements to support this acquisition, which include bridge credit agreements and senior unsecured financing. The company continues to identify opportunities to improve liquidity and working capital efficiency, including extending payment terms with suppliers. The strategic initiatives and actions taken reflect the company’s commitment to resilience, adaptability, and maintaining operational continuity under challenging conditions.

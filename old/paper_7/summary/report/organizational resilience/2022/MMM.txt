3M is impacted by the global pandemic and related effects associated with the coronavirus (COVID-19). Given the diversity of 3M's businesses, some factors relative to COVID-19 increase the demand for 3M products, while others decrease demand or make it more difficult for 3M to serve customers. Overall, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on 3M's consolidated results of operations was primarily driven by factors related to changes in demand for products and disruption in global supply chains. 3M is also impacted by the Russia-Ukraine conflict, which has led to supply disruption due to the conflict. Though 3M monitors relevant factors as well as options to mitigate potential impacts, it is not able to predict the extent to which these circumstances may have a material effect on 3M's consolidated results of operations or financial condition. 3M has experienced interruptions to portions of the manufacturing at its site in Zwijndrecht, Belgium, and has received agreement with authorities to begin the process toward restarting operations at the facility. 3M continues to work with government authorities to comply with applicable legal requirements. The company refers to various "adjusted" amounts or measures on an "adjusted basis," which exclude special items. In 2022, 3M's costs for significant litigation totaled approximately $2.3 billion pre-tax, which included pre-tax charges associated with steps toward resolving combat arms earplugs litigation and commitments to address PFAS-related matters. 3M completed the split-off of its food safety division business, resulting in a pre-tax gain of $2.7 billion, and committed to a plan to exit PFAS manufacturing by the end of 2025, resulting in a pre-tax charge of $0.8 billion related to impairment. 3M's operations are influenced by raw material and logistics costs driven by geopolitical, logistics, and disruptive events that caused imbalances in the global supply chain. The company has prioritized investments in growth and sustainability, which are essential for maintaining operational flexibility and resilience in the face of external pressures. 3M's management continues to assess risks and uncertainties that could affect future results, including those related to environmental disruptions and operational continuity. The company acknowledges that its ability to respond effectively to these challenges is critical for preserving organizational health and ensuring performance under pressure. 3M's strategic initiatives aim to enhance resilience through resource allocation and adaptation strategies that address both immediate and long-term challenges. The ongoing commitment to operational management and strategic adaptation reflects 3M's focus on maintaining positive adjustment under challenging conditions.

The COVID-19 pandemic significantly affected the global economy and strained the hospitality industry beginning in 2020. However, we have experienced strong signs of recovery since early 2021, with comparable system-wide revenue per available room (RevPAR) in the third and fourth quarters of 2022 exceeding levels achieved in the same periods in 2019. Although all periods included in our consolidated financial statements were impacted by the pandemic, we believe that including hotels that temporarily suspended operations reflects the underlying results of our business. Our strategic objectives include the continued expansion of our global hotel network and fee-based business, which supports our resilience strategies by allowing us to grow with limited or no capital investment. We evaluate the economic viability of new hotel additions based on geographic location and the credit quality of third-party owners, which is essential for resource allocation and operational flexibility. The current economic environment has posed challenges to our growth strategy, including delays in openings and new developments. However, we believe that our relationships with third-party hotel owners and franchisees are crucial for maintaining our presence and generating new opportunities for property development. The recovery of the travel and hospitality industry has been driven by increased consumer demand and spending, which has positively impacted our management and franchise fee revenues. In addition, our ability to adapt to changing market conditions and consumer preferences has allowed us to respond effectively to external pressures. We have taken steps to reduce fixed costs to maximize profitability while supporting the long-term sustainability of our brands and business. Our cash management policy aims to maintain liquidity and minimize operational costs, which is vital for our resilience in the face of economic fluctuations. We have continued access to debt markets and expect to obtain financing as required, which enhances our capacity to manage operational resources and support strategic initiatives. The increase in revenues from our owned and leased hotels reflects improved occupancy and average daily rates, indicative of our operational management and adaptability during recovery. We have also resumed share repurchases and quarterly cash dividends, which were previously suspended to preserve cash during the pandemic. Our approach to liquidity and available sources of cash is designed to meet anticipated requirements for operating and other expenditures, ensuring that we can confront future challenges effectively. Overall, our organizational capabilities, including strategic foresight and crisis management, have positioned us to navigate the complexities of the current business environment while maintaining performance under pressure.

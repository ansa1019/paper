In March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the outbreak of a new strain of coronavirus (COVID-19) a pandemic, which led to certain customers in our small- and large-container businesses adjusting their service levels, including a decrease in the frequency of pickups or a temporary pause in service. We experienced a decline in volumes disposed at certain of our landfills and transfer stations, but as service levels decreased, we also experienced a decrease in certain costs of our operations that are variable in nature. This decline in service activity peaked in 2020 and has improved sequentially thereafter, returning to pre-pandemic levels in 2022. Our operational flexibility and adaptability were tested during this period, and we focused on resource allocation to mitigate risks associated with the pandemic. We expect revenue to be in the range of $14.650 billion to $14.800 billion in 2023, driven by pricing in excess of cost inflation and profitable volume growth, which reflects our strategic initiatives to enhance organizational resilience. The acquisition of US Ecology on May 2, 2022, valued at $2.2 billion, expands our environmental solutions footprint and enhances our ability to provide comprehensive services from collection to disposal. This strategic acquisition is part of our ongoing efforts to reconfigure our operational capabilities and strengthen our competitive advantage in the market. The financial results of US Ecology are included within our Group 3 reportable segment, which focuses on environmental solutions. Our revenue for the year ended December 31, 2022, increased by 19.6% compared to the previous year, attributed to increased volume, average yield, and acquisitions. We are engaged in 73 landfill gas-to-energy and other renewable energy projects, demonstrating our commitment to sustainability and adaptability in a turbulent market. Our operational management strategies include investing in technology to improve productivity and increase customer retention, which are essential for maintaining performance under pressure. We incurred restructuring charges primarily related to the redesign of our enterprise resource planning systems, which are expected to enhance our organizational capabilities and efficiency. Our liquidity and capital resources are positioned to support our operational needs and strategic growth initiatives, ensuring we can confront future challenges effectively. We have established financial assurance requirements to comply with environmental regulations, which reflect our commitment to operational integrity and risk management. Our ability to foresee and respond to environmental disruptions is critical for maintaining organizational health and effectiveness. The integration of US Ecology is expected to be substantially complete by the end of 2023, further solidifying our resilience strategies. We continue to evaluate our operational practices to ensure we can adapt to changing market conditions and customer needs, thereby enhancing our organizational coherence and agility.

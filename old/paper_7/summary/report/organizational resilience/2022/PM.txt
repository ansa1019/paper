Since the onset of the war in Ukraine, our main priority has been the safety and security of our more than 1,300 employees and their families in the country. PMI has helped to evacuate more than 1,000 people from Ukraine and relocate over 2,700 others from conflict zones to locations in the country away from the heaviest fighting; provided critical aid to employees who cannot leave or who decide to remain in Ukraine; and provided those who have left the country with a range of support in neighboring countries. We are continuing to pay salaries to all our Ukrainian employees and are also providing substantial in-kind support to them and their families. In addition, we have contributed approximately $10 million in funds and donated essential items across the country. On February 25, 2022, in order to preserve the safety of our employees, we announced the temporary suspension of our commercial and manufacturing operations in Ukraine, including at our factory in Kharkiv. We subsequently resumed some retail activities where safety allowed, in order to provide product availability and service to adult consumers, and began to supply the market from production centers outside Ukraine, as well as through a contract manufacturing arrangement. Production at our factory in Kharkiv remains suspended. We employ more than 3,200 people in Russia and will continue to support our employees there, including paying their salaries, while continuing to fulfill our legal obligations. We will continue to make decisions with employee safety and security as a priority. On March 24, 2022, we announced the concrete steps we had taken to suspend planned investments and scale down our manufacturing operations in Russia, including the discontinuation of a number of cigarette products; the suspension of our marketing activities; the cancellation of all product launches planned for 2022, including Iluma; and the cancellation of our plans to manufacture heated tobacco units for Iluma in Russia. We are continuously assessing the evolving situation in Russia, including recent regulatory constraints in the market that entail very complex terms and conditions that must be met for any divestment transaction to be granted approval by the authorities; and restrictions resulting from international regulations. These developments above have and will continue to have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial position, and may result in impairment charges. The war in Ukraine has necessitated a reevaluation of our operational strategies and resource allocation to ensure business continuity and employee welfare amidst significant external pressures. Our ability to adapt to these unexpected situations reflects our commitment to maintaining operational flexibility and resilience in the face of adversity. The strategic initiatives undertaken during this period demonstrate our focus on preserving organizational health and ensuring the safety of our workforce while navigating complex geopolitical challenges. The ongoing situation emphasizes the importance of crisis management and preparedness in sustaining our operational capabilities and ensuring the long-term viability of our business in turbulent markets.

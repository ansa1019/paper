Cintas helps more than one million businesses of all types and sizes get ready to open their doors with confidence every day by providing a wide range of products and services that enhance customers' image and help keep their facilities and employees clean, safe, and looking their best. The company’s strategy is to achieve revenue growth for all products and services by increasing penetration at existing customers and broadening the customer base to include market segments not historically served. Frequent contact with customers enables the development of close personal relationships, which provides a platform for launching additional products and services. The COVID-19 pandemic impacted Cintas' ability to conduct normal business operations, adversely affecting some customers' ability to pay timely. In response, Cintas increased inventory, primarily personal protective equipment and facility services inventory, to meet customer needs and demand associated with safety and cleanliness requirements. The ongoing rollout of COVID-19 vaccines and the gradual lifting of restrictions positively impacted the business, although uncertainty remains about the pace of economic recovery and its impact on future results. The company regularly reviews its operating segments for reporting purposes based on information its chief operating decision maker regularly reviews for resource allocation and performance assessment. Cintas evaluates operating segment performance based on revenue and income before income taxes, ensuring operational flexibility and adaptability in response to external pressures. The company’s liquidity and capital resources are supported by cash flows from operating activities, which have historically provided a significant source of liquidity to fund operations and expansion activities. Cintas has access to a $2.0 billion revolving credit facility, which enhances its financial resilience in a turbulent market environment. The company has experienced significant impacts from inflation, including higher labor, fuel, and transportation costs, but management has been able to mitigate these pressures through pricing and various efficiency initiatives. Cintas' ability to respond effectively to environmental disruptions and transform itself to emerge stronger from challenging situations reflects its organizational resilience. The company maintains a focus on strategic acquisitions and evaluates opportunities as they arise, which contributes to its capacity for growth and adaptation. The management's proactive measures and strategic foresight are essential in navigating complex situations and ensuring organizational survival.

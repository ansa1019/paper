We are focused on maintaining high cash margins and a low-cost structure to drive an increasing return on capital and operational excellence, and to mitigate inflationary pressures through improvements and efficiencies in our drilling and completion programs. Our capital budget for 2023 is $2.50 billion to $2.70 billion, and we intend to remain flexible and use a combination of our growing and sustainable base dividend, variable dividend, and opportunistic share repurchase program to generate the highest value proposition for our stockholders. Our strong balance sheet can withstand another down cycle, reflecting our commitment to operational continuity and resilience in the face of economic fluctuations. We have a robust strategy to utilize our free cash flow to meet our quarterly return of capital commitment and for debt repayment rather than expanding our drilling program. The impact of inflation on our business has been insignificant in prior periods; however, we recognize that rising interest rates, global supply chain disruptions, and concerns about potential economic downturns contribute to economic and pricing volatility. We are committed to maintaining operational flexibility and adapting our strategies in response to external pressures and market conditions. Our approach includes a trajectory model of organizational resilience that emphasizes the importance of reconfiguring our operational strategies in response to disruptive events while ensuring the maintenance of integrity and performance. We have also implemented significant enhancements to our commitment to environmental, social responsibility, and governance performance and disclosure, which reflects our proactive measures in managing risks associated with environmental disruptions. Our ongoing initiatives to reduce greenhouse gas intensity and end routine flaring by 2025 demonstrate our focus on sustainability and adaptability in our operations. We are continuously assessing our operational resources and capabilities to ensure effective resource deployment and management, which is crucial for navigating complex situations and maintaining organizational health. Our strategic initiatives are designed to enhance our resilience strategies, enabling us to confront and benefit from sudden disruptive changes while ensuring our organizational success and survival in turbulent markets. We are focused on building collaborative networks and enhancing our organizational learning processes to foster innovation and adaptability. Our financial resources, including cash flows from operations and available borrowings, support our liquidity and capital management program, which is essential for addressing future financial obligations and capital expenditure activities. We believe that our strategic planning and proactive measures will position us to effectively manage uncertainties and enhance our organizational resilience in the face of evolving market dynamics.

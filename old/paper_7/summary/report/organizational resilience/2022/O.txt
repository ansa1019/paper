We invest in people and places to deliver dependable monthly dividends that increase over time. Our diversified portfolio consists of owned or held interests in 12,237 properties, with an occupancy rate of 99.0%, indicating operational effectiveness and resilience in maintaining high occupancy levels despite market fluctuations. We believe that our cash and cash equivalents on hand, cash provided from operating activities, and borrowing capacity is sufficient to meet our liquidity needs for the next twelve months, reflecting our preparedness for unexpected situations. Our conservative capital structure aims to mitigate financial exposure and maintain operational flexibility, which is crucial for adapting to external pressures and environmental disruptions. We expect to fund our operating expenses and other short-term liquidity requirements primarily through cash provided by operating activities and additional borrowings under our revolving credit facility, demonstrating our strategic response to resource needs and operational continuity. 

The increase in total revenue primarily relates to the merger with Vereit and acquisitions, showcasing our ability to absorb strain and preserve functioning despite the presence of adversity. We have a $4.25 billion unsecured revolving multicurrency credit facility that matures in June 2026, which allows us to respond effectively to financial demands and maintain resilience in our capital structure. We regularly review our credit facility and commercial paper programs and may seek to extend, renew, or replace these programs as deemed appropriate, reflecting our proactive measures in crisis management and strategic planning. 

Our strategy of primarily holding properties long-term decreases the likelihood of carrying values not being recoverable, thus enhancing our organizational health and resilience. The impairments recorded in previous years were primarily triggered by the COVID-19 pandemic, highlighting the need for robust risk assessment and management strategies in the face of external disturbances. We have established a trajectory model of organizational resilience that focuses on how we project temporal trajectories of responses toward disruptive events and reconfigure these trajectories toward the future, which is essential for maintaining performance under pressure.

We believe that our stockholders are best served by a conservative capital structure, which includes maintaining solid interest and fixed charge coverage ratios. Our ability to foresee and confront sudden disruptive changes is reflected in our operational management and strategic initiatives, which are designed to enhance our competitive advantage and ensure organizational survival. The increase in general and administrative expenses is primarily due to higher payroll-related costs and corporate-level professional fees associated with the growth of the company, including the merger with Vereit, demonstrating our commitment to investing in human capital and organizational learning. 

Our cash reserves and liquidity management strategies are critical in supporting our operational resources and ensuring we can navigate complex situations effectively. We expect that inflation will cause lease provisions to result in rent increases over time, which is vital for sustaining our revenue streams and enhancing our resilience against economic fluctuations.

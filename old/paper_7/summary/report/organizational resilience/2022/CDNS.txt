Our business model provides some resilience against macroeconomic factors, and we continuously monitor the direct and indirect impacts of these or similar circumstances on our business and financial results. The ongoing geopolitical conflict and the COVID-19 pandemic have posed a variety of challenges to our day-to-day operations; however, we have implemented policies and practices that have enabled us to support critical operations and execute our strategy. The termination of our operations in Russia has not limited our ability to develop or support our products and has not had a material impact on our results of operations, financial condition, liquidity, or cash flows. We expect the impact of expanded trade restrictions on our business to be limited based on our current assessments. Despite the challenges posed by the pandemic, we have not experienced a material adverse impact on our results of operations, financial condition, liquidity, or cash flows. Our strategy is to provide the technology necessary for our customers to develop products across a variety of vertical markets, which enhances our ability to pursue attractive opportunities in the markets we serve. We completed acquisitions that are expected to add important new technologies and capabilities to our system design and analysis technology portfolio, thereby improving our operational flexibility and resilience. Our investments in research and development activities and technical sales support reflect our commitment to maintaining organizational health and adaptability in the face of external pressures. We recognize that our performance is significantly influenced by business levels and the payment terms set forth in our customer agreements, and we continuously evaluate our assumptions and estimates to ensure they align with our operational objectives. The increase in cash flows from operating activities during fiscal 2022 was primarily due to improved results from operations and the timing of cash receipts from customers and disbursements made to vendors. We expect that our current cash and cash equivalent balances and cash flows generated from operations will be sufficient to meet the needs of our domestic and international operating activities and other capital and liquidity requirements for the foreseeable future. Our operating margin increased during fiscal 2022, as revenue growth in each of our product categories exceeded growth in operating expenses, indicating our ability to maintain performance under pressure. We have established a trajectory model of organizational resilience that focuses on how we project responses toward disruptive events and reconfigure our strategies to adapt to future challenges. Our organizational practices emphasize the importance of collaboration networks and strategic initiatives that enhance our resilience and ability to confront adversity. The multifaceted nature of our operations requires us to remain vigilant in assessing risks and opportunities, ensuring that we can effectively respond to environmental disruptions while maintaining our competitive advantage.

During 2022, the company updated its disaggregated net revenue presentation by category and geography to reflect the nature of its payment services and to align such information with the way in which management will prospectively view its categories of net revenue. We connect consumers, financial institutions, merchants, governments, digital partners, businesses and other organizations worldwide by enabling electronic payments instead of cash and checks and making those payment transactions safe, simple, smart, and accessible. Our investments in new networks, such as open banking solutions and digital identity capabilities, support and strengthen our payments and services solutions. Throughout the process of suspending operations in Russia, our priority has been the safety and well-being of our employees and their families, indicating a focus on organizational health and resilience in the face of external pressures. The full extent to which the Russian invasion of Ukraine affects our business, results of operations, and financial condition will depend on future developments, including the duration of the invasion and the impacts on regional and global economies, which are uncertain and cannot be predicted at this time. We continue to monitor the effects of the Russian invasion of Ukraine and the related impacts to regional and global economies, demonstrating our commitment to adaptability and preparedness in unexpected situations. The company generated net cash flows from operations of $11.2 billion, which reflects our operational flexibility and resilience strategies in managing financial resources effectively. Our liquidity and access to capital could be negatively impacted by global credit market conditions, emphasizing the importance of risk management and resource allocation in maintaining operational continuity. We guarantee the settlement of many transactions between our customers, and while historical trends may not indicate potential future losses, the risk of loss on these guarantees is specific to individual customers and may also be driven by regional or global economic conditions. We believe that our existing cash, cash equivalents, and investment securities balances, along with our cash flow generating capabilities, are sufficient to satisfy our future operating cash needs, capital asset purchases, and other liquidity requirements, which is crucial for sustaining organizational resilience. The companyâ€™s strategic initiatives across payments, services, and new networks are supported by higher personnel costs, indicating a commitment to resource generation and organizational capabilities. The effective income tax rate was lower in 2022 primarily due to a discrete tax benefit related to final U.S. tax regulations, which reflects our strategic response to changing regulatory environments. We continue to evaluate our ongoing operations in relation to historical results, facilitating an understanding of our organizational effectiveness and resilience in a turbulent market. The adjustments made to our financial measures and the presentation of currency-neutral growth rates provide relevant information to facilitate an understanding of our operating results, which is essential for maintaining performance under pressure and ensuring organizational success.

In fiscal 2022, we continued to promote adoption of our most predictive scores, including the FICOÂ® Resilience Index, which identifies consumers who are more resilient to economic stress relative to others within the same FICO score bands. This strategic initiative reflects our focus on enhancing organizational resilience by understanding and addressing customer needs in the face of external pressures. Our transition from private data centers to external service providers for hosting technology infrastructure demonstrates our commitment to operational flexibility and resource reallocation to higher-value areas, facilitating adaptation to changing market conditions. The increase in total revenue to $1.4 billion, a 5% increase from fiscal 2021, indicates our ability to maintain performance under pressure, despite challenges such as a 3% negative impact from a prior business divestiture. Our annual recurring revenue for the software segment increased to $569.3 million, a 9% increase from the previous year, showcasing our resilience in sustaining growth through strategic management of resources and operational continuity. The dollar-based net retention rate of 107% during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022 reflects our success in retaining and growing revenue from existing customers, which is a crucial aspect of organizational effectiveness and resilience. We regard annual contract value bookings as an important indicator of future revenues, which underscores our proactive measures in anticipating and responding to market demands. The strategic shift to emphasize software over services and the divestiture of lower-margin businesses are indicative of our efforts to enhance organizational strength and agility in a turbulent market environment. Our operating income of $542.4 million during fiscal 2022, a 7% increase from fiscal 2021, further illustrates our capacity to adapt and thrive amidst challenges. The decrease in operating expenses, driven by strategic cost initiatives and a reduction in headcount, highlights our focus on resource management and operational efficiency. We believe our cash and cash equivalents, along with available borrowings, will be sufficient to fund our working capital requirements, which is essential for maintaining resilience in the face of unexpected situations. Our assessment of goodwill for impairment and the absence of significant changes in our estimates reflect our commitment to organizational health and stability. The strategic planning and foresight demonstrated in our financial management, including the ability to navigate through economic fluctuations and uncertainties, reinforce our organizational resilience and capacity for transformation. Overall, our performance metrics and strategic initiatives illustrate our ongoing commitment to fostering a resilient organizational framework capable of sustaining growth and adapting to evolving market conditions.

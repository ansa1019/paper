We experienced earnings growth in 2022, compared with 2021, due primarily to increased producer activity across our operations, higher realized commodity prices, and higher average fee rates. In 2023, we expect to benefit from higher volumes and the expected completion of our mb-5 ngl fractionator, highlighting our extensive and integrated assets located in productive shale basins. Following the medford incident, we developed claims and recorded accruals for expected insurance recoveries, which include business interruption insurance that covers incurred costs and losses to mitigate losses and lost earnings. We expect to continue operating ngl pipeline assets in medford and are preserving certain assets for future potential ngl facilities. We reached an agreement with our insurers to settle all claims related to the medford incident for total insurance payments of $930 million, which will impact our cash from operations in 2023 and 2024 due to incurred costs and losses. Our growth strategy focuses on connecting diversified supply basins with purity ngls demand from the petrochemical and refining industries. We operate an integrated, reliable, and diversified network of ngl and natural gas gathering, processing, fractionation, transportation, and storage assets. Our capital-growth projects, including the construction of the demicks lake iii natural gas processing plant and the mb-5 fractionator, are expected to enhance our operational flexibility and performance. We assess our financial performance using various metrics, including operating income and adjusted ebitda, which reflect our ability to maintain performance under pressure. Our business interruption insurance accruals primarily represent third-party fractionation costs, fully offsetting actual losses incurred. We believe we have sufficient liquidity due to our credit agreement and access to equity programs, allowing us to manage operational continuity and resource needs effectively. We utilize derivatives to reduce market-risk exposure and achieve predictable cash flows, which supports our resilience strategies. We assess our goodwill for impairment annually and consider macroeconomic conditions and overall financial performance to ensure organizational health. Our operational management includes a centralized cash management program to provide financial flexibility and lower costs. We expect total capital expenditures to be between $1.3 billion and $1.5 billion in 2023, driven by our capital-growth projects. We have material cash commitments related to capital expenditures and senior notes, which we expect to fund through operating cash flows. Our credit ratings, which are investment grade, may be affected by our leverage and liquidity, impacting our ability to borrow funds. We are committed to maintaining our operational effectiveness and adapting to market conditions, ensuring our organizational resilience in the face of external pressures and disruptions.

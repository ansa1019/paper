In 2022, we initiated several measures to pursue greater efficiency and to realign our business and strategic priorities, which included a facilities consolidation strategy and a layoff of approximately 11,000 employees. Our restructuring efforts aimed at enhancing operational flexibility and adapting to a challenging macroeconomic environment. We believe that the ongoing changes in our advertising systems are necessary to improve performance and maintain our competitive advantage in the face of external pressures, such as inflation and regulatory changes impacting our ad targeting and measurement tools. Our investments in artificial intelligence and machine learning are part of our strategy to enhance our operational capabilities and adapt to evolving market conditions. The COVID-19 pandemic has also influenced our business dynamics, leading to fluctuations in advertising demand and user engagement, which we continuously assess to inform our strategic response. 

We recognize the importance of maintaining organizational health and resilience through effective resource allocation and management of operational resources. Our approach to crisis management emphasizes preparedness and the ability to confront unexpected situations, which is critical for sustaining performance under pressure. The complexity of our operational environment necessitates a systemic perspective on risk assessment and mitigation strategies, ensuring that we can absorb strain and preserve functioning despite adversities. 

We are committed to fostering an organizational culture that supports innovation and learning, enabling us to reconfigure our strategies in response to disruptive events. The integration of new technologies and the development of collaborative networks are essential to our resilience strategies, as they enhance our capacity to generate resources and adapt to changing customer needs. Our focus on strategic initiatives and inter-organizational collaboration is aimed at achieving major objectives while navigating the turbulent markets we operate in.

As we continue to evolve, we anticipate that our ability to maintain positive adjustment under challenging conditions will be tested by ongoing economic and regulatory developments. The strategic planning efforts we undertake are designed to ensure that we remain agile and responsive to the demands of the business environment, thereby reinforcing our organizational resilience. Our commitment to transparency and effective communication about our initiatives and their implications is integral to our strategy for sustaining long-term growth and organizational success. 

In summary, our operational management practices are centered on enhancing organizational effectiveness and resilience, enabling us to thrive in a landscape characterized by uncertainty and rapid change. We are focused on leveraging our organizational capabilities to foster a learning organization that can adapt and flourish in the face of adversity.

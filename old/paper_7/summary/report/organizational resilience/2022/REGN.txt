Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. is a fully integrated biotechnology company that invents, develops, manufactures, and commercializes medicines for people with serious diseases. Our ability to generate profits and positive cash flow from operations depends significantly on the continued success in commercializing Eylea and Dupixent, as well as on whether we can obtain regulatory approval for Aflibercept 8 mg and successfully commercialize it. We expect to incur substantial expenses related to our research and development activities, which are expected to expand and require additional resources. The financial results may fluctuate and will depend on various factors, including the continuation of collaborations, the scope and progress of our research and development efforts, and the timing of certain expenses. Our collaboration agreements may require us to deliver various rights, services, and/or goods across the entire life cycle of a product or product candidate, necessitating an assessment of whether each promise represents a separate obligation or should be combined as a single unit of account. We recognize revenue from product sales when our customer is deemed to have obtained control of the product, which may vary due to rebates, chargebacks, and discounts provided under governmental and other programs. The preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts and related disclosures, and if actual experience differs from these assumptions, the resulting changes could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. The uncertainties associated with drug development include safety and efficacy data, enrollment and performance of clinical trials, changes in regulatory requirements, and the competitive landscape affecting product candidates. The lengthy process of seeking FDA and other applicable approvals requires substantial resources, and any failure to obtain or delay in obtaining regulatory approvals could materially adversely affect our business. We believe that our existing capital resources, borrowing availability under the 2022 credit facility, and funds generated by anticipated product sales will enable us to meet our anticipated operating needs for the foreseeable future. We expect continued increases in expenditures, particularly in connection with our research and development activities. The amount of funding required for our clinical programs depends upon various factors, including the results of our research, regulatory requirements, and the estimated costs of trials. We also anticipate substantial commercialization costs for our marketed products, which will depend on market potential, whether costs are shared with collaborators, and regulatory approval of additional product candidates. We enter into collaboration and licensing agreements that may require us to pay amounts contingent upon the occurrence of various future events, which have a high degree of uncertainty. Our contingent reimbursement obligations to collaborators will affect our share of profits from sales under collaborations, which we expect to use to reimburse these obligations. The company was in compliance with all covenants of the 2022 credit agreement as of December 31, 2022. The agreements governing our lease financing contain financial and operating covenants, and we were in compliance with all such covenants as of December 31, 2022.

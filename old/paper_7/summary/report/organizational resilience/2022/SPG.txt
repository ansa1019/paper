The COVID-19 pandemic had a material negative impact on economic and market conditions around the world, leading to significant changes in the ability to recognize revenue due to changes in the assessment of the probability of collection of lease income and asset impairment charges. In response to the pandemic, the company implemented a series of actions to reduce costs and increase liquidity, including significantly reducing all non-essential corporate spending and property operating expenses, as well as suspending redevelopment and new development projects. As the economic environment has recovered from the pandemic, operations have returned to more normalized pre-pandemic levels. The company seeks growth in earnings and cash flows by enhancing the profitability and operation of properties through attracting high-quality tenants and utilizing economies of scale to reduce operating expenses. The company routinely reviews and evaluates acquisition opportunities based on their ability to enhance the portfolio, and its international strategy includes partnering with established real estate companies to minimize foreign exchange risk. The company employs a three-fold capital strategy to provide necessary capital for growth, maintain flexibility to access capital, and manage its financial structure to preserve investment grade credit ratings. The company considers funds from operations, comparable funds from operations, and net operating income as key measures of operating performance. The company has experienced material impacts from governmental measures intended to control the spread of COVID-19, including restrictions on movement and business operations. The company has also recorded gains related to property insurance recoveries of previously depreciated assets due to natural disasters. The company’s financing strategy relies primarily on long-term fixed-rate debt, and it has historically had access to public equity markets and various forms of debt financing. The company believes it has sufficient cash on hand and availability under credit facilities to address its debt maturities and capital needs. The company expects to generate positive cash flow from operations and considers these projected cash flows in its sources and uses of cash. A significant deterioration in projected cash flows could lead to increased reliance on available funds from credit facilities, further curtailing planned capital expenditures. The company’s business model requires it to regularly access debt markets for acquisition, development, and refinancing activities. The company’s operational flexibility and strategic initiatives are designed to enhance its resilience in the face of external pressures and disruptions, thereby maintaining organizational health and effectiveness. The company’s approach to managing risks includes assessing operational performance measures and tenant financial conditions, particularly in light of the challenges posed by the pandemic and other environmental disturbances. The company’s focus on high-quality real estate across the retail spectrum and its strategic response to market changes are indicative of its commitment to organizational resilience and adaptability in a turbulent business environment.

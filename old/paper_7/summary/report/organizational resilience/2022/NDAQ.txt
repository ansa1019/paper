In September 2022, we announced a new organizational structure which aligns our businesses more closely with the foundational shifts that are driving the evolution of the global financial system. This new corporate structure includes three business segments: market platforms, capital access platforms, and anti-financial crime. The changes in our organizational structure are intended to enhance our operational flexibility and adaptability in response to external pressures and disruptive events. Management allocates resources, assesses performance, and manages these businesses as three separate segments, which reflects our strategic initiatives aimed at maintaining organizational health and resilience. The comparability of our results of operations between reported periods is impacted by the acquisition of Verafin, which has contributed to our ability to absorb strain and improve functioning despite the presence of adversity. Our operating results indicate a focus on performance maintenance and recovery strategies, particularly in the face of environmental perturbations and market volatility. We have pursued various strategic initiatives and completed acquisitions and divestitures in recent years, which have resulted in expenses that would not have otherwise been incurred. These efforts are aimed at enhancing our organizational capabilities and ensuring operational continuity. The increase in compensation and benefits expense in 2022 was driven by continued investment in employees to drive growth, reflecting our commitment to resource generation and organizational strength. The strategic alignment of our segments is designed to facilitate knowledge absorption and enhance our competitive advantage in a turbulent market environment. Our financial performance metrics, such as annualized recurring revenue, serve as indicators of our organizational effectiveness and trajectory in the face of changing market conditions. We have implemented policies and procedures to measure, manage, monitor, and report risk exposures, which are reviewed regularly by management and the board of directors. This proactive approach to risk management is critical for maintaining system integrity and resilience. Our ability to respond effectively to environmental disruptions is further supported by our focus on strategic adaptation and operational management. The ongoing assessment of our performance under pressure and the implementation of crisis response mechanisms are essential components of our organizational resilience strategy. We recognize the importance of stakeholder engagement and inter-organizational collaboration in navigating complex situations and ensuring long-term sustainability. The financial health of our organization is reflected in our liquidity and capital resources, which remain robust, allowing us to confront challenges and seize opportunities for growth. The strategic foresight embedded in our operational planning underscores our commitment to organizational transformation and evolution in an ever-changing business landscape.

Management believes effective risk management is vital to the success of business activities, and accordingly, the firm has an enterprise risk management (ERM) framework to integrate diverse roles of risk management into a holistic structure and facilitate the incorporation of risk assessment into decision-making processes across the firm. The fast-paced, complex, and constantly evolving nature of global financial markets requires the maintenance of a risk management culture that is incisive and knowledgeable about specialized products and markets, subject to ongoing review and enhancement. The firm's risk appetite defines the aggregate level and types of risk that the firm is willing to accept to achieve its business objectives, taking into account the interests of clients and fiduciary duties to shareholders, as well as capital and other regulatory requirements. This risk appetite is embedded in the risk culture and linked to short-term and long-term strategic, capital, and financial plans, as well as compensation programs. The board oversees the ERM framework and is responsible for ensuring that risks are managed in a sound manner, with committees authorized to facilitate risk oversight responsibilities. The operations and technology committee oversees operational risk, including business continuity and resilience, and reviews risk management and assessment guidelines in coordination with the board. The firm risk committee, co-chaired by the chief executive officer and chief risk officer, monitors capital levels and material risks, overseeing the steps management has taken to manage such risks. The governance structure facilitates efficient and comprehensive supervision of risk exposures and processes, ensuring accountability across business divisions and effective communication of risk matters. The chief risk officer oversees compliance with risk limits and independently reviews material risks, ensuring that the structure and design of incentive compensation arrangements do not encourage excessive risk-taking. The firm employs various risk mitigation strategies, including diversification of risk exposures and hedging, to manage market risks associated with trading activities. The risk management process incorporates stress testing and scenario analyses, allowing the firm to assess the impact of stresses on exposures and capital position. The evaluation of counterparties and borrowers includes an assessment of the probability of default and any losses that may occur when an obligor defaults. The firm actively manages credit risk exposure through a comprehensive risk management framework that identifies, monitors, and limits country risk. Stress tests measure the impact on credit and market exposures of shocks stemming from negative economic or political scenarios, and results may lead to amendments of limits or exposure mitigation. The firm is committed to continuous review and enhancement of risk management processes to capture evolving risks associated with changes in market structure and dynamics, ensuring resilience in the face of environmental disruptions and maintaining operational continuity.

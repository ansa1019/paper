The coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has caused significant disruptions to national and global economies and government activities since March 2020. During this time, we have continued to conduct our operations while responding to the pandemic with actions to mitigate adverse consequences to our employees, business, supply chain, and customers. The Russia-Ukraine conflict could continue to impact future U.S. government defense spending due to the heightened national security threat and the need to replenish stockpiles that have been reduced in support of Ukraine. The long-term outlook for our U.S. defense business is influenced by the U.S. military's funding priorities, the diversity of our programs and customers, our insight into customer requirements stemming from our incumbency on core programs, and our ability to evolve our products to address a fast-changing threat environment. We have seen signals of additional demand for our products and services, indicating a need for adaptability in our operations. Our markets, with approximately 70% of our revenue from the U.S. government, show that government spending levels, particularly defense spending, influence our financial performance. We expect our investment in the development of new aircraft products and technologies to support the segment's long-term growth, reflecting our commitment to service innovation and operational flexibility. The increase in demand for aircraft services, particularly maintenance work, has been driven by growing global air travel, demonstrating our ability to absorb strain and preserve functioning despite external pressures. Our strong operating performance is evidenced by record-high revenue and operating earnings, indicating resilience in navigating supply chain challenges and inflationary pressures across the business. We emphasize cash flow generation, underpinned by an operating discipline focused on cost control and working capital management, which provides us with the flexibility for prudent capital deployment. Our capital deployment priorities include investments in our products and services to drive long-term growth, reflecting a proactive approach to resource allocation. The increase in product revenue was primarily driven by higher volume on significant programs, showcasing our ability to manage operational resources effectively. The marine systems segment's backlog growth indicates our capacity to respond to long-term contracts and programs, which can span several years, demonstrating our organizational strength and resilience in the face of complex situations. We recognize that the ultimate resolution of our exposure related to litigation and other legal proceedings may change as further facts and circumstances become known, which necessitates a robust risk management framework. Our focus on maintaining operational continuity and organizational effectiveness is critical as we navigate through these turbulent markets and external disturbances. The need for strategic adaptation and crisis management is underscored by the evolving geopolitical landscape, which requires us to be agile and responsive to changing conditions. Our commitment to organizational learning and knowledge management is essential for sustaining competitive advantage and ensuring long-term success in a volatile business environment.

Servicenow is a leading provider of enterprise cloud computing solutions that define, structure, manage, and automate services across the global enterprise. Our mission is to help the modern enterprise operate faster and be more scalable by applying a service-oriented lens to the activities, tasks, and processes that comprise day-to-day work life. We continue to invest in the development of our services, infrastructure, and sales and marketing to drive long-term growth. Our solutions empower enterprises to change the way people work, which includes enhancing operational flexibility and adapting to customer needs. We have aggressively invested in our direct sales force and partnerships with our indirect sales channel to grow our customer base, which is a key indicator of our market penetration and future revenues. Our renewal rate has remained high, indicating a strong ability to maintain customer relationships and adapt to changing market conditions. The upsell rate reflects our ability to generate additional sales from existing customers, demonstrating our capacity for resource generation and operational continuity. We calculate our renewal rate by subtracting our attrition rate from 100%, which is indicative of our organizational resilience in maintaining positive adjustment under challenging conditions. Our professional services revenues consist of fees associated with the implementation and configuration of our subscription service, which are critical for ensuring business continuity and customer satisfaction. We recognize that our international operations provide a significant portion of our total revenues, which necessitates a strategic response to external pressures and environmental disruptions. The general strengthening of the U.S. dollar has had an unfavorable impact on our revenues, highlighting the need for effective risk management and adaptability in our financial strategies. We expect our sales and marketing expenses to increase as we expand our direct sales force and grow our international operations, which will require careful resource allocation and strategic planning. Our research and development expenses are focused on enhancing our core platform and developing new applications to fill market needs, reflecting our commitment to innovation and organizational learning. We assess collectibility based on various factors, ensuring that we maintain operational effectiveness and resilience in our financial practices. The increase in our employee headcount is a direct response to the growing demands of our business, indicating our proactive measures to ensure we have the necessary human capital to support our strategic initiatives. We continue to evaluate our accounting policies and significant judgments to ensure they align with our operational goals and market conditions, which is essential for maintaining organizational health and effectiveness. Our ability to foresee and confront challenges in the market is critical for our long-term success and sustainability, as we navigate a complex and rapidly changing business environment.

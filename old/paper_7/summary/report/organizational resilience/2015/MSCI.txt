MSCI offers content, applications, and services to support the needs of institutional investors throughout their investment processes, enabling them to measure and manage risk across all major asset classes. Our growth strategy includes expanding relationships with investment institutions worldwide, developing new and enhancing existing product offerings, and seeking to acquire products, technologies, and companies that will enhance our client base and product offerings. We have significantly invested in and expanded our operating functions and infrastructure, including additional product management, sales, and client support staff, to maximize our medium-term revenue and profit growth while ensuring that MSCI remains a leading provider of investment decision support tools. The rate of growth of our investments and expenses has, in recent years, exceeded that of our revenues, which has slowed the growth of our earnings. We focus on operating metrics, including run rate, subscription sales, and aggregate retention rate, to manage the business effectively. Our business model is characterized by recurring subscriptions, which represent fees earned from clients primarily under renewable contracts or agreements. The contracts state the terms under which these fees are calculated, and we recognize the fees as we provide the product and service to the client over the license period. Our revenues are also influenced by asset-based fees linked to our indexes, which are recognized based on the estimated assets under management. 

We utilize a portfolio of key financial metrics to manage the company, including GAAP and non-GAAP measures, and we review revenues by type and by segment. The aggregate retention rate is crucial as subscription cancellations decrease our run rate and ultimately our operating revenues. We believe that our liquidity, along with other financing alternatives, will provide the necessary capital to fund acquisitions and achieve planned growth. Our contractual obligations consist primarily of leases for office space, vendor obligations arising from market data contracts, and debt obligations from the issuance of senior notes. The 2014 revolving credit agreement and the indentures governing our senior notes contain covenants that limit our ability to incur additional indebtedness or engage in transactions that could affect our operational flexibility. As of December 31, 2015, we maintained a consolidated leverage ratio of 3.08:1.00 and a consolidated interest coverage ratio of 8.64:1.00, indicating our capacity to manage financial obligations effectively. We believe that our operational continuity and strategic initiatives will enable us to adapt to environmental disruptions and maintain resilience in our business operations.

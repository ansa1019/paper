During fiscal 2015, we continued to generate significant free cash flow used to enhance shareholder value through investments in long-term growth initiatives; acquisitions of relevant technologies and products that strengthen our portfolio and competitive position; and our share repurchase program. We leveraged the financial crime and compliance technology to integrate with our existing fraud detection and analytics to provide broader, more responsive fraud solutions for our customers. We also returned significant cash to shareholders through our stock repurchase program. Our acquisition of tonbeller addresses the rapidly growing demand for integrated, enterprise-class financial crime and compliance solutions, which reflects our ability to adapt to external pressures and enhance operational flexibility. We continued to invest in our growth initiatives that expand our addressable markets, demonstrating our commitment to organizational resilience through strategic initiatives and resource allocation. The increase in compliance solutions was attributable to our acquisition of tonbeller, which showcases our capacity for transformation and innovation in response to market demands. We are shifting some of our resources to distribution of our expanded market, indicating our proactive measures to reconfigure our operational strategies in the face of changing conditions. We have more than 100 million consumers with access to their free score through the fico® score open access program, which allows our participating clients to provide their customers with a free fico® score along with materials to help them understand what affects their score, demonstrating our focus on customer needs and knowledge absorption. Our calculations of bookings have varying degrees of certainty depending on the revenue type and individual contract terms, indicating our awareness of the complexities and uncertainties inherent in our business environment. We derive a significant portion of revenue internationally, and a significant share of revenue from transactional or unit-based software license fees, reflecting our adaptability to diverse market conditions. The margin decrease was primarily attributable to an increase in our restructuring cost related to the write-down of facilities, which underscores the importance of risk management and operational continuity in maintaining organizational health. We expect that research and development expenditures as a percentage of revenues will be consistent with or slightly lower than those incurred during fiscal 2015, which reflects our ongoing commitment to innovation and strategic foresight. Our effective tax rates were influenced by favorable settlements and adjustments, which highlight our organizational capabilities in navigating regulatory environments. We evaluate the merits of acquiring technology or businesses, or establishing strategic relationships, indicating our future orientation and preparedness for potential disruptions. Our ability to respond effectively to environmental disruptions and transform ourselves to emerge stronger from challenging situations is a testament to our organizational resilience. We believe these balances, as well as available borrowings from our revolving line of credit and anticipated cash flows from operating activities, will be sufficient to fund our working and other capital requirements, showcasing our resource generation capabilities.

We are one of the largest global pharmaceutical sourcing and distribution services companies, helping both healthcare providers and pharmaceutical and biotech manufacturers improve patient access to products and enhance patient care. Our operations are organized based upon the products and services we provide to our customers, which include drug distribution and related services designed to reduce healthcare costs and improve patient outcomes. We deliver innovative programs and services designed to increase the effectiveness and efficiency of the pharmaceutical supply chain in both human and animal health. The pharmaceutical distribution segment's operations provide a comprehensive offering of brand-name and generic pharmaceuticals, over-the-counter healthcare products, home healthcare supplies and equipment, and related services to a wide variety of healthcare providers. Our use of the term "specialty" refers to drugs used to treat complex diseases, which generally require ongoing clinical monitoring. We believe that our strategic initiatives, including the acquisition of Pharmedium Healthcare Holdings, Inc., enhance our operational flexibility and resilience in the face of market changes. The acquisition is expected to contribute to our ability to absorb strain and preserve functioning despite the presence of adversity. Our revenue growth has been driven by increased sales of brand and generic products, as well as the strong growth of our specialty distribution businesses. We anticipate that our future revenue growth will continue to be affected by various factors such as industry growth trends, competition, and changes in pharmaceutical manufacturer pricing and distribution policies. Our operating results have generated cash flow, which, together with availability under our debt agreements, has provided sufficient capital resources to finance working capital and cash operating requirements. We have increased seasonal needs related to our inventory build, which can require the use of our credit facilities to fund short-term capital needs. The increase in days payable outstanding has benefited from the increase in purchases of generic pharmaceuticals, which have longer payment terms than brand-name pharmaceuticals. Our cash flows from operating activities can vary significantly from period to period based on fluctuations in our working capital. We utilize various financial metrics to evaluate our working capital performance, which can be impacted by the timing of cash receipts and disbursements. The increase in gross profit was primarily due to higher brand and generic sales volume, largely attributable to our strategic partnerships and operational adjustments. We recognize that changes affecting our service channels could result in revenue reductions, and we are committed to maintaining our organizational health through effective risk management and operational continuity strategies. Our commitment to innovation and adaptability is reflected in our ongoing investments in technology initiatives and infrastructure, which are essential for sustaining our competitive advantage in a turbulent market environment. The multifaceted nature of our operations requires a systemic perspective to ensure resilience against external pressures and disruptions, enabling us to confront challenges and capitalize on opportunities for growth and success.

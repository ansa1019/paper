Altria Group, Inc.'s access to the operating cash flows of its wholly-owned subsidiaries consists of cash received from the payment of dividends and distributions, and the payment of interest on intercompany loans by its subsidiaries. At December 31, 2015, Altria Group, Inc.'s principal wholly-owned subsidiaries were not limited by long-term debt or other agreements in their ability to pay cash dividends or make other distributions with respect to their equity interests. The financial services and the innovative tobacco products businesses are included in an all other category due to the continued reduction of the lease portfolio of PMCC and the relative financial contribution of Altria Group, Inc.'s innovative tobacco products businesses to Altria Group, Inc.'s consolidated results. The changes in Altria Group, Inc.'s net earnings and diluted earnings per share attributable to Altria Group, Inc. for the year ended December 31, 2015, from the year ended December 31, 2014, were due primarily to higher income from the smokeable products and smokeless products segments and lower interest and other debt expense, net. The increase of $470 million in operations was partially offset by lower earnings from Altria's equity investment in SABMiller. Altria Group, Inc. forecasted that its 2016 full-year adjusted diluted EPS growth rate is expected to be in the range of 7% to 9% over 2015 full-year adjusted diluted EPS.

The factors described in Item 1A represent continuing risks to this forecast.

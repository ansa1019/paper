Much of our focus in fiscal year 2015 was toward transforming our organization to support our strategy of building best-in-class platforms and productivity services for a mobile-first, cloud-first world. We must continue to evolve and adapt over an extended time in pace with this changing environment. Our success is highly dependent on our ability to attract and retain qualified employees. The market for software, devices, and cloud-based services is dynamic and highly competitive, with frequent changes in both technologies and business models. Each industry shift is an opportunity to conceive new products, new technologies, or new ideas that can further transform the industry and our business. We push the boundaries of what is possible through a broad range of research and development activities that seek to identify and address the changing demands of customers, industry trends, and competitive forces. Our investments in devices and infrastructure will increase our operating costs and may decrease our operating margins. We achieved product development milestones, implemented organizational changes, and made strategic and tactical moves to support our central ambitions. Our commercial cloud revenue grew significantly, reflecting continued subscriber growth from our cloud-based offerings. The investments we are making in our commercial cloud and server products are essential to maintaining operational flexibility and adapting to external pressures. We reached over 8 million paid Dynamics seats and refreshed and enhanced Microsoft Dynamics ERP products, which supports our resilience strategies by fostering innovation and responding to customer needs. Our industry is characterized by environmental perturbations that require us to maintain a multifaceted approach to organizational resilience. The ability to absorb strain and preserve functioning despite adversity is crucial for our operational continuity. We have made significant strides in enhancing our organizational capabilities through strategic initiatives and inter-organizational collaboration. The dynamic nature of our business environment necessitates a focus on resource allocation and management to ensure we can confront and recover from unexpected situations. Our operational resources are aligned with our major objectives to support resilience and adaptability in the face of disruptive change. The restructuring of our phone hardware business is an example of how we are reconfiguring our organizational practices to enhance performance under pressure.

Our focus on research and development is aimed at ensuring we remain competitive and can navigate the complexities of the evolving technological landscape. The integration of acquired businesses and the ongoing assessment of our operational effectiveness are critical to our strategy of maintaining organizational strength and coherence.

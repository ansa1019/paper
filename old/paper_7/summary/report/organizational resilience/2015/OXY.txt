In conducting its business, Occidental seeks to limit its financial and political risks. Occidental strives to retain sufficient cash on hand and maintain a low debt to capitalization ratio, which allows Occidental access to capital markets. The company aims to maximize total returns to stockholders through strategies that include investing in projects that generate long-term value and allocating and deploying capital with a focus on achieving returns well in excess of its cost of capital. Occidental's operations are affected by significant volatility due to various market conditions, including price volatility inherent in the oil and gas business. The decline in oil and gas prices during 2015 prompted Occidental to assess the carrying value of all its oil and gas producing assets and development plans for its non-producing assets. As a result, Occidental recorded substantial pre-tax impairment and related charges for both domestic and international assets. The company’s strategy includes minimizing or ceasing involvement in non-core operations, which is expected to improve margins through lower cash operating costs and reduced capital spending. Occidental's oil and gas segment implements its strategy by focusing on operating and developing areas where reserves are known to exist and increasing production from core areas, primarily in the Permian Basin and Colombia. The company employs enhanced oil recovery techniques in mature fields and maintains a disciplined approach toward domestic acquisitions and divestitures. In the chemical segment, Occidental's primary objective is to generate cash flow in excess of its normal capital expenditure requirements and achieve above-cost-of-capital returns. The segment's strategy focuses on being a low-cost producer to maximize cash flow generation. Occidental’s midstream and marketing segment strives to maximize realized value by optimizing the use of its assets and providing access to multiple markets. The segment evaluates opportunities across the value chain and seeks to minimize costs while limiting credit risk exposure. Occidental's operations are subject to stringent environmental regulations, and the company factors environmental expenditures into its business planning process as an integral part of producing quality products responsive to market demand. Occidental's ability to add reserves depends on the success of improved recovery, extension, and discovery projects, which are influenced by reservoir characteristics and technology improvements. The company’s strategic initiatives are designed to enhance operational flexibility and adaptability in response to external pressures and market volatility. Occidental's management believes that its ongoing programs and strategic planning will enable it to maintain operational continuity and effectively respond to adverse conditions, thereby supporting organizational resilience. The company’s focus on capital efficiency and the integration of its operations across segments allows for the reconfiguration of resources to meet changing market demands and customer needs.

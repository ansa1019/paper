The medical technology industry is highly competitive and continues to evolve, with success measured by the development of innovative therapies and the value they bring to stakeholders. We are committed to developing new technologies and providing innovative patient care, which reflects our organizational resilience in responding effectively to environmental disruptions. Our focus on innovation and a robust product pipeline of meaningful new technologies will help us sustain our successes and build long-term value for our shareholders. We believe that our strategic initiatives and investments in research and development, which amounted to 15.4% of our net sales in 2015, are essential for maintaining operational flexibility and adapting to changing market conditions. The healthcare environment presents both opportunities and challenges, requiring us to generate robust clinical and economic evidence to encourage the adoption of innovative new medical therapies. Our ability to absorb strain and preserve functioning despite adversity is demonstrated through our commitment to defending our intellectual property and navigating the complexities of a consolidating industry. The increase in net sales of our transcatheter heart valve therapy products, driven by the successful launches of the Edwards Sapien XT and Sapien 3 valves, exemplifies our capacity for innovation and adaptation in response to customer needs and market demands. We have experienced fluctuations in net income and gross profit, influenced by foreign currency exchange rates and product mix, which highlights the importance of effective resource allocation and risk management strategies. Our financial position reflects our resilience in maintaining performance under pressure, as evidenced by our ability to navigate the impacts of foreign exchange losses and fluctuations in international sales. We continuously assess our operational resources and capabilities to ensure we are well-positioned to confront external pressures and environmental disturbances. Our strategic response to these challenges includes leveraging our organizational strengths and collaborative networks to enhance our competitive advantage. The approval of new products and the acquisition of companies, such as Cardiaq, further demonstrate our proactive measures to ensure future growth and organizational survival. We recognize the significance of organizational learning and knowledge management in fostering resilience, as we adapt to complex situations and strive for operational continuity. Our commitment to innovation and strategic foresight is essential for navigating the turbulent markets we operate in, ensuring that we can foresee and respond to disruptive changes effectively. The multifaceted nature of our operations requires us to engage in inter-organizational collaboration and maintain a focus on sustainability, which are critical components of our organizational health and resilience strategies.

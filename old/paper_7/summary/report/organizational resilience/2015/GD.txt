With approximately 55 percent of our revenue from the U.S. government, our financial performance is impacted by U.S. government spending levels, particularly defense spending. The long-term outlook for our U.S. defense business is influenced by the relevance of our programs to the U.S. military's funding priorities, the diversity of our programs and customers, our insight into customer requirements stemming from our incumbency on core programs, and our ability to evolve our products to address a fast-changing threat environment. We continue to pursue international opportunities presented by demand for military equipment and information technologies from our non-U.S. operations and through exports from our North American businesses. In navigating the current business environment, we continue to focus on improving operating earnings, expanding margin, and the efficient conversion of earnings into cash. We emphasize effective program execution, anticipate trends, and react to changing circumstances in our business environment, and drive cost-reduction activities across our business. Our consolidated operating margin expanded due largely to improved performance and continued cost-reduction efforts in the aerospace, combat systems, and information systems and technology groups. We recognize the majority of our revenue using the percentage-of-completion method of accounting, which reflects our ability to adapt to operational demands and manage resources effectively. Variations in revenue are discussed generally in terms of volume, typically measured by the level of activity on individual contracts or programs. Operating costs for the defense groups consist of labor, material, subcontractor, overhead, and general and administrative costs and are recognized generally as incurred. The combat systems group's operating margin increased due to strong operating performance and cost-cutting across the business, including reduced overhead costs following restructuring activities. The information systems and technology group's operating margin increased due to improved program performance and rightsizing across the group. We expect our continued investment in the development of new aircraft products and technologies to support the aerospace group's long-term growth. The group's services performance reflected a favorable mix of work, demonstrating our operational flexibility and adaptability to market demands. Our total backlog, including funded and unfunded portions, was $66.1 billion at the end of 2015, which provides stability well into the future. The backlog includes firm contracts that we believe are likely to receive funding, although there is no guarantee that future budgets will provide the necessary funding for a given program. We regularly assess the probability of recovery of deferred costs, which requires making assumptions about future contract activity and market conditions. Our focus on cash flow generation gives us the flexibility for capital deployment while preserving a strong balance sheet to position us for future opportunities. We believe we have adequate funds on hand and sufficient borrowing capacity to execute our financial and operating strategy, which reflects our commitment to organizational resilience in the face of changing market conditions.

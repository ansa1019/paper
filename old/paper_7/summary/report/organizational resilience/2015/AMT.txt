During the fourth quarter of 2015, we reviewed and changed our reportable segments to enhance our operational flexibility and adaptability in response to market demands. Our primary business is the leasing of space on communications sites, which allows us to maintain positive adjustment under challenging conditions, thereby supporting our organizational resilience. The majority of our tenant leases are multiyear contracts, resulting in recurring revenue that contributes to our operational continuity and financial stability. We anticipate generating over $30 billion of non-cancellable tenant lease revenue over future periods, which underscores our strategic response to external pressures and market fluctuations. Our diversified communications site portfolio enables us to absorb strain and preserve functioning despite adverse conditions, reflecting our commitment to resource allocation and risk mitigation strategies. 

We continue to believe that our site leasing revenue is likely to increase due to the growing use of wireless services and our ability to meet the corresponding incremental demand. Our established tenant base provides us with new business opportunities, which have historically resulted in consistent and predictable organic revenue growth. This growth is supported by our ability to innovate and adapt to the evolving needs of wireless service providers, thereby enhancing our competitive advantage. Our holistic master lease agreements build strong strategic partnerships with our tenants, significantly reducing collocation cycle times and enabling rapid deployment of equipment on our sites.

In evaluating financial performance, management uses segment gross margin and operating profit as key indicators of organizational effectiveness. The growth in operating profit across our segments is primarily attributable to increases in gross margin, which reflects our ability to manage operational resources effectively. We have focused on building relationships with large multinational carriers, which positions us to benefit from various wireless technology deployments over the long term. 

Our strategic initiatives include selectively developing or acquiring new sites in existing and new markets, which further enhances our organizational capabilities and resilience. The ability to adapt to environmental disruptions is critical, and we anticipate that our extensive international portfolio will drive sustainable, long-term growth. We have established operations in many emerging markets, allowing us to participate meaningfully in the deployment of initial voice and data networks. 

As we continue to expand, our focus on operational management and strategic adaptation will be essential to navigate the complexities of the telecommunications landscape. We are committed to maintaining organizational coherence and effectiveness, ensuring that we can confront challenges and leverage opportunities for growth. Our approach to crisis management and preparedness is integral to our resilience strategies, allowing us to respond effectively to unexpected situations and maintain performance under pressure.

Our company's goals are targeted at serving our customers, our employees, the environment, the communities in which we work, and our stockholders, and achievement of our goals is intended to meet the needs of a changing industry. We believe we are uniquely equipped to meet the challenges of the changing waste industry and our customers' waste management needs, both today and as we work together to envision and create a more sustainable future. We remain dedicated to providing long-term value to our stockholders by successfully executing our strategy: to know and service our customers better than anyone in our industry, to extract more value from the materials we manage, and to innovate and optimize our business. We plan to accomplish our strategic goals through competitive advantages derived from operational improvements and focused differentiation in our industry, driven by capitalizing on our extensive, well-placed network of assets. In pursuit of these long-term goals, we recognize that we must grow the business and do so as efficiently and cost-effectively as possible. We believe that execution of our strategy through these key priorities will drive continued financial performance and leadership in a dynamic industry. We generated strong earnings and cash flow growth from our solid waste business by continuing a disciplined focus on revenue growth and cost control. These results were driven by strong core pricing in each line of business; controlling costs of both our operations and corporate functions; improving customer experience by differentiating our service offerings to reduce customer churn; maintaining discipline around capital spending; and implementing a more rational and sustainable framework for recycling operations as an integrated component of solid waste services. We continue to monitor emerging diversion technologies that may generate additional value, and our current attention will be on improving existing diversion technologies, such as our recycling operations. We believe that continued execution of our objectives will translate into earnings and cash flow growth, leaving us well positioned to continue investing in our business, pay dividends and repurchase shares, while continuing our commitment to maintain a strong balance sheet. We recognize that we must adapt to external pressures and evolving customer needs, which requires a systemic perspective on resource allocation and operational flexibility. Our strategic initiatives are designed to enhance our resilience by focusing on innovation, service optimization, and inter-organizational collaboration. We have established mechanisms for risk assessment and mitigation, ensuring that we can effectively confront unexpected situations and environmental perturbations. Our organizational practices emphasize adaptability and learning, enabling us to maintain performance under pressure and navigate complex situations. We are committed to fostering a culture of resilience that empowers our teams to respond effectively to disruptive events and to reconfigure our operations as necessary to sustain our competitive advantage. Our approach to crisis management and preparedness is integral to our organizational health and long-term success, as we strive to enhance our operational continuity and resourcefulness in the face of adversity. We continuously assess our performance and the implications of our strategic decisions, ensuring that we remain agile and responsive to the dynamic landscape of the waste management industry.

In 2015, we recognized the importance of maintaining operational continuity and resilience in the face of external pressures and market volatility. Our strategic initiatives aimed at enhancing organizational effectiveness included a focus on resource allocation and the development of adaptive strategies to confront unexpected situations. The sale of our pharmacy and clinic businesses to CVS for $1.9 billion was a significant decision that allowed us to reconfigure our operational framework and deploy resources more effectively. This transaction is expected to be accretive to earnings per share in subsequent periods, demonstrating our commitment to organizational transformation and recovery from prior challenges. We also emphasized the importance of crisis management and preparedness in our operational practices, which are essential for sustaining performance under pressure. Our ability to absorb strain and maintain positive adjustment during adverse conditions reflects our organizational resilience, as we continuously assess risks and adapt to changing market dynamics. The increase in comparable sales and digital channel growth illustrates our capacity to innovate and respond to customer needs effectively, contributing to our competitive advantage. We have implemented mechanisms for knowledge management and learning organization practices that enhance our absorptive capacity and facilitate inter-organizational collaboration. Our financial performance metrics, including return on invested capital, indicate a strong trajectory toward achieving our major objectives while navigating environmental disruptions. We are committed to leveraging our organizational strengths and dynamic capabilities to ensure long-term sustainability and success in turbulent markets. The strategic foresight embedded in our planning processes allows us to project future trajectories and align our resources to meet anticipated demands. We recognize that the complexity of the current business environment requires us to remain agile and responsive, fostering a culture of resilience that supports our operational management and enhances our overall organizational health. Our focus on stakeholder engagement and collaboration networks is pivotal in navigating the challenges posed by economic fluctuations and ensuring our organizational survival. The ongoing evaluation of our operational resources and strategic adaptation efforts will continue to drive our performance maintenance and organizational evolution in the face of adversity.

The discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements. We provide direct banking products and services and payment services through our subsidiaries. Our business activities are funded primarily through consumer deposits, securitization of loan receivables, and the issuance of unsecured debt. We expect revenues to increase in 2016, driven by growth in our existing direct banking products and investments in marketing and rewards. We continue to focus on capital deployment through organic growth in the business and through our quarterly dividends and share repurchase program. The total charge-off rate is expected to increase slightly in 2016, assuming no material change in the macroeconomic environment. We added to the loan loss reserve in 2015 as we continue to grow receivables and recently originated loans season. We continue to leverage our proprietary network to support our card-issuing business. The regulatory environment has seen increased examination and enforcement actions, which could limit our business strategies and require us to invest more management time and resources in compliance efforts. The consumer financial protection bureau regulates consumer financial products and services, ensuring consistent enforcement of laws. The closure of our mortgage origination business in June 2015 and the focus on regulatory compliance reflect our adaptability to changing market conditions. We are subject to regulatory capital requirements that became effective January 1, 2015, requiring minimum risk-based capital and leverage ratios. Our liquidity management practices position us well to comply with these standards, and we maintain a liquidity risk and funding management policy approved by our board of directors. We conduct liquidity stress testing regularly and maintain contingency funding planning to address potential liquidity shortfalls. Our liquidity portfolio includes cash and cash equivalents and high-quality, liquid, unencumbered investment securities. We seek to maintain sufficient liquidity to satisfy all maturing obligations and fund business operations for at least 12 months in a severe stress environment. The size and composition of our liquidity portfolio may fluctuate based on expected liability maturities and operational requirements. We have access to the federal reserve bank's discount window as a source of contingency funding. Our ability to make capital distributions is subject to the federal reserve's review and non-objection of our proposed capital actions. We are required to submit an annual capital plan to the federal reserve, which includes an assessment of our expected uses and sources of capital. The results of our annual supervisory stress tests are published, and we maintain agreements with derivative counterparties that require us to maintain an investment-grade credit rating. Our organizational practices reflect a focus on resilience strategies, including the maintenance of operational continuity and the ability to adapt to external pressures and environmental disruptions. The ongoing evaluation of our business strategies and the implementation of proactive measures ensure our organizational health and effectiveness in navigating complex situations.

In our financial focus, we emphasize long-term, sustainable growth in free cash flows, which are driven primarily by increasing operating income and efficiently managing working capital and cash capital expenditures. We seek to improve all aspects of the customer experience, including lowering prices, improving availability, offering faster delivery and performance times, increasing selection, and earning customer trust. To increase sales of products and services, we focus on enhancing operational flexibility and adapting to customer needs while managing resource allocation efficiently. Our model allows us to turn inventory quickly, which contributes to a cash-generating operating cycle, indicating our ability to maintain performance under pressure. We expect variability in inventory turnover over time, which is influenced by several factors, including our investment in new geographies and product lines, and the extent to which we utilize third-party fulfillment providers. We continually evaluate opportunities to sell additional equity or debt securities and secure additional financing to strengthen our financial position, demonstrating our proactive measures in risk management and resource generation. Our technology and content investments support a variety of product and service offerings, reflecting our commitment to innovation and adaptation strategies. We believe that advances in technology will continue to improve the consumer experience and increase its ubiquity, thus enhancing our operational management and strategic adaptation to environmental disruptions. Our efforts to expand fulfillment capacity and improve process efficiencies indicate our focus on organizational health and resilience in the face of challenges. We regularly evaluate our facility requirements to accommodate anticipated shipment volumes, which is essential for maintaining operational continuity. The increase in operating cash flow is primarily due to net income growth, excluding non-cash charges, and changes in working capital, highlighting our ability to absorb strain and preserve functioning despite adversity. Our financial reporting currency is the U.S. dollar, and fluctuations in foreign exchange rates significantly affect our reported results, emphasizing the need for strategic foresight and adaptability in a turbulent market. We have identified critical accounting policies that require subjective judgments, reflecting our organizational capabilities in managing complexity and uncertainty. We also monitor the actual performance of the business relative to fair value assumptions, which is crucial for maintaining organizational coherence and resilience. Our liquidity is affected by restricted cash balances, and we endeavor to manage our global taxes on a cash basis, which is essential for sustaining our operational effectiveness. We seek to mitigate costs of shipping and enhance our fulfillment capabilities, which are vital for supporting continued business growth. Our investments in technology infrastructure to support AWS and other service offerings demonstrate our commitment to resilience engineering and organizational transformation in response to market demands.

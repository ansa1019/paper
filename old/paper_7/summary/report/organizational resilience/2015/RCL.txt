The year 2015 marked another record year for our company as adjusted earnings grew by more than 40% year-over-year for the second consecutive year. The company remains focused on improving returns for our shareholders. We continue to focus on our beverage packages, specialty restaurants, internet packages, and shore excursions to strengthen our onboard yields. We remain dedicated to finding efficiencies, identifying synergies, and improving costs while at the same time focusing on strategic spending by investing in areas that will boost revenue. The decision to significantly change our pullmantur strategy from growing the brand through vessel transfers to a right-sizing strategy reflects our adaptability to external pressures and market volatility. This right-sizing strategy includes reducing our exposure to Latin America, refocusing on the brand's core market of Spain, and reducing the size of pullmantur's fleet, demonstrating our operational flexibility in response to adverse conditions. The strategic change led to a non-cash impairment charge of $399.3 million, primarily related to goodwill, trademarks, and trade names, indicating our proactive measures in managing risk and maintaining organizational health. The impairment review for goodwill consists of a qualitative assessment of whether it is more-likely-than-not that a reporting unit's fair value is less than its carrying amount, which reflects our commitment to performance maintenance under challenging conditions. Our approach to managing the impact of foreign currency fluctuations on our revenues and expenses illustrates our resilience strategies and risk management capabilities. We have engaged in three transactions expected to improve our return on invested capital, showcasing our strategic foresight and resource allocation in turbulent markets. The companyâ€™s long-term commitment to grow revenue yields, manage costs, and maintain steady capacity growth continues to guide us toward our major objectives. We expect that our cash flows from operations and our current financing arrangements will be adequate to meet our capital expenditures and debt repayments over the next twelve-month period. Our working capital deficit is mainly attributable to the fact that a vast majority of our passenger ticket receipts are collected in advance of the applicable sailing date, which allows us to utilize these advance receipts to fund operating expenses and other investments. The anticipated overall capital expenditures based on our existing ships on order reflect our strategic planning and resource generation efforts. Our liquidity position, consisting of cash and available credit facilities, supports our operational continuity and preparedness for future challenges. The focus on improving returns for our shareholders and the decision to amend and restate our credit facilities demonstrates our proactive stance in crisis management and organizational survival. The company's ability to adapt to changing market conditions and to reconfigure its strategies in response to external disturbances underscores our organizational resilience and commitment to sustaining performance amidst adversity.

Our management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations reflects our ongoing efforts to adapt and respond to external pressures and environmental disruptions. We continue to see our business evolve as we execute on our strategy to leverage the "virtuous cycle of growth," which is essential for maintaining operational flexibility and resilience in the face of challenging macroeconomic conditions. The decrease in platform unit sales due to adverse market conditions highlights the importance of resource allocation and strategic initiatives to mitigate risks and enhance organizational health. Our effective tax rate decreased significantly, driven by one-time items and our decision to indefinitely reinvest certain prior years' non-U.S. earnings, which demonstrates our strategic foresight and adaptability in financial management. 

The restructuring program initiated in 2015 aimed to adjust resources from areas of disinvestment to areas of investment, which is a critical aspect of our organizational change processes. This program was substantially complete by the end of 2015 and is expected to yield gross annual savings that will enhance our operational capabilities. We also recognize the importance of inter-organizational collaboration, as evidenced by our acquisition of Altera, which is expected to enable new classes of products that meet customer needs in the data center and Internet of Things market segments. 

Our liquidity and capital resources are robust, with cash and cash equivalents totaling $25.3 billion, reflecting our ability to generate cash from operations and maintain financial resilience. The significant investments in research and development underscore our commitment to innovation and the development of new technologies, which are vital for sustaining competitive advantage and ensuring organizational survival in a turbulent market environment. 

The assessment of our property, plant, and equipment for impairment is indicative of our proactive measures to manage risks associated with operational resources and to ensure that our assets are aligned with our strategic objectives. We continuously evaluate the recoverability of our assets, which is essential for maintaining system integrity and performance under pressure. 

Our ongoing investments in non-marketable equity instruments and the strategic management of our investment portfolio further illustrate our commitment to resilience engineering and the absorption of knowledge from external sources. The complexity of our operations necessitates a multifaceted approach to risk management and operational continuity, ensuring that we can confront unexpected situations effectively. 

In summary, our strategic planning and resource management practices are designed to enhance our organizational resilience, enabling us to navigate through adverse conditions while maintaining a focus on growth and innovation. The combination of effective leadership, operational flexibility, and a strong commitment to learning and adaptation positions us well to respond to future challenges and opportunities in the business environment.

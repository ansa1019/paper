In 2015, we incurred substantial restructuring costs as a result of actions to lower our cost structure in response to weak economic conditions in the key industries we serve. We expect to take additional restructuring actions in 2016, which will result in costs of about $400 million. Our restructuring activities continued as part of our ongoing efforts to optimize our cost structure and improve the efficiency of our operations. The decrease in sales volume was primarily due to lower deliveries to end users caused by widespread economic weakness, particularly in developing countries. The unfavorable currency impact was primarily from a weaker euro, Japanese yen, and Brazilian real, as sales in these currencies translated into fewer U.S. dollars. The decline in sales volume was partially offset by the favorable impact of changes in dealer inventories, as dealers adjusted inventory based on their expectations of future demand and product delivery times. We believe that our ability to adapt to these challenges is critical for maintaining operational flexibility and ensuring business continuity. 

Our financial products segment experienced a decrease in revenues primarily due to lower average earning assets and lower average financing rates. The decline was partially offset by a favorable impact from changes in the allowance rate and changes in portfolio balances. We are focused on enhancing customer productivity through the development of automated analytics and diagnostics solutions, which we believe will provide a competitive advantage. The ongoing economic conditions have necessitated a strategic response to mitigate risks and enhance our organizational resilience. 

We anticipate that continued weakness in the energy and mining industries will pose external pressures on our sales and profitability. The restructuring costs incurred in 2015 were primarily related to a reduction in workforce and the closure and consolidation of numerous manufacturing facilities throughout the company. We believe that these restructuring actions will ultimately strengthen our operational capabilities and enhance our resilience in the face of market volatility. 

Our management utilizes various strategic tools to assess the impact of environmental disruptions and to implement resilience strategies that enable us to recover from adverse conditions. The focus on operational management and resource allocation is essential for navigating complex situations and ensuring organizational health. As we confront these challenges, our ability to absorb strain and maintain performance under pressure will be critical for our long-term success. 

In summary, our strategic initiatives are designed to enhance organizational effectiveness and adaptability, ensuring that we can respond effectively to unexpected situations and maintain positive adjustment under challenging conditions. We remain committed to fostering a culture of learning and collaboration, which we believe will contribute to our overall resilience and capacity to thrive in turbulent markets.

Ametek's operations are affected by global, regional, and industry economic factors; however, the company's strategic geographic and industry diversification, along with its mix of products and services, have helped to limit the potential adverse impact of any unfavorable developments in any one industry or the economy of any single country on its consolidated operating results. The company established records for operating income, operating income margins, net income, and diluted earnings per share in 2015, with contributions from recent acquisitions and successful operational excellence initiatives positively impacting results. The company emphasizes investment in research, development, and engineering, which totaled $200.8 million in 2015, directed toward the development of new products and processes and the improvement of existing products and processes. The full-year impact of the 2015 acquisitions and continued focus on operational excellence initiatives, including realignment actions, are expected to positively influence the company's results in 2016. The company expects the challenging global economic environment across many of its markets and geographies to continue, which necessitates adaptability and operational flexibility. The decrease in net sales for 2015 was attributed to unfavorable foreign currency translation and internal sales decline, partially offset by an increase from acquisitions. The company's backlog of unfilled orders indicates a need for effective resource deployment and management to navigate future uncertainties. The 2015 realignment costs primarily related to workforce reductions in response to the weak global economy, reflecting the company's strategic response to external pressures. The expected annualized cash savings from these realignment costs are anticipated to be approximately $90 million, demonstrating the company's focus on maintaining operational continuity and performance under pressure. The company believes it has sufficient cash-generating capabilities from domestic and unrestricted foreign sources, available credit facilities, and access to long-term capital funds to meet its operating needs and contractual obligations in the foreseeable future. The company's differentiated and global business activities help reduce the impact that any particular market risk may have on its operating income as a whole, indicating a systemic perspective on risk management. The company is committed to maintaining its organizational health through strategic initiatives that enhance operational resilience and adaptability in the face of environmental disruptions. The company has established reserves sufficient to perform all known responsibilities under existing claims and consent orders, reflecting its proactive measures in environmental management. The company believes that its operational excellence initiatives, combined with strategic acquisitions, will continue to enhance its competitive advantage and organizational strength. The company's focus on collaboration networks and inter-organizational collaboration further supports its resilience strategies, enabling it to confront and benefit from sudden disruptive changes to survive and flourish in a turbulent business environment.

This annual report on Form 10-K includes projections, goals, assumptions, and statements that may constitute forward-looking statements. These projections may address our exposures to various sectors, including the energy sector and currency exchange rates, and strategies to grow net investment income, efficiently manage capital, and reduce expenses. Factors that could cause actual results to differ include changes in market conditions, our ability to successfully manage business operations without negatively impacting client relationships, and the occurrence of catastrophic events. Our ongoing efforts to transform AIG for long-term competitiveness include initiatives focused on organizational simplification, operational efficiency, and business rationalization, which are expected to result in significant cost savings and improved performance. We are focused on creating a leaner, more profitable insurer by reorganizing our operating model into modular business units to enhance transparency and accountability. The company is also committed to reducing general operating expenses and improving the commercial insurance property casualty accident year loss ratio. Our investment strategies are tailored to the specific business needs of each operating unit, with the primary objectives being the generation of investment income, preservation of capital, and liquidity management. We actively monitor and manage our liquidity risk to ensure sufficient cash can be generated to meet obligations as they come due. Our liquidity risk management framework includes policies and monitoring tools to address industry and market-related liquidity events. The company’s risk management efforts may not always be successful, and material adverse effects on our business, results of operations, cash flows, liquidity, or financial condition may occur. We have established a risk appetite framework that integrates stakeholder interests, strategic business goals, and available financial resources, balancing measured risks expected to generate sustainable earnings and create long-term value. The framework includes risk tolerances on capital and liquidity measures set at both the parent and legal entity levels. We utilize various methods to measure our market risk exposure, including sensitivity analysis, scenario analysis, and stress testing. Our market risk management framework focuses on quantifying the financial repercussions of changes in market risk drivers, including equity prices, interest rates, credit spreads, and foreign exchange rates. The company is exposed to various catastrophic events that can affect multiple lines of business, and we manage this exposure through risk limits based on aggregate probable maximum loss modeling and purchasing catastrophe reinsurance. We also actively monitor terrorism risk and manage exposures to losses from terrorist attacks through a combination of risk limits and reinsurance. Our mortgage guaranty business manages risk through proprietary risk quality indices and risk-based pricing models. The estimation of reinsurance recoverable involves significant judgment, particularly for latent exposures, and we assess the collectability of reinsurance recoverable balances through detailed reviews and historical trends. The liability for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses is a key risk faced by our non-life insurance companies, and we regularly review and update the methods and assumptions used to determine loss reserve estimates. The company’s loss reserve reviews involve collaboration with claims, underwriting, and senior management to ensure robust considerations of changes in loss trends and claims handling practices.

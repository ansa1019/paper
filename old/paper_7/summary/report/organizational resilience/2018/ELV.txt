We are one of the largest health benefits companies in the United States, serving approximately 40 million medical members through our affiliated health plans. Our operations are managed through three reportable segments: commercial & specialty business, government business, and other. Our results of operations depend in large part on our ability to accurately predict and effectively manage healthcare costs through effective contracting with providers of care to our members and our medical management and health and wellness programs. Our strategy has been to participate in markets where we have confidence that they are on a path toward sustainability, including factors such as expected financial performance and regulatory environment. We strive to price our healthcare benefit products consistent with anticipated underlying medical trends and make adjustments to respond to legislative and regulatory changes. The potential effect of escalating healthcare costs, any changes in our ability to negotiate competitive rates with our providers, and any regulatory or market-driven restrictions may impose further risks to our ability to profitably underwrite our business. 

We manage our cash, investments, and capital structure to meet the short-term and long-term obligations of our business while maintaining financial flexibility and liquidity. Our investment strategy is to make investments consistent with insurance statutes and other regulatory requirements, while preserving our asset base. We believe that funds from future operating cash flows, cash, and investments will be sufficient for future operations and commitments, and for capital acquisitions and other strategic transactions. Our growth strategy is designed to enable us to take advantage of additional economies of scale, as well as providing access to new and evolving technologies and products. 

We have established a new pharmacy benefits manager, ingeniorx, to provide our members with more cost-effective solutions and improve our ability to integrate pharmacy benefits within our medical and specialty platform. Our operational flexibility is enhanced by our diversified mix of managed care products and services, which include preferred provider organizations, health maintenance organizations, and consumer-driven health plans. We work to mitigate medical cost trends through various medical management programs, including utilization management and condition management. 

The patient protection and affordable care act has changed and may continue to impact our business model and strategy, presenting both growth opportunities and regulatory challenges. We will continue to evaluate the impact of the ACA as additional guidance is made available and as further developments occur. Our ability to adapt to these changes is critical for maintaining operational continuity and organizational health. Additionally, we regularly review and set assumptions regarding cost trends and utilization when establishing claim liabilities, which can significantly affect our financial performance. 

We maintain a strong financial condition and liquidity position, with consolidated cash, cash equivalents, and investments in fixed maturity and equity securities. Our debt-to-capital ratio is monitored to assess our overall leverage and additional borrowing capacity, which is essential for sustaining our operations and strategic initiatives. We believe that our organizational resilience is reflected in our ability to respond effectively to environmental disruptions and transform ourselves to emerge stronger from challenging situations.

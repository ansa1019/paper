We are a leading provider of online auctions and vehicle remarketing services with operations in various countries, aiming to generate sustainable profits while producing environmental and social benefits. Our goals include facilitating the recovery and resilience of communities affected by severe climate events. We provide vehicle sellers with a full range of services to process and sell vehicles primarily over the internet, which helps expedite each stage of the vehicle sales process, minimize administrative and processing costs, and maximize the ultimate sales price. The increase in service revenues for fiscal 2018 was driven by growth in the number of units sold from new and expanded contracts with insurance companies and growth from existing suppliers, influenced by an increase in total loss frequency and extraordinary volumes of flood-damaged vehicles due to Hurricane Harvey. Our operational flexibility is crucial as we adapt to market conditions and external pressures, including fluctuations in commodity prices and used car values, which impact our service revenues and overall performance. We continuously monitor and analyze key financial performance indicators to manage our business effectively. The increase in yard operations expenses was primarily due to growth in volume and abnormal costs associated with processing an increased number of vehicles, particularly following disruptive events such as hurricanes. We expect to continue to use cash flows from operations to finance our working capital needs and to develop and grow our business, demonstrating our commitment to adaptability and resilience in response to market demands. Our strategic initiatives include acquiring and developing additional vehicle storage facilities in key markets and pursuing national and regional vehicle seller agreements, which enhance our operational capabilities and competitive advantage. We believe that our currently available cash and cash equivalents, along with cash generated from operations, will be sufficient to satisfy our operating and working capital requirements for at least the next 12 months. Our business is seasonal, with increased vehicle processing during winter months due to higher accident frequency, necessitating effective resource allocation and management. We have a history of financing growth through cash generated from operations and debt financing, which supports our resilience strategies in navigating economic fluctuations and operational challenges. Our capital expenditures are primarily related to opening and improving facilities and software development, reflecting our focus on organizational transformation and innovation. The successful execution of our strategic response to environmental disruptions and market volatility is essential for maintaining operational continuity and achieving our major objectives. We are committed to enhancing our organizational health and effectiveness through continuous improvement in our operational practices and resource management.

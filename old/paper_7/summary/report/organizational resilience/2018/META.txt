In 2018, we continued to focus on our main revenue growth priorities, which include helping marketers use our products to connect with consumers where they are and making our ads more relevant and effective. We anticipate that additional investments in expanding our data center capacity, network infrastructure, and office facilities will support our growth and operational continuity. Our user growth metrics indicate a 9% year-over-year increase in daily active users and monthly active users, reflecting our adaptability to market demands and user engagement. The increase in advertising revenue was primarily driven by an increase in the number of ads delivered and the average price per ad, which demonstrates our operational flexibility and strategic response to external pressures. We believe that our investments in long-term technology initiatives, such as connectivity and artificial intelligence, will further enhance our organizational capabilities and resilience in the face of environmental disruptions. 

The increase in costs and expenses in 2018 was largely due to operational expenses related to our data centers and technical infrastructure, which are crucial for maintaining performance under pressure. Our research and development expenses also increased significantly, reflecting our commitment to innovation and the development of new products that align with customer needs. We expect that our future planning will continue to focus on enhancing our organizational effectiveness and agility, particularly in response to evolving market conditions and user behavior. 

We recognize that trends in user metrics affect our revenue and financial results, influencing the number of ads we can show and the overall value of our advertising services. The growth in our user base in regions with lower average revenue per user indicates our strategic foresight in penetrating diverse markets, which is essential for sustaining long-term growth and resilience. Our financial resources, including cash and cash equivalents, provide a buffer against potential risks and uncertainties, allowing us to navigate adverse conditions effectively. 

We are also involved in legal proceedings and regulatory inquiries that could impact our financial condition. We continuously assess these contingencies, which require significant judgment regarding the probability and estimated amount of loss, underscoring the complexity of our operational environment. Our ability to manage these risks and uncertainties is integral to our organizational health and resilience. 

Overall, our strategic initiatives and investments are designed to enhance our organizational strength and adaptability, ensuring that we can maintain positive adjustment under challenging conditions while pursuing our major objectives and sustaining growth in a competitive landscape.

This MD&A is intended to provide investors with an understanding of our recent performance, financial condition, and prospects. In operating our business, we seek to grow our portfolio of brands through innovation, category development, and commercial execution, leverage our cost and financial discipline to fund growth and improve margins, and allocate capital in value-creating ways. We initiated a restructuring program to reduce our structural cost base by streamlining and simplifying our manufacturing supply chain and overhead organization. The 2018 global restructuring program will make our overhead organization structure and manufacturing supply chain less complex and more efficient. The program is expected to impact all of our business segments and our organizations in all major geographies. We expect to close or sell approximately 10 manufacturing facilities and expand production capacity at several others. The restructuring is expected to be completed by the end of 2020, with total costs anticipated to be $1.7 billion to $1.9 billion pre-tax. Annual pre-tax savings from the restructuring are expected to be $500 to $550 million by 2021. We continue to focus on generating cash flow and allocating capital to shareholders. Cash provided by operations was $3.0 billion in 2018 compared to $2.9 billion in 2017, driven by improved working capital and lower tax payments. We are subject to risks and uncertainties, which can affect our business operations and financial results. We expect earnings per share to be $4.85 to $5.35. Adjusted earnings per share are expected to be $6.50 to $6.70, which excludes 2018 global restructuring program charges equivalent to $1.35 to $1.65. We expect net sales to decrease 1 to 2 percent, anticipating changes in foreign currency exchange rates to have an unfavorable impact of 3 to 4 percent. We expect organic sales to increase approximately 2 percent, driven by higher net selling prices of at least 3 percent. We plan to achieve cost savings of $400 to $450 million, including $300 to $325 million from our force program and $100 to $125 million from the 2018 global restructuring program. We expect inflation in key cost inputs of $300 to $400 million, with the majority occurring in international markets. We anticipate the majority of the inflation to occur in international markets. We expect foreign currency translation effects to reduce operating profit by 2 to 3 percent and transaction effects to also negatively impact the comparison. We expect interest expense to increase somewhat year-on-year. Our share of net income of equity companies was $103 in 2018 and $104 in 2017. We believe our ability to generate cash from operations and our capacity to issue short-term and long-term debt are adequate to fund working capital, capital spending, payment of dividends, pension plan contributions, and other needs for the foreseeable future. The effective tax rate of 26 percent in 2018 was essentially even compared to the rate in 2017. The rate in 2018 included a net charge related to U.S. tax reform matters. The 2017 provision for income taxes included a net benefit as a result of U.S. tax reform and related activity. Our subsidiaries in Argentina began accounting for their operations as highly inflationary effective July 1, 2018, as required by GAAP. The effect of changes in exchange rates on peso-denominated monetary assets and liabilities has been reflected in earnings in other income and expense, net, and was not material.

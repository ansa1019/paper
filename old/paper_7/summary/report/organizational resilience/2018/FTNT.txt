In addition to historical information, this annual report on Form 10-K contains forward-looking statements concerning our expectations regarding continued growth and market share gains, variability in sales, expected impact of sales of certain products and services, and the impact of macro-economic and geopolitical factors on our sales. Our cybersecurity solutions are designed to provide broad visibility and segmentation of the digital attack surface through our integrated security fabric platform, which features automated protection, detection, and responses. The focus areas of our business consist of network security, cloud security, and operational technology, which have generated new opportunities for us to grow our business. We continue to see our enterprise customers purchasing a fairly balanced mix of products across these product groups. Our revenue growth was driven by both product and service revenue, with service revenue growth significantly influenced by the strength of our technical support and security subscription services. We expect the trend of service revenue being higher than product revenue to continue, as it depends significantly on the growth of our customer base and the expansion of our service bundle offerings. Our total deferred revenue balance grew 26% as of December 31, 2018, compared to the same period last year, reflecting our ability to absorb strain and preserve functioning despite adversity. The increase in operating income and margin was primarily due to revenue growth outpacing expense growth, demonstrating our operational flexibility and resilience in adapting to market conditions. We monitor key metrics, including revenue, deferred revenue, and cash flows from operating activities, to evaluate growth trends and assess operational efficiencies. The adoption of new accounting standards has also positively impacted our financial performance, contributing to improved operating margins. Our investments in research and development and sales and marketing are critical to support growth and capture market share in the enterprise market. We expect to continue to invest in our workforce to enhance our organizational capabilities and maintain our competitive advantage. Our liquidity and capital resources are impacted by our operating activities, including cash generated from net income and changes in operating assets and liabilities. We believe our existing cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for at least the next 12 months, reflecting our preparedness and resilience strategies. The changes in cash flows from investing activities primarily relate to timing of purchases, maturities, and sales of investments, as well as capital expenditures. Our operational management is focused on maintaining performance under pressure and ensuring business continuity through effective resource allocation and strategic initiatives. We continue to assess the impact of external pressures and environmental disruptions on our business model, ensuring that we are equipped to confront challenges and adapt effectively to maintain organizational health and success.

Hilton is one of the largest and fastest growing hospitality companies in the world, with a premier brand portfolio that includes various luxury, full-service, focused-service, and timeshare brands. Our strategic objectives include the continued expansion of our global footprint and fee-based business, which involves evaluating the economic viability of properties before adding them to our management and franchise development pipeline. By increasing the number of management and franchise contracts with third-party owners, we expect to enhance overall return on invested capital and cash available for stockholders. The hospitality industry is seasonal, and our properties experience varying levels of demand based on location and type, which necessitates adaptability in our operational strategies. We depend on long-term management and franchise contracts with third-party owners and franchisees for a significant portion of our revenues, emphasizing the importance of maintaining strong relationships with these stakeholders to support growth and resilience in the face of external pressures. Our operations are sensitive to consumer demand and global economic conditions, which can lead to volatility in revenues due to changes in travel patterns and economic downturns. We have taken steps to reduce fixed costs to levels deemed appropriate to maximize profitability while optimizing customer experience. The effectiveness of our cost-cutting efforts is limited by inherent fixed costs, and we continuously evaluate our operational flexibility to respond to market conditions. Our financial performance is also influenced by the ability of developers and owners to access capital for property development, which is crucial for sustaining our growth trajectory. We believe that our relationships with third-party owners, franchisees, and developers are diverse and not concentrated with any particular entity, which enhances our resilience. Our liquidity management policy aims to maintain availability of cash and minimize operational costs, ensuring that we can meet anticipated requirements for operating and other expenditures. We finance our business activities primarily with cash generated from operations, which we believe will be adequate for the foreseeable future. The preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that could materially affect our financial position and results of operations, particularly in light of unforeseen events. Our ability to respond effectively to environmental disruptions and transform ourselves to emerge stronger from challenging situations is a critical aspect of our organizational resilience. We continuously assess our operational resources and capabilities to ensure we can adapt to unexpected situations and maintain performance under pressure. The strategic planning process includes evaluating our organizational practices and the impact of external disturbances on our operational integrity, which is essential for sustaining our competitive advantage in a turbulent market.

The following discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements, including, without limitation, statements relating to our plans, strategies, objectives, expectations, intentions, and resources. Schlumberger's financial performance in 2018 was driven largely by North America, where revenue increased significantly despite a sharp decrease in activity during the fourth quarter. This growth was primarily attributed to increased land activity that benefited Schlumberger's OneStim business, which saw substantial revenue growth. The international revenue showed resilience, remaining essentially flat compared to 2017, indicating an ability to maintain performance under challenging conditions. The dramatic fall in oil prices in the fourth quarter was largely driven by higher-than-expected US shale production and geopolitical factors affecting global demand. Schlumberger expects a more positive supply- and demand-balance sentiment to lead to a gradual recovery in oil prices, reflecting the organization’s adaptability and strategic response to external pressures. The company is observing clear signs that exploration and production investments are starting to normalize, indicating a shift toward sustainable financial stewardship of the global resource base. In the context of operational management, Schlumberger's focus on aligning investments closer to free cash flow demonstrates a proactive approach to resource allocation amidst market volatility. The international markets, particularly outside the Middle East and Russia, are beginning to recognize the necessity of investing in their resource bases to maintain production levels, showcasing the importance of organizational resilience in navigating resource constraints and external disturbances. The seasonal slowdown in Russia was offset by increased revenue in the Middle East, Asia, and Africa, demonstrating operational flexibility and the ability to reconfigure strategies in response to market dynamics. The company’s strategic initiatives, including investments in long-term resource development, reflect a commitment to organizational health and performance maintenance, even in the face of adversity. Schlumberger's ability to absorb strain and preserve functioning during periods of disruption is evident in its operational responses and financial strategies. The company's emphasis on future planning and crisis management is critical for sustaining performance under pressure and ensuring organizational survival in turbulent markets. The combination of increased activity from national oil companies and the need for investment in resource development highlights the multifaceted nature of organizational resilience. Schlumberger's strategic foresight and commitment to operational continuity are essential for navigating complex situations and ensuring the organization can confront future challenges effectively. The focus on maintaining integrity and performance amidst environmental perturbations underscores the company's resilience strategies and mechanisms for recovery. Overall, Schlumberger's operational and financial strategies reflect an understanding of the complexities involved in sustaining organizational effectiveness and adaptability in a rapidly changing business environment.

Our business environment has been characterized by globalization of exchanges, customers, and competitors; lower interest rates and financial markets uncertainty; rising demand for speed, data, data capacity, and connectivity by market participants, necessitating increased investment in technology; evolving and disparate regulation across multiple jurisdictions; increasing focus on capital and cost efficiencies; and consolidation and increasing competition among global markets for trading, clearing, and listings. We have diversified our business so that we are not dependent on volatility or trading activity in any one asset class. In addition, we have increased our portion of non-transaction and clearing revenues from 39% in 2014 to 56% in 2018. This non-transaction revenue includes data services and listings, which are required for our clients' business operations regardless of market volatility or shifts in business profitability levels. The ability to evolve existing products to serve emerging needs, develop new products, and respond to competitive dynamics in pricing, exclusivity, and consolidation is important to our business. Recent changes with regard to global financial reform have emphasized the importance of transparent markets, centralized clearing, and access to data, all of which are important aspects of our product offering. However, some of the proposed rules have yet to be implemented, and some rules that have already been partially implemented are being reconsidered. As the evolution continues, legislative and regulatory actions may change the way we conduct our business and may create uncertainty for market participants, which could affect trading volumes or demand for market data. We continue to focus on our strategy to grow each of our revenue streams, as well as on our company-wide expense reduction initiatives and our synergies in connection with our acquisitions in order to mitigate these uncertainties and to build on our growth opportunities by leveraging our proprietary data, clearing, and markets. Our operational flexibility is enhanced by our ability to adapt to changing market conditions and to manage risks effectively. We recognize the importance of maintaining organizational health and resilience in the face of external pressures and disruptive events. Our strategic initiatives are designed to enhance our competitive advantage and ensure business continuity. We are committed to fostering a culture of innovation and learning, which is critical for our organizational effectiveness and long-term success. Our investments in technology and data services are aimed at improving our operational management and enhancing our responsiveness to customer needs. We have established mechanisms for risk assessment and mitigation, which are essential for navigating complex situations and ensuring performance maintenance under pressure. Our focus on strategic resilience enables us to confront challenges and capitalize on opportunities, thereby supporting our organizational evolution and sustainability in turbulent markets. The integration of our acquisitions and the development of collaborative networks further strengthen our organizational capabilities and adaptability. We remain vigilant in assessing the implications of environmental disruptions and are prepared to implement proactive measures to safeguard our operations and enhance our resilience.

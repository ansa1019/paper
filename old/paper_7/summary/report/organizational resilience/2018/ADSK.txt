The discussion in our management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations highlights our ability to adapt to changing market conditions and customer needs, which is essential for maintaining organizational resilience. We have made a strategic decision to shift our business model from selling perpetual licenses to subscriptions, which enhances our operational flexibility and allows us to respond effectively to environmental disruptions. This transition is supported by our investments in cloud service offerings, which provide scalable computing power and flexibility, thereby improving our resilience strategies. Our subscription plans are designed to give customers more flexibility and access to a broader range of solutions, which helps us to maintain a competitive advantage in turbulent markets.

We have also established a program to incentivize maintenance plan customers to move to subscription offerings, which reflects our proactive measures to ensure business continuity during this transition. The significant increase in our annualized recurring revenue indicates our success in adapting to market demands and enhancing our organizational capabilities. Our acquisitions, such as Assemble Systems and PlanGrid, are aimed at strengthening our product portfolio and expanding our presence in the construction industry, which is critical for our long-term resilience.

Furthermore, our extensive global network of distributors and resellers enhances our organizational strength by providing us with a broad reach into various markets. This network allows us to deploy resources effectively and manage risks associated with market volatility. Our commitment to maintaining an open-architecture design of our software facilitates inter-organizational collaboration and supports the development of customized solutions, which is vital for adapting to complex situations.

We continuously review our assumptions and estimates regarding our financial condition, which is crucial for assessing our operational performance under pressure. The implementation of new revenue recognition standards has required us to adapt our financial reporting processes, ensuring that we remain resilient in the face of regulatory changes. Our focus on improving product functionality and expanding offerings through both internal development and acquisitions demonstrates our strategic foresight and commitment to organizational transformation.

In summary, our ability to absorb strain and preserve functioning despite adversity is reflected in our strategic initiatives, including the transition to a subscription model, investments in cloud technologies, and a focus on enhancing customer engagement through our user communities. These efforts collectively contribute to our organizational resilience, enabling us to confront external pressures and maintain a trajectory of growth and innovation.

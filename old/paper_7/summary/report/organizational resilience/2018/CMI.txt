We are a global power leader that designs, manufactures, distributes, and services diesel and natural gas engines and powertrain-related component products. Our financial performance depends, in large part, on varying conditions in the markets we serve, particularly the on-highway, construction, and general industrial markets. Economic downturns in these markets generally result in reduced sales of our products and can result in price reductions in certain products and/or markets. As part of our growth strategy, we invest in businesses in certain countries that carry high levels of risks such as China, Brazil, India, Mexico, Russia, and countries in the Middle East and Africa. Our geographic diversity and broad product and service offerings have helped limit the impact from a drop in demand in any one industry or customer or the economy of any single country on our consolidated results. We anticipate North American medium-duty truck and heavy-duty truck demand will remain strong, and we expect demand for power generation markets to remain strong, with increased demand in global data center markets. We are experiencing cost increases as a result of trade tariffs recently imposed by the U.S. and some of its trading partners. Our operations are also affected by currency, political, economic, and regulatory matters, including the adoption and enforcement of environmental and emission standards in the countries we serve. Our financial condition and liquidity remain strong, and our solid balance sheet and credit ratings enable us to have ready access to credit and the capital markets. We assess our liquidity in terms of our ability to generate adequate cash to fund our operating, investing, and financing activities. We believe our operating cash flow and liquidity provide us with the financial flexibility needed to fund working capital, common stock repurchases, acquisitions, capital expenditures, dividend payments, projected pension obligations, and debt service obligations. We continue to generate cash from operations in the U.S. and maintain access to our revolving credit facility. Our investments in research and development capabilities, along with strategic acquisitions and partnerships, are aimed at meeting our objectives and enhancing our resilience against market fluctuations. We have long-standing relationships with many leading manufacturers in the markets we serve, which contribute to our organizational strength and resilience. Our ability to absorb strain and preserve functioning despite adversity is reflected in our strategic initiatives and operational flexibility. We focus on developing new products to meet future emission standards and improvements in fuel economy performance, which are crucial for maintaining our competitive advantage in a turbulent market environment. Our organizational practices emphasize adaptability and responsiveness to external pressures, ensuring we can confront unexpected situations and maintain operational continuity. The changes in our segment measure of profitability to EBITDA assist in evaluating the performance of each of our operating segments and provide a consistent basis for comparison. Our commitment to innovation and service continuity positions us to navigate complex situations effectively and sustain our organizational health.

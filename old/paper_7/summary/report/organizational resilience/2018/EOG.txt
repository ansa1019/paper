EOG Resources, Inc. operates under a consistent business and operational strategy that focuses predominantly on maximizing the rate of return on investment by controlling operating and capital costs and maximizing reserve recoveries. This strategy is intended to enhance the generation of cash flow and earnings from each unit of production on a cost-effective basis, allowing EOG to deliver long-term production growth while maintaining a strong balance sheet. EOG's efforts to identify plays with large reserve potential have proven to be successful, and it continues to drill numerous wells in large acreage plays, which are expected to contribute substantially to EOG's crude oil and liquids-rich natural gas production. EOG places emphasis on applying its horizontal drilling and completion expertise to unconventional crude oil and liquids-rich reservoirs, focusing on increasing drilling, completion, and operating efficiencies gained in prior years. The company has significant flexibility with respect to financing alternatives, including borrowings under its commercial paper program and other uncommitted credit facilities, which supports its operational continuity and adaptability in response to changing market conditions. EOG's capital structure strategy aims to maintain a strong balance sheet with a consistently below-average debt-to-total capitalization ratio, which was 24% at December 31, 2018. The anticipated capital expenditures for 2019 are estimated to range from approximately $6.1 billion to $6.5 billion, structured to maintain capital discipline while funding exploration, development, and exploitation activities primarily from internally generated cash flows. EOG recognizes the importance of operational flexibility and strategic initiatives to mitigate risks associated with environmental disruptions and market volatility. The company has a strong prospect inventory and will pursue acquisitions that bolster existing drilling programs or offer incremental exploration and production opportunities. EOG's management continues to focus on reducing operating costs through efficiency improvements, which are essential for maintaining performance under pressure and ensuring organizational effectiveness. The companyâ€™s approach to risk management includes evaluating potential crude oil and liquids-rich natural gas exploration and development prospects, as well as looking for opportunities to add drilling inventory through leasehold acquisitions and tactical acquisitions. EOG's operational management strategies are designed to confront external pressures and enhance organizational resilience, allowing the company to absorb strain and preserve functioning despite adversity. The emphasis on maintaining the lowest possible operating cost structure consistent with efficient, safe, and environmentally responsible operations reflects EOG's commitment to organizational health and sustainability in turbulent markets. EOG's ability to foresee and adapt to complex situations is critical for its long-term success and survival in the competitive landscape of the oil and gas industry.

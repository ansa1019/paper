We are a leading provider of mission-critical investment decision support tools and services, leveraging our knowledge of the global investment process and expertise in research, data, and technology to deliver actionable solutions to our clients. Our dynamic and flexible delivery of content and capabilities enables clients to manage their investment objectives across multiple asset classes in an increasingly integrated manner. Through a combined use of the content and capabilities provided by each of our operating segments, clients gain a broad view of the global investment industry, which is essential for maintaining operational flexibility and adapting to environmental perturbations. Our growth strategy includes expanding leadership in research-enhanced content, strengthening client relationships by providing solutions, and improving access to our solutions through cutting-edge technology and platforms. We focus on key operating metrics such as run rate, subscription sales, and retention rate to manage the business effectively and ensure performance maintenance under pressure. The retention rate is particularly important as subscription cancellations decrease our run rate and ultimately our operating revenues over time. We believe that our liquidity, along with other financing alternatives, will provide the necessary capital to fund growth initiatives and acquisitions, thereby enhancing our organizational resilience. Our business model, characterized by recurring subscription revenues, allows us to maintain a high percentage of profits converted into excess cash, which is crucial for resource generation and operational continuity. We continuously evaluate acquisition opportunities to adapt to the competitive landscape and respond to external pressures. The ability to foresee and confront sudden disruptive changes is reflected in our strategic initiatives, which aim to enhance our organizational capabilities and ensure long-term sustainability. Our financial performance metrics, including revenue growth and adjusted EBITDA, demonstrate our ability to absorb strain and preserve functioning despite adversity. We have implemented strategic relationships and acquisitions with complementary content and technology companies to bolster our resilience strategies. The operational management of our resources, including human capital and technological advancements, plays a vital role in fostering an agile organizational culture that can navigate complex situations and maintain a competitive advantage. Our commitment to innovation and service enhancement is evident in our research and development investments, which are essential for adapting to market volatility and ensuring organizational effectiveness. The strategic foresight embedded in our planning processes allows us to project future needs and align our operations with evolving customer demands. By fostering a learning organization, we enhance our absorptive capacity and improve our response mechanisms to unexpected situations, thereby reinforcing our organizational strength and coherence.

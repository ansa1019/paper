Many factors affect the opportunities, challenges, and risks of the southern company system's electricity and natural gas businesses. These factors include the ability to maintain constructive regulatory environments, to maintain and grow sales and customers, and to effectively manage and secure timely recovery of costs. The traditional electric operating companies and natural gas distribution utilities have various regulatory mechanisms that operate to address cost recovery. Effectively operating pursuant to these regulatory mechanisms and appropriately balancing required costs and capital expenditures with customer prices will continue to challenge the southern company system for the foreseeable future. Management continues to evaluate the contribution of each of these activities to total shareholder return and may pursue acquisitions, dispositions, and other strategic ventures or investments accordingly. In striving to achieve attractive risk-adjusted returns while providing cost-effective energy to more than eight million electric and gas utility customers, the southern company system continues to focus on several key performance indicators. These indicators include, but are not limited to, customer satisfaction, plant availability, electric and natural gas system reliability, execution of major construction projects, and earnings per share. The ability to control costs and avoid cost and schedule overruns during the development, construction, and operation of new facilities is subject to a number of factors, including changes in labor costs, availability, and productivity; challenges with management of contractors, subcontractors, or vendors; adverse weather conditions; shortages, increased costs, or inconsistent quality of equipment, materials, and labor; project scope and design changes; and storm impacts. The southern company system's commitment to the environment has been demonstrated in many ways, including participating in partnerships resulting in approximately $140 million of funding that has restored or enhanced more than 2 million acres of habitat since 2003. The southern company system has transitioned from an electric generating mix of 70% coal and 15% natural gas in 2007 to a mix of 30% coal and 46% natural gas in 2018, along with over 8,000 mws of renewable resources. This transition has been supported in part by the southern company system retiring 4,226 mws of coal- and oil-fired generating capacity since 2010 and converting 3,280 mws of generating capacity from coal to natural gas since 2015. The southern company system's ability to achieve its goals of reducing carbon emissions is dependent on many external factors, including supportive national energy policies, low natural gas prices, and the development, deployment, and advancement of relevant energy technologies. The southern company system's construction program is currently estimated to total approximately $8.0 billion for 2019, with significant capital expenditures related to environmental compliance and infrastructure improvements. The ultimate impact of environmental laws and regulations and the ghg goals discussed herein will depend on various factors, such as state adoption and implementation of requirements, the availability and cost of any deployed technology, fuel prices, and the outcome of pending and/or future legal challenges. The southern company system's operations are regulated by state and federal environmental agencies through a variety of laws and regulations governing air, water, land, and protection of other natural resources.

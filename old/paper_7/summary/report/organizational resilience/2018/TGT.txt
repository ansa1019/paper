Our operating cash flow provided by continuing operations was $5,970 million, reflecting our efforts to manage operational resources effectively. The increase in inventory to support higher sales demonstrates our adaptability to changing market conditions and customer needs. We have continued to invest in opportunities to profitably grow our business, create sustainable long-term value, and maintain our current operations and assets, which aligns with our strategic initiatives aimed at enhancing organizational health and performance. The disciplined approach to capital allocation emphasizes our commitment to operational continuity and resource management, ensuring that we can respond effectively to environmental disruptions. Our capital expenditures increased primarily due to investments in existing stores, which is a reflection of our strategic response to enhance operational flexibility and resilience. The increase in digital channel sales, which contributed significantly to comparable sales growth, illustrates our focus on service innovation and the ability to reconfigure our business model in response to external pressures. We believe that our sources of liquidity will continue to be adequate to maintain operations and finance anticipated expansion, which is critical for our resilience strategies. Our commitment to maintaining a competitive dividend and returning excess cash to shareholders further underscores our focus on sustaining organizational strength and performance under pressure. The management of our financing strategy, including maintaining a balanced spectrum of debt maturities and managing exposure to floating interest rate volatility, is vital for ensuring our long-term resilience. The ability to access capital markets and maintain strong credit ratings is essential for our operational effectiveness and adaptability in turbulent markets. We have also focused on risk management practices, including the assessment of potential hazards and the establishment of support systems to mitigate risks associated with operational challenges. Our approach to managing legal and other contingencies reflects our commitment to maintaining organizational coherence and resilience in the face of uncertainties. The ongoing evaluation of our critical accounting estimates and the management of our pension obligations demonstrate our proactive measures to ensure financial stability.

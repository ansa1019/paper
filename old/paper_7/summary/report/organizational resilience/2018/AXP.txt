We are a global services company with three reportable operating segments: global consumer services group (gcsg), global commercial services (gcs), and global merchant and network services (gmns). Our results for 2018 reflect strong performance and our focus on, and investment in, our four strategic imperatives. We continued to invest in new services and card member benefits, new card acquisitions, and expanding our merchant network. Our results also included the benefit of a lower tax provision due to a reduction in the U.S. corporate income tax rate resulting from the tax act, along with several discrete tax benefits. We remain focused on delivering differentiated value to our merchants, card members, and business partners while delivering appropriate returns to our shareholders. Our business environment is characterized by intense competition and external pressures, which necessitate a strategic response to maintain operational flexibility and resilience. We have implemented a comprehensive enterprise-wide risk management (ERM) program to identify, aggregate, monitor, and manage risks, ensuring that we can adapt to unexpected situations and maintain performance under pressure. The risk committee of our board of directors oversees our risk management framework, ensuring that we have mechanisms in place for crisis management and recovery from disruptive events. 

Our marketing and business development expenses increased, driven by higher spending on growth initiatives and continued investments in partnerships. We have also seen an increase in card member services expenses, primarily due to higher usage of travel-related benefits. Provisions for losses increased, reflecting growth in card member loans and higher net write-offs, which are influenced by the seasoning of recent loan vintages. The increases in write-offs and delinquencies were due in part to the complexity of our lending portfolio and the need for effective risk assessment and management strategies. 

We aim to maintain access to a diverse set of cash and readily-marketable securities to meet our expected future financing obligations, particularly during economic downturns. Our liquidity management strategy includes maintaining unencumbered liquid assets and projecting cash inflows and outflows under various economic scenarios. We also seek to enhance our operational resilience through strategic initiatives that promote organizational health and adaptability. 

Our funding strategy involves maintaining a broad, deep, and diverse set of funding sources to finance our assets and meet operational requirements. We believe that our capital allocation to growing businesses with a return on risk-adjusted equity in excess of our costs will generate shareholder value. The level and composition of our consolidated capital position are determined through our internal capital adequacy assessment process, which considers our business activities and marketplace conditions. 

In summary, our organizational resilience is supported by a multifaceted approach that includes strategic planning, risk management, operational flexibility, and a commitment to innovation and customer engagement. We continuously assess our performance and adapt to the changing business environment to ensure long-term sustainability and success.

We design, make and sell semiconductors to electronics designers and manufacturers all over the world. Our business model is designed around four sustainable competitive advantages that we believe, in combination, put us in a unique class of companies: a strong foundation of manufacturing and technology, a broad portfolio of differentiated analog and embedded processing semiconductors, the broadest reach of market channels, and the diversity and longevity of our products, markets, and customer positions. We invest in manufacturing technologies and do most of our manufacturing in-house, which helps ensure a consistent supply of products for our customers and allows us to invest in technology that differentiates the features of our products. Our strategic focus is on analog and embedded processing, particularly in the industrial and automotive markets, which we believe represent the best growth opportunities. This focus provides long product life cycles, intrinsic diversity, and less capital-intensive manufacturing, offering stability, profitability, and strong cash generation. We have gained market share in analog and embedded processing and have grown free cash flow, reflecting our ability to adapt and respond to changing market conditions. Our cash flow from operations underscores the strength of our business model, and we believe we have the necessary financial resources and operating plans to fund our working capital needs, capital expenditures, dividend and debt-related payments, and other business requirements for at least the next 12 months. During periods of market downturns, we remain disciplined with our operating plan and expenses while focusing on long-term investments to strengthen our competitive advantages. Our strategy is to return all free cash flow to shareholders, which underscores our commitment to maintaining operational continuity and performance maintenance. We recognize that changes in customer demand can affect our revenue and gross profit, and we continuously assess our operational flexibility to address these fluctuations. Our segments represent groups of similar products that are combined based on design and development requirements, product characteristics, manufacturing processes, and distribution channels, reflecting our strategic resource allocation. We believe that our diverse and long-lived positions deliver high terminal value to our shareholders, as we are not dependent on any single product, customer, technology, or market. Our focus on creating a competitive manufacturing cost advantage allows us to absorb strain and preserve functioning despite the presence of adversity. We have a robust approach to risk management, which includes assessing potential impacts of environmental disruptions and maintaining a proactive stance in our strategic initiatives. Our ability to foresee and confront sudden disruptive changes is critical to our organizational resilience, enabling us to survive, grow, and flourish in a competitive landscape. We continuously invest in our capabilities to ensure we can adapt to complex situations and maintain our organizational health. The breadth of our portfolio and our strategic response mechanisms position us to effectively manage operational resources and enhance our organizational effectiveness, even under pressures and constraints.

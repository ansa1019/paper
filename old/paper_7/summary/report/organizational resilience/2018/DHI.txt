During fiscal 2018, we maintained a strong cash balance and overall liquidity position while controlling our level of debt, which reflects our commitment to managing risk and maintaining financial flexibility to make opportunistic strategic investments. Our operating strategy focuses on leveraging our financial and competitive position to increase returns on inventory investments and generate strong profitability and cash flows. We actively manage our inventory investments across our operating markets to diversify geographic risk and adapt to consumer demand. We are committed to delivering high-quality homes and a positive experience for our customers, which is central to our operational effectiveness. Our approach includes modifying product offerings, sales pace, home prices, and sales incentives as necessary to meet consumer demand and maintain affordability, demonstrating our adaptability to changing market conditions. We believe our business is well positioned with a broad geographic footprint, diverse product offerings, and a strong balance sheet, which enhances our resilience in the face of external pressures and market fluctuations. 

We have expanded our product offerings to include a broad range of homes for entry-level, move-up, and luxury buyers, indicating our strategic response to customer needs and market demands. Our operational management includes actively controlling the number of unsold, completed homes in inventory and starting construction on unsold homes to capture new home demand. We also invest in land and land development in desirable markets while controlling the level of land and lots we own relative to local new home demand, which is crucial for maintaining operational continuity. 

Our financial results indicate a significant increase in homebuilding revenues and pre-tax income, reflecting our ability to absorb strain and preserve functioning despite market challenges. We have leveraged our scale and relationships to control land and construction cost increases, which is essential for risk mitigation. The acquisition of Forestar enhances our access to optioned land and lot positions, further supporting our operational efficiency and strategic initiatives. 

We regularly assess our projected capital requirements to fund growth, repay debt obligations, and support other corporate needs, ensuring we are prepared for future market conditions. Our proactive measures include maintaining a strong balance sheet and liquidity, which allows us to navigate through economic uncertainties and environmental disruptions. We continuously evaluate our land and lot supply and manage our inventory levels to optimize returns and cash flows, reflecting our commitment to strategic resilience and operational flexibility. 

The successful execution of our strategic initiatives and the ability to adapt to changing market conditions are critical for our organizational success. We remain focused on growing revenues and profitability while managing risks associated with market volatility and external disturbances. Our organizational practices emphasize collaboration, knowledge management, and the development of dynamic capabilities, which are essential for sustaining performance under pressure and ensuring long-term organizational health.

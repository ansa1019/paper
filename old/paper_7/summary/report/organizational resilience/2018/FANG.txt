We are an independent oil and natural gas company focused on the acquisition, development, exploration, and exploitation of unconventional, onshore oil and natural gas reserves in the Permian Basin in West Texas. Our activities are directed at the horizontal development of the Wolfcamp and Spraberry formations in the Midland Basin and the Wolfcamp and Bone Spring formations in the Delaware Basin. We intend to continue to develop our reserves and increase production through development drilling and exploitation and exploration activities on our multi-year inventory of identified potential drilling locations. During 2018, we successfully closed three acquisitions, including our acquisition of Energen Corporation, which almost doubled our core acreage position. We quickly addressed the dramatic decline in oil prices by announcing a reduction in activity levels and acting on that plan immediately in 2019. By remaining focused on corporate returns and prudent capital allocation, we believe we are positioned to generate significant free cash flow while continuing to grow production at industry-leading rates. We are operating 21 rigs now and intend to operate between 18 and 22 rigs in 2019, monitoring the ongoing commodity price environment to retain financial flexibility to adjust our drilling and completion plans in response to market conditions. Our 2019 drilling and completion budget accounts for capital costs that we believe will cover potential increases in service costs during the year. We have budgeted a total capital spend of $2.7 billion to $3.0 billion, which will be allocated to horizontal drilling, midstream infrastructure investments, and other expenditures. We expect to drill and complete 290 to 320 gross horizontal wells in 2019. The increase in production volumes was due to a combination of increased drilling activity and growth through acquisitions, reflecting our ability to adapt to changing market conditions. Our revenues are derived from the sale of oil and natural gas production, and we have experienced significant revenue increases due to higher production volumes and average sales prices. We utilize commodity derivative financial instruments to reduce our exposure to fluctuations in the price of crude oil, which reflects our strategic response to external pressures. We have also entered into transportation contracts to secure access to premium pricing markets, enhancing our operational flexibility. Our liquidity and cash flow are affected by commodity prices, and we continuously monitor and adjust our projected capital expenditures in response to various factors, including drilling success and market conditions. If we require additional capital, we may seek it through traditional reserve base borrowings, joint venture partnerships, or other means. We are committed to maintaining operational continuity and adapting to environmental disruptions while focusing on organizational effectiveness and resilience strategies. Our financial resources and operational management practices are designed to ensure we can confront challenges and capitalize on opportunities, thereby enhancing our organizational strength and sustainability in a turbulent market environment.

We are one of the largest global pharmaceutical sourcing and distribution services companies, helping both healthcare providers and pharmaceutical and biotech manufacturers improve patient access to products and enhance patient care. Our operations are organized based upon the products and services we provide to our customers, which include a comprehensive offering of brand-name, specialty brand-name and generic pharmaceuticals, over-the-counter healthcare products, and related services. The pharmaceutical distribution services segment distributes these products to a wide variety of healthcare providers, including acute care hospitals and health systems, independent and chain retail pharmacies, and medical clinics. We deliver innovative programs and services designed to increase the effectiveness and efficiency of the pharmaceutical supply chain. Our business transformation efforts and restructuring activities are aimed at aligning our organization to our customers' needs, which reflects our adaptability in response to changing market conditions. We have been in active communication with regulatory bodies regarding our ongoing compliance efforts, demonstrating our commitment to maintaining operational continuity and addressing any challenges that arise. The suspension of production activities at our Memphis facility due to FDA inspections represents an unexpected situation that we are managing through compliance and remediation efforts, highlighting our resilience strategies in the face of adversity. Our revenue growth is influenced by various factors, including industry growth trends, the introduction of new innovative therapies, and changes in pharmaceutical manufacturer pricing and distribution policies. We are continuously assessing risks and opportunities, which allows us to adapt our strategies to maintain performance under pressure. The increase in distribution, selling, and administrative expenses reflects our investment in new information technology systems, which are essential for operational flexibility and enhancing our service delivery. Our effective tax rates have been favorably impacted by changes in legislation, which further supports our financial health and operational resilience. We anticipate that our future revenue growth will be supported by our strategic initiatives and the ongoing evolution of our business model, which is designed to address both current and future customer needs. Our commitment to enhancing organizational capabilities through technology and process improvements is indicative of our focus on sustaining competitive advantage in a turbulent market environment. The integration of acquisitions, such as H.D. Smith, is part of our strategy to expand our service offerings and enhance our operational effectiveness. We recognize the importance of collaboration networks and stakeholder engagement in achieving our major objectives, which ultimately contribute to our organizational success and resilience in the face of external pressures and market volatility.

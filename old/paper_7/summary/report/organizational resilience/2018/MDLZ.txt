The malware incident on June 27, 2017, significantly impacted our business, affecting a substantial portion of our global sales, distribution, and financial networks. In response, we executed business continuity and contingency plans to contain the impact, minimize damages, and restore our systems environment. We have restored our main operating systems and processes and enhanced our system security. The incident had a negative impact of 2.3% on our net revenue growth and 2.4% on our organic net revenue growth, resulting in incremental expenses of $84 million predominantly during the recovery effort. We continued efforts to strengthen our security measures and enhance general information technology, business process, and disclosure controls. Our strategy aims to drive long-term growth by focusing on accelerating consumer-centric growth, driving operational excellence, and creating a winning growth culture. We believe that the successful implementation of our strategic priorities and leveraging our strong foundation of iconic global and local brands, along with deep innovation, marketing, and distribution capabilities, will drive top- and bottom-line growth, enabling us to create long-term value for our shareholders. We monitor consumer spending and our market share within the food and beverage categories, recognizing that geopolitical and economic uncertainties may affect category growth. To mitigate adverse effects of ongoing volatility across markets, we aim to protect profitability through cost management and pricing strategies. Our growth strategy relies on expanding operations, particularly in emerging markets, which are often characterized by greater political, economic, and currency volatility. We are taking measures to increase our resources in customer service and logistics, as well as increasing inventory levels to manage through potential disruptions. We continue to monitor developments and trends that could impact our revenue and profitability objectives, including long-term demographics and consumer trends, which are expected to lead to growth in consumer behaviors such as more frequent, smaller meals and greater use of convenience foods. We recognize changing consumer trends, including an increased emphasis on well-being and time compression, and are investing in our well-being and other snack offerings, product and marketing innovation, and new routes to market, including e-commerce. Our operational flexibility is critical in responding to external pressures and ensuring business continuity. We have executed a complete withdrawal from a multiemployer pension plan, estimating a withdrawal liability of $573 million, which reflects our best estimate absent an assessment from the fund. We anticipate that the ultimate withdrawal liability may change as new information becomes available. Our financial outlook emphasizes achieving profitable, long-term growth while managing our business effectively to attain this goal. We utilize various strategic tools and mechanisms to assess risks and adapt to unexpected situations, ensuring our organizational resilience in the face of adversity.

PG&E Corporation and the utility continue to operate their businesses as debtors in possession under the jurisdiction of the bankruptcy court and in accordance with applicable provisions of the bankruptcy code and the orders of the bankruptcy court. The chapter 11 cases could adversely affect PG&E Corporation's and the utility's relationships with suppliers and employees which, in turn, could adversely affect the value of PG&E Corporation's and the utility's business and assets. Management has concluded that uncertainty regarding these matters raises substantial doubt about PG&E Corporation's and the utility's ability to continue as going concerns. The utility is facing extraordinary challenges relating to a series of catastrophic wildfires that occurred in northern California in 2017 and 2018. The realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities are subject to uncertainty. The utility's ability to fund ongoing operations and other capital needs will depend on cash on hand, cash flow from operations, and distributions received from subsidiaries. The chapter 11 cases may also provide the counterparties under certain commodity and related agreements with the right to declare an event of default and to seek termination of such agreements. The utility's financial results may continue to be impacted by the outcome of other current and future enforcement, litigation, and regulatory matters. The utility's future results depend upon the confirmation and successful implementation of a chapter 11 plan of reorganization. The utility's business is subject to the risks and uncertainties of bankruptcy, including the ability to develop and obtain applicable bankruptcy court, creditor, or regulatory approvals. The utility's future financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows depend upon confirming and successfully implementing a plan of reorganization. The utility expects that the DIP credit agreement, together with cash on hand, cash flow from operations, and distributions received from subsidiaries, will be the utility's primary source of capital to fund ongoing operations and other capital needs. The utility's obligations under the DIP credit agreement are guaranteed by PG&E Corporation, and such guarantee is a senior secured obligation of PG&E Corporation. The utility's ability to recover costs incurred in connection with the wildfires is uncertain, and the timing and outcome of claims arising from the wildfires will materially affect the utility's financial condition. The utility's ongoing operations and financial condition are subject to significant risks and uncertainties, including the impact of wildfires, regulatory changes, and the ability to recover costs through rates. The utility's response to environmental disruptions, including wildfires, will require effective risk management and adaptation strategies to ensure operational continuity and organizational resilience. The utility's future cash flows will be materially impacted by the timing and outcome of the chapter 11 cases, as well as the ability to manage and respond to the volatility of energy commodity prices and other external pressures. The utility's organizational capabilities, including operational flexibility and strategic initiatives, will be critical in navigating the challenges posed by the current business environment and ensuring long-term sustainability and resilience.

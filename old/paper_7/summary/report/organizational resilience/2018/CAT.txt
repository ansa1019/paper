In order for our results to be more meaningful to our readers, we have separately quantified the impact of several significant items. Restructuring costs in recent years have been incurred to achieve a flexible and competitive cost structure. Although we expect restructuring to continue as part of ongoing business activities, restructuring costs should be lower in 2019 than 2018. The increase in profit was primarily due to higher sales volume and lower restructuring costs. The improvement in demand was primarily in Europe, with favorable price realization contributing to the sales increase. Our strategic growth initiatives align with investments that support operational flexibility and enhance organizational capabilities. We believe the strength of the U.S. economy, continued pipeline construction, and state and local funding for infrastructure development will be favorable to sales in 2019. The company's ability to absorb strain and preserve functioning despite adversity is evident in our strategic response to environmental disruptions and operational management. We have incurred substantial restructuring costs to adapt to changing market conditions, which reflects our commitment to maintaining organizational health and resilience. The increase in sales volume was driven by improved demand across all regions and segments, indicating our capacity to respond effectively to external pressures. Our operational resources have been aligned to enhance performance under pressure, ensuring that we can navigate unexpected situations and maintain competitive advantage. The increase in dealer inventories during 2018, compared with dealer inventories that were about flat in 2017, reflects our ability to manage resource deployment effectively. We expect demand for heavy construction, quarry, and aggregate equipment to remain strong, which is indicative of our organizational foresight and adaptability in a turbulent market. Our financial products segment revenues increased primarily due to higher average financing rates and higher average earning assets, demonstrating our resilience in financial management. The anticipated increase in restructuring costs in 2019 is expected to be lower than in previous years, as we continue to implement strategic initiatives aimed at enhancing operational continuity. The company's ongoing assessment of risk management practices and resource allocation strategies is crucial for sustaining performance maintenance and organizational effectiveness. We have developed a trajectory model of organizational resilience that focuses on how actors project temporal trajectories of responses toward disruptive events, reconstitute the trajectories in immediate response to the event, and reconfigure the trajectories toward the ensuing future. Our commitment to learning organization principles supports our ability to confront challenges and reconfigure operational practices in response to complex situations. The favorable changes in dealer inventories and increased sales in various regions underscore our organizational strength and the effectiveness of our strategic planning. We believe that our proactive measures and strategic foresight will enable us to navigate future uncertainties and maintain a robust position within the competitive landscape.

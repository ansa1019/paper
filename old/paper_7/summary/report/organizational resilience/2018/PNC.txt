We manage our company for the long term, focusing on the fundamentals of growing customers, loans, deposits, and revenue while improving profitability and managing risk. Our approach is concentrated on organically growing and deepening client relationships across our businesses that meet our risk/return measures. We strive to expand and deepen customer relationships by offering a broad range of deposit, credit, and fee-based products and services, which addresses their financial objectives and puts customers' needs first. Our capital priorities support client growth and business investment, maintain appropriate capital in light of economic conditions, and return excess capital to shareholders. We face a variety of risks that may impact our risk profile, including economic conditions, political and regulatory environments, and operational challenges. Our financial performance is substantially affected by external factors, including global economic conditions, interest rate movements, and changes in customer behavior due to evolving economic conditions or regulatory initiatives. Our success depends on effectively managing capital and liquidity, management of credit risk, execution of strategic priorities, and our ability to adapt to the changing regulatory environment. We maintain a strong capital position and return capital to shareholders, reflecting our commitment to resilience in the face of external pressures. Our risk management framework is designed to optimize long-term shareholder value while supporting our employees, customers, and communities. We manage risk in light of our risk appetite, which represents the desired enterprise risk position set within our capital-based risk and liquidity capacity to achieve strategic objectives. Our enterprise strategy includes risk appetite, strategic planning, capital planning, and stress testing processes, which are reviewed and approved annually by the board of directors. We employ a comprehensive risk management governance framework to ensure risks are identified, balanced decisions are made, and risks are adequately monitored and managed. Our operational risk management framework supports the effective management of operational risk, which is inherent to the organization. We utilize operational risk management programs to assess existing risks, determine potential risks, and evaluate the effectiveness of internal controls. We also monitor compliance with laws and regulations, which can impact our ability to operate our businesses and financial condition. Our ability to identify and effectively manage risks is crucial for maintaining operational continuity and organizational resilience. We have established risk management policies and procedures to provide direction and clarity on roles and responsibilities. Our business continuity strategies are designed to mitigate risks associated with potential disruptive events to business activities. We continuously evaluate our operational practices and adapt to ensure resilience in the face of adversity, including economic fluctuations and market volatility. Our commitment to strategic initiatives and inter-organizational collaboration enhances our adaptability and positions us to respond effectively to unexpected situations.

BlackRock is implementing a number of steps to prepare for various outcomes, including effecting organizational, governance and operational changes, applying for and receiving licenses and permissions in the EU, and engaging in client communications. These steps, many of which have been time-consuming and costly, are expected to add complexity to BlackRock's European operations. In addition, depending on the terms of the UK's exit from the EU, BlackRock may experience organizational and operational challenges and incur additional costs in connection with its European operations post-Brexit, which may impede the company's growth or impact its financial performance. BlackRock's diversified platform, in terms of style, product, client and geography, enables it to generate more stable cash flows through market cycles, positioning BlackRock to invest for the long term by striking an appropriate balance between investing for future growth and prudent discretionary expense management. The diversity of BlackRock's platform facilitates the generation of organic growth in various market environments, and as client preferences evolve. BlackRock continues to invest in technology services offerings, which enhance the ability to manage portfolios and risk, effectively serve clients and operate efficiently. Anticipated industry consolidation and regulatory requirements should continue to drive demand for holistic and flexible technology solutions. The company's framework for long-term value creation is predicated on generating differentiated organic growth, leveraging scale to increase operating margins over time, and returning capital to shareholders on a consistent basis. BlackRock's investment management revenue is primarily comprised of fees earned as a percentage of assets under management (AUM) and, in some cases, performance fees, which are normally expressed as a percentage of fund returns to the client. Numerous factors, including price movements in the equity, debt or currency markets, or in the price of real assets, commodities or alternative investments in which BlackRock invests on behalf of clients, could impact BlackRock's AUM, revenue and earnings. BlackRock's highly diversified multi-product platform was created to meet client needs in all market environments. The company serves a diverse mix of institutional and retail clients across the globe, including investors in iShares ETFs, maintaining differentiated client relationships and a fiduciary focus. The company manages $3.0 trillion of equity assets across markets globally. Significant global equity market declines in the fourth quarter of 2018, which reduced BlackRock's AUM by approximately $466 billion over that period, negatively impacted BlackRock's base fee run-rate entering 2019. In addition, challenged market performance in direct hedge funds and hedge fund solutions in 2018 may also impact performance fees for 2019, as certain quarterly- and annual-locking funds are below high-water marks entering the year. BlackRock's institutional results will be driven by enhancing BlackRock's solutions-oriented approach; deepening client relationships through product diversification and higher value-add capabilities, including illiquid alternatives; and leveraging Aladdin's analytical and risk management expertise. The company continues to monitor various factors, including AUM, for potential indicators of impairment. BlackRock's management believes evaluating the company's ongoing operating results may be enhanced if investors have additional non-GAAP financial measures. Management uses both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures in evaluating BlackRock's financial performance.

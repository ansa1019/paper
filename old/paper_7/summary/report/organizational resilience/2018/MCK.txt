The company conducts its business through three reportable segments: U.S. pharmaceutical and specialty solutions, European pharmaceutical solutions, and medical-surgical solutions. Revenues increased primarily due to market growth, including expanded business with existing customers and business acquisitions, partially offset by the loss of customers within the U.S. pharmaceutical and specialty solutions segment. The increase in revenue was also affected by growing drug utilization, price increases, and newly launched products, while facing price deflation associated with brand to generic drug conversion. The company’s operational efficiency is being enhanced through strategic growth initiatives aimed at optimizing operating models and cost structures, which include centralization and outsourcing of certain administrative functions. The company anticipates that the relocation of its corporate headquarters will improve efficiency, collaboration, and cost competitiveness. A strategic growth initiative was announced to drive long-term incremental profit growth and increase operational efficiency, which includes a reduction in workforce and facility consolidation. The company is also committed to implementing actions to support operational continuity and adaptability in response to external pressures and competitive environments. The fiscal 2019 restructuring initiatives are expected to be substantially completed by the end of 2020, with total pre-tax charges anticipated to be approximately $140 million to $180 million. The company’s operational flexibility is evidenced by its ability to absorb strain and preserve functioning despite the presence of adversity, including government reimbursement reductions and competitive pressures. The company’s financial condition is supported by available cash generated from operations and existing sources of liquidity from credit facilities and commercial paper issuance. The company continuously monitors its operations and adopts strategies responsive to changes in the economic and political environment in each of the countries in which it operates, reflecting a systemic perspective on organizational resilience. The company’s ability to respond effectively to environmental disruptions and transform itself to emerge stronger from challenging situations is a core aspect of its operational strategy. The company recognizes the importance of maintaining organizational health and adaptability in the face of market volatility and external disturbances. The company’s approach to risk management includes assessing the impact of potential adverse events and implementing proactive measures to mitigate risks associated with operational changes and market conditions. The company’s commitment to strategic initiatives and inter-organizational collaboration is essential for sustaining competitive advantage and ensuring long-term organizational success. The financial review indicates that the company is positioned to confront challenges and leverage opportunities for growth, demonstrating resilience in navigating complex situations and maintaining performance under pressure.

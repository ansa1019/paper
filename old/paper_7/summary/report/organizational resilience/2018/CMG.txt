As of December 31, 2018, we operated 2,452 Chipotle restaurants throughout the United States, 37 international Chipotle restaurants, and two non-Chipotle restaurants, demonstrating our commitment to accessibility and purpose. We continue to invest in improving our digital platforms and equipping select restaurants with an upgraded second make line dedicated to fulfilling out-of-restaurant orders, which reflects our adaptability to changing customer needs and operational flexibility. During 2018, our restaurant operating costs as a percentage of revenue decreased, primarily due to comparable restaurant sales increases combined with lower marketing and promotional expenses, indicating effective resource allocation and operational management. We recognized total corporate restructuring costs during 2018, which included employee severance and transition costs, recruitment and relocation costs, and lease termination costs, highlighting our strategic response to internal changes and the necessity for organizational resilience in the face of restructuring. In June 2018, we announced planned restaurant closures of approximately 55 to 65 restaurants, which were part of our strategy to address underperforming locations and to reconfigure our operational footprint, thereby maintaining organizational health and performance under pressure. We expect to incur additional restaurant exit costs into 2019, demonstrating our ongoing commitment to managing operational challenges and ensuring future viability. The significant factors contributing to revenue increases in 2018 were new restaurant openings and comparable restaurant sales increases, which reflect our ability to foresee and respond to market demands effectively. Our corporate restructuring and restaurant closures are aimed at enhancing overall operational effectiveness and ensuring long-term sustainability. We have also invested in leadership changes, adding key executives to strengthen our organizational capabilities and strategic initiatives. The increase in general and administrative expenses in 2018 was largely due to costs associated with corporate restructuring and initiatives to support restaurant growth, indicating our focus on maintaining performance during periods of change. Our liquidity and capital resources are primarily generated from operating activities, which we utilize to finance new restaurant construction and improve guest experiences, underscoring our resilience strategies in navigating operational challenges. We believe that cash from operations, along with our cash and investment balances, will be sufficient to meet ongoing capital expenditures and working capital requirements, reflecting our strategic foresight and resource management capabilities. The planned capital expenditures for 2019 include investments in existing restaurants and new restaurant construction, which are essential for maintaining operational continuity and adapting to market conditions. Our approach to managing inflationary pressures through menu price increases and cost control measures demonstrates our proactive measures to sustain profitability and operational resilience. The ongoing evaluation of our operational practices and the integration of strategic tools are critical to our ability to confront and adapt to external pressures and market volatility, ensuring organizational survival and success in a competitive landscape.

The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly curtailed global economic activity and caused substantial volatility and disruption in global financial markets, adversely affecting the company's business, results of operations, financial condition, and stock price. The company has experienced operational disruptions, with many retail stores and channel partner points of sale temporarily closed, and the majority of employees working remotely. The company has reopened some offices and retail stores, subject to operating restrictions to protect public health and safety. The full extent of the future impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on operational and financial performance remains uncertain and will depend on various factors outside the company's control, including the timing, extent, trajectory, and duration of the pandemic, as well as the development and availability of effective treatments and vaccines. The company believes its existing balances of cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities will be sufficient to satisfy its working capital needs and other liquidity requirements associated with its existing operations. The year-over-year growth in research and development expense was driven primarily by increases in headcount-related expenses, as the company continues to believe that focused investments in R&D are critical to its future growth and competitive position in the marketplace. The company’s investment policy generally requires securities to be investment grade, which minimizes the potential risk of principal loss. The company’s marketable securities investment portfolio is primarily invested in highly rated securities, with a primary objective of minimizing risk. The company’s ability to respond effectively to environmental disruptions and transform itself to emerge stronger from challenging situations is reflected in its financial management strategies, including cash generated by operating activities and strategic capital return programs. The company has a share repurchase program that allows for the repurchase of common stock, which is a strategic response to maintain shareholder value during turbulent market conditions. The company’s operational flexibility is demonstrated through its ability to manage its business primarily on a geographic basis, aligning with the unique market dynamics of each region. The company’s approach to risk management includes entering into interest rate swaps to manage interest rate risk on its notes and foreign currency swaps to manage foreign currency risk. The company's operational continuity and resilience strategies are evident in its commitment to maintaining adequate liquidity and managing its resources effectively in response to external pressures and disruptions. The company’s performance maintenance strategies are supported by its focus on innovation and adaptation, which are critical for navigating complex situations and ensuring organizational effectiveness in the face of adversity. The company’s leadership and strategic foresight are essential for fostering an environment conducive to organizational learning and resilience, enabling it to confront challenges and capitalize on opportunities for growth and sustainability.

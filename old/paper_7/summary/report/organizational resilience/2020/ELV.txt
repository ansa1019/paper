We are one of the largest health benefits companies in the United States, serving approximately 43 medical members through our affiliated health plans. The COVID-19 pandemic has created unique and unprecedented challenges, impacting our membership and benefit expenses, and influencing member behavior. We proactively took several actions to preserve our liquidity and financial flexibility and minimize the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, including borrowing under our senior revolving credit facility and delaying certain tax payments. Our strategy includes expanding through a combination of organic growth, strategic acquisitions, and efficient use of capital, which enables us to take advantage of additional economies of scale and provides access to new technologies and products. We believe geographic and product diversity reduces our exposure to local or regional regulatory, economic, and competitive pressures, thus enhancing our organizational resilience. The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly impacted our operations, causing market instability and increasing unemployment, which may adversely affect our claim payments and revenues. We continue to monitor the pandemic and its implications for our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Our results of operations depend on our ability to accurately predict and effectively manage healthcare costs through effective contracting with providers, product pricing, medical management, and health and wellness programs. We strive to maintain operational flexibility and adaptability in response to external pressures and environmental perturbations. Our comprehensive pharmacy benefits management services are designed to enhance our operational capabilities and improve member experiences. We have implemented quality improvement activities aimed at improving member health outcomes and preventing hospital readmissions, which are essential for maintaining organizational health. The ongoing evolution of our business model is influenced by regulatory changes, including those related to the Affordable Care Act, which may impact our strategic initiatives and operational practices. We recognize the importance of maintaining a strong financial condition and liquidity position, which is critical for our ability to respond to unexpected situations and ensure business continuity. Our organizational practices are focused on enhancing our capacity for learning and adaptation, which are vital for thriving in a turbulent market environment. We have taken steps to optimize our business operations, including process automation and reducing our office space footprint, which reflects our commitment to organizational transformation and resilience. Our ability to absorb strain and preserve functioning despite adversity is demonstrated through our proactive measures and strategic planning, which are essential for navigating complex situations and ensuring long-term success. The ongoing assessment of risks and opportunities allows us to reconfigure our strategies and maintain a competitive advantage in the healthcare industry. We will continue to engage with stakeholders and leverage our collaborative networks to enhance our organizational resilience and effectiveness in meeting customer needs.

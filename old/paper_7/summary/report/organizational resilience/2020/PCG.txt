PG&E Corporation and the utility have taken aggressive steps to mitigate the threat of catastrophic wildfires, the spread of wildfires should they occur, and the impact of public safety power shutoff (PSPS) events. The utility's wildfire risk mitigation initiatives involve substantial and ongoing expenditures, which could involve other costs, and the extent to which the utility will be able to recover these expenditures through rates is uncertain. The utility has incurred significant costs in connection with wildfire mitigation plans, and the success of these efforts depends on various factors, including the ability to retain or contract for the workforce necessary to execute wildfire mitigation actions. The utility's financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows may be materially affected by uncertainties in connection with future wildfires, wildfire insurance, and regulatory changes. The utility's ability to fund operations and make scheduled payments depends on the levels of its operating cash flows and access to capital markets. The utility's financial results may also be impacted by the timing and outcome of ratemaking proceedings, as well as the uncertainties regarding the impact of PSPS events, which have adversely affected the utility's reputation with customers, regulators, and policymakers. The utility's wildfire-related liabilities are recorded when it determines that a loss is probable and can reasonably estimate the loss or a range of losses, reflecting the complexities and uncertainties involved in estimating potential liabilities. The utility's operations are subject to extensive regulation, and the outcomes of various enforcement, litigation, and regulatory matters could materially affect its financial condition. The utility is also subject to an enhanced oversight and enforcement process, which requires additional reporting and monitoring by the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC). The utility's organizational culture and governance are under scrutiny to ensure that safety is prioritized and that resources are adequately directed to promote accountability and achieve safety goals. The utility's wildfire mitigation plans are designed to minimize the risk of its electrical lines and equipment causing catastrophic wildfires, and the effectiveness of these plans is essential for maintaining operational continuity and resilience in the face of environmental perturbations. The utility's financial condition and operational flexibility are influenced by its ability to adapt to changing regulatory requirements and external pressures, including the ongoing impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. The utility's strategic initiatives include implementing emergency customer protections and establishing memorandum accounts to track costs associated with these protections. The utility's participation in the wildfire fund is contingent upon meeting specific eligibility requirements, and its contributions to the fund are treated similarly to prepaid insurance, with expenses allocated ratably based on an estimated period of coverage. The utility's financial health is also affected by its ability to recover costs associated with wildfire mitigation and other regulatory compliance efforts, which are critical for sustaining its operations and ensuring long-term resilience.

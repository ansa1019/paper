In response to the pressures from the COVID-19 pandemic, we have demonstrated our ability to adapt and maintain operational continuity by implementing various measures to promote the health and safety of our customers and team members while keeping our stores open. These actions included implementing social distancing standards, providing personal protective equipment, modifying store procedures, and enhancing cleaning protocols. Additionally, we relaxed attendance policies and advanced sick time for team members affected by COVID-19. We took proactive measures to strengthen our liquidity and mitigate the expected ongoing impact on our operations and financial performance, which included temporarily deferring certain capital investments and managing our cost structure in response to sales volatility. Our ability to navigate the current environment reflects our organizational resilience, as we have adjusted our operations to meet customer needs during challenging conditions. The gradual reopening of markets positively impacted our performance, indicating our capacity to recover and adapt to external pressures. We have also focused on enhancing our service offerings and customer education regarding vehicle maintenance, which supports our strategic initiatives aimed at maintaining a competitive advantage. Our dual market strategy, which serves both DIY customers and professional service providers, has been instrumental in our ability to respond effectively to market dynamics. The acquisition of Mayasa has further strengthened our operational capabilities and market presence, contributing to our resilience in the face of disruption. We remain committed to our long-term business strategy, which requires capital to open new stores and expand distribution infrastructure, while also ensuring we are prepared for future uncertainties. Our financial strategies, including the issuance of senior notes and the management of our revolving credit facility, demonstrate our focus on maintaining liquidity and financial flexibility. The increase in sales during 2020, despite significant headwinds, highlights our operational effectiveness and ability to adapt to changing market conditions. We have seen strong demand for our products driven by consumers investing in existing vehicles, which underscores the importance of our organizational practices in fostering resilience. Our commitment to continuous improvement in customer service, inventory management, and operational efficiency positions us well to confront future challenges. The ongoing assessment of our performance under pressure and the strategic response to environmental disruptions are critical components of our organizational resilience framework. We recognize that the ability to foresee and adapt to complex situations is essential for sustaining our business and achieving long-term success. As we navigate the evolving landscape, we will continue to leverage our organizational strengths, including our skilled workforce and robust supply chain, to enhance our resilience and ensure operational continuity.

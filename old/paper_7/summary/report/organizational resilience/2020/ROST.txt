Ross Stores, Inc. operates two brands of off-price retail apparel and home fashion stores and is the largest off-price apparel and home fashion chain in the United States. The company’s primary objective is to pursue and refine existing off-price strategies to maintain and improve both profitability and financial returns over the long term. The COVID-19 pandemic has had a material adverse impact on the company's results of operations, financial position, and cash flows, resulting in significant revenue decline due to temporary store closures and mandated occupancy restrictions. In response to the pandemic, the company temporarily closed all store locations, distribution centers, and corporate offices, implementing "work from home" measures for many associates. The company took actions to preserve financial liquidity and enhance flexibility, including borrowing $800 million from its revolving credit facility and completing a $2.0 billion senior notes offering. The organization faced challenges in adapting to the pandemic's impact, including reduced customer traffic and the need for operational changes, such as enhanced cleaning and sanitation activities. The company incurred additional operating costs related to these measures, resulting in approximately $130 million in additional net costs for fiscal 2020. As stores reopened, the company experienced a surge in customer demand but faced challenges due to depleted inventory levels and ongoing uncertainties regarding consumer behavior. The organization has negotiated rent deferrals and abatements for many stores to manage financial pressures during this period. The ongoing effects of the pandemic may continue to create significant uncertainty and challenges, impacting cash flows and operational continuity. The company anticipates potential interruptions to cash flows from operations and plans to rely more on cash reserves while carefully monitoring and managing its cash position. The strategic response to the pandemic includes evaluating opportunistic real estate acquisitions and adjusting the pace of new store openings based on market conditions and consumer demand. The company also implemented temporary furloughs for a large portion of its workforce and suspended stock repurchase programs and dividends to conserve cash. The organization’s ability to adapt to these challenges reflects its resilience strategies, focusing on maintaining operational flexibility and responding effectively to environmental disruptions. As the company navigates through these exceptional conditions, it aims to maintain its competitive advantage by refining its merchandise offerings and leveraging its operational capabilities to recover and grow in the future. The uncertainty surrounding the pandemic's duration and impact on consumer demand continues to pose risks, necessitating ongoing assessment and strategic adaptation to ensure organizational survival and success.

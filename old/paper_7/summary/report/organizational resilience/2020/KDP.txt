The ongoing outbreak of COVID-19 has created category headwinds for a number of our products, requiring us to adapt quickly to changes in shopping behaviors. We are focused on providing for our communities by supporting frontline healthcare workers and have found innovative ways to maintain operations under challenging conditions. The pandemic has had divergent impacts within our business, with a significant increase in demand for our at-home products while experiencing declines in our away-from-home business. Our ability to continue operations without significant negative impacts will depend on our capacity to protect critical frontline employees and our supply chain, as food and agriculture are deemed part of the critical infrastructure. We have implemented measures to ensure employee safety, which include temporary incentive pay programs and enhanced safety protocols. Our integrated business model enables us to be more flexible and responsive to the changing needs of our large retail customers, allowing us to leverage our scale and reduce costs. The diversity of our broad portfolio and extensive route-to-market network has enabled us to navigate the impacts of the pandemic effectively. We continue to manage all aspects of our business, including monitoring the financial health of our customers and suppliers, implementing gross margin enhancement strategies, and developing new opportunities for growth. Our financial condition and liquidity remain strong, and we believe we are uniquely positioned to manage our business as the crisis continues to unfold. We have taken deliberate actions to maintain operational continuity, including reducing discretionary costs and managing our marketing expenses in light of the current environment. The current situation has increased operating costs, necessitating strong portfolio and channel mix management to optimize overall performance. We expect heightened volatility in net sales during and subsequent to the duration of the pandemic, which may impact interim periods. Our ability to adapt to these challenges reflects our organizational resilience, as we strive to maintain positive adjustment under adverse conditions. We have also recognized the need for strategic initiatives that enhance our operational flexibility and responsiveness to external pressures, ensuring we can sustain performance despite environmental perturbations. Our commitment to employee safety and community support during this crisis exemplifies our organizational strength and resilience strategies. We are actively assessing risks and opportunities to ensure we can confront future challenges and continue to thrive in a turbulent market environment.

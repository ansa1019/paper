The outbreak of COVID-19 continues to impact the United States and other countries throughout the world, causing disruptions to our business and adversely affecting our financial results. Economic and market conditions, including those caused by the pandemic, have substantial impacts on our financial condition and results of operations, influencing the values of our investments, our ability to exit these investments profitably, and our capacity to raise capital from investors. The volatility and dislocation in capital markets raise substantial risks but also present opportunities to invest at reduced valuations that position us for future growth and investment returns. Our ability to grow our revenues depends in part on our ability to attract new capital and investors, which is driven by the perception of the alternative asset management industry and our investment products as attractive vehicles for capital appreciation or income. The competitive fundraising environment may affect our ability to successfully raise comparably sized or larger funds, impacting our assets under management and associated fees. Our ability to maintain and grow our revenue base is contingent upon successfully deploying capital and participating in capital markets transactions, which may be influenced by greater competition, high valuations, and increased overall costs of credit. Challenging market and economic conditions may adversely affect our ability to exit and realize value from our investments, resulting in lower-than-expected returns. The strength and liquidity of the U.S. and relevant global equity markets generally affect the valuation of our equity positions and our ability to successfully exit our private equity portfolio companies in a timely manner. Our investments are impacted by various economic conditions and events outside of our control that are difficult to quantify or predict, which may have a significant impact on the valuation of our investments and, therefore, on the investment income we realize and our results of operations and financial condition. We have a long-term investment horizon, and the capital deployed in any one quarter may vary significantly from the capital deployed in any other quarter or the quarterly average of capital deployed in any given year. Reduced levels of transaction activity tend to result in reduced potential future investment gains, lower transaction fees, and lower fees for our capital markets business line. Our ability to attract new capital and investors is influenced by our successful deployment of capital and the overall market conditions. The operational flexibility to adapt to unexpected situations and environmental perturbations is critical for maintaining organizational health and performance. Our strategic initiatives focus on resource allocation and the development of resilience strategies to navigate through crises and ensure business continuity. The need for effective risk assessment and management mechanisms is paramount in addressing external pressures and maintaining operational continuity. The organizational capabilities to absorb strain and preserve functioning under challenging conditions are essential for achieving major objectives and sustaining competitive advantage in a turbulent market environment.

Equinix has activated its business continuity plans globally with the goal of providing seamless operations throughout its facilities, including provisions for ensuring all data centers remain staffed and fully operational. The company has implemented precautionary measures to minimize the risk of operational impact and to protect the health and safety of its employees, customers, partners, and communities. These measures include an appointment-based system to control timing and frequency of visits, while also encouraging customers to leverage remote operational support services to restrict visits and minimize the number of people and time spent in facilities. The company has redundancies built into its supply chain of vendors and maintains a stock of critical items on site to ensure repairs can be completed. To date, Equinix has not observed any significant disruption to its data center operations due to supply chain impacts from the COVID-19 pandemic. The majority of revenue is derived from large companies across diverse industries, indicating a broad customer base that contributes to organizational resilience. Equinix's financial resources are expected to allow it to manage potential impacts from the ongoing pandemic, which could include reductions in revenue and delays in payments from customers and partners. The company continues to pursue expansion opportunities, primarily the build-out of new data centers in existing markets that are at or near capacity. Equinix's strong financial position and focused business model are designed to drive new customer growth and bookings, leveraging a critical mass of enterprise and service provider customers. The company has experienced some construction delays due to the pandemic; however, these delays and additional costs are considered insignificant relative to the overall project duration and budget. The company has also assessed realized and potential credit deterioration of its customers due to changes in the macroeconomic environment and has increased its allowance for credit losses for accounts receivable. Equinix's operational flexibility and strategic response to the pandemic demonstrate its commitment to maintaining performance under pressure. The company has a recurring revenue model, with more than 90% of total revenues derived from colocation and related interconnection services, which contributes to its organizational health and resilience. The ongoing evaluation of operational resources, customer needs, and market conditions informs Equinix's strategic initiatives and resource allocation, ensuring adaptability in a turbulent business environment. The company continues to monitor available capacity in each of its selected markets and performs demand studies to determine if future expansion is warranted. Its interconnected data centers allow customers to increase information and application delivery performance while significantly reducing costs, further enhancing the company's competitive advantage.

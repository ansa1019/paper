Global economic uncertainty, including the effects of the COVID-19 global pandemic, continues to impact the company's results of operations. Demand for rail services saw large and rapid declines in the first half of the year, followed by steep sequential increases in the second half, but the effects of the disruption of global manufacturing, supply chains, and consumer spending as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic are ongoing. The company maintains a strong cash balance and access to committed funding sources and other sources of external liquidity if required. As this is a dynamic situation, it is difficult to determine the future impacts of the pandemic. The full implications of COVID-19, including the extent of its impact on the company's financial and operating results, will be determined by several factors, including the timing of vaccine production and distribution as well as the impacts of virus mutations and case resurgences across the country. CSX employees that provide efficient and reliable rail service are essential to keeping supply chains fluid in response to this challenge. Accordingly, business operations have been modified to ensure the safety of employees across the network while continuing to provide a high level of service to customers. A cross-functional task force monitors and coordinates the company's response to COVID-19. Policies and procedures established to protect the health and safety of employees and customers and to safeguard CSX operations include rigorous cleaning regimens for equipment and facilities, provision of sanitation supplies, distribution of disposable face coverings, facilitation of social distancing measures, and administration of temperature testing at certain facilities. These precautions remain in place despite the easing of pandemic restrictions by state and local governments across the network. Additionally, remote work arrangements have been made where possible in order to reduce the density of employees in a single location, and alternative locations for key functions, such as dispatch, are being utilized as needed. The company is committed to operational and safety improvement while remaining focused on reducing risk and enhancing the overall safety of its employees, customers, and communities in which the company operates. Despite operating challenges presented by the COVID-19 pandemic, the company remained focused on safety, service, and controlling costs. The company is continually evaluating market and regulatory conditions that could affect its ability to generate sufficient returns on capital investments. CSX is committed to maintaining and improving its existing infrastructure and to positioning itself for long-term, profitable growth through optimizing network and terminal capacity. The company has multiple sources of liquidity, including cash generated from operations and financing sources. CSX's credit ratings remained stable during 2020, reflecting its commitment to maintaining an investment-grade credit profile. The company is well positioned from a liquidity standpoint, ending the year with $3.1 billion of cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments. The increase in cash and short-term investments was driven by cash from operations and proceeds from the issuance of long-term debt. The company continues to maintain adequate current assets to satisfy current liabilities and maturing obligations when they come due. The company is committed to returning cash to shareholders, and future share repurchases are expected to be funded by cash on hand, cash generated from operations, and debt issuances. The company remains focused on strategic initiatives that enhance operational flexibility and resilience in the face of external pressures and disruptions.

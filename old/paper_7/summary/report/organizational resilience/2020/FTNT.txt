In response to the unprecedented challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic, we have implemented readiness plans to maintain critical internet infrastructure, with many employees working remotely. We have taken actions to protect our employees, including restricting travel and directing most employees to work from home, while implementing measures such as staggered work shifts and health safety awareness training. Our business model involves selling security solutions to a diverse range of organizations, which enhances our operational flexibility and adaptability in the face of external pressures. We have noted that certain aspects of our business have not been significantly affected, demonstrating our resilience in navigating unexpected situations. The allowance for credit losses was increased after performing additional credit reviews of existing customers, reflecting our proactive measures in risk assessment and management. We have offered payment terms in excess of our contractual agreements to certain distributor customers, which has resulted in an increase in the average collection period of our trade receivables. Our total deferred revenue balance grew significantly, indicating our ability to generate resources and maintain performance despite external disturbances. The pandemic has led to a lengthening of sales cycles for some customers, which may impact future performance, yet our operational management strategies remain focused on sustaining growth. We have increased our on-hand stock of certain products to mitigate supply chain risks, demonstrating our capacity for resource reconfiguration under extreme conditions. The diversification of our revenue globally remains a key strength, with significant contributions from various geographic regions, which supports our organizational health and competitive advantage. Our cybersecurity solutions are designed to provide broad visibility and segmentation of the digital attack surface, which is critical for maintaining operational continuity. The growth in our service revenue, driven by fortiguard and other security subscriptions, reflects our strategic initiatives to enhance customer engagement and meet evolving customer needs. We are committed to investing in research and development, which is essential for fostering innovation and maintaining our position in the competitive landscape. Our financial resources, including cash and cash equivalents, are sufficient to meet anticipated cash needs, supporting our resilience strategies in the face of uncertainty. The ongoing evaluation of our operational resources and strategic response mechanisms will be crucial as we navigate the complexities of the current business environment. We continue to monitor key metrics to evaluate growth trends and operational efficiencies, ensuring that we remain agile and responsive to market demands. The implications of the pandemic on our business and operations are being assessed continuously, as we strive to adapt and transform in response to the evolving landscape.

We manage our company for the long term, focused on the fundamentals of growing customers, loans, deposits, and revenue while improving profitability and managing risk, expenses, and capital. Our approach is concentrated on organically growing and deepening client relationships across our businesses that meet our risk/return measures. We strive to serve our customers and expand relationships by offering a broad range of deposit, credit, and fee-based products and services, addressing their financial objectives and putting customers' needs first. Our capital priorities support customers and business investment, maintaining appropriate capital in light of economic conditions and regulatory expectations. The extent of risks we face may vary depending on current business and economic conditions, political and regulatory environment, and operational challenges. Our success will depend upon effectively managing capital and liquidity, executing our strategic priorities, and managing credit risk in our portfolio. We continue to invest in our products, markets, and brand, embracing commitments to our customers, shareholders, employees, and communities where we do business. Our financial performance is substantially affected by external factors, including global and domestic economic conditions, actions by government agencies, and changes in the competitive and regulatory landscape. We have granted loan modifications through various hardship relief programs to assist our customers in need during the pandemic, reflecting our commitment to organizational resilience. Our risk management strategies are designed to identify, assess, and mitigate risks, ensuring we remain within our risk appetite while supporting our strategic objectives. We maintain a strong capital position and have adopted the CECL accounting standard, which reflects the significantly adverse economic impacts of the pandemic on loan portfolio credit quality. Our operational risk management framework is designed to provide effective management of operational risk, enabling us to understand and manage risks to achieve our desired risk profile. We actively monitor the interest rate environment and make adjustments in response to evolving market conditions, ensuring our balance sheet is positioned to benefit from changes in interest rates. Our enterprise risk management framework includes risk culture, strategic planning, risk governance, and oversight, which collectively support our organizational resilience. We have established a comprehensive risk management governance framework to ensure that risks are identified, monitored, and managed effectively. Our operational risk management practices are embedded in our culture and decision-making processes, allowing us to adapt to unexpected situations and maintain operational continuity. We continuously assess our current branch network for optimization opportunities, reflecting our commitment to operational flexibility and adaptability in response to changing customer behaviors and market conditions. The planned acquisition of BBVA is expected to enhance our capabilities and strengthen our position in the market, further contributing to our organizational resilience. We have established a cross-functional governance structure to oversee our transition from LIBOR and mitigate associated risks, demonstrating our proactive approach to managing potential disruptions. Our focus on customer loyalty and engagement, along with our strategic initiatives, positions us to effectively respond to external pressures and maintain organizational health in a turbulent business environment.

The energy landscape changed dramatically in 2020 with simultaneous demand and supply shocks that drove the industry into a severe downturn. The demand shock was triggered by the COVID-19 pandemic, which continues to have unprecedented social and economic consequences. Mitigation efforts to stop the spread of this highly contagious disease included stay-at-home orders and business closures that caused sharp contractions in economic activity worldwide. Despite these challenges, the company entered 2020 in a position of relative strength, with cash and cash equivalents of more than $5 billion, short-term investments of $3 billion, and an undrawn credit facility of $6 billion, totaling approximately $14 billion in available liquidity. This strong foundation allowed the company to be measured in its response to the sudden change in the business environment. The company announced an initial set of actions to address the downturn, which included a reduction in its 2020 operating plan capital and operating costs, and the suspension of its share repurchase program. These actions decreased uses of cash by approximately $5 billion in 2020. The company also established a framework for evaluating its assets and implementing economic production curtailments, which resulted in voluntarily curtailing production predominantly from operated North American assets. Due to its strong balance sheet, the company was in an advantaged position to forgo some production and cash flow in anticipation of receiving higher cash flows for those volumes in the future. The workforce and operations adjusted to mitigate the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, with personnel performing daily self-assessments for symptoms of illness and staffing levels in certain operating locations reduced to minimize health risk exposure. The marketing and supply chain side of the business adapted in response to COVID-19, proactively working with vendors to ensure the continuity of business operations and monitor distressed service and materials providers. The company enhanced its focus on counterparty risk monitoring during this period and requested credit assurances when applicable. Operationally, the company remained focused on safely executing the business, generating cash provided by operating activities of $4.8 billion in 2020. The company’s decisive actions over the last several years, including focusing on free cash flow generation, high-grading its asset base, and lowering the cost of supply of its investment resource portfolio, have put it in a strong relative position compared to its independent peers. The expectation is that commodity prices will remain cyclical and volatile, and a successful business strategy in the exploration and production industry must be resilient in lower price environments while retaining upside during periods of higher prices. The company has demonstrated its ability to adapt to local conditions as warranted, and its operations have adjusted to mitigate the impacts of external pressures, thereby maintaining operational continuity and organizational health. The company’s commitment to safety and environmental stewardship remains a priority, as it strives to protect the health and safety of everyone involved in its operations and the communities in which it operates.

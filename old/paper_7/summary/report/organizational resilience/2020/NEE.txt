Nee and its subsidiaries require funds to support and grow their businesses, which are primarily provided by cash flows from operations, borrowings, or issuances of short- and long-term debt. The ability to maintain a strong investment grade credit rating is essential for accessing capital markets, which is critical for operational continuity and resilience under adverse conditions. Nee and FPL are closely monitoring the global outbreak of COVID-19 and are taking steps intended to mitigate the potential risks posed by the pandemic. FPL's service area was impacted by Hurricane Dorian in 2019 and by Hurricane Isaias and Tropical Storm Eta in 2020. FPL determined that it would not seek recovery of the storm restoration costs through a storm surcharge from customers and instead recorded costs as storm restoration costs in consolidated statements of income, utilizing available reserve amortization to offset these costs. This approach reflects a strategic response to external pressures and demonstrates operational flexibility in crisis management. The use of reserve amortization is permitted by the 2016 rate agreement, which is critical for maintaining financial health and achieving targeted regulatory return on equity. In 2020, FPL's net income increased primarily due to continued investments in plant in service and other property, showcasing the importance of resource allocation and strategic initiatives in enhancing organizational resilience. Neer's results decreased in 2020 primarily driven by an impairment charge related to its investment in Mountain Valley Pipeline, highlighting the impact of external disturbances on firm performance. Neer added significant new wind and solar generating capacity in the U.S. and increased its backlog of contracted renewable development projects, indicating adaptability and resource generation capabilities in response to market demands. The capital investments made by Nee and its subsidiaries are aimed at expanding and enhancing electric systems and generation facilities to provide reliable service, which is essential for organizational survival and resilience in a turbulent market environment. The liquidity and capital resources section emphasizes the need for effective resource management and the importance of maintaining access to credit and capital markets to support ongoing operations and strategic growth initiatives. The ability to foresee and confront sudden disruptive changes is critical for survival, growth, and flourishing in the competitive landscape. The management of counterparty credit risk through established policies and credit enhancements reflects a proactive approach to risk mitigation, ensuring organizational coherence and stability in the face of uncertainties. Overall, the disclosures illustrate a multifaceted approach to organizational resilience, focusing on operational flexibility, strategic foresight, and the capacity to adapt to complex situations and external pressures while maintaining performance under challenging conditions.

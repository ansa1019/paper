Occidental's operations, financial condition, cash flows, and levels of expenditures are highly dependent on oil prices and, to a lesser extent, natural gas liquids and natural gas prices. The ongoing effects of the COVID-19 pandemic have severely impacted the worldwide economy, leading to travel restrictions and stay-at-home orders that limited oil and gas demand. In response to the dramatic drop in oil prices, Occidental has taken significant measures to enhance its liquidity position, including reducing its capital budget and making substantial cuts to operating and corporate costs. Occidental has realized overhead savings and operating cost savings, which are expected to remain permanent in future years. The company has also reduced its quarterly common stock dividend to preserve liquidity and entered into a new receivable securitization facility to provide additional liquidity. Occidental believes these actions enhance its liquidity position to fund operations and may make further adjustments to future levels of expenditures and operating costs based on economic conditions. The ultimate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on Occidental's results of operations and financial position remains uncertain and could be material. Occidental is focused on protecting the health and safety of its employees and contractors during the pandemic and has implemented workplace restrictions for health and safety reasons. The company continues to monitor government directives and has not incurred significant disruptions to its operations due to these restrictions. Occidental's ability to navigate new regulations, such as siting requirements for oil and gas drilling locations, will depend on establishing a history of obtaining drilling permits and meeting regulatory criteria. The company is committed to delivering a unique shareholder value proposition through its integrated asset portfolio and continual enhancements to its organizational capability. Occidental aims to maximize shareholder returns through efficient capital allocation, prioritizing projects that reduce its carbon footprint, and maintaining a robust liquidity position. The oil and gas segment focuses on long-term value creation and sustainability, leveraging scale, technical expertise, and environmental leadership to bring production quickly to market and extend the life of older fields at lower costs. Occidental's strategic initiatives include operating and developing areas with known reserves, maintaining a disciplined approach to capital expenditures, and focusing on cost-reduction efficiencies and innovative technologies. The company has also emphasized the importance of organizational health and resilience in adapting to external pressures and disruptions, ensuring operational flexibility to respond to changing market conditions. Occidental's commitment to sustainability and environmental responsibility underpins its operational strategies, aiming for net-zero operational emissions and advancing carbon capture and storage projects. The company continues to evaluate its economic environment and may need to raise capital to fund operations and refinance debt maturities in light of ongoing uncertainties.

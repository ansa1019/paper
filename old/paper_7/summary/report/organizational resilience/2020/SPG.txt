The COVID-19 pandemic has already had a significant negative impact on economic and market conditions around the world in 2020, and the pandemic continues to adversely impact economic activity in real estate. The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic continues to evolve, and governments have imposed measures intended to control its spread, including restrictions on freedom of movement and business operations. Although tenants and consumers have been adapting to the COVID-19 pandemic, such adaptations may take time, and there is no guarantee that retail will return to pre-pandemic levels even once the pandemic subsides. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, the company may experience material impacts including changes in the ability to recognize revenue due to changes in the assessment of the probability of collection of lease income and asset impairment charges as a result of changing cash flows generated by properties. The company implemented a series of actions to reduce costs and increase liquidity in light of the economic impacts of the pandemic, including significantly reducing all non-essential corporate spending and property operating expenses, implementing a temporary furlough of certain corporate and field employees, and suspending more than $1.0 billion of redevelopment and new development projects. The company has also focused on the health and safety of employees, shoppers, and communities, indicating a commitment to organizational health and resilience strategies during challenging conditions. The company routinely reviews and evaluates acquisition opportunities based on their ability to enhance the portfolio, which reflects a proactive approach to resource allocation and operational flexibility. The international strategy includes partnering with established real estate companies and financing international investments with local currency to minimize foreign exchange risk, demonstrating a systemic perspective on risk management and resource deployment. The company seeks growth in earnings and cash flows by enhancing the profitability and operation of properties and investments, which indicates a focus on performance maintenance and adaptability in response to external pressures. The company’s financing strategy relies primarily on long-term fixed-rate debt, and it has historically had access to public equity markets, which supports its organizational resilience in managing financial resources. The company has also engaged in joint ventures to acquire assets out of bankruptcy, reflecting an ability to confront and benefit from sudden disruptive change. The ongoing evaluation of suspended projects and the continuation of certain redevelopment and new development projects indicate a commitment to organizational transformation and recovery mechanisms in response to exceptional conditions. The company’s focus on generating consumer traffic through marketing initiatives and strategic corporate alliances further illustrates its resilience strategies in adapting to the evolving business environment.

We begin management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations with an overview of our businesses and significant trends. The impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on Oracle's business highlight the importance of organizational resilience in adapting to unexpected situations and external pressures. Our cloud and license business, which represented 83% of our total revenues, has shown resilience through the continued renewal of cloud services and license support customer contracts, enabling us to maintain operational flexibility and respond effectively to environmental disruptions. The historical upward trend of our cloud and license business' revenues is primarily due to the addition of new cloud services and license support contracts, which we recognize as revenues ratably, demonstrating our capacity for resource allocation and recovery in challenging conditions. 

The service innovation in our offerings, including the pivot to cloud-based deployments, reflects our strategic initiatives aimed at enhancing organizational health and competitive advantage. We have introduced programs that allow customers to migrate to and expand with Oracle Cloud, which is essential for maintaining performance under pressure and ensuring business continuity. Our hardware business, while representing a smaller portion of total revenues, has faced challenges due to the emphasis on cloud-based infrastructure technologies, showcasing the need for adaptability in response to market demands and changing customer needs.

Our services business, which assists customers in maximizing their investments in Oracle technologies, has been affected by declines in consulting and education revenues, emphasizing the importance of inter-organizational collaboration and strategic response mechanisms during adverse conditions. The restructuring expenses incurred during fiscal 2020 were part of our efforts to improve operational management and cost structure, which are critical to sustaining organizational resilience.

We continue to invest significantly in research and development to maintain our competitive position and enhance our capabilities in the face of market volatility. The strategic foresight demonstrated in our acquisition program is another key element of our resilience strategy, allowing us to absorb strain and reconfigure resources to adapt to evolving business environments. Our focus on employee-related expenditures and infrastructure investments supports our operational continuity and positions us to confront future challenges effectively.

In summary, our financial condition and results of operations reflect our commitment to organizational resilience through proactive measures, strategic planning, and the ability to foresee and adapt to complex situations. The ongoing evaluation of our critical accounting policies and estimates is essential in maintaining organizational effectiveness and ensuring that we can navigate the uncertainties of the business environment while continuing to support our customers and stakeholders.

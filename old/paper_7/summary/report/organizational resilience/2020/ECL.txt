In 2020, we faced significant effects from the COVID-19 pandemic, which resulted in lower sales and a significant earnings decline for the full year. Despite the range of actions we took to expand our sales and benefit our earnings through new products, programs, investments in the business, and cost efficiency programs, the more substantial impact from the pandemic highlighted the need for operational flexibility and adaptability in our organizational practices. We continued to generate strong cash flow from operations, allowing us to fund our ongoing operations, acquisitions, investments in our business, debt repayments, and return cash to our shareholders through share repurchases and dividend payments. Our strong balance sheet has allowed us continued access to capital at attractive rates, which is crucial for maintaining organizational health under challenging conditions. The restructuring activities associated with our plans to enhance efficiency and effectiveness reflect our commitment to organizational resilience, enabling us to confront and benefit from sudden disruptive changes. The institutional advancement program, aimed at enhancing our institutional sales and service structure, is intended to maximize service effectiveness by leveraging ongoing investments in digital technology. We anticipate total program savings of approximately $50 million by the end of 2024, demonstrating our strategic initiatives to improve operational management and resource allocation. The COVID-19 pandemic prompted us to take proactive measures to protect employee pay and adapt to the evolving market conditions, which included leveraging technology and structural improvements to simplify processes and reduce complexity. Our ability to absorb strain and preserve functioning despite adversity is evidenced by our ongoing efforts to drive revenue growth through new products and programs while implementing cost-saving measures. The pandemic has underscored the importance of crisis management and preparedness in maintaining operational continuity and ensuring organizational survival. We have also taken advantage of the employer payroll tax deferral offered by the CARES Act, reflecting our strategic response to external pressures and resource constraints. Our organizational capabilities have been tested, and we have demonstrated resilience through our ability to reconfigure operations and adapt to unexpected situations. The impact of the pandemic on our business environment necessitates a focus on future planning and strategic foresight to navigate ongoing uncertainties and ensure long-term growth. We remain committed to our strategic resilience, which is essential for thriving in turbulent markets and achieving our major objectives. Our approach to risk management and resource generation will continue to evolve as we confront the complexities of the current economic landscape, ensuring that we maintain a competitive advantage and foster organizational strength.

The COVID-19 pandemic continues to disrupt economic activities globally, resulting in substantial decreases in the demand for many refined petroleum products, particularly gasoline and jet fuel. This lack of demand has led to low crude oil prices and refining margins, prompting crude oil producers to shut in high-cost production and refiners to reduce processing rates. In response to the challenging margin environment, significant steps were taken to enhance liquidity, including issuing $3.75 billion of senior unsecured notes, borrowing a net $500 million under a term loan facility, temporarily suspending the share repurchase program, and reducing capital spending by more than $700 million compared to the original budget. The company reported a loss of $4.0 billion and generated $2.1 billion in cash from operating activities, utilizing available cash and debt financing to fund capital expenditures and investments. The adverse effects of the pandemic may continue to be significant in the near term, and the depth and duration of the economic consequences remain unknown. Continuous monitoring of the asset and investment portfolio for impairments and optimization opportunities is essential in this challenging business environment. The commitment to operating excellence guides the company’s operations, focusing on protecting health and safety, continuous improvement in safety, environmental stewardship, reliability, and cost efficiency.

The global pandemic caused by COVID-19 and related economic conditions impacted the company's results of operations, with significant effects on underwriting margins. Earned premiums in personal insurance were negatively impacted by premium refunds provided to personal automobile customers in response to COVID-19. Claims and claim adjustment expenses in business insurance included lower loss estimates in certain product lines, partially offset by higher loss estimates in others. General and administrative expenses were modestly impacted by increased allowances for expected credit losses on premiums receivable across all segments. The company experienced declines in installment premium charges attributable to billing relief actions offered to customers, and net investment income was affected by volatility in global financial markets. The company has insurance operations in various countries, which exposes it to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. The impact of COVID-19 on the company's financial results is uncertain and could materially affect future performance. The company expects that the combination of dividends to common shareholders and common share repurchases will likely not exceed net income over time. The liquidity requirements of the company's insurance subsidiaries are met primarily by funds generated from premiums, fees, and income received on investments. The company's investment strategy focuses on maintaining a high-quality investment portfolio and a relatively short average effective duration, with a significant majority of funds invested in a diversified portfolio of high-quality, liquid securities. The company actively monitors and evaluates changes in third-party models to manage its exposure to catastrophic events, employing various analyses and methods to make underwriting and reinsurance decisions. The company’s results of operations could be adversely impacted by significant catastrophe losses, which are inherently unpredictable. The company's capital position is strong, and it expects to return capital not needed to support business operations to shareholders. The company has established a holding company liquidity target and believes its assets are sufficient to meet current liquidity requirements. The company has a shelf registration statement filed with the SEC and a revolving credit agreement to support its capital needs. The company's claims and claim adjustment expense reserves are subject to a high degree of judgment and estimation uncertainty, influenced by various internal and external factors. The company continually refines its estimates for claims and claim adjustment expenses based on historical loss experience and emerging trends. The estimation process involves evaluating the impact of changes in claims handling procedures, legal interpretations, and economic conditions. The company’s reserves are impacted by factors such as the frequency and severity of claims, changes in the tort environment, and the overall economic landscape. The company also faces risks related to potential future changes in legislation and regulatory actions that could affect its operations and financial position.

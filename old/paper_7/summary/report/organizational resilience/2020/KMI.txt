As an energy infrastructure owner and operator, we routinely examine various variables and factors to evaluate our current performance and prospects for the future. We generally attempt to mitigate risk of reduced volumes and prices by negotiating contracts with longer terms, with higher per-unit pricing and for a greater percentage of our available capacity. Our operations are impacted by external pressures, including the COVID-19 pandemic, which caused significant disruptions and volatility in energy demand and commodity prices. We have prioritized protecting our employees while continuing to provide essential services, implementing measures to ensure operational continuity during challenging conditions. Our business segments are structured to maintain performance under pressure, with long-term contracts that provide stability against short-term market fluctuations. The profitability of our operations is generally less sensitive to short-term changes in supply and demand due to the nature of our contracts, which often include minimum volume commitments. We continuously assess our risk management strategies and operational flexibility to adapt to environmental disruptions and changing market conditions. Our hedging program aims to mitigate exposure to fluctuations in energy commodity prices, thereby enhancing our resilience against market volatility. The ongoing evaluation of our long-lived assets and goodwill reflects our commitment to maintaining organizational health and performance integrity amid uncertainties. We recognize the importance of strategic initiatives and resource allocation in navigating adverse conditions, ensuring that we can reconstitute our operations and recover effectively from disruptions. Our focus on long-term planning and adaptability positions us to confront unexpected situations and sustain operational effectiveness. The strategic response to the pandemic has included a phased return to workplace processes and investment in safety measures to support our workforce. We continue to monitor the market landscape and adjust our strategies to enhance our resilience and ensure that we can meet customer needs while maintaining organizational success. Our commitment to environmental compliance and legal matters further underscores our proactive approach to risk management, ensuring that we are prepared for potential challenges ahead. The complexities of our operations require a multifaceted understanding of the market dynamics, and we leverage our organizational capabilities to foster collaboration and innovation across our business segments.

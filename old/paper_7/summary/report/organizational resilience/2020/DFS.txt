The COVID-19 pandemic has continued to have a widespread and unprecedented impact on a global scale, creating significant external pressures that affect our operations and financial condition. We have successfully executed our strategy and implemented approximately $400 million of cost reductions by targeting areas such as account acquisition costs and marketing expenses. Our operations continue largely unaffected due to the successful implementation of certain business continuity plans, which have allowed us to maintain operational flexibility despite the shift to work-from-home arrangements. However, this shift has increased our dependence on third-party service providers, which poses additional risks. We remain committed to disciplined expense management and will continue to make investments for profitable long-term growth, including increased marketing and investments in core technology capabilities and efficiency improvements. 

Our capital and liquidity positions were strong entering the pandemic, allowing us to maintain normal operations during extended periods of financial market stress. We have taken prudent actions to preserve capital and augment our capital when the macroeconomic and operating environment turned uncertain. We completed numerous stress tests to assess the impact of a severe economic downturn on our capital and liquidity. The COVID-19 pandemic has adversely impacted our financial results, leading to a decrease in sales volume and credit card loan growth, as well as an increase in our estimate of life of loan expected credit losses. 

In response to the pandemic, we expanded borrower relief offerings, including skip-a-pay programs and other loan modification options, to support customers facing financial difficulties. The accounts using these modifications were evaluated for potential exclusion from troubled debt restructuring status. The impact of these programs has been favorable on reported credit performance, as accounts enrolled did not advance through delinquency cycles as they would have without the programs. 

We have re-opened some of our physical locations with appropriate health safety measures, but employees have the option to continue working from home. Our liquidity portfolio has increased materially since the onset of the pandemic, curtailing our need for wholesale funding. We maintain a liquidity risk and funding management policy to ensure adequate liquidity to sustain business operations and meet obligations under stressed and normal operating conditions. 

Our primary funding sources include direct-to-consumer and brokered deposits, public term asset-backed securitizations, and other short- and long-term borrowings. We have access to a liquidity portfolio comprised of highly liquid, unencumbered assets, including cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, and investment securities. We seek to balance the trade-offs between maintaining too much liquidity, which may be costly, and having too little liquidity, which could cause financial distress. 

The ongoing economic uncertainty associated with the pandemic requires us to maintain prudent liquid asset and capital buffers. We continue to work with our customers to address their unique financial situations while balancing safety and soundness requirements. Our commitment to maintaining operational continuity and flexibility in response to external disturbances reflects our focus on organizational resilience.

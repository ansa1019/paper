During the year ended December 31, 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic significantly impacted the global economy and strained the hospitality industry due to travel restrictions and stay-at-home directives, resulting in cancellations and significantly reduced travel around the world. The reduction in travel led to the complete and partial suspensions of hotel operations in many areas, which included approximately 20 percent of global hotel properties for some portion of the reporting period. The pandemic had a material adverse impact on results, and the company expects this impact to continue for an indeterminate duration. In response to this global crisis, actions were taken to prioritize the safety and security of guests, employees, and owners, including the launch of Hilton CleanStay to deliver a new standard of cleanliness and disinfection to properties worldwide. Additionally, alternative uses for certain hotel properties were found, including partnerships to donate free room nights to frontline medical professionals. The company implemented several steps to help withstand this uncertain time, including securing liquidity through various measures such as drawing down on credit facilities, suspending dividend payments, and reducing payroll and related costs through workforce reductions and temporary salary reductions. The strategic objectives include the continued expansion of the global footprint and fee-based business while evaluating the economic viability of new properties based on geographic location and credit quality of third-party owners. The company has good relationships with third-party owners and franchisees, which are critical for generating new incremental opportunities for property development that support growth. Despite the challenges posed by the pandemic, the company opened over 410 hotels, contributing to net unit growth, and had nearly 2,570 hotels in the development pipeline, reflecting a commitment to future planning and resilience strategies. The hospitality industry is inherently seasonal, and the pandemic has exacerbated the volatility in consumer demand and economic conditions. The company continues to monitor the potential impact of external pressures, including economic downturns and changes in consumer behavior, on revenues and profitability. The ability to adapt to these challenges is vital for maintaining operational flexibility and ensuring organizational effectiveness. The company recognizes the importance of strategic management and resilience engineering to navigate through adverse conditions, emphasizing the need for proactive measures and resource management to sustain operations and support recovery efforts. The ongoing evaluation of risks and the implementation of strategic initiatives are essential for fostering organizational resilience and ensuring long-term success in a turbulent market environment.

The COVID-19 pandemic has had and may continue to have material and adverse effects on our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows in the future. The extent to which the pandemic impacts our operations will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted with confidence, including the scope, severity, and duration of the pandemic. We have incurred increased operational costs due to public health measures and regulations affecting our properties, as well as additional health and safety measures adopted related to the pandemic. We expect total seniors housing operating expenses to remain elevated during the pandemic and potentially beyond as these additional health and safety measures become standard practice. Our asset management process includes the review of monthly financial statements and other operating data for each property, obligor/partner creditworthiness, property inspections, and covenant compliance. We aim to intervene at an early stage to address any negative trends, supporting both the collectability of revenue and the value of our investment. In response to the pandemic, we undertook certain opportunistic disposals to enhance near-term liquidity. We have a significant development portfolio, and while we have only experienced minor construction delays, we may face more significant delays in the future. Our primary objectives are to protect stockholder capital and enhance stockholder value, which involves diversifying our investment portfolio by property type, relationship, and geographic location. We continuously evaluate opportunities to finance future investments and believe our liquidity is sufficient to fund our uses of cash. Our investments generate cash from net operating income and principal payments on loans receivable. The collection of rent due during the pandemic has generally been consistent with historical collection rates, and we have executed short-term rent deferrals with certain tenants. However, the prolonged impact of the pandemic may cause operators or tenants to seek further modifications of lease agreements, potentially leading to reductions in revenue and increases in uncollectible receivables. We monitor our investments through various methods determined by the type of property and evaluate the operating environment in each property's market to determine the likely trend in operating performance. When unacceptable trends are identified, we seek to mitigate, eliminate, or transfer the risk. We also aim to structure our relevant investments to mitigate payment risk, with operating leases typically structured as master leases and loans generally cross-defaulted and cross-collateralized with other real estate loans. The ability to respond effectively to environmental disruptions and transform itself to emerge stronger from challenging situations is critical to our organizational resilience. Our strategic initiatives are designed to maintain operational flexibility and adaptability in the face of external pressures and uncertainties, ensuring our organizational health and competitive advantage in turbulent markets.

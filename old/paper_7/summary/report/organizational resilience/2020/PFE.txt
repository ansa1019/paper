In response to the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic, we have implemented measures aimed at mitigating issues where possible, including using digital technology to assist in operations for our commercial, manufacturing, research and development, and enabling functions globally. Our business and operations have been impacted by the pandemic in various ways, such as adapting our promotional platform by amplifying our existing digital capabilities to reach healthcare professionals and customers, providing critical education and information. We have not seen significant disruption to our supply chain to date, and all of our manufacturing sites globally have continued to operate at or near normal levels. We believe we have, and expect to maintain, the ability to meet liquidity needs for the foreseeable future, which includes maintaining operational continuity while monitoring for new developments related to the pandemic. Our response to COVID-19 includes collaboration with industry partners and academic institutions to develop potential approaches to prevent and treat the virus, demonstrating our commitment to confronting public health challenges. We have undertaken efforts to ensure our cost base aligns appropriately with our revenue base, restructuring our corporate enabling functions to support our focused innovative biopharmaceutical products business. We view our business development activity as an enabler of our strategies and seek to generate growth by pursuing opportunities that strengthen our capabilities. The COVID-19 pandemic has necessitated a reevaluation of our operational flexibility and adaptability, as we continue to monitor epidemiological data and adjust our engagement strategies with healthcare professionals. Our R&D efforts seek to add value to existing products by improving their effectiveness and ease of dosing, which is critical to our success. We are committed to strategically capitalizing on growth opportunities by advancing our product pipeline and maximizing the value of our existing products. The impact of COVID-19 on our revenues included an estimated unfavorable impact of approximately $700 million, primarily reflecting lower demand for certain products and disruptions to wellness visits for patients. Despite these challenges, we have adapted our operations and maintained a focus on innovation and recovery strategies to navigate the complexities of the current environment. Our organizational practices emphasize resilience strategies that allow us to confront and benefit from sudden disruptive changes, ensuring our ability to survive, grow, and flourish in a turbulent market. We continuously assess our business, assets, and scientific capabilities as part of our regular portfolio review process, which is essential for maintaining organizational health and effectiveness. The ongoing pandemic has reinforced the importance of strategic resilience and operational management in achieving our major objectives and sustaining firm performance under pressure.

The following discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations of Nasdaq should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes. In response to the uncertainties posed by COVID-19 and related economic impacts, we took actions to strengthen our liquidity and cash position and to reduce our refinancing risk. To mitigate funding uncertainties and as a precautionary measure to maximize our liquidity and increase our available cash on hand, Nasdaq borrowed $799 million under the revolving credit commitment of the 2017 credit facility. We observed that conditions in the market for tier 2 commercial paper issuers were deteriorating, impacting both costs and actionable duration of commercial paper issues. Our senior management closely evaluates key drivers and metrics for our business segments, which include market services, corporate platforms, investment intelligence, and market technology. The increase in equity derivative trading and clearing revenues was primarily due to higher U.S. industry trading volumes and a higher U.S. gross capture rate. The increase in cash equity trading revenues was due to higher U.S. industry trading volumes and higher European value traded. The increase in demand for our connectivity services contributed to the rise in trade management services revenues. In evaluating the performance of our business, we assess performance and manage these businesses as four separate segments, which allows for a systemic perspective on resource allocation and operational flexibility. We have pursued various strategic initiatives and completed acquisitions and divestitures in recent years, resulting in expenses that would not have otherwise been incurred. Our ability to absorb strain and preserve functioning despite the presence of adversity is reflected in our operational continuity and strategic response to external pressures. We continue to monitor and manage our liquidity and capital resources closely, ensuring that our operations can withstand environmental perturbations. The increase in headcount was driven by strategic initiatives, mainly growth in our market technology business, which reflects our adaptability and resource generation capabilities. We are committed to maintaining a positive adjustment under challenging conditions, as evidenced by our proactive measures in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Our financial performance metrics, including annualized recurring revenue, are key indicators of our organizational health and trajectory. The ability to foresee, confront, and benefit from sudden disruptive change is essential for our organizational resilience and success in turbulent markets. We have implemented policies and procedures to measure, manage, monitor, and report risk exposures, which are reviewed regularly by management and the board of directors. Our strategic planning and future orientation are critical in navigating complex situations and ensuring organizational survival. The measures we take to enhance our operational management and strategic adaptation are integral to our resilience strategies, enabling us to thrive in a competitive landscape.

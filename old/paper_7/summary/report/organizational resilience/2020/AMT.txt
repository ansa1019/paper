During the fourth quarter of 2020, we updated our reportable segments to better align with our geographical areas of business operations following the Insite acquisition, which reflects our strategic initiative to enhance operational flexibility and adaptability in response to market demands. We continue to report our results in six segments, which allows us to maintain a systemic perspective on our performance across diverse regions. The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has introduced external pressures that may adversely impact our business and that of our tenants, necessitating proactive measures to ensure the continued availability of our communications sites while safeguarding the health of our employees and stakeholders. We have implemented various actions, including remote support for tenants and modifications to our business practices, to navigate these challenges effectively. Our tenant leases, which generally have initial non-cancellable terms of five to ten years, provide a foundation for business continuity and revenue stability, with the majority of our revenue being recurring. The anticipated churn rate in our U.S. & Canada property segment is expected to be elevated due to contractual lease cancellations, which emphasizes the importance of strategic response mechanisms to mitigate risks associated with tenant consolidation. We believe that our diversified communications site portfolio positions us to absorb strain and preserve operational integrity despite the presence of adversity. Our ability to generate cash flow from operating activities is closely linked to maintaining recurring revenue and optimizing operational efficiencies, which are critical for sustaining organizational health and performance under pressure. The impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations has been noted, with potential implications for our financial results, underscoring the need for effective risk assessment and management strategies. We have also identified opportunities for growth through the acquisition and construction of new sites, which enhances our resource generation capabilities and supports our long-term objectives. Our focus on inter-organizational collaboration and building relationships with multinational carriers is expected to yield incremental revenue opportunities, particularly as we expand into emerging markets. The strategic planning involved in our acquisitions and capital expenditures reflects our commitment to organizational resilience, enabling us to adapt to complex situations and evolving market conditions. The integration of new technologies and the anticipated deployment of advanced mobile networks are expected to drive demand for our services, further reinforcing our competitive advantage. We are committed to continuously evaluating our operational practices and resource allocation to ensure that we remain agile and responsive to both current and future challenges, thereby fostering an environment conducive to organizational success and sustainability.

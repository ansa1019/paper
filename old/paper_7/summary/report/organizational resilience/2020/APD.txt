In response to COVID-19, we implemented certain health and safety policies to help keep our employees, contractors, customers, and communities safe while continuing to run our facilities, which have been considered "essential" by local governments and public health authorities. Our number one priority was the safety and well-being of our people, and we focused on maintaining plant operations and ensuring business continuity. We estimate that COVID-19 negatively impacted our overall sales by approximately 4%, primarily driven by lower volumes in our merchant business across regional industrial gas segments. Despite the significant health crisis, we continued to win significant new growth projects around the world and serve our customers, delivering stable results. Our onsite business model, which represents approximately half of our business, is expected to continue generating stable cash flow, allowing us to execute our strategic focus on our industrial gas business and the creation of long-term shareholder value. We remain committed to safely maintaining operations and ensuring business continuity, including providing financial security for employees and reliably supplying critical products and services to our customers. We are negotiating with customers regarding contract terms that could impact sales in our industrial gases - Asia segment, demonstrating our adaptability to unexpected situations. The dynamic nature of these circumstances makes it challenging to estimate the future impact on our ongoing business and overall financial performance. We will continue to focus on pricing discipline in our merchant business and expect our onsite business model to generate stable cash flow. Our operations are organized into five reportable business segments, and we have remained focused on sustainability and our commitment to advancing diversity and inclusion, setting new goals aligned with our business strategy. We have successfully executed a debt offering during the third quarter, supporting significant opportunities to invest in high-return industrial gas projects and the repayment of upcoming debt maturities. The impacts of COVID-19 on our liquidity and capital resources have been considered, and we do not expect it to affect our ability to meet future liquidity needs. We anticipate capital expenditures to be funded principally with our current cash balance and cash generated from continuing operations. Our strategic focus includes evaluating acquisitions of small- and medium-sized industrial gas companies or assets, purchases of existing industrial gas facilities from customers, and investments in large industrial gas projects driven by demand for cleaner energy and emerging market growth. We will continue to monitor our projects to determine whether capital spending and project onstream timing may be delayed due to the uncertainty regarding the duration of COVID-19 and its negative impact on the global economy. The ongoing focus on operational flexibility and strategic initiatives is essential for maintaining our organizational resilience in the face of external pressures and disruptions.

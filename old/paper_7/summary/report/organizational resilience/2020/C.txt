During 2020, Citi demonstrated solid performance and operational resilience despite significant deterioration in public health and economic conditions due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Citi's revenues were largely unchanged from the prior year, reflecting strong performance in fixed income markets, equity markets, investment banking, and the private bank, which offset the impact of lower interest rates and reduced customer activity in global consumer banking. The company continued to support its colleagues, customers, clients, and communities while maintaining a strong balance sheet, indicating a commitment to organizational health and adaptability under challenging conditions. Citi's response to the pandemic involved proactive measures to ensure the safety and well-being of employees while maintaining high levels of client servicing. The majority of Citi colleagues worked remotely, and the company implemented new protocols to create safe work environments. Citi's organizational response was governed by its executive management team and regional task forces, focusing on continuity of business plans and responses to customer needs. The company engaged closely with stakeholders to assure alignment on pandemic-related matters, demonstrating inter-organizational collaboration and strategic initiatives aimed at maintaining operational continuity. Despite the pandemic's adverse impacts, Citi maintained strong capital and liquidity positions, with a common equity tier 1 capital ratio of 11.7% and a supplementary leverage ratio of 7.0%, reflecting its ability to absorb strain and preserve functioning. The allowance for credit losses increased significantly, driven by a deterioration in Citi's macroeconomic outlook and the need for a higher level of stress assessment. Citi's management of COVID-19 pandemic risks included protocols for prioritizing critical processing and ensuring staff could support these processes from remote locations. The company modified the contractual terms of corporate loans for borrowers impacted by the pandemic, reflecting its commitment to resource allocation and customer needs. Citi's transformation efforts are aimed at strengthening risk management and controls, indicating a focus on resilience strategies and mechanisms for recovery. The company also engaged in philanthropic efforts, committing over $100 million to support COVID-19-related community relief and economic recovery efforts globally. In addition, Citi provided a wide array of consumer relief programs, including payment deferrals and fee waivers, to assist approximately three million U.S. consumers and small businesses affected by the pandemic. These actions illustrate Citi's organizational capabilities and operational flexibility in confronting adversity. The overall economic outlook for 2021 reflects continued challenges and uncertainties related to the pandemic, which will likely impact Citi's businesses and results. However, Citi believes that its existing portfolios are adequately reserved under the current expected credit loss standard, demonstrating a proactive approach to risk management and organizational foresight.

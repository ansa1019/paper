This report contains statements concerning the companies' expectations, plans, objectives, future financial performance, and other statements that are not historical facts. The companies make forward-looking statements with full knowledge that risks and uncertainties exist that may cause actual results to differ materially from predicted results. Factors that may cause actual results to differ are often presented with the forward-looking statements themselves. These factors include unusual weather conditions and their effect on energy sales to customers and energy commodity prices; extreme weather events and other natural disasters, including hurricanes, high winds, severe storms, earthquakes, flooding, climate changes, and changes in water temperatures and availability that can cause outages and property damage to facilities; and the impact of extraordinary external events, such as the current pandemic health event resulting from COVID-19, and their collateral consequences, including extended disruption of economic activity in our markets. The inability to complete planned construction, conversion, or growth projects at all, or with the outcomes or within the terms and time frames initially anticipated, including as a result of increased public involvement, intervention, or litigation in such projects, poses significant challenges to operational continuity. The companies' operations are subject to risks and uncertainties that may negatively impact the timing or amounts of operating cash flows. The strategic target asset allocation for Dominion Energy's pension funds is designed to achieve attractive levels of returns while managing risks associated with environmental and regulatory compliance, which are critical for maintaining organizational resilience. The expected long-term rates of return on plan assets and discount rates applied to benefit obligations are critical assumptions that influence financial performance and organizational health. Dominion Energy's planned capital expenditures are expected to include construction and expansion of electric generation, including renewable energy, and natural gas distribution, which are essential for adapting to changing market conditions and customer needs. The company expects to fund its capital expenditures with cash from operations and a combination of securities issuances and short-term borrowings, reflecting a proactive approach to resource management and operational flexibility. Future environmental regulations related to climate change may necessitate the installation of additional control technology at certain facilities, which could have a material impact on financial condition and cash flows. The company continues to monitor the global outbreak of COVID-19 and developments affecting its workforce, suppliers, and other aspects of its business, indicating a commitment to crisis management and preparedness. The strategic initiatives undertaken by Dominion Energy, including the construction of new facilities and the adaptation of existing operations, reflect a multifaceted approach to resilience in the face of external pressures and disruptive events.

The company is closely monitoring the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on all aspects of its business, which has resulted in disruptions in certain sectors beginning late in the first quarter of 2020 due to market volatility. Moody's believes that it has adequate liquidity to maintain its operations with minimal disruption and to comply with its debt covenants. In 2020, the company added $700 million in additional long-term borrowings to maximize liquidity during this period of uncertainty and reduced discretionary spending, including temporarily suspending its share repurchase program. The company continues to evaluate its estimates related to revenue recognition and accounts receivable allowances, which are particularly dependent on management's judgment about uncertain matters. Moody's has engaged in restructuring actions, which require management to utilize significant estimates related to expenses for severance and other employee benefit costs, contract termination costs, and asset impairments. The company has also performed interim goodwill impairment assessments, reflecting the impact of the COVID-19 crisis on its financial projections. The company is committed to disciplined cost management through this period of uncertainty and believes that the most significant risks to its financial results relate to uncertainties surrounding the pandemic. The company has observed significant market disruption and a widening of credit spreads, which could materially impact its near-term operating results. Additionally, reductions in discretionary spending by customers and social distancing measures could result in fewer new sales opportunities and an extension of sales cycles. The company’s operational flexibility and strategic initiatives are designed to enhance technology infrastructure to enable automation, innovation, and efficiency, supporting business growth. The company evaluates its reporting units on an annual basis or more frequently if there are changes in the reporting structure due to acquisitions or realignments. The assessment of goodwill impairment involves significant estimates and assumptions, including projections of future operating results and cash flows, which are based on internal budgets and strategic plans. The company’s ability to absorb strain and preserve functioning despite adversity is reflected in its strategic response to the COVID-19 crisis, including the management of operational resources and financial resources to navigate through unexpected situations. The company’s organizational practices are designed to maintain performance under pressure and ensure operational continuity, demonstrating resilience in the face of external disturbances. The company’s approach to aggregating and deepening available data and analytic tools fosters a more integrated and efficient delivery to customers, resulting in better decisions around risks and opportunities. The company’s commitment to maintaining a strong cash flow and liquidity positions it to confront challenges and support its strategic priorities, including investments in employees and targeted acquisitions.

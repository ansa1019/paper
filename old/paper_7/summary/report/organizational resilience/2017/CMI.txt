We are a global power leader that designs, manufactures, distributes, and services diesel and natural gas engines and engine-related component products. Our financial performance depends, in large part, on varying conditions in the markets we serve, particularly the on-highway, construction, and general industrial markets. Economic downturns in markets we serve generally result in reduced sales of our products and can result in price reductions in certain products and/or markets. Our geographic diversity and broad product and service offerings have helped limit the impact from a drop in demand in any one industry or customer or the economy of any single country on our consolidated results. As part of our growth strategy, we invest in businesses in certain countries that carry high levels of risks such as China, Brazil, India, Mexico, Russia, and countries in the Middle East and Africa. Our operations are also affected by currency, political, economic, and regulatory matters, including the adoption and enforcement of environmental and emission standards. We expect demand to improve or remain strong in many of our most important markets, while challenges such as market demand in truck markets in China are expected to decline. We generated $2.3 billion of operating cash flows in 2017, compared to $1.9 billion in 2016, reflecting our ability to maintain operational continuity and adapt to changing market conditions. Our financial condition and liquidity remain strong, and we assess our liquidity in terms of our ability to generate adequate cash to fund our operating, investing, and financing activities. We believe our operating cash flow and liquidity provide us with the financial flexibility needed to fund working capital, common stock repurchases, acquisitions, capital expenditures, dividend payments, projected pension obligations, and debt service obligations. We have long-standing relationships with many of the leading manufacturers in the markets we serve, which contributes to our organizational resilience by fostering inter-organizational collaboration and enhancing our competitive advantage. Our investments in research, development, and engineering are focused on developing new products to meet future emission standards and improve fuel economy performance, reflecting our commitment to innovation and adaptability in response to external pressures. The formation of joint ventures and strategic partnerships, such as with Eaton Corporation, further exemplifies our proactive measures to enhance our operational capabilities and market presence. Our segment ebit increased due to improved gross margin, lower loss contingency charges, and increased equity, royalty, and interest income from investees, indicating our ability to reconfigure resources effectively in response to market demands. The increase in gross margin was primarily due to higher volumes, improved leverage, and lower material costs, partially offset by increased warranty costs and variable compensation expenses. We continue to focus on strategic initiatives that enhance our organizational effectiveness and resilience, ensuring we can confront and adapt to future challenges while maintaining positive adjustment under challenging conditions.

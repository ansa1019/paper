The management emphasizes the importance of maintaining operational flexibility and adapting to changes in the business environment, which is crucial for sustaining competitive advantage. The organization’s commitment to investing in information technology systems and improving existing stores demonstrates a proactive approach to enhancing operational capabilities and resilience.

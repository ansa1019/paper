Our management's discussion and analysis indicates that we manage our operations through two geographic operating segments to capitalize on local and regional trends and customer needs, which reflects our adaptability to external pressures. We believe our investments in one of the industry's largest sales organizations and our extensive network of technical and veterinary operations specialists enhance our operational flexibility and resilience. Our research and development efforts enable us to deliver innovative products to address unmet needs, emphasizing our commitment to service innovation and the maintenance of positive adjustment under challenging conditions. The animal health industry is influenced by various factors, including human population growth, increasing demand for improved nutrition, and natural resource constraints, which necessitate a strategic response to ensure business continuity and organizational health. Our operational efficiency program focuses on reducing complexity and optimizing resource allocation, which is essential for enhancing long-term value and resilience against economic downturns. We have divested or exited several manufacturing sites and are continuing to optimize our resource allocation and efficiency, which reflects our proactive measures in response to operational challenges. The unpredictability of product regulatory or commercial success increases the potential for capacity imbalances, highlighting the need for effective risk management and adaptability in our operational strategies. Our growth strategies include leveraging our direct local presence and strong customer relationships, which enhance our ability to respond effectively to environmental disruptions. We also aim to expand into complementary businesses, which could enhance our organizational capabilities and resilience. The operational environment is characterized by competition and external disturbances, necessitating a focus on strategic initiatives that bolster our organizational strength and performance under pressure. We continuously monitor our liquidity position and assess the impact of global economic conditions on our operational management, ensuring that we are prepared for potential adverse scenarios. Our financial resources and operational continuity are critical in navigating the complexities of the animal health market, where we must confront various challenges, including disease outbreaks and adverse weather conditions. The comprehensive operational efficiency program is substantially complete, yet we remain vigilant in our efforts to enhance organizational effectiveness and resilience through strategic adaptation and resource management. Our ability to absorb strain and preserve functioning despite adversity is a testament to our organizational resilience, as we strive to maintain integrity and performance in a rapidly evolving business environment.

The strength of the alignment among the company, its franchisees, and suppliers is key to McDonald's long-term success, enabling the identification, implementation, and scaling of ideas that meet customers' changing needs and preferences. By leveraging the system, McDonald's builds on its competitive advantages of system alignment and geographic diversification to deliver consistent, yet locally-relevant restaurant experiences. The company has made purposeful changes to execute against key elements of its turnaround plan, focusing on running better restaurants, driving operational growth, and enhancing financial value. The velocity growth plan aims to drive sustainable guest count growth, a reliable long-term measure of the company's strength, vital to growing sales and shareholder value. This plan is rooted in extensive customer research and insights, targeting the core of its business—food, value, and customer experience. The strategy includes retaining existing customers, regaining lost customers, and converting casual to committed customers, supported by sustainable platforms that enable execution with greater speed, efficiency, and impact. McDonald's continues to enhance the overall customer experience through three identified growth accelerators: experience of the future, digital, and delivery, which contribute to operational flexibility and adaptability in meeting customer needs. The company’s refranchising efforts have transitioned it to a more heavily franchised business model, benefiting performance by providing a more predictable and stable revenue stream with significantly lower operating costs and risks. This structure supports the company's resilience by allowing franchisees to be responsible for supporting and reinvesting in their businesses, thereby enhancing operational continuity and reducing resource constraints. The company continually reviews its mix of company-operated and franchised restaurants to optimize overall performance, with a long-term goal of approximately 95% franchised. McDonald's has achieved its best comparable sales performance in six years, demonstrating the effectiveness of its strategies in confronting and adapting to market challenges. The company’s financial performance reflects its ability to absorb strain and preserve functioning despite external pressures, with significant cash flow generation and a commitment to returning value to shareholders. The company’s approach to managing inflationary cost increases through rapid inventory turnover and menu price adjustments illustrates its operational resilience. McDonald's also emphasizes the importance of embedding social and environmental issues into its core business, which aligns with its strategic priorities and enhances its organizational health. The company’s focus on innovation, customer-centric growth, and strategic adaptation positions it to navigate future uncertainties and maintain a trajectory of growth and resilience in a turbulent market environment.

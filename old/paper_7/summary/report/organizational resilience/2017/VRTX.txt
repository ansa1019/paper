We invest in scientific innovation to create transformative medicines for serious diseases, focusing on developing and commercializing therapies for cystic fibrosis and advancing research and development programs in other diseases. Our ongoing research and development programs are conducted independently or in collaboration with third parties, allowing us to balance the risks inherent in drug development and potentially provide drug candidates that will form our pipeline in future years. We believe that pursuing research in diverse areas enhances our organizational resilience by enabling us to adapt to environmental perturbations and respond effectively to external pressures. The discovery and development of new pharmaceutical products is a difficult and lengthy process that requires significant financial resources and extensive technical and regulatory expertise, which we closely monitor to balance risk and potential. Our corporate compliance program is designed to actively identify, prevent, and mitigate risk through the implementation of compliance policies and systems, promoting a culture of compliance that supports organizational health and resilience. We engage in discussions with numerous commercial insurers and managed health care organizations to obtain and maintain appropriate levels of reimbursement for our products, which is critical for sustaining operational continuity and financial resources. Our collaboration arrangements with biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies enhance our research capabilities and pipeline, reflecting our strategic initiatives to foster inter-organizational collaboration and resource generation. We have entered into collaborations with various entities to acquire rights or license drug candidates or technologies, which may provide significant competitive advantages and support our resilience strategies. The successful development of our drug candidates is highly uncertain and subject to numerous risks, including regulatory approval processes that could delay or limit our ability to bring products to market. We continuously evaluate our drug development programs in light of new data and insights, which can result in abrupt changes in focus and priorities, reflecting our organizational flexibility and adaptability. Our financial condition is supported by substantial cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities, which we intend to rely on as our primary source of liquidity. We expect that cash flows from product sales will be sufficient to fund our operations for at least the next twelve months, although the adequacy of our available funds will depend on various factors, including future revenues generated by our products and the potential introduction of new drug candidates to the market. Our strategic planning involves assessing the impact of potential regulatory changes and market dynamics, which is essential for maintaining our organizational resilience in a turbulent business environment. We have a robust framework for risk management that includes monitoring the fair value of contingent payments related to our collaborations, which are critical for our financial performance and operational effectiveness. Our commitment to fostering a learning organization is reflected in our ongoing investment in research and development, which is vital for sustaining our competitive position and enhancing our organizational capabilities in the face of adversity.

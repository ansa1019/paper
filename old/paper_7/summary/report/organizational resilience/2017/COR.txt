We are one of the largest global pharmaceutical sourcing and distribution services companies, helping both healthcare providers and pharmaceutical and biotech manufacturers improve patient access to products and enhance patient care. Our operations are organized based upon the products and services we provide to our customers, which include a comprehensive offering of brand-name, specialty brand-name, and generic pharmaceuticals, as well as over-the-counter healthcare products and related services. Effective September 30, 2017, we reorganized our operating structure, resulting in the combination of legacy segments into a single operating segment, which reflects our adaptability and strategic response to market demands. The pharmaceutical distribution services segment distributes products and provides additional services to a wide variety of healthcare providers, demonstrating our operational flexibility and commitment to maintaining performance under pressure. We have implemented initiatives to improve operating efficiency across many of our businesses, which is indicative of our resilience strategies aimed at enhancing organizational effectiveness. Our revenue growth has been influenced by various factors, including industry trends and the introduction of innovative therapies, showcasing our capacity for service innovation and resource allocation in response to external pressures. The increase in gross profit was primarily due to a reduction in last-in, first-out (LIFO) expense and an increase in gross profit in other segments, reflecting our ability to absorb strain and preserve functioning despite adverse conditions. We recognize the importance of managing risks associated with litigation and operational challenges, which are integral to our crisis management and emergency management practices. Our commitment to organizational health is further demonstrated through our focus on enhancing product quality and patient safety, which aligns with our major objectives of maintaining operational continuity and adapting to regulatory requirements. The strategic initiatives undertaken, including the integration of acquired businesses, illustrate our foresight and capability to reconfigure operations in response to market dynamics. We continue to assess our performance under varying conditions, utilizing metrics such as days sales outstanding and days inventory on hand to evaluate our working capital performance. The increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses indicates our proactive measures to manage cash flow and operational resources effectively. Our liquidity and capital resources are structured to support ongoing cash requirements, including funding for acquisitions and capital expenditures, which are essential for sustaining growth and resilience in a turbulent market environment. We anticipate that our future revenue growth will continue to be affected by various factors, including competition and changes in pharmaceutical manufacturer pricing, which necessitate ongoing strategic adaptation and operational management. The multifaceted nature of our operations and the collaborative networks we maintain with stakeholders are critical to our organizational resilience, enabling us to confront challenges and capitalize on opportunities for growth and success.

Given the multiple-year duration and largely fixed cost nature of content commitments, if membership acquisition and retention do not meet expectations, margins may be adversely impacted. The long-term and fixed cost nature of content commitments may limit flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in the business and market segments. If content is not favorably received by consumers, acquisition and retention may be adversely impacted, and adjustments to content offerings may not be made quickly. The company faces risks such as unforeseen costs and potential liability in connection with content acquired, produced, licensed, and distributed. As a producer and distributor of content, potential liability for negligence or other claims based on the nature of materials may arise. The company is devoting more resources toward the development, production, marketing, and distribution of original programming, which can help differentiate the service and attract and retain members. However, if original programming does not meet expectations, business results may be adversely impacted. The company is expanding operations internationally, managing and adjusting the business to address varied content offerings and differing legal and regulatory environments. The growing complexity of the business, including improving operational practices related to streaming operations and original content, must be managed effectively to avoid adverse impacts on business performance. The company is subject to economic, political, regulatory, and other risks arising from international operations, which require significant resources and management attention. Failure to manage these risks could harm international operations and overall business results. The ability to provide members with content depends on licensing rights from studios and content providers, and if these rights are not obtained on acceptable terms, the ability to stream content may be adversely affected. The company relies on a combination of proprietary and third-party technology to operate the business, and any failure or unavailability of this technology could adversely impact operations. Significant disruptions or unauthorized access to computer systems could result in loss of service or data, which would harm the business and reputation. The company has implemented systems to protect data and thwart hackers, but there is no assurance that these efforts will be successful in the future. The ability to attract and retain members is dependent upon the reliable performance and security of computer systems. The company utilizes third-party cloud computing services, and any disruption in these services could adversely impact member experience. The company is also subject to risks related to payment processing and the ability to collect payments, which could impact revenue and member acquisition. The company must maintain a positive reputation with consumers concerning the service and content offered to attract and retain members. Changes in marketing practices or negative consumer reactions could adversely affect reputation and membership levels. The company faces risks related to competition, including increased costs of programming and the need to secure exclusive rights to differentiate the service. Failure to manage change and growth effectively could adversely affect business performance.

Our goal is to achieve sales growth at the high-end of the medical technology (medtech) industry and maintain our capital allocation strategy that prioritizes acquisitions, dividends, and share repurchases. In 2017, we achieved reported net sales growth of 9.9%. We continued our capital allocation strategy by investing in acquisitions, which reflects our commitment to innovation and adaptation in response to market demands. We took proactive measures in August 2017 by initiating a voluntary product recall involving specific lots of our oral care products in response to regulatory concerns, demonstrating our capacity for crisis management and operational flexibility. We discontinued business with the third-party supplier and resumed shipping oral care products in October, returning to full supply capacity by the end of 2017. This incident illustrates our ability to confront unexpected situations and reconfigure our operations to maintain performance under pressure. Our financial condition continues to be of high quality, as evidenced by our ability to generate substantial cash from operations and to readily access capital markets at competitive rates, which supports our operational continuity and strategic initiatives. We believe that our strong business results and global cash management strategy enhance our organizational resilience, allowing us to effectively navigate external pressures and environmental disruptions. We anticipate being able to support our short-term liquidity and operating needs, including acquisitions and recall-related payments, from a variety of sources, including cash from operations and existing credit lines. The establishment of our European regional headquarters contributed to lower effective income tax rates, which reflects our strategic response to optimize resource allocation. We maintain reserves for excess and obsolete inventory, which requires substantial judgment and estimation, reflecting our organizational capability to manage risks and uncertainties in our operations. Our financial statements include the operations of acquired businesses starting from the completion of the acquisition, indicating our focus on resource generation and strategic adaptation through acquisitions. We are involved in various ongoing legal proceedings, and the outcomes of these matters may impact our financial position, highlighting the importance of effective risk management and stakeholder engagement. We believe that our operational management practices and commitment to innovation will enable us to foresee and adapt to future challenges, ensuring our organizational survival and success in a turbulent market environment.

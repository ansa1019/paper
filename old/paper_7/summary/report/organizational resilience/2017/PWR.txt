We are a leading provider of specialty contracting services, offering infrastructure solutions primarily to the electric power, oil and gas, and communications industries. Our integrated operations and common administrative support require that certain allocations be made to determine segment profitability, including allocations of shared and indirect costs. Our customers include many leading companies in the industries we serve, and we have developed strong strategic alliances with numerous customers, striving to maintain our status as a preferred service provider. We recognize revenues on our unit price and cost-plus contracts as units are completed or services are performed, and for our fixed price contracts, revenues are recognized based on the percentage of total costs incurred to date in proportion to total estimated costs to complete the contract. Our operating results can be subject to seasonal and other variations influenced by weather, customer spending patterns, and project timing, which may affect our operational flexibility and ability to maintain performance under pressure.

We have formed partnerships with select infrastructure investors, providing capital available to invest in infrastructure projects, which enhances our capabilities and supports our strategic initiatives. Our industry is capital intensive, and we expect the need for substantial capital expenditures to continue to meet anticipated demand for our services. We also evaluate opportunities for strategic acquisitions that may require cash and investments in strategic partnerships, which may enhance our operational management and resource generation capabilities. 

Our revenues are influenced by various factors, including the financial condition of our customers, economic conditions, and the timing of project awards. We have experienced increased demand for our services due to the need for infrastructure upgrades and modernization, particularly in response to severe weather events that have necessitated emergency restoration services. Our ability to adapt to these challenges is critical for maintaining operational continuity and ensuring organizational resilience.

The regulatory environment continues to present challenges, impacting project timing and customer spending. We anticipate that utilities will continue to integrate smart grid technologies into their distribution systems, which will require upgrades to existing infrastructure. Our proactive measures to develop our workforce, including training initiatives and strategic partnerships, are essential for addressing labor availability issues and ensuring we can meet customer demands.

We recognize that our operational performance is subject to risks, including fluctuations in commodity prices and regulatory challenges that may impact project execution and margins. Our focus on long-term profitable growth, combined with our ability to respond effectively to environmental disruptions and transform our operations, positions us to capitalize on future opportunities while navigating the complexities of the industries we serve.

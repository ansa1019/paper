ConocoPhillips has taken steps to improve its competitiveness and resilience by establishing clear priorities for cash allocation. The company aims to maintain financial strength, grow distributions, and pursue disciplined growth, which reflects its commitment to resilience strategies in a volatile business environment. The cash allocation priorities include investing capital to maintain production volumes, paying dividends, reducing debt to maintain a strong investment grade rating, and strategically investing to grow cash from operations.

The company has shifted its capital allocation to focus on shorter cycle time, low cost-of-supply projects, which enhances operational flexibility and adaptability to changing market conditions. ConocoPhillips continues to optimize its asset portfolio by focusing on low cost-of-supply assets that align with its strategic direction. The company recognizes that financial strength is essential in a cyclical business, and it has set a target to reduce debt significantly by year-end 2019. The commitment to safety and environmental stewardship remains a high priority, with efforts to protect health and safety while systematically managing risk to drive sustainable business growth. The company is also focused on building a learning organization that utilizes human performance principles to improve operational performance. The management of ConocoPhillips carefully considers the fiscal and regulatory environment when evaluating projects, which is crucial for maintaining resilience in operations. The company acknowledges the impact of external pressures, including fluctuating commodity prices and regulatory changes, on its profitability and operational strategies. The ability to foresee and adapt to changes in the business environment is vital for organizational resilience, and the company continuously evaluates its strategies to ensure alignment with its major objectives. The management's proactive measures in response to environmental disruptions and other challenges demonstrate a commitment to organizational health and sustainability. The companyâ€™s approach to risk management involves assessing potential hazards and developing strategies for crisis response and recovery, which are essential for maintaining operational continuity and organizational effectiveness.

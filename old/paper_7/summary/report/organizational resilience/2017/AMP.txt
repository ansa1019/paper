Ameriprise Financial is a diversified financial services company with a more than 120-year history of providing financial solutions. The business and regulatory environment in which we operate remains subject to elevated uncertainty and change. Financial markets and macroeconomic conditions have had and will continue to have a significant impact on our operating and performance results. To succeed, we expect to continue focusing on our key strategic objectives. The success of these strategies may be affected by various factors, including equity price, credit market, and interest rate fluctuations, which can significantly impact our results of operations. The ongoing low interest rate environment may result in increases to our reserves and changes in various rate assumptions, which may negatively impact our operating earnings. We continually assess our market-related inputs and implement model changes related to our living benefit valuation. Management uses certain non-GAAP measures to evaluate our financial performance, which should not be viewed as a substitute for GAAP measures. Our financial targets include operating total net revenue growth and operating earnings per diluted share growth, which reflect our commitment to maintaining operational flexibility and adapting to changing market conditions. 

The establishment of reserves is an estimation process using a variety of methods, assumptions, and data elements. If actual experience is better than or equal to the results of the estimation process, then reserves should be adequate to provide for future benefits and expenses. We have extensive experience studies and analysis to monitor changes and trends in policyholder behavior, allowing us to quickly detect changes in policyholder behavior. Our ability to analyze differences in experience provides an effective approach to managing risks associated with our products. We believe cash flows from operating activities, available cash balances, and our availability of revolver borrowings will be sufficient to fund our operating liquidity needs. 

We maintain substantial liquidity and have additional liquidity available through an unsecured revolving credit facility. The payment of dividends by many of our subsidiaries is restricted, and certain subsidiaries are subject to regulatory capital requirements. We take into account the overall health of the business, capital levels, and risk management considerations in determining a dividend strategy for payments to our parent holding company from our subsidiaries. The new tax act had an unfavorable impact on combined Riversource Life actual capital, but we expect ongoing benefits from tax reform to be positive as the lower tax rate will provide additional opportunities for further free cash and capital generation. 

Our operational management strategies include maintaining a strong focus on business continuity and resource allocation to ensure resilience under challenging conditions. We continuously evaluate our organizational practices and strategic initiatives to enhance our adaptability and operational effectiveness in response to external pressures and market volatility. The ability to foresee and confront sudden disruptive changes is integral to our organizational resilience, allowing us to sustain performance and achieve our major objectives despite adversity.

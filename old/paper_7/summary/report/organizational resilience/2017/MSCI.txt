The company is an innovative and leading provider of mission-critical investment decision support tools, which help clients manage their investment processes and address their investment, risk, and regulatory challenges. Our clients are increasingly integrating the content developed across our company into their investment processes. We focus on revenue and profit growth, including results accounted for under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, as well as non-GAAP measures, for the company as a whole and by operating segment. Our growth strategy includes creating broad and innovative research-driven content, expanding our client base and deepening existing client relationships, developing flexible and scalable technology, and executing strategic relationships and acquisitions. We utilize a portfolio of key financial metrics to manage the company, including GAAP and non-GAAP measures. Our operating metrics, including run rate, subscription sales, and aggregate retention rate, provide insight into our latest reported portfolio of recurring business. The aggregate retention rate is important because subscription cancellations decrease our run rate and ultimately our operating revenues over time. We regularly evaluate acquisition opportunities and believe our liquidity, along with other financing alternatives, will provide the necessary capital to fund these transactions and achieve our planned growth. We maintain minimum cash balances globally for general operating purposes and seek to align our tax profile with our global operating footprint. Our financial performance is characterized by recurring subscription revenues, asset-based fees, and non-recurring revenues, which reflect our ability to adapt to changing market conditions and client needs. The company has a strong focus on operational flexibility and resource allocation to ensure effective responses to environmental disruptions. Our organizational practices emphasize the importance of risk management and strategic initiatives to maintain performance under pressure. We aim to enhance our organizational resilience by developing mechanisms for recovery and adaptation in the face of adversity. The company’s operational continuity is supported by a diverse client base and a robust business model that licenses annual, recurring subscriptions for a fee. We have a significant focus on research and development to enhance our product offerings and maintain competitive advantage. The results of our operations indicate a commitment to performance maintenance and organizational effectiveness, with a focus on strategic adaptation to external pressures and market volatility. Our financial resources are managed to ensure sustainability and growth in turbulent markets, with an emphasis on future planning and crisis management. The company’s ability to foresee and confront challenges is integral to its organizational identity and success. We continuously assess our operational resources and capabilities to ensure alignment with our major objectives and strategic foresight.

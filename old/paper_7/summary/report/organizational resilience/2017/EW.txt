The medical technology industry is highly competitive and continues to evolve, requiring organizations to adapt and respond effectively to environmental disruptions. Our success is measured both by the development of innovative products and the value we bring to our stakeholders. We are committed to developing new technologies and providing innovative patient care, which reflects our organizational resilience in facing challenges. In 2017, we invested 16.1% of our net sales in research and development, demonstrating our focus on innovation and strategic initiatives to enhance our capabilities. We received FDA approval for several new products, including the hemosphere advanced monitoring platform, which provides clinicians with clarity on a patient's hemodynamics to help them make proactive, timely clinical decisions. The approval of our inspiris resilia aortic valve, the first in a new class of resilient heart valves, exemplifies our commitment to resilience strategies that address customer needs and enhance operational flexibility. The increase in our net income in 2017 was primarily driven by increased sales and a gain from successful litigation related to the theft of trade secrets, indicating our ability to recover and maintain performance under pressure. The impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on net sales highlights the external pressures we navigate while managing our operational resources. Our gross profit margin in 2017 was positively impacted by an improved product mix, driven by transcatheter heart valve therapy products, which reflects our strategic response to market demands and operational management. The increase in selling, general, and administrative expenses was primarily due to higher sales and marketing expenses to support our transcatheter heart valve program, showcasing our resource allocation towards growth initiatives. We recognize the importance of organizational health and the need for effective risk management in maintaining our competitive advantage. Our liquidity and capital resources are sufficient to fund current requirements, reflecting our preparedness for future challenges. We periodically consider various financing alternatives to enhance our operational continuity and resilience in turbulent markets. The acquisition of companies such as Valtech and Harpoon Medical demonstrates our commitment to expanding our capabilities and fostering inter-organizational collaboration, which is essential for thriving in complex situations. Our focus on generating robust clinical, economic, and quality of life evidence is aimed at encouraging the adoption of innovative new medical therapies that demonstrate superior outcomes. The strategic planning and proactive measures we implement are designed to ensure our organizational survival and success in a rapidly changing business environment. The ability to foresee, confront, and benefit from sudden disruptive change is critical for our organizational resilience, enabling us to flourish despite challenges.

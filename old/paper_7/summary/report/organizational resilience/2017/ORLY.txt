In management's discussion and analysis, we provide a historical and prospective narrative of our general financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and certain other factors that may affect our future results, including key drivers of the automotive aftermarket industry and recent developments within our company. We have ongoing initiatives aimed at tailoring our product offering to adjust to customers' changing preferences, which reflects our adaptability to external pressures and market demands. Our ability to respond effectively to environmental disruptions and transform ourselves to emerge stronger from challenging situations is critical for maintaining operational flexibility and ensuring business continuity. We believe that cash expected to be provided by operating activities and availability under our unsecured revolving credit facility will be sufficient to fund both our short-term and long-term capital and liquidity needs for the foreseeable future, which is essential for our organizational health and resilience. The increase in gross profit was primarily a result of sales from new stores and the increase in comparable store sales at existing stores, indicating our capacity for resource generation and operational effectiveness. We remain confident in our ability to gain market share in existing markets and grow in new markets by focusing on our dual market strategy and core values, which contribute to our organizational strength. Our liquidity and capital resources are critical to our strategic initiatives, allowing us to confront challenges and manage risks effectively. The increase in total debt was attributable to the issuance of senior notes and borrowings on our revolving credit facility, reflecting our strategic response to resource needs and market conditions. We have developed sophisticated systems for monitoring the life cycle of our products, which aids in adjusting inventory levels in response to demand fluctuations, demonstrating our knowledge management capabilities. Our focus on enhancing services and programs offered in our stores supports our resilience strategies by improving customer engagement and satisfaction. The increase in average ticket values reflects the increasing complexity and cost of replacement parts necessary to maintain vehicles, which is a response to evolving customer needs and market dynamics. We opened 190 net new stores during the year, which is part of our strategic adaptation to market opportunities and demonstrates our commitment to growth and organizational evolution. Our ongoing assessment of risks, including economic conditions and competitive pressures, informs our decision-making processes and enhances our crisis management capabilities. The ability to foresee and adapt to changes in the business environment is crucial for sustaining performance under pressure and ensuring long-term organizational success. We believe that our proactive measures, including investments in employee training and customer service, strengthen our operational continuity and enhance our resilience in the face of adversity.

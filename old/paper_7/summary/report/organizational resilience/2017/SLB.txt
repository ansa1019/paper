During the past three years of unprecedented market downturn, Schlumberger has proactively sought to strengthen its technology offering and presence in key markets around the world. In line with the challenging business environment, Schlumberger has restructured all relevant parts of the company, in terms of both size and organizational structure, to maximize its market competitiveness and operational agility. Schlumberger has continued to evaluate the present and future return prospects for all of its product lines, as it seeks to maximize its long-term financial performance. Schlumberger's financial performance in 2017 was driven by land activity in North America, where revenue increased over 80% in line with the average rig count increase. The increase in oil price afforded by the OPEC agreement gave producers a means to increase their investment in tight oil. However, apprehension related to growing US supply and uncertainty surrounding the duration of OPEC and Russia-led production cuts held international spending to a level 3% below 2016. The outlook improved for international markets, evidenced by a significant increase in the sanctioning of new projects. The number of final investment decisions tripled in 2017 as compared to 2016, with 75% of the new projects planned for shallow and deepwater offshore environments. Schlumberger has identified the seismic acquisition business as the only product line that does not meet its return expectations going forward, leading to the decision to exit the marine and land seismic acquisition market and operate the WesternGeco product line as an asset-light business. The strong growth in demand is projected to continue in 2018, on the back of a robust global economy. Schlumberger remains committed to delivering market-leading products and services to its customers and superior returns to its shareholders. As the oil market began to rebalance in 2017, replacement of conventional oil reserves remains a challenge. In 2017, discoveries were at an all-time low due to lower exploration activity, and more than 60% of discovered resources were gas. Schlumberger's operational flexibility and strategic initiatives have allowed it to adapt to changing market conditions and customer priorities. The company has maintained a focus on enhancing its operational management capabilities and has engaged in inter-organizational collaboration to improve its resilience strategies. The strategic response to external pressures has involved a comprehensive assessment of resource allocation and deployment to ensure operational continuity and performance maintenance. Schlumberger's approach to crisis management has been characterized by a commitment to innovation and adaptation, enabling the organization to confront and benefit from sudden disruptive changes. The companyâ€™s ability to absorb strain and preserve functioning despite adversity reflects its organizational resilience, which is further supported by its emphasis on learning processes and knowledge management. Schlumberger's financial resources and liquidity position are designed to support its strategic planning and future orientation, ensuring that it can navigate complex situations and maintain organizational effectiveness in a turbulent business environment.

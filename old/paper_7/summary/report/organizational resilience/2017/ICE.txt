Our business environment has been characterized by industry consolidation and increasing competition among global markets for trading, clearing, and listings; the globalization of exchanges, customers, and competitors; market participants' rising demand for speed, data capacity, and connectivity, which requires ongoing investment in technology; evolving and disparate regulation across multiple jurisdictions; and increasing focus on capital and cost efficiencies. We have diversified our business so that we are not dependent on volatility or trading activity in any one asset class. In addition, we have increased our portion of non-transaction and clearing revenues from 21% in 2013 to 58% in 2017. This non-transaction revenue includes data services, listings, and other revenues. We continue to focus on our strategy to grow each of our revenue streams, as well as on our company-wide expense reduction initiatives and our synergies in connection with our acquisitions in order to mitigate these uncertainties and to build on our growth opportunities by leveraging our proprietary data, clearing, and markets. We anticipate that there will continue to be growth in the financial information services sector driven by a number of global trends, including increasing global regulatory demands; greater use of fair value accounting standards and reliance on independent valuations; greater emphasis on risk management; market fragmentation driven by regulatory changes; the move to passive investing and indexation; ongoing growth in the size and diversity of financial markets; increased electronification of fixed income and other less automated markets; the development of new data products; the demand for greater data capacity and connectivity; new entrants; and increasing demand for outsourced services by financial institutions. Our operational flexibility allows us to adapt to changing market conditions and customer needs, enhancing our resilience. We are committed to maintaining our organizational health by fostering a culture of innovation and adaptability, which is essential for navigating disruptive events and ensuring long-term success. Our strategic initiatives are designed to enhance our organizational capabilities and ensure that we can respond effectively to external pressures and environmental perturbations. We recognize the importance of risk assessment and mitigation strategies in maintaining operational continuity and resilience. Our focus on knowledge management and the development of dynamic capabilities allows us to absorb and reconfigure resources in response to unexpected situations. We are also aware of the need for inter-organizational collaboration and stakeholder engagement to strengthen our organizational identity and enhance our crisis management capabilities. The ability to foresee and confront challenges, while maintaining a positive adjustment under challenging conditions, is central to our approach to organizational resilience. We continuously evaluate our performance under pressure and adapt our strategies to ensure that we can thrive in turbulent markets. Our commitment to operational management and strategic adaptation is reflected in our proactive measures and future planning efforts, which are essential for sustaining our competitive advantage and achieving our major objectives.

The un-carrier strategy is about adding value to the customer relationship by changing the rules of the industry and giving customers more, which reflects our ability to adapt and respond to competitive pressures. We believe our un-carrier strategy, along with ongoing network improvements, has been successful in attracting and retaining customers, thereby enhancing organizational health and resilience. During 2017, our operations in Texas, Florida, and Puerto Rico experienced losses related to hurricanes, which impacted our functioning and operational flexibility. We expect additional expenses to be incurred and customer activity to be affected, primarily related to our operations in Puerto Rico. We continue to assess the damage from the hurricanes and work with our insurance carriers to submit claims for property damage and business interruption, demonstrating our crisis management capabilities and resource allocation strategies. The negative impact from the hurricanes for the year ended December 31, 2017, was approximately $201 million, net of insurance recoveries, which highlights the importance of risk assessment and mitigation strategies in maintaining performance under pressure. Our ability to recover from such disruptive events is critical for sustaining operational continuity and ensuring future performance. We have recognized insurance recoveries related to hurricane losses in the amount of approximately $93 million, which serves as an offset to the costs incurred. The increase in total revenues of $40.6 billion was primarily driven by growth in service and equipment revenues, indicating our adaptability and responsiveness to customer needs. The increase in branded postpaid and prepaid revenues reflects our strategic initiatives and resilience strategies, which are essential for navigating environmental disruptions. Our operational management and strategic adaptation to market conditions have allowed us to maintain a competitive advantage, even in the face of external disturbances. The ongoing success of our promotional activities and the continued strength of our MetroPCS brand contribute to our organizational effectiveness and resilience. We have also experienced a decrease in branded postpaid phone churn, which is indicative of increased customer satisfaction and loyalty resulting from our efforts to improve network quality and customer service. The strategic response to market volatility and the implementation of innovative service offerings are vital components of our organizational dynamics. Our commitment to future planning and crisis response is evident in our approach to managing customer relationships and operational resources. The complexities of our business environment require continuous evaluation of our organizational capabilities and the deployment of resources to ensure resilience against unforeseen challenges. The growth in our customer base and the successful execution of our un-carrier initiatives demonstrate our organizational strength and ability to flourish in turbulent markets.

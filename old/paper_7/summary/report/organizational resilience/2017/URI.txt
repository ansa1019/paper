United Rentals is well positioned to take advantage of the fragmented and diverse equipment rental industry due to its extensive resources and competitive advantages. The company has executed a strategy focused on improving profitability through revenue growth, margin expansion, and operational efficiencies, which includes customer segmentation and service differentiation. The implementation of "lean" management techniques, including kaizen processes aimed at continuous improvement, is designed to enhance operational flexibility and efficiency. The company continues to optimize its customer and fleet mix to better serve its target accounts, which is expected to enhance performance.

The company anticipates solid demand for equipment rental services in 2018, indicating a proactive approach to future planning and resource allocation. 

The financial flexibility and liquidity improvements achieved through various capital structure actions position the company to invest in business opportunities and respond effectively to environmental disruptions. The acquisitions of NES and Neff are part of a broader strategy to expand core operations and enhance organizational capabilities, thereby contributing to resilience in the face of market volatility. The company’s focus on enhancing customer service through a single point of contact for key accounts demonstrates an understanding of the importance of organizational coherence and stakeholder engagement in maintaining performance under pressure. 

Operational continuity is supported by a robust customer service network and centralized call centers, which facilitate effective communication and responsiveness to customer needs. The company's commitment to continuous improvement through lean processes is expected to yield significant savings and enhance overall organizational health. The emphasis on strategic acquisitions and the expansion of specialty rental services further illustrates the company’s adaptability and resourcefulness in navigating complex market conditions. 

In summary, United Rentals’ strategic initiatives, including operational efficiencies, customer service enhancements, and targeted acquisitions, reflect a comprehensive approach to maintaining organizational resilience. The company’s ability to absorb strain and preserve functioning amidst external pressures is evidenced by its proactive measures in resource management and operational flexibility, positioning it for sustained growth and success in a competitive landscape.

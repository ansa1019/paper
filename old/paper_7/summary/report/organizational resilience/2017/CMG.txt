During 2017, we invested in improving our digital platforms, including significant improvements to our mobile application and online ordering platform, which reflects our commitment to operational flexibility and adaptation to changing customer needs. Additionally, we equipped select restaurants with an upgraded second make line dedicated to fulfilling out-of-restaurant orders, demonstrating our strategic initiatives aimed at enhancing service innovation and business continuity. Our sales from out-of-restaurant orders represented 8.3% of our revenue during the year, indicating our ability to reconfigure operations in response to external pressures and market demands. We expect to focus our resources on improving our operations and delivering an outstanding experience to every one of our guests, which is essential for maintaining organizational health and resilience. 

We recognize that our success may depend on the continued service and availability of key personnel, and upcoming changes in our management team may not provide the benefits we expect. The data security incident in April 2017, where malware was detected on our payment processing network, highlights the importance of risk management and the need for robust crisis response mechanisms to mitigate potential adverse impacts on our operations. We removed the malware and continue to evaluate ways to enhance our security measures, which is crucial for maintaining operational integrity and customer trust.

The significant factors contributing to our revenue increase in 2017 included new restaurant openings and comparable restaurant sales increases, which reflect our adaptability and resilience in a challenging business environment. We recorded a liability of $30.0 million related to anticipated claims and assessments by payment card networks due to the data security incident, which underscores the need for effective impact assessment and resource management strategies in the face of unexpected situations.

Our liquidity and capital resources are primarily allocated for new restaurant construction and initiatives to improve guest experiences, which are integral to our long-term strategic planning and operational continuity. As of December 31, 2017, we had a cash and short-term investment balance of $509.0 million, which we expect to utilize to support growth and refurbishments, demonstrating our resource generation capabilities. 

We believe that cash from operations, together with our cash and investment balances, will be sufficient to meet ongoing capital expenditures and working capital requirements for the foreseeable future. Our total capital expenditures for 2017 were $216.8 million, with expectations to incur about $300 million in total capital expenditures in 2018, focusing on investments in existing restaurants and new restaurant construction. 

In summary, our operational strategies and investments reflect a multifaceted approach to enhancing organizational resilience, ensuring that we can confront and adapt to environmental disruptions while maintaining performance and achieving our major objectives.

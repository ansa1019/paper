In 2017, we produced solid growth and operating results across all segments, with consolidated revenue increasing 8.2% to $65.872 billion, driven by shipment growth and benefits from network investments. However, operating profits were partially offset by impacts from natural disasters and capacity constraints due to volume surges. We believe that our adjusted financial measures provide meaningful information to assist investors in understanding our financial results and assessing our prospects for future performance. These measures are important indicators of our recurring results of operations, as they exclude items that may not be indicative of our underlying performance. We continually adjust our air and ground networks to better match higher volume levels, and we deploy technology to increase productivity. The increase in operational expenses was primarily due to higher employee compensation and increased costs associated with outside contract carriers, driven by volume growth. The operational flexibility we maintain allows us to adapt to unexpected situations, such as capacity constraints and natural disasters. We recognize that our ability to absorb strain and preserve functioning despite adversity is critical for maintaining organizational resilience. Our strategic initiatives, including the deployment of Saturday operations and the expansion of our air and ground networks, are designed to enhance our operational capabilities and ensure business continuity in the face of external pressures. The financial performance of our segments reflects our commitment to resource allocation and management, which are essential for adapting to changing market conditions and customer needs. The growth in e-commerce has driven demand for our services, and we continue to innovate in response to these market dynamics. We also recognize the importance of collaboration networks and inter-organizational collaboration in enhancing our resilience strategies. Our ability to foresee and confront disruptive changes is supported by our organizational practices and the strategic tools we employ. We maintain a focus on performance maintenance and recovery mechanisms to ensure that we can respond effectively to crises and maintain operational continuity. The adjustments we make in response to environmental perturbations and operational challenges demonstrate our commitment to organizational health and effectiveness. Our ongoing investments in technology and infrastructure are aimed at enhancing our adaptability and ensuring that we can meet future demands while maintaining a competitive advantage in a turbulent market. The strategic foresight we apply in our planning processes enables us to navigate complex situations and sustain our organizational strength over time.

The long-term outlook for our U.S. defense business is influenced by the U.S. military's funding priorities, the diversity of our programs and customers, our insight into customer requirements stemming from our incumbency on core programs, our ability to evolve our products to address a fast-changing threat environment, and our proven track record of successful contract execution. The majority of the aerospace segment's operating costs relate to new aircraft production on firm orders and consist of labor, material, subcontractor, and overhead costs. Operating earnings and margin in the defense segments are driven by changes in volume, performance, or contract mix. Performance refers to changes in profitability based on adjustments to estimates at completion on individual contracts. The combat systems segment's backlog includes work remaining on significant multi-year contracts awarded in prior years, which reflects our ability to respond effectively to environmental disruptions. We expect our investment in the development of new aircraft products and technologies to support the aerospace segment's long-term growth. Our total backlog, including funded and unfunded portions, was $86.9 billion on December 31, 2019, up 28.1% from $67.9 billion at the end of 2018, indicating our capacity to absorb strain and preserve functioning despite external pressures. The segment's book-to-bill ratio was 1.23-to-1 in 2019, demonstrating strong demand across our product and services portfolio. The increase in product revenue in 2019 was driven by higher volume on military vehicle production and ship construction, reflecting our operational flexibility and strategic initiatives to adapt to changing market conditions. We regularly assess the probability of recovery of costs associated with our contracts, which requires making assumptions about future contract activity and the extent of cost recovery. Our focus on cash flow generation provides the flexibility for capital deployment while preserving a strong balance sheet to position us for future opportunities. The marine systems segment's backlog growth of 66.1% from $26.6 billion at year-end 2018 to $44.2 billion at the end of 2019 is primarily due to the award of block V of the Virginia-class submarine program, showcasing our organizational strength in managing complex projects. Our strategic response to environmental disruptions includes ongoing investments to support growth at our shipyards, which are essential for maintaining operational continuity. The information technology segment's total backlog was $9.1 billion at the end of 2019, up 14.7% from $8 billion at year-end 2018, reflecting our ability to adapt and thrive in a competitive landscape. We believe we have adequate funds on hand and sufficient borrowing capacity to execute our financial and operating strategy, which is critical for maintaining organizational resilience. The projected timing of cash flows associated with our obligations is based on management's estimates, which are influenced by historical experience and current market conditions, underscoring our commitment to proactive measures in risk management. Our ability to foresee and confront challenges is demonstrated through our strategic planning and the successful execution of long-term contracts, which are vital for our organizational health and performance maintenance.

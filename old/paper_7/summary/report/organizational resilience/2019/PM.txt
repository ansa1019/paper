We are leading a transformation in the tobacco industry to create a smoke-free future and ultimately replace cigarettes with smoke-free products to the benefit of adults who would otherwise continue to smoke, society, the company, and its shareholders. Through multidisciplinary capabilities in product development, state-of-the-art facilities, and scientific substantiation, we aim to ensure that our smoke-free products meet adult consumer preferences and rigorous regulatory requirements. We are engaged in the development and commercialization of reduced-risk products ("rrps"), which present, are likely to present, or have the potential to present less risk of harm to smokers who switch to these products versus continuing smoking. Our net revenues and operating income are affected by various factors, including the volume of products we sell, the price of our products, changes in currency exchange rates, and the mix of products we sell. The currency-neutral growth in net revenues came despite the unfavorable impact resulting from the deconsolidation of our Canadian subsidiary, which reflects our ability to absorb strain and preserve functioning despite adversity. The optimization of our global manufacturing infrastructure included pre-tax asset impairment and exit costs, which primarily related to the closure of cigarette plants in various countries. The administration of the Canadian restructuring process, which allows a business to carry on its operations with minimal disruption, highlights our organizational resilience in managing external pressures and maintaining operational continuity. We recorded a pre-tax charge related to Canadian tobacco litigation, reflecting our response to unforeseen legal challenges and the need for effective crisis management. The unfavorable currency impact during 2019 resulted from fluctuations of the U.S. dollar, affecting profitability across our primary revenue markets. Our ongoing efforts to optimize our capital structure demonstrate our strategic response to financial pressures and our commitment to maintaining organizational health. The increase in diluted earnings per share from our operations was due primarily to favorable pricing and lower manufacturing costs, indicating our operational flexibility and adaptability in a competitive landscape. The favorable pricing and volume/mix in various segments illustrate our ability to confront market volatility and maintain performance under pressure. Our engagement in strategic initiatives and the development of new products reflect our future orientation and commitment to innovation, which are essential for organizational success in a turbulent business environment. The multifaceted nature of our operations, including inter-organizational collaboration and resource management, underscores our resilience strategies and mechanisms for recovery in the face of challenges. The impact of external disturbances and the need for effective risk management are integral to our organizational practices, as we navigate complex situations and strive for sustainable growth. Our ability to foresee and adapt to environmental disruptions is critical for our survival and flourishing in the market, reinforcing our organizational strength and capabilities.

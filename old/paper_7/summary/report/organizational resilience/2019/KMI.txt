As an energy infrastructure owner and operator in multiple facets of the various U.S. energy industries and markets, we routinely examine a number of variables and factors to evaluate our current performance and our prospects for the future. To mitigate risk of reduced volumes and prices, we negotiate contracts with longer terms and higher per-unit pricing, which helps maintain operational flexibility and resource allocation under varying market conditions. Our long-term contracts are structured to ensure that we receive the majority of our fee for making capacity available, regardless of actual utilization, thereby enhancing our resilience against external pressures and market fluctuations. The profitability of our operations is driven by stable demand for refined petroleum products, which tends to track demographic and economic growth, allowing us to strategically position our assets in stable or growing markets. We utilize a hedging program that employs derivative contracts to mitigate exposure to fluctuations in energy commodity prices, thereby enhancing our financial resilience and operational continuity. Our capital expenditures are budgeted to maintain safe and efficient operations, meet customer needs, and comply with regulatory requirements, which are essential for sustaining organizational health. We also engage in strategic initiatives aimed at enhancing our adaptability and responsiveness to environmental disruptions and operational challenges. Our ability to absorb strain and preserve functioning despite adversity is reflected in our approach to risk management, which includes assessing potential environmental liabilities and legal exposures. We maintain a centralized cash management program that provides financial flexibility and lowers the cost of borrowing, ensuring that we can respond effectively to unexpected situations. The strategic planning process incorporates a focus on future orientation and resilience strategies, enabling us to navigate complex situations and maintain performance under pressure. Our organizational practices emphasize collaboration networks and inter-organizational collaboration, which are critical for resource generation and knowledge absorption. The management of our operational resources is aligned with our major objectives, ensuring that we can reconfigure and adapt our strategies in response to changing market dynamics. We continuously evaluate our performance metrics, including segment earnings before depreciation and amortization, to assess our operational effectiveness and identify areas for improvement. Our commitment to learning organization principles fosters an environment conducive to innovation and organizational transformation, which is vital for sustaining competitive advantage in turbulent markets. The integration of risk assessment and management practices into our operational framework enhances our organizational resilience, enabling us to confront and recover from adverse events while maintaining a focus on long-term growth and sustainability.

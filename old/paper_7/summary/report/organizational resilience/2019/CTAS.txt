Cintas helps more than one million businesses of all types and sizes get ready to open their doors with confidence every day by providing a wide range of products and services that enhance customers' image and help keep their facilities and employees clean, safe, and looking their best. The company's strategy is to achieve revenue growth for all products and services by increasing penetration at existing customers and broadening the customer base to include business segments not historically served. This strategy involves identifying additional product and service opportunities and leveraging a highly talented and diverse team of service professionals who develop close personal relationships with customers. Cintas evaluates operating segment performance based on revenue and income before income taxes, regularly reviewing its operating segments for reporting purposes to allocate resources effectively and assess performance. The company completed the acquisition of G&K Services, Inc., which operates within the uniform rental and facility services segment, and evaluates strategic acquisitions as opportunities arise. Cintas' revenue growth has been positively impacted by new business, the penetration of additional products and services into existing customers, and price increases, partially offset by lost business. The increase in sales productivity is attributed to improved training and increased tenure of sales representatives. Cintas' operational flexibility is demonstrated through its ability to adapt to changing market conditions, as evidenced by the increase in revenue from the uniform rental and facility services segment and the first aid and safety services segment. The company also maintains a focus on cost management, with selling and administrative expenses increasing at a slower pace than revenue growth. Cintas' effective management of resources and strategic initiatives has led to significant increases in income before income taxes and net income from continuing operations. The company’s liquidity and capital resources are bolstered by cash flows provided by operating activities, which have historically supplied a significant source of liquidity to fund operations and expansion activities. Cintas' access to the commercial paper and long-term debt markets has provided sources of liquidity, and the company does not anticipate difficulties in obtaining financing in the future. The company's credit ratings reflect its ability to maintain favorable access to capital markets, which is crucial for sustaining operational continuity and addressing resource needs. Cintas' commitment to exceeding customer expectations and maximizing long-term value for shareholders and working partners underpins its resilience strategies, enabling it to confront and benefit from sudden disruptive changes in the business environment. The company’s proactive measures in crisis management and its focus on organizational health and adaptability contribute to its overall resilience, ensuring that it can maintain performance under pressure and navigate complex situations effectively.

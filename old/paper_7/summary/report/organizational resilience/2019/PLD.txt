During the year ended December 31, 2019, our operating fundamentals remained strong, which has increased rents and kept occupancies high. We consider our ability to generate cash from operating activities, distributions from our co-investment ventures, contributions and dispositions of properties, and available financing sources to be adequate to meet our anticipated future development, acquisition, operating, debt service, dividend, and distribution requirements. We believe reviewing the fundamentals this way allows management to understand the entire impact on the financial statements, as it will affect both the real estate operations and strategic capital segments. Our financial condition and results of operations are evaluated based on the net operating income (NOI) of our two operating segments: real estate operations and strategic capital. The operating fundamentals in the markets in which we operate continue to be strong, which has increased rents and kept occupancies high. We experienced positive rental rate growth, which is a combination of the rollover of existing leases to higher rental rates and contractual rent increases on existing leases. Our financial condition reflects our ability to absorb strain and preserve or improve functioning despite the presence of adversity. We also generated operating cash through our strategic capital segment by providing asset and property management and other services to our unconsolidated co-investment ventures. The revenues associated with the strategic capital segment fluctuate because of changes in the size of the portfolios through acquisitions and dispositions, the fair value of the properties, and other transactional activity including foreign currency exchange rates and timing of promotes. We evaluate our business operations based on the NOI of our two operating segments, which helps management and investors understand our operating results. Our consolidated development portfolio, including properties under development and pre-stabilized properties, was 50.0% leased and expected to be completed before December 2021. We expect to fund our cash needs principally from available unrestricted cash balances, net cash flow from property operations, fees earned for services performed on behalf of the co-investment ventures, and proceeds from the disposition of properties. Our liquidity and capital resources overview indicates that we have sufficient resources to confront financial pressures and maintain operational continuity. We are engaged in various stages of negotiations for the acquisition or disposition of individual properties or portfolios of properties, which reflects our strategic initiatives to adapt to changing market conditions. Our ability to respond effectively to environmental disruptions and transform ourselves to emerge stronger from challenging situations is evident in our strategic capital revenues, which increased due to the growth in our operating portfolio and the successful execution of our business strategy. The increase in NOI from development completions period over period demonstrates our capacity to adapt and thrive in a competitive landscape. Our strategic response to external pressures includes maintaining a strong occupancy rate and focusing on rental rate growth, which are critical to our organizational resilience and overall performance.

We believe our integrated midstream energy asset network links producers of natural gas and NGLs from some of the largest supply basins in the United States to domestic and international markets, enhancing our operational flexibility and resilience under varying market conditions. Our operations consist of three reportable operating segments: refining & marketing, retail, and midstream, each organized and managed based on the nature of the products and services they offer, which allows for adaptability and responsiveness to external pressures. The strategic actions we undertake, including the separation of our retail transportation fuel and convenience store business into an independent, publicly traded company, are aimed at enhancing shareholder value and ensuring operational continuity during periods of change. We have established long-term, fee-based commercial agreements with MPLX, which provide transportation, storage, distribution, and marketing services, thereby supporting our refining & marketing segment and contributing to our resilience strategies. The acquisition of Andeavor has expanded our refining capacity and market presence, allowing us to better absorb strain and maintain performance despite market fluctuations. Our refining & marketing margin, which is influenced by the prices of refined products and the costs of crude oil, reflects our ability to navigate complex market dynamics and maintain operational effectiveness. We continuously evaluate our capital plan and make changes as conditions warrant, demonstrating our commitment to strategic adaptation and resource allocation in response to evolving market demands. The performance of our retail segment, which includes a significant number of convenience stores, is also affected by changes in fuel and merchandise sales, highlighting the importance of understanding customer needs and market trends for sustaining profitability. Our midstream segment's profitability is impacted by tariff rates and volumes shipped, necessitating an ongoing assessment of market conditions and operational capabilities to ensure resilience against external disturbances. We have also implemented various risk management strategies to mitigate potential adverse impacts from environmental regulations and market volatility, reinforcing our organizational health and long-term sustainability. The financial resources available to us, including liquidity from our bank revolving credit facilities, provide a buffer against economic uncertainties and support our strategic initiatives. Our commitment to maintaining an investment-grade credit profile reflects our proactive measures to ensure financial stability and operational resilience in the face of challenges. Overall, our organizational practices, including inter-organizational collaboration and strategic foresight, contribute to our ability to confront and adapt to disruptive changes, thereby enhancing our overall resilience and capacity for future growth.

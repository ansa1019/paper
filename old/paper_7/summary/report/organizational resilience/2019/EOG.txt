EOG operates under a consistent business and operational strategy that focuses predominantly on maximizing the rate of return on investment of capital by controlling operating and capital costs and maximizing reserve recoveries. This strategy is intended to enhance the generation of cash flow and earnings from each unit of production on a cost-effective basis, allowing EOG to deliver long-term production growth while maintaining a strong balance sheet. EOG continues to drill numerous wells in large acreage plays, which have contributed substantially to its crude oil and liquids-rich natural gas production. EOG has placed an emphasis on applying its horizontal drilling and completion expertise to unconventional crude oil and liquids-rich reservoirs, focusing on increasing drilling, completion, and operating efficiencies gained in prior years. The company continues to evaluate potential crude oil and liquids-rich natural gas exploration and development prospects and seeks opportunities to add drilling inventory through leasehold acquisitions, farm-ins, exchanges, or tactical acquisitions. EOG's major producing areas in the United States are in New Mexico, North Dakota, Texas, and Wyoming, and it continues to deliver natural gas under existing supply contracts in Trinidad. EOG's efforts to identify plays with large reserve potential have proven successful, reflecting its ability to adapt and respond to environmental pressures. The company maintains a strong balance sheet with a consistently below-average debt-to-total capitalization ratio, which was 19% at December 31, 2019. EOG's management believes it has one of the strongest prospect inventories in its history and will make acquisitions that bolster existing drilling programs or offer incremental exploration and production opportunities. EOG's capital expenditures are structured to maintain its strategy of capital discipline by funding exploration, development, and exploitation activities primarily from available internally generated cash flows. The anticipated 2020 capital expenditures are estimated to range from approximately $6.3 billion to $6.7 billion, with a focus on U.S. crude oil drilling activities. EOG has significant flexibility with respect to financing alternatives, including borrowings under its commercial paper program and bank borrowings. The company continues to focus on reducing operating costs through efficiency improvements and anticipates increases in both total production and total crude oil production from 2019 levels. EOG's ability to foresee, confront, and benefit from sudden disruptive changes is indicative of its organizational resilience, which is reflected in its strategic initiatives and operational flexibility. The company's financial management strategies, including the use of commodity derivative contracts and maintaining a strong balance sheet, further support its resilience in navigating market volatility and external pressures. EOG's commitment to operational continuity and its proactive measures in risk management demonstrate its capacity to maintain performance under pressure and adapt to complex situations.

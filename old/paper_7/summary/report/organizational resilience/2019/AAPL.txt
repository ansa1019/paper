The company believes that focused investments in research and development are critical to its future growth and competitive position in the marketplace, and to the development of new and updated products and services that are central to the company's core business strategy. The year-over-year growth in research and development expense in 2019 was driven primarily by increases in headcount-related expenses. The company manages its business primarily on a geographic basis, aligning with the location of its customers and distribution partners and the unique market dynamics of each geographic region. The company assumes no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements for any reason, except as required by law, indicating a proactive approach to risk management and adaptability to future uncertainties. The company believes its existing balances of cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities, along with commercial paper and other short-term liquidity arrangements, will be sufficient to satisfy its working capital needs, capital asset purchases, dividends, share repurchases, debt repayments, and other liquidity requirements associated with its existing operations over the next 12 months. The company’s investment policy generally requires securities to be investment grade and limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer, reflecting a strategic response to potential financial risks. The company’s capital expenditures included product tooling and manufacturing process equipment, data centers, corporate facilities and infrastructure, indicating a commitment to operational continuity and resource generation. The company’s share repurchase program does not obligate it to acquire any specific number of shares, allowing for flexibility in resource allocation. The company’s effective tax rate for 2019 was lower than the statutory federal income tax rate due primarily to the lower tax rate on foreign earnings and tax benefits from share-based compensation, illustrating the impact of strategic financial management on organizational health. The company continues to evaluate the amount of the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets, assessing the realizability of these assets as part of its risk assessment and management strategies. The company’s critical accounting policies and estimates are important to the portrayal of its financial condition and operating results, requiring management to make judgments and estimates about inherently uncertain matters. The company invests in manufacturing-related assets, including capital assets held at its suppliers' facilities and prepayments provided to certain of its suppliers associated with long-term agreements to secure the supply of inventory, which reflects an understanding of the complexities involved in supply chain management. The company’s ability to respond effectively to environmental disruptions and transform itself to emerge stronger from challenging situations is indicative of its organizational resilience. The company’s operational flexibility is evident in its approach to managing its reportable segments, which provide similar hardware and software products and services but are managed separately to better align with market dynamics. The company’s strategic initiatives include increasing its quarterly cash dividend and expanding its share repurchase program, demonstrating a commitment to maintaining performance under pressure and ensuring stakeholder engagement.

Our business environment has been characterized by globalization of marketplaces, customers, and competitors; commodity, interest rate, and financial markets uncertainty; and evolving, increasing, and disparate regulation across multiple jurisdictions. We have diversified our business so that we are not dependent on volatility or trading activity in any one asset class. In addition, we have increased our portion of non-transaction and clearing revenues from 34% in 2014 to 51% in 2019. We believe that our current and historic investments in technology and cybersecurity protections position us well competitively to accommodate increased costs of compliance, assurance, or incident response. However, trends in nationalism and data privacy could result in requirements that necessitate increases in staffing or the introduction of local data collection, potentially undermining our synergistic centralized service model. A prolonged and impactful cyber-attack on any of our market participants could drive the industry away from electronification and reduce the market advantages we have realized through automation. We continue to focus on our strategy to grow each of our revenue streams and prudently manage expenses to mitigate uncertainties and build on growth opportunities by leveraging our proprietary data, clearing, and markets. We have invested significant resources in our proprietary ICE global network and cybersecurity protections to minimize the potential impact of a wide-scale cyber interruption, system outages, or global regulatory drive to move critical infrastructure and/or sensitive financial transactions away from the public internet. Our business model emphasizes the importance of transparent markets, centralized clearing, and access to data, which are critical for maintaining operational continuity and resilience in the face of external pressures. We anticipate continued growth in the financial information services sector driven by global trends, including increasing regulatory demands, greater emphasis on risk management, and ongoing growth in the size and diversity of financial markets. Our operational flexibility is enhanced by our ability to adapt to changing market conditions and customer needs, allowing us to maintain performance under pressure. We recognize that the evolution of existing products and new product innovation is essential to serve emerging customer needs and changing industry agreements. Our strategic initiatives focus on enhancing our organizational capabilities and resilience strategies to confront and recover from disruptive events. We believe that our investments in technology, operational management, and strategic adaptation will support our long-term objectives and enable us to navigate complex situations effectively. The integration of our acquisitions and the development of new data products reflect our commitment to organizational transformation and resilience. We are dedicated to fostering a learning organization that emphasizes knowledge management and collaborative networks to enhance our adaptability and responsiveness to market volatility. Our focus on operational management, strategic foresight, and proactive measures will ensure that we remain resilient in the face of future challenges and uncertainties.

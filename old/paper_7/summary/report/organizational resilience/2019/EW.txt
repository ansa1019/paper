The medical technology industry is highly competitive and continues to evolve, requiring organizations to adapt and respond effectively to environmental disruptions. Our success is measured both by the development of innovative products and the value we bring to our stakeholders. We are committed to developing new technologies and providing innovative patient care, which reflects our organizational resilience in maintaining operational continuity and adapting to changing market conditions. In 2019, we invested 17.3% of our net sales in research and development, demonstrating our focus on innovation and resource allocation to enhance our capabilities. We reached an agreement with Boston Scientific to settle all outstanding patent disputes, which reflects our strategic response to external pressures and our commitment to protecting our intellectual property. The acquisition of CAS Medical Systems, Inc. is part of our strategy to expand our capabilities in noninvasive monitoring, enhancing our operational flexibility and resilience in critical care. Our financial performance, including a significant increase in net sales driven by our transcatheter aortic valve replacement products, indicates our ability to absorb strain and improve functioning despite market challenges. The healthcare environment demands robust clinical, economic, and quality of life evidence, which we are dedicated to generating to encourage the adoption of innovative new medical therapies. The increase in gross profit was driven by improved product mix and sales performance, although it was partially offset by strategic decisions regarding our product portfolio, illustrating the complexities of resource management and adaptation strategies. Our commitment to stakeholder engagement and the development of collaborative networks enhances our organizational health and resilience. The increase in selling, general, and administrative expenses reflects our investment in personnel to support our transcatheter structural heart initiatives, which is crucial for maintaining performance under pressure. We continuously assess our operational resources and make strategic adaptations to ensure we meet customer needs and respond to market volatility. Our liquidity and capital resources are sufficient to fund current requirements, demonstrating our preparedness and ability to confront financial challenges. The execution of various contractual obligations and commitments, including contingent consideration arrangements, highlights our proactive measures in managing future uncertainties. We believe that adequate amounts of tax and related penalties have been provided for uncertain tax positions, reflecting our organizational foresight and risk management capabilities. Overall, our trajectory model of organizational resilience focuses on how we project responses toward disruptive events, reconstitute our strategies in immediate response, and reconfigure our operations to emerge stronger from challenges, thereby ensuring our survival and growth in a turbulent market.

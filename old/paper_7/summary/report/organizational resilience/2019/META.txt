In 2019, we continued to focus on our main revenue growth priorities, which include helping marketers use our products to connect with consumers and making our ads more relevant and effective. We intend to continue to invest based on these priorities, and we anticipate that additional investments in our data center capacity, network infrastructure, and office facilities, as well as scaling our headcount to support our growth, will continue to drive expense growth in 2020. We believe that our available funds, credit facility, and cash flow from operations will be sufficient to meet our operational cash needs for the foreseeable future. Our cash flow from operating activities during 2019 primarily consisted of net income adjusted for certain non-cash items, which indicates our capacity to absorb strain and preserve functioning despite challenges. The increase in cash flow from operating activities during 2019 compared to 2018 was primarily due to higher net income prior to the effect of the $5.0 billion FTC legal settlement accrual, an increase in taxes payable, as well as increases in non-cash items. We are involved in legal proceedings and regulatory inquiries that arise in the ordinary course of business, and we evaluate the associated developments on a regular basis to ensure that we can confront and manage these pressures effectively. Our critical accounting policies and estimates reflect our commitment to maintaining operational flexibility and adapting to changing circumstances. We recognize that the outcome of these matters is inherently uncertain, and should any of these estimates and assumptions change or prove to be incorrect, it could have a material impact on our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows. Our investments in research and development, which increased significantly in 2019, are aimed at building new experiences that improve people's lives and support our strategic initiatives. We recognize the importance of operational continuity and the need to adapt to environmental perturbations, which is reflected in our ongoing commitment to enhancing our technical infrastructure and expanding our data center capacity. We anticipate that the cost of revenue will increase as we continue to expand our data center capacity and technical infrastructure to support user growth and increased engagement. Our strategic response to external pressures includes a focus on transparency and communication regarding our services and their role in the world. We believe that our organizational practices and resource allocation strategies will enable us to maintain a competitive advantage and achieve our major objectives. The increase in our employee headcount reflects our commitment to building organizational strength and resilience, as we continue to invest in our workforce to support our growth and innovation initiatives. We are committed to ensuring that our organizational capabilities are aligned with our strategic goals, enabling us to respond effectively to unexpected situations and maintain performance under pressure.

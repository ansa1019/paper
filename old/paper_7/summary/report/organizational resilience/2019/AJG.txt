We believe that one of our major strengths is our ability to deliver comprehensively structured insurance and risk management services to our clients. Our brokers, agents, and administrators act as intermediaries between underwriting enterprises and our clients, and we do not assume net underwriting risks. We expect to use the additional cash flow generated by these earnings to continue our mergers and acquisition strategy in our core brokerage and risk management operations. Our brokerage segment generates revenues by identifying, negotiating, and placing all forms of insurance or reinsurance coverage, as well as providing risk-shifting, risk-sharing, and risk-mitigation consulting services. The primary source of revenues for our brokerage services is commissions from underwriting enterprises, based on a percentage of premiums paid by our clients, or fees received from clients based on an agreed level of service usually in lieu of commissions. We also provide management and administrative services to captives, pools, risk-retention groups, and healthcare exchanges, which reflects our operational flexibility and adaptability to client needs. 

In our risk management segment, we provide contract claim settlement, claim administration, loss control services, and risk management consulting for various organizations that choose to self-insure property/casualty coverages. Revenues for the risk management segment are comprised of fees generally negotiated on a per-claim or per-service basis, which indicates our capability to respond effectively to environmental disruptions. Our history of strong new business generation, solid retentions, and enhanced value-added services for our carrier partners should all result in further organic growth opportunities around the world. 

We have invested in clean energy operations capable of producing refined coal that we believe qualifies for tax credits under IRC section 45. The production and sale of refined coal at these plants are qualified to receive refined coal tax credits, which contributes to our organizational resilience by generating positive cash flow. Our current estimate of the 2020 annual net after-tax earnings, including IRC section 45 tax credits, which will be produced from all of our clean energy investments, is $80.0 million to $100.0 million. We anticipate that these investments will continue to generate positive net cash flows, which is crucial for maintaining operational continuity and supporting our strategic initiatives.

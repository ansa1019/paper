In 2018, we set out to simplify Sempra Energy's business model and sharpen our focus on building North America's premier energy infrastructure company. Our operational and financial results reflect our focus on executing this strategy, which includes significant changes in revenues, costs, and earnings. The California utilities received a constructive final decision regarding revenue requirements and adjustments, which supports business continuity and operational flexibility. We contributed to the wildfire fund established through legislation addressing issues related to catastrophic wildfires in California, demonstrating our proactive measures in risk management and crisis response. The increase in earnings at SDG&E was primarily due to higher authorized operating margins and tax benefits, reflecting effective resource allocation and strategic initiatives. The performance of Sempra Texas Utilities improved significantly, driven by higher equity earnings from Oncor Holdings, indicating our capacity to adapt and respond to external pressures. Sempra Mexico's earnings increased due to the commencement of commercial operations of new pipeline projects, showcasing our ability to innovate and absorb knowledge from operational experiences. The operational management of Sempra Renewables ceased with the sale of its remaining assets, indicating a strategic reconfiguration in response to market conditions. Our commitment to capital expenditures and investments reflects a future-oriented approach to maintaining organizational health and resilience. The performance of our utilities is influenced by regulatory frameworks that permit recovery of costs incurred, which is essential for sustaining operational integrity under varying conditions. The wildfire fund established in California aims to provide liquidity for wildfire-related claims, highlighting the importance of inter-organizational collaboration and resource generation in times of adversity. Our financial resources and operational continuity are supported by access to long-term debt markets, which is crucial for maintaining competitive advantage and ensuring the resilience of our business model. The anticipated sales of our South American businesses are intended to strengthen our balance sheet and focus on capital investment in North America, reflecting our strategic foresight and adaptability in a turbulent market environment. The ongoing performance of SDG&E and SoCalGas will depend on the resolution of regulatory matters and environmental regulations, which are critical for organizational survival and effective resource management. The ability to navigate complex situations and maintain operational flexibility is essential for Sempra Energy's success in achieving its major objectives and sustaining performance under pressure.

We are the leading retailer and distributor of automotive replacement parts and accessories in the Americas, with operations beginning in 1979. As of August 31, 2019, we operated 5,772 stores in the U.S., including Puerto Rico and Saint Thomas; 604 stores in Mexico; and 35 stores in Brazil. Our business is impacted by various factors within the economy that affect both our consumer and our industry, including fuel costs, wage rates, and other economic conditions. Given the unpredictability of gas prices, we cannot predict how future changes will impact our sales. We have experienced accelerated pressure on wages in the U.S., driven by regulatory changes and market pressures. Our sales mix can be impacted by severe or unusual weather over a short-term period, and we believe the improvement in our failure-related sales category was driven by differences in regional weather patterns and improved merchandise assortments. We have seen a close correlation between our net sales and the number of miles driven, which suggests that as the number of miles driven increases, consumers' vehicles are more likely to need service and maintenance. The aging vehicle population is expected to continue increasing, leading to higher demand for our products. Our investments are directed primarily to new locations, supply chain infrastructure, enhancements to existing locations, and technology investments. We plan to continue leveraging our inventory purchases, although our ability to do so may be limited by our vendors' capacity to factor their receivables from us. We have initiated strategic tests focused on increasing inventory availability, which has increased our inventory per location. Our accounts payable to inventory ratio reflects our ability to manage working capital effectively. We anticipate that we will rely primarily on internally generated funds and available borrowing capacity to support our capital expenditures and working capital requirements. Our liquidity is supported by cash flows from operations, which were $2.129 billion in 2019. We have made significant investments in capital assets and new locations, with a focus on maintaining operational flexibility and resilience in the face of external pressures. Our ability to respond effectively to environmental disruptions and transform ourselves to emerge stronger from challenging situations is critical to our organizational resilience. We maintain a strong interest coverage ratio, which reflects our capacity to manage debt obligations and support our operational continuity. Our strategic initiatives are designed to enhance our organizational capabilities and ensure we can adapt to changing market conditions. We believe our historical trends and proactive measures in resource management will support our long-term growth and performance maintenance. Our management continuously evaluates our operational practices and financial strategies to ensure we remain resilient and effective in meeting customer needs while navigating complex situations.

PG&E Corporation and the utility have faced significant challenges, including material losses from the 2017 Northern California wildfires and the 2018 Camp Fire, which have raised substantial doubt about their ability to continue as going concerns. The realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities are subject to uncertainty due to these events. The utility's financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows may be materially affected by the outcome of the Chapter 11 cases, which involve risks and uncertainties that could adversely affect relationships with suppliers and employees, thereby impacting the value of the business. The utility's ability to emerge from Chapter 11 is contingent upon satisfying conditions set forth in AB 1054, which includes satisfying wildfire claims through settlements and maintaining neutral rates for customers. The utility has entered into a debtor-in-possession (DIP) credit agreement, which is expected to be its primary source of capital during the Chapter 11 proceedings, but access to additional financing may be limited. The utility's operational flexibility is further challenged by the uncertainties surrounding future wildfires and the ability to obtain sufficient wildfire insurance coverage. The utility has incurred significant costs related to wildfire mitigation efforts, which are tracked in various memorandum accounts, and the recovery of these costs requires regulatory approval. The utility's 2019 Wildfire Mitigation Plan includes measures to reduce the potential for fires caused by electrical equipment, enhance vegetation management, and improve system hardening, reflecting a proactive approach to risk mitigation. The utility's participation in the wildfire fund established by AB 1054 is contingent upon meeting several eligibility requirements, including the resolution of its Chapter 11 case and the approval of its plan of reorganization by the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC). The utility's governance structure is being strengthened to enhance safety and risk management, including the appointment of an independent safety advisor and the establishment of a safety oversight committee. The utility's strategic initiatives aim to address the complexities of wildfire risks and enhance organizational resilience through improved operational practices and stakeholder engagement. The utility's financial condition and operational strategies are closely monitored, with significant implications for its ability to adapt to environmental perturbations and maintain service continuity. The ongoing regulatory proceedings and the utility's responses to external pressures highlight the multifaceted nature of its resilience strategies, which are essential for navigating the challenges posed by disruptive events and ensuring long-term organizational success.

Management believes that this provides useful information to investors. We continue to take actions to right size our business for the current market conditions and our long-term outlook, including restructuring our operations to dispose of non-core businesses, resizing our remaining businesses to better align with market demand and driving these businesses with an operational rigor and discipline that is focused on our customers' lifecycle experience. We are building a cost structure to support an average 25 to 30 gigawatt new unit gas turbine market; however, actual orders in a given year can vary. As a result of these actions and overall market conditions, we believe the business is showing early signs of stabilization. We expect incremental improvements in 2020 with further acceleration in 2021 and beyond. We continue to invest in new product development, such as our ha-turbines, including upgrades, as these are critical to our customers and the long-term strategy of the business. The grid market continues to be challenging as we have experienced current year order declines in the high voltage direct current (hvdc) and high voltage (hv) product lines. Given price pressure, the need for grid flexibility to accommodate more renewable energy, and the diversification of energy players, the hydropower industry continues to maximize value with new small-scale and pumped storage projects to support both wind and solar expansion. We are executing our turnaround plans and we expect improvements in contribution margin in 2020. We continue to focus on cost reduction initiatives of our products, in-sourcing blade production and developing larger, more efficient turbines. We continue to monitor our execution during this period including risks of delivery delays due to customer site readiness issues and possible project postponements. We expect additional opportunities to repower existing wind turbines. The repower market remains robust, and we expect continued strong demand in 2020 and beyond. We are actively pursuing opportunities to enhance our operational flexibility and resilience strategies to adapt to market conditions and external pressures. Our organizational health is supported by ongoing investments in technology and innovation, which are critical for maintaining competitive advantage in a turbulent market environment. We are committed to ensuring business continuity and operational management through effective resource allocation and strategic initiatives. The actions we are taking are designed to enhance our organizational resilience, enabling us to confront and recover from disruptive events while maintaining performance under pressure. We recognize the importance of inter-organizational collaboration and stakeholder engagement in achieving our major objectives and sustaining operational continuity. Our focus on strategic adaptation and proactive measures will position us to navigate future uncertainties and enhance our organizational effectiveness. We are also committed to fostering a learning organization that embraces change management and encourages knowledge creation and sharing across teams. This multifaceted approach is essential for building organizational strength and ensuring long-term success in a complex and dynamic business landscape.

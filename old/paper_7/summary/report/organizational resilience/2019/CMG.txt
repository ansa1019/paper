As of December 31, 2019, we operated 2,580 Chipotle restaurants throughout the United States and 39 international Chipotle restaurants. We are committed to making good food more accessible while continuing to be a brand with a demonstrated purpose. Our financial highlights indicate a revenue increase of 14.8% to $5.6 billion in 2019 compared to $4.9 billion in 2018, with comparable sales increasing 11.1%. We continue to invest in improving our digital platforms, having significantly upgraded our capabilities by completing the rollout of digital pickup shelves and expanding our delivery capabilities to over 98% of our store base. Digital sales from out-of-restaurant orders increased to 18.0% of revenue for the full year 2019, up from 10.9% in 2018. Our restaurant operating costs as a percentage of revenue decreased due to comparable restaurant sales increases, partially offset by higher food costs and wage inflation. In 2018, we undertook corporate restructuring, consolidating certain administrative functions and closing offices, which involved offering affected employees opportunities to continue in the new organization or severance packages. We recognized corporate restructuring activities of $56.8 million, with $14.2 million in 2019. We announced planned closures of approximately 55 to 65 restaurants, recognizing exit costs of approximately $36.5 million. In 2019, we opened 140 new restaurants and expect to open between 150 to 165 in 2020. Seasonal factors cause profitability fluctuations, with average daily restaurant sales typically lower in the first and fourth quarters due to various external pressures. Our liquidity and capital resources primarily support new restaurant construction and initiatives to improve guest experiences. As of December 31, 2019, we had a cash and short-term investment balance of $880.8 million, which we expect to utilize for business growth and maintaining existing restaurants. We have not required significant working capital due to our operational model, which minimizes receivables and inventories. Our total capital expenditures for 2019 were $333.9 million, with expectations of $350 million in 2020. We anticipate increased development costs for new restaurants due to strategic initiatives such as design updates. Our contractual obligations include operating leases and purchase obligations for goods and services necessary for operations. We have recorded liabilities for legal contingencies and monitor claims closely to adjust estimates as circumstances change. Our self-insured employee health benefits programs carry significant retentions for various liabilities, and we estimate costs based on historical trends and economic conditions. We recognize compensation expenses for equity awards based on fair value, which requires significant judgment regarding various assumptions. Our estimates of future cash flows for long-lived assets are subjective and can be impacted by changes in business conditions. We manage our restaurants collectively, and individual restaurant cash flows are not generally independent of others in a market. We have no material off-balance sheet arrangements, and our operations are affected by inflation in various areas, which we have historically offset with menu price increases.

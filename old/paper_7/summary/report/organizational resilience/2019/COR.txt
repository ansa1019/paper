We are one of the largest global pharmaceutical sourcing and distribution services companies, helping both healthcare providers and pharmaceutical and biotech manufacturers improve patient access to products and enhance patient care. Our operations are organized based upon the products and services we provide to our customers, which include a comprehensive offering of brand-name, specialty brand-name, and generic pharmaceuticals, as well as additional services designed to increase the effectiveness and efficiency of the pharmaceutical supply chain. The pharmaceutical distribution services segment distributes a wide variety of products and provides data analytics, outcomes research, and additional services for biotechnology and pharmaceutical manufacturers, which are essential for adapting to market demands and ensuring operational continuity. We recognize that our future revenue growth will continue to be affected by various factors, including industry growth trends, the introduction of new, innovative therapies, and changes in pharmaceutical manufacturer pricing and distribution policies. Our ability to maintain positive adjustment under challenging conditions is reflected in our revenue growth, which increased 6.9% from the prior fiscal year, primarily due to the growth of our pharmaceutical distribution services segment and strong specialty product sales. The operational flexibility demonstrated through our strategic acquisitions and consolidations, such as the integration of Profarma and H.D. Smith, has enhanced our capacity to respond to external pressures and market fluctuations. Additionally, our gross profit increased 11.4%, indicating effective resource allocation and operational management despite challenges such as the suspension of production at our Memphis facility. We continue to incur remediation costs related to our compounding operations, which exemplifies our commitment to risk mitigation and recovery strategies in the face of adversity. The consent decree with the FDA and the ongoing compliance measures required for our Pharmedium facilities illustrate our proactive approach to crisis management and organizational resilience. Our operational resources and strategic initiatives are designed to ensure we can confront unexpected situations and maintain our organizational health. The significant impairment of long-lived assets and associated costs highlight the challenges we face; however, our focus on strategic adaptation and organizational transformation remains steadfast. We anticipate that our cash flows from operations and borrowings will be sufficient to fund our ongoing cash requirements, supporting our resilience strategies and future planning. Our liquidity and capital resources are structured to finance working capital and support our strategic objectives, ensuring we can navigate turbulent markets and sustain our competitive advantage. The ongoing assessment of our long-lived assets and the strategic decisions made in response to market conditions reflect our commitment to maintaining system integrity and performance under pressure. As we continue to evolve and adapt, our emphasis on collaboration networks and inter-organizational collaboration will be critical in enhancing our resilience and ensuring long-term organizational success.

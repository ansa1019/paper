Schlumberger's financial performance in 2019 was primarily driven by international markets, where increased activity on the part of operators reflected a continued investment in longer-term resource development following a sustained period of underinvestment and declining production. The company experienced a significant drop in North American revenue, largely due to budget exhaustion and cash flow constraints affecting customer spending. Despite these challenges, Schlumberger's international revenue grew, demonstrating resilience in adapting to external pressures and maintaining operational continuity. The company is cautiously optimistic about its portfolio high-grading strategy, which aims to promote margin expansion and improve returns in the North American land market, indicating a proactive approach to resource allocation and operational flexibility.

In response to the fluctuating market conditions, Schlumberger implemented a scale-to-fit strategy, which included repurposing or exiting underperforming business units and focusing on asset-light operations. This strategic adaptation reflects the company's commitment to maintaining its organizational health and effectiveness under adverse conditions. The formation of the Sensia joint venture and the divestiture of the drilling tools business are examples of strategic initiatives aimed at enhancing operational resilience and resource generation.

The company also demonstrated its ability to manage risks and uncertainties through its financial strategies, which included maintaining a strong liquidity position with significant cash and short-term investments. Schlumberger's management believes that its liquidity resources are sufficient to meet future business requirements, thereby supporting its resilience strategies in the face of market volatility. The effective management of its capital structure, including debt management and cash flow from operations, further underscores Schlumberger's focus on sustaining performance under pressure.

Schlumberger's operational management practices, including the right-sizing of hydraulic fracturing capacity and the restructuring of operations to protect margins, illustrate its commitment to resilience in navigating complex situations and environmental disruptions. The company’s ability to absorb strain and preserve functioning despite challenges is indicative of its multifaceted approach to organizational resilience, emphasizing adaptability and strategic foresight.

The expectation of international revenue growth in the coming periods, supported by increasing offshore activity and improving activity mix, reflects Schlumberger's confidence in its resilience capabilities. The company’s focus on future planning and crisis response mechanisms positions it to confront unexpected situations effectively. Overall, Schlumberger's strategic response to external disturbances and its emphasis on operational flexibility and resource management highlight its commitment to organizational resilience, ensuring that it can thrive amidst adversity and maintain positive adjustment under challenging conditions.

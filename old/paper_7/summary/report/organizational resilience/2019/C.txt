Citi's 2019 results reflected steady progress toward improving profitability and returns, despite an uncertain revenue environment, driven by strong client engagement and balanced growth across businesses and geographies. The company demonstrated strong expense discipline, resulting in expenses that were largely unchanged from the prior year, and positive operating leverage, even as it continued to invest in the franchise. Citi intends to continue building on the progress made during 2019 with a focus on further optimizing performance to benefit shareholders while remaining flexible and adapting to market and economic conditions as they develop. Economic forecasts for 2020 have been lowered, and various economic, political, and other risks and uncertainties could create a more volatile operating environment, impacting Citi's businesses and future results. The company reported broad-based loan and deposit growth across its Global Consumer Banking (GCB) and Institutional Clients Group (ICG), with net income increasing 8% primarily driven by a lower effective tax rate and higher revenues, partially offset by higher costs of credit. The results included a net tax benefit related to discrete tax items, reflecting the company's ability to manage its financial resources effectively. Citi's capital metrics remained strong, with a common equity tier 1 capital ratio of 11.8% as of December 31, 2019, indicating resilience in maintaining financial stability amid external pressures. The GCB segment reported solid underlying revenue growth, with balanced performance across regions, while ICG revenues increased, reflecting a 1% increase in banking revenues and a 5% increase in markets and securities services revenues. The company’s operational flexibility was evident as it navigated through a challenging environment, maintaining a focus on strategic initiatives that enhance organizational capabilities and performance. Citi's commitment to efficiency savings and the wind-down of legacy assets contributed to a stable operational framework, supporting its resilience strategies. The overall strategy is to leverage Citi's global footprint to be the pre-eminent bank for affluent consumers, indicating a proactive approach to future planning and adaptation to market dynamics. The company’s ability to absorb strain and preserve functioning amidst adversity was highlighted by its balanced performance across various segments, showcasing its organizational strength and adaptability in a turbulent business environment. The emphasis on maintaining positive adjustment under challenging conditions aligns with the broader definition of organizational resilience, as Citi continues to confront and manage risks while optimizing its operational resources and strategic responses to ensure long-term sustainability and success.

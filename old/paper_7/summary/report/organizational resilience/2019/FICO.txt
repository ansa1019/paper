During fiscal 2019, our growth initiatives continued to generate significant free cash flow, which we utilized to enhance stockholder value through investments in long-term growth initiatives and acquisitions of relevant technologies and products that strengthen our portfolio and competitive position. We continued to transform our business from on-premises to recurring revenue associated with our cloud-based solutions, which provides growth opportunities with customers that can benefit from the affordability and simplicity of these solutions. Our continued product innovation is indicative of our adaptability in responding to customer needs and market demands. We drive growth in our scores segment, which has achieved a multi-year expansion in the growing U.S. consumer market. The increase in our business-to-business scores revenue was primarily attributable to a higher unit price in mortgage and auto activities, reflecting our ability to adjust to environmental perturbations and competitive pressures. 

We regard the volume of bookings achieved as an important indicator of future revenues, which includes estimated revenues derived from software licenses and transactional fees. Our calculations of bookings are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties concerning timing and contingencies affecting product delivery and performance, indicating our operational flexibility in navigating unexpected situations. The variability in our bookings is primarily caused by economic trends in our customers' industries and individual performance relative to competitors, highlighting the need for effective risk assessment and management strategies.

Our financial results demonstrate resilience, with total revenues for fiscal 2019 increasing by 16% from the previous year. The operating income increased significantly, reflecting our ability to maintain performance under pressure and adapt to changing market conditions. We continue to enhance stockholder value by returning cash through stock repurchase programs, which is a strategic response to our financial performance and market position.

The increase in our cloud business revenues and the strategic partnerships we have formed illustrate our commitment to innovation and resilience in the face of market volatility. Our operational management practices, including increased resource allocation towards cloud infrastructure, are designed to support our long-term objectives and enhance our organizational capabilities. 

We assess our operational continuity and organizational health through various metrics, including our ability to generate cash flow and manage expenses effectively. Our strategic initiatives are focused on ensuring that we can confront challenges and leverage opportunities for growth, thereby reinforcing our organizational resilience. The emphasis on research and development, along with our commitment to enhancing our product offerings, positions us to respond proactively to future disruptions and maintain our competitive advantage. 

In summary, our organizational practices and strategic planning reflect a multifaceted approach to resilience, enabling us to navigate complex situations and sustain performance amidst external pressures and uncertainties.

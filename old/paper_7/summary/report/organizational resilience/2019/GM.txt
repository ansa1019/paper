Our management team has adopted a strategic plan to transform GM into the world's most valued automotive company, which includes several major initiatives that we anticipate will redefine the future of personal mobility and advance our vision of zero crashes, zero emissions, zero congestion while also strengthening the core of our business. We continue to strategically assess our performance and ability to achieve acceptable returns on our invested capital, as well as our cost structure in order to maintain a low breakeven point. In November 2018, we announced plans to accelerate steps to improve our overall business performance, including the reorganization of global product development staffs and the realignment of manufacturing capacity in response to market-related volume declines. We expect these transformation activities to drive significant cost efficiencies and enhance our operational flexibility. The labor agreement with the UAW, which has a term of four years, includes provisions that will impact our operational continuity and resource allocation. The UAW strike caused significant disruptions, resulting in an unfavorable impact on our ebit-adjusted and net cash provided by operating activities. We estimate that lost production volumes and parts sales due to the UAW strike had an unfavorable impact of approximately $3.6 billion on our GMNA ebit-adjusted in the year ended December 31, 2019. We have achieved substantial cost savings through staffing, manufacturing, and product initiatives, and we are on track to reduce capital expenditures while meeting our revised cost savings target. Our liquidity plans are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including those described in the risk factors section, which may affect our ability to respond to environmental disruptions and maintain our competitive advantage. We continue to monitor and evaluate opportunities to strengthen our competitive position over the long term while maintaining a strong investment-grade balance sheet. Our future uses of cash are focused on reinvesting in our business, maintaining a strong balance sheet, and returning available cash to shareholders. We have recorded charges related to our transformation plans, which may have a material impact on our results of operations. The ability to respond effectively to environmental disruptions is critical for our organizational resilience, and we are committed to adapting our strategies to ensure long-term sustainability. We believe that offering a comprehensive suite of financing products will generate incremental sales of our vehicles and support our sales throughout various economic cycles. Our management uses non-GAAP measures to view operating trends and perform analytical comparisons, which are integral to our decision-making processes. We are actively testing our autonomous vehicles and making significant progress toward commercialization, which is part of our strategy to enhance our operational capabilities and resilience. We view the Chinese market as important to our global growth strategy and are employing a multi-brand strategy to increase our product offerings. Our joint ventures in China are critical to our operational success, and maintaining strong relationships with our partners is essential for navigating the complexities of the market. We continue to face competitive pressures and regulatory challenges that require us to be agile and responsive in our strategic initiatives.

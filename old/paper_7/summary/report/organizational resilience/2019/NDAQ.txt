The following discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations of Nasdaq should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included in this Form 10-K. Our senior management closely evaluates key drivers for our market services, corporate services, information services, and market technology segments to assess performance. We manage, operate, and provide our products and services in four business segments, which allows for strategic resource allocation and operational flexibility. The comparability of our results of operations between reported periods is impacted by acquisitions and divestitures, which are critical for maintaining organizational health and adapting to external pressures. Our growth strategy emphasizes service innovation and the ability to respond effectively to environmental disruptions, thereby enhancing our competitive advantage. 

The financial performance reflects our capacity to absorb strain and preserve functioning despite adversity, indicating resilience in our operational management. The increase in annualized recurring revenue (ARR) is a key performance metric that assesses the health and trajectory of our business, highlighting our ability to generate resources and adapt to changing market conditions. The restructuring charges recorded in 2019 are a consequence of strategic initiatives aimed at reconfiguring our business areas to advance our opportunities as a technology and analytics provider. 

We have implemented policies and procedures to measure, manage, monitor, and report risk exposures, which are reviewed regularly by management and the board of directors. Our approach to risk management involves assessing potential disruptions and implementing resilience strategies to mitigate risks associated with operational continuity. The maintenance of positive adjustment under challenging conditions is reflected in our ability to manage financial resources effectively, ensuring we can confront unexpected situations and maintain performance under pressure. 

Our liquidity and capital resources are supported by cash generated from operations, which allows us to meet commitments and fund strategic initiatives. The principal factors affecting our internally generated funds include potential deterioration in revenues and changes in regulatory requirements. We are also exposed to credit risk, which we manage by evaluating counterparties and limiting exposure to ensure organizational resilience. 

Overall, our operational practices and strategic planning reflect a commitment to adaptability and resilience, enabling us to navigate complex situations and maintain organizational effectiveness. The focus on future planning and crisis response mechanisms is essential for sustaining growth and ensuring long-term success in a turbulent market environment.

The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the other sections of this annual report on Form 10-K, including the consolidated financial statements and related notes contained in Item 8, and the discussion of risk factors that may affect future results in Item 1A. Altria's reportable segments are smokeable products, smokeless products, and wine. The financial services and the innovative tobacco products businesses are included in an all other category due to the continued reduction of the lease portfolio of PMCC and the relative financial contribution of Altria's innovative tobacco products businesses to Altria's consolidated results. The changes in Altria's net earnings and diluted EPS attributable to Altria for the year ended December 31, 2019, from the year ended December 31, 2018, were due primarily to various operational factors including higher income from the smokeable and smokeless products segments and lower spending as a result of Altria's decision in 2018 to refocus its innovative product efforts. Altria forecasts that its 2020 full-year adjusted diluted EPS growth rate is expected to be in the range of 4% to 7% over its 2019 full-year adjusted diluted EPS base, reflecting increased investments related to PM USA's commercialization efforts for IQOS and Helix's plans to manufacture and expand U.S. distribution of on! This forecasted growth rate excludes estimated per share charges in 2020 for tax expense, representing a partial reversal of the tax basis benefit recorded in 2017 attributable to Altria's investment in ABI. The increase of $421 million in operations shown in the table above was due primarily to higher earnings from Altria's equity investment in ABI, partially offset by higher interest and other debt expense due to debt incurred in connection with the Cronos and Juul transactions. Altria's strategic initiatives reflect a focus on resilience strategies that aim to maintain operational flexibility and adaptability in response to external pressures and environmental disruptions. The company emphasizes the importance of resource allocation and management in navigating complex situations and ensuring organizational effectiveness.

Altria's commitment to strategic adaptation and transformation is evident in its efforts to reconfigure its business strategies and operational practices in response to changing market dynamics. The organization recognizes the significance of learning processes and knowledge management in enhancing its absorptive capacity and overall organizational health, which are critical for sustaining competitive advantage and achieving major objectives.

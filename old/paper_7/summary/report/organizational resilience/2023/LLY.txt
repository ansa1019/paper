Management's discussion and analysis highlights that our long-term success depends on our ability to continually discover or acquire, develop, and commercialize innovative medicines, which is essential for maintaining operational flexibility and adapting to environmental perturbations. The introduction of new products and indications, as well as business development activities, are critical to enhance or refine our product pipeline, reflecting our strategic initiatives to confront external pressures and ensure organizational health. The pharmaceutical research and development process is inherently risky, with a high rate of failure, necessitating effective resource allocation and risk management to mitigate potential adverse impacts on firm performance. We face significant challenges in meeting demand for our incretin products, which requires ongoing adjustments to our operational management strategies and resource generation capabilities. Our management continuously evaluates liquidity and capital resources to ensure we can adequately finance capital requirements and maintain operational continuity in the face of uncertainties. The regulatory landscape, including potential impacts from the Inflation Reduction Act, poses additional pressures on pricing and reimbursement, which could affect our strategic response and overall resilience. We have implemented measures to manage demand amid tight supply, including efforts to expand manufacturing capacity, which are vital for maintaining performance under pressure. The complexities of our business environment necessitate a multifaceted approach to crisis management and organizational change processes, ensuring we remain adaptable and capable of reconfiguring our strategies in response to unexpected situations. Our investments in new facilities and technologies are aimed at enhancing our operational capabilities, thereby supporting our resilience strategies and future planning. We recognize that fluctuations in interest rates, currency values, and overall economic conditions can impact our financial resources and operational effectiveness, necessitating a proactive approach to risk assessment and management. The ongoing evaluation of our research and development spending across our portfolio reflects our commitment to strategic adaptation and resilience in navigating the challenges of the pharmaceutical industry. As we expand our manufacturing capacity, we are also entering into various agreements for contract manufacturing, which could require significant resource commitments, underscoring the importance of effective resource management and collaboration networks. The uncertainties inherent in our business, including potential litigation and regulatory challenges, further emphasize the need for robust organizational practices and stakeholder engagement to ensure our continued success and survival in a turbulent market environment.

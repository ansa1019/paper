Moody's is a global integrated risk assessment firm that empowers organizations to anticipate, adapt, and thrive in a new era of exponential risk. The company continues to monitor current macroeconomic and geopolitical uncertainties that have contributed to volatility in rated issuance volumes, which began in 2022 and have continued into 2023. These uncertainties include inflation levels, higher interest rates, and volatility in the global capital markets partly resulting from ongoing military conflicts. Moody's operations and net assets in regions affected by these conflicts are not material; however, broader global market volatility has contributed to fluctuations in rated issuance volumes. The company is unable to predict the near-term or longer-term impact of these conflicts on its financial position and operating results due to numerous uncertainties regarding their severity and duration. Moody's evaluates its critical accounting estimates based on historical experience and other reasonable assumptions, recognizing that actual results may differ under different conditions. The company performs qualitative assessments of its reporting units to determine goodwill impairment, which reflects its ability to maintain operational integrity and performance amidst external pressures. Moody's utilizes a trajectory model of organizational resilience that focuses on how actors project temporal trajectories of responses toward disruptive events and reconfigure these trajectories in response to challenges. The company believes that its ability to manage interrelated risks and opportunities enables business leaders to identify, measure, and mitigate risks effectively. The ongoing restructuring program reflects Moody's commitment to adapting its operational structure in response to changing market conditions. The company’s financial resources are managed to ensure sufficient liquidity to meet operational needs, and it continues to evaluate its cash management strategies in light of its organizational objectives. Moody's recognizes the importance of maintaining operational flexibility and resilience in the face of environmental perturbations and market volatility. The company's strategic initiatives aim to enhance its capabilities in risk management and to foster a culture of continuous improvement and innovation. Moody's is committed to leveraging its internal knowledge and resources to navigate complex situations and to support its organizational health and effectiveness. The firm’s focus on strategic foresight and adaptability positions it to respond proactively to future challenges and to sustain its competitive advantage in a turbulent business environment.

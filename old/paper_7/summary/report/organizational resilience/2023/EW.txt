We are the global leader in patient-focused medical innovations for structural heart disease and critical care monitoring. Our priority has been to maintain access for patients to our life-saving technologies while providing continuous front-line support to our clinician partners, and protecting the well-being of our employees. We expect to continue to experience adverse effects related to COVID-19 for some time, particularly as hospital systems continue experiencing budget constraints and staffing shortages, the supply chains continue to adjust to the market, and medical procedure rates and demand for our products continue to fluctuate as the medical system rebalances its infrastructure and resources in a post-COVID-19 market. The medical technology industry is highly competitive and continues to evolve. Our success is measured both by the development of innovative products and the value we bring to our stakeholders. We are committed to developing new technologies and providing innovative patient care. In 2023, we invested 17.8% of our net sales in research and development. We are dedicated to generating robust clinical, economic, and quality-of-life evidence increasingly expected by patients, clinicians, and payors in the current healthcare environment, with the goal of encouraging the adoption of innovative new medical therapies that demonstrate superior outcomes. Despite the challenges to our business due to COVID-19 and macroeconomic headwinds, our net sales for 2023 were $6.0 billion, representing an increase of $622.4 million over 2022, driven by sales growth of our TAVR products. The planned separation of our critical care product group will enable us to pursue expanded opportunities for TAVR, TMTT, and surgical patients, as well as new investments in interventional heart failure technologies. We have continued to experience the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, particularly in Japan and disruptions related to staffing shortages in the United States and Europe. Our teams were relentless in doing the right things for patients, demonstrating operational flexibility and adaptability under challenging conditions. We launched several new products and received multiple regulatory approvals, which reflect our commitment to innovation and resilience in the face of external pressures. Our financial position remains robust, supported by diverse revenue streams and strategic investments in research and development. We believe that these sources are sufficient to fund the current and long-term requirements of working capital, capital expenditures, and other financial commitments. Our commitment to maintaining operational continuity and adapting to environmental disturbances is evident in our strategic initiatives aimed at enhancing our organizational capabilities and ensuring performance maintenance. We strive to resolve open matters with each tax authority at the examination level, which reflects our proactive measures in managing uncertainties and potential risks. Our approach to resource management and operational management is designed to foster resilience, enabling us to confront challenges and capitalize on opportunities for growth and sustainability. The execution of our strategic response to market volatility and disruptions is key to our organizational success, ensuring that we remain a leader in the medical technology industry while navigating complex situations and maintaining our focus on patient care and innovation.

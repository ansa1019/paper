Macroeconomic conditions, including inflation, changes in interest rates, and currency fluctuations, have directly and indirectly impacted, and could in the future materially impact, the company's results of operations and financial condition. The company's total net sales decreased 3% or $11.0 billion during 2023 compared to 2022, with the weakness in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar accounting for more than the entire year-over-year decrease in total net sales. The company believes its balances of cash, cash equivalents, and unrestricted marketable securities, which totaled $148.3 billion as of September 30, 2023, along with cash generated by ongoing operations and continued access to debt markets, will be sufficient to satisfy its cash requirements and capital return program over the next 12 months and beyond. The company's material cash requirements include outstanding fixed-rate notes with varying maturities for an aggregate principal amount of $106.6 billion, with $9.9 billion payable within 12 months. The company utilizes several outsourcing partners to manufacture subassemblies for its products and to perform final assembly and testing of finished products, indicating a reliance on external resources for operational continuity. The company's future gross margins can be impacted by a variety of factors, as discussed in part I, item 1A of this form 10-K under the heading "risk factors." The company has an authorized share repurchase program and intends to increase its dividend on an annual basis, subject to declaration by the board of directors. The year-over-year growth in research and development expense in 2023 was driven primarily by increases in headcount-related expenses, reflecting a strategic initiative to enhance organizational capabilities. The company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business, the outcomes of which are inherently uncertain, necessitating effective risk management practices. The evaluation of the company's uncertain tax positions involves significant judgment in the interpretation and application of GAAP and complex domestic and international tax laws, which could materially impact the company's financial condition and operating results. The company records a liability when it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount is reasonably estimable, indicating an approach to managing potential adverse events. The company's effective tax rate for 2023 was lower compared to 2022 due primarily to a lower effective tax rate on foreign earnings and the impact of U.S. foreign tax credit regulations, which reflects adaptability in financial management strategies. The company’s operational flexibility is evidenced by its ability to respond effectively to environmental disruptions and transform itself to emerge stronger from challenging situations, thus maintaining a focus on organizational resilience. The company’s strategic response to market volatility and external pressures is critical for sustaining performance under pressure and ensuring long-term organizational health.

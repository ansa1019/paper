During 2023, we successfully launched multiple leadership products across our business and made important progress on our artificial intelligence (AI) strategy, which is focused on delivering a broad portfolio and multigenerational roadmap of leadership CPUs, GPUs, and adaptive computing solutions for AI inference and training. Our AI strategy emphasizes extending the open software platform to enable our AI hardware to be deployed broadly and with ease, and expanding deep and collaborative engagements across ecosystems to accelerate deployments of AMD-based AI solutions at scale. We brought together multiple AI teams across AMD to execute our end-to-end AI hardware strategy and drive the development of a comprehensive software ecosystem that spans our full product portfolio. The demand for our data center GPU products was very strong, indicating our ability to respond effectively to environmental disruptions. Despite a mixed demand environment, we maintained operational continuity with net revenue of $22.7 billion, reflecting our adaptability in a challenging market. The decrease in net revenue was primarily due to a 25% decrease in client segment revenue, which was partially offset by a 17% increase in embedded segment revenue and a 7% increase in data center segment revenue, demonstrating our capacity to reconfigure resources and adapt to changing market conditions. Our operating income for 2023 was $401 million, a decrease from the previous year, primarily due to lower client segment performance and increased R&D investments, yet we continued to invest in our capabilities to enhance future performance. We believe our cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments, and cash flows from operations will be sufficient to fund operations over the next 12 months and beyond, indicating our resilience in managing financial resources under varying conditions. Our strategic initiatives include strengthening our AI software capabilities through strategic acquisitions, which enhance our organizational strength and resource generation. We continue to evaluate the impact of proposed and enacted legislative changes on our effective tax rate and cash flows, demonstrating our proactive measures in risk management and strategic foresight. Our financial condition reflects a commitment to maintaining operational flexibility and performance under pressure, as evidenced by our ability to manage working capital and cash flow activities effectively. The integration of Xilinx has contributed to our embedded segment revenue, showcasing our capacity for organizational transformation and adaptation. We recognize the importance of collaboration networks and inter-organizational collaboration in navigating complex situations and enhancing our organizational resilience. Our ongoing assessment of market conditions and strategic response mechanisms will enable us to confront future challenges and maintain a trajectory of positive adjustment under adversity, ensuring our organizational health and sustainability in turbulent markets.

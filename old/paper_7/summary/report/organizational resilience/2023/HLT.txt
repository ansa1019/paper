The COVID-19 pandemic has posed significant challenges to our operations, yet our results for the year ended December 31, 2022, reflected a strong recovery compared to the same periods in 2020 and 2021. The ongoing impacts of the pandemic have necessitated our focus on operational flexibility and adaptability to ensure business continuity. As we navigate external pressures, particularly from the pandemic, we have observed that certain regions and customer segments continue to recover, indicating our resilience in the face of adversity. Our strategic objectives include the continued expansion of our global hotel network, which is critical for maintaining competitive advantage and operational resilience. We evaluate the economic viability of new hotel additions based on geographic location and the credit quality of third-party owners, which reflects our commitment to resource allocation and risk assessment in uncertain environments. The current economic landscape, characterized by elevated inflation and interest rates, has introduced complexities that may affect our growth strategy and operational management. However, we have taken proactive measures to manage fixed costs and optimize value for our stakeholders, which supports the long-term sustainability of our business. Our development pipeline represents hotels expected to be added to our system in the future, demonstrating our future orientation and commitment to resilience strategies. The increase in revenues from our owned and leased hotels, driven by improved performance and occupancy rates, underscores our ability to adapt and recover from disruptive events. We recognize the importance of inter-organizational collaboration and stakeholder engagement in enhancing our organizational health and effectiveness. The multifaceted nature of our operations requires a systemic perspective to navigate environmental disruptions and maintain performance under pressure. Our management and franchise segment's success relies on our ability to sustain good relationships with third-party hotel owners and franchisees, which is essential for our organizational coherence and resilience. The increase in franchise and management fees is indicative of our capacity to absorb strain and preserve functioning despite external disturbances. We are committed to leveraging our organizational capabilities and emotional resources to confront challenges and ensure operational continuity. Our cash management policy aims to maintain liquidity and minimize operational costs, which is vital for our resilience in turbulent markets. As we continue to adapt to changing market conditions, our focus on strategic initiatives and performance maintenance will be crucial for our organizational evolution and success. The ability to foresee and respond to future challenges will enhance our resilience and ensure we emerge stronger from adversity.

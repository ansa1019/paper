Management's discussion and analysis includes a focus on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, which is essential for maintaining organizational resilience. Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our financial reporting and the preparation of consolidated financial statements for external purposes. This assessment is based on criteria established in the internal control-integrated framework, which emphasizes the design and operating effectiveness of key financial reporting controls, process documentation, and our overall control environment. The inherent limitations of control systems must be acknowledged, as they can only provide reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the control system's objectives will be met. The design of a control system must reflect resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Management's evaluation concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within specified time periods. This effectiveness is critical for timely decisions regarding required disclosure, which is a key aspect of organizational resilience. Furthermore, our internal control over financial reporting was assessed as effective, which is vital for maintaining performance under pressure and ensuring operational continuity. The assessment included evaluation of elements such as the design and operating effectiveness of key financial reporting controls and our overall control environment, which are essential for adapting to unexpected situations and mitigating risks associated with external disturbances. The ability to respond effectively to environmental disruptions and transform itself to emerge stronger from challenging situations is a reflection of our organizational resilience. The management's proactive measures in evaluating and enhancing internal controls contribute to our capacity to absorb strain and preserve functioning despite the presence of adversity. This focus on maintaining integrity and performance under various pressures and constraints aligns with the multifaceted nature of organizational resilience, which encompasses the ability to foresee, confront, and benefit from sudden disruptive changes. The overall effectiveness of our internal controls and the strategic initiatives in place are indicative of our commitment to resilience strategies that support organizational health and adaptability in a turbulent business environment.

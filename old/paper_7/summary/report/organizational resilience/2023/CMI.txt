We are a global power leader that designs, manufactures, distributes, and services diesel, natural gas, electric, and hybrid powertrains and powertrain-related components. Our operations are affected by geopolitical risks, currency fluctuations, political and economic uncertainty, and public health crises. Our geographic diversity and broad product and service offerings have helped limit the impact from a drop in demand in any one industry or region. As part of our growth strategy, we invest in businesses in countries that carry higher levels of risk such as China, Brazil, India, Mexico, and countries in the Middle East and Africa. We have long-standing relationships with leading manufacturers, which enhance our competitive advantage and resilience in the market. The indefinite suspension of operations in Russia required us to reorganize our regional management structure, demonstrating our ability to adapt to unexpected situations and maintain operational flexibility. Our financial performance depends on varying conditions in the markets we serve, and demand tends to fluctuate in response to overall economic conditions. Economic downturns generally result in reduced sales and can lead to price reductions in certain products and markets. We continue to serve all our markets as they adopt electrification and alternative power technologies, meeting the needs of our OEM partners and end customers. Our financial condition and liquidity remain strong, supported by significant ongoing operating cash flow. We assess our liquidity in terms of our ability to generate adequate cash to fund our operating, investing, and financing activities. Our access to capital markets, existing cash, and marketable securities provide us with the financial flexibility needed to make payments required by regulatory agreements, targeted capital expenditures, and debt service obligations. We recorded a charge to resolve regulatory civil claims regarding our emissions certification and compliance process, which will impact our liquidity in 2024. We expect to make substantial payments related to this agreement through our existing liquidity and access to debt markets. Our investment strategy includes targeted capacity expansions and new product lines, which are essential for maintaining resilience in a turbulent market environment. We anticipate demand for trucks in North America and India to remain strong, while challenges include potential weakening demand for heavy-duty trucks and continued inflationary pressures. Our organizational practices focus on strategic initiatives that enhance our operational management and resource allocation, ensuring we can confront and adapt to environmental perturbations and market volatility. We believe our ability to foresee and respond to disruptive changes is critical for our organizational survival and success. The ongoing separation of our filtration business into a stand-alone company will result in incremental expenses, but we view this as a strategic move to enhance our long-term resilience. Our comprehensive approach to risk management, including assessing potential hazards and implementing proactive measures, supports our organizational health and effectiveness in navigating complex situations.

We are the leading retailer and distributor of automotive replacement parts and accessories in the Americas, with operations that began in 1979. As of August 26, 2023, we operated 6,300 stores in the U.S., 740 stores in Mexico, and 100 stores in Brazil. Our commercial sales program provides commercial credit and prompt delivery of parts to various accounts, which enhances our operational flexibility and ability to adapt to customer needs. For fiscal 2023, we achieved record net income of $2.5 billion, a 4.1% increase over the prior year, driven by sales growth and initiatives aimed at improving our responsiveness to customers. Our business is influenced by various macroeconomic factors, including inflation and supply chain disruptions, which pose external pressures that we must navigate to maintain performance. The correlation between miles driven and our net sales indicates our capacity to absorb strain and respond to environmental disruptions effectively. We have observed a slight decrease in discretionary sales and an increase in maintenance categories, reflecting our adaptability to changing market conditions. Our investments in growth initiatives, including new store openings and supply chain projects, are strategic responses to enhance our resilience and operational continuity. We believe our cash flows, available reserves, and credit capacity will provide sufficient liquidity to support our operations and strategic investments. The aging vehicle population contributes to increased demand for our products, allowing us to reconfigure our resource allocation to meet customer needs. Our ability to manage working capital effectively, including negotiating extended payment terms with suppliers, supports our operational resilience. We anticipate that our ongoing investments in supply chain initiatives will further enhance our organizational capabilities and performance maintenance. Our strategic planning includes leveraging our financial resources to support growth while managing risk through effective debt management. The adjustments in our self-insurance reserves reflect our proactive measures to mitigate risks associated with operational hazards. Our historical experience and strategic foresight enable us to navigate uncertainties in the business environment, ensuring we remain competitive. The focus on maintaining our investment-grade credit ratings is critical for our financial health and resilience. As we continue to adapt to market volatility and external disturbances, our organizational practices will emphasize collaboration and knowledge management to enhance our overall effectiveness. Our commitment to operational flexibility and responsiveness to customer demands positions us to thrive in a turbulent market landscape.

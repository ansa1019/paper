Cintas helps more than one million businesses of all types and sizes get ready to open their doors with confidence every day by providing a wide range of products and services that enhance customers' image and help keep their facilities and employees clean, safe, and looking their best. The company’s principal objective is to exceed customers' expectations in order to maximize long-term value for shareholders and working partners, which provides a framework for its business strategy. This strategy aims to achieve revenue growth by increasing penetration at existing customers and broadening the customer base to include market segments not historically served. Cintas has a highly talented and diverse team of service professionals visiting customers regularly, which enables the development of close personal relationships. The combination of the distribution system and strong customer relationships provides a platform for launching additional products and services. Cintas evaluates operating segment performance based on revenue and operating income, regularly reviewing its operating segments for reporting purposes based on information used for resource allocation and performance assessment. The company’s total revenue for fiscal 2023 was $8.8 billion, reflecting a 12.2% increase over the prior fiscal year, driven by increased sales volume and organic growth. Revenue growth was a result of new business, penetration of additional products and services into existing customers, and price increases. The company has been able to mitigate inflationary pressures through pricing and various efficiency initiatives, ensuring that these factors have not materially impacted its consolidated financial condition or results of operations. Cintas' liquidity and capital resources are supported by cash flows from operating activities, which have historically provided a significant source of liquidity. The company expects these cash flows to remain sufficient to provide adequate levels of liquidity. Cintas has access to $2.0 billion of debt capacity from its revolving credit facility, which supports its operational continuity and strategic objectives, including acquisitions and share repurchases. The company believes it has sufficient liquidity to operate in the current business environment for at least the next 12 months and the foreseeable future thereafter. Cintas' ability to continue accessing the commercial paper and long-term debt markets on favorable terms is influenced by credit ratings, which are monitored closely. The company’s operational flexibility is enhanced by its strategic initiatives, which include evaluating acquisitions as opportunities arise and pursuing geographic expansion. Cintas' approach to managing risks includes maintaining compliance with debt covenants and ensuring that its operational practices support resilience against external pressures and disruptions. The company’s performance under pressure is reflected in its ability to adapt to changing market conditions and customer needs, demonstrating organizational resilience through effective resource management and strategic foresight. Cintas' commitment to organizational health and effectiveness is evident in its focus on customer retention, employee engagement, and continuous improvement in service delivery, which collectively contribute to its resilience and long-term success.

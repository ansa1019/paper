During the COVID-19 pandemic, we prioritized ensuring product availability for our customers and consumers, a strategic direction that remained in place throughout the global supply chain challenges and disruptions, despite adversely impacting our profitability. We continue to address the controllable challenges in our supply chain, which reflects our commitment to maintaining operational continuity and adapting to unexpected situations. Our growth strategy includes expanding our international business, which exposes us to risks inherent in conducting international operations, including fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and the impact of economic uncertainty on consumer discretionary spending. We recognize that the beverage industry is subject to changing consumer preferences that may adversely affect us if we misjudge such preferences. Our historical success is attributable, in part, to our introduction of different and innovative beverages, which have been positively accepted by consumers. Our future success will depend, in part, upon our continued ability to develop and introduce different and innovative beverages that meet consumer preferences. We believe that the key value drivers of our business include international growth, profitable growth, cost management, and an efficient capital structure designed to optimize our working capital to finance expansion. We are focused on increasing profit margins and implementing strategies to achieve profitable growth, which reflects our adaptability and resilience in a competitive landscape. Our ability to absorb, mitigate, or pass on cost increases to our bottlers/distributors and/or customers is crucial in maintaining our operational flexibility and organizational health. We face significant risks, including the impact of rising costs, interest rates, and inflation on the discretionary income of our consumers, which could negatively affect the stability of our industry and our company. The consolidation of co-packers and reliance on fewer co-packing groups may also pose challenges to our operational management. We continuously strive to meet changing consumer needs through beverage innovation, choice, and variety, which is essential for our organizational resilience. The proposal and/or adoption of legislation affecting the sale of energy and alcohol drinks may adversely affect our company, highlighting the need for effective strategic responses to external pressures. Our commitment to consumers begins with our broad product line and a wide selection of diet, light, and low-calorie beverages. We recognize the importance of crisis management and preparedness in navigating complex situations, ensuring that we can effectively respond to disruptions in our supply chain and maintain our performance under pressure. Our ability to generate sufficient cash flows to support our expansion plans and general operating activities is critical for our organizational success, as is our focus on reducing our cost base and enhancing our operational resources. We believe that our strong capital position and ability to raise funds at a relatively low effective cost of borrowings provide a competitive advantage, enabling us to adapt to the evolving business environment and sustain our growth trajectory.

We are committed to being the leader in providing infrastructure that safely delivers natural gas products to reliably fuel the clean energy economy. Our ongoing strategy is to safely and reliably operate large-scale midstream infrastructure where our assets can be fully utilized and drive low per-unit costs. We focus on consistently attracting new business by providing highly reliable service to our customers, which is essential for maintaining operational continuity and organizational effectiveness. Our strategy is designed to maximize the opportunities created by the vast supply of natural gas and natural gas products that exist in the United States, which reflects our adaptability to environmental perturbations and market demands. We seek to maintain a strong financial position and liquidity while managing a diversified portfolio of safe, clean, and reliable energy infrastructure assets that continue to serve key growth markets. The execution of our plan may be impacted by various risks, including a global recession, opposition to infrastructure projects, unexpected increases in capital expenditures, and physical damages to facilities. Our growth capital and investment expenditures are expected to support projects that maintain our assets for safe and reliable operations, as well as projects that reduce emissions and meet legal, regulatory, and contractual commitments. We have a strong commitment to safety and environmental stewardship, which is integral to our resilience strategies. Our expansion projects, such as the regional energy access project and various gathering expansions, are aimed at enhancing our operational flexibility and capacity to respond to customer needs. The acquisitions we have made, including the strategic portfolio of natural gas storage facilities, are intended to expand our resource generation capabilities and improve our competitive advantage. We continuously monitor regulatory changes and their potential impacts on our operations, which is crucial for effective risk management and organizational foresight.

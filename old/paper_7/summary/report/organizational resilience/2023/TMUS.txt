The objectives of our management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations include providing a narrative explanation from the perspective of management regarding our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, liquidity, and certain other factors that may affect future results. Following the merger with Sprint, we have undertaken network integration and decommissioning activities to achieve efficiencies in network, retail, information technology, and back-office operations. Our integration initiatives included the acceleration or termination of certain operating and financing leases, allowing for the realization of synergies associated with network integration. We began implementing restructuring initiatives to realize cost efficiencies from the merger, which included severance costs associated with the reduction of redundant processes and functions. In August 2023, we implemented a workforce reduction initiative, impacting approximately 5,000 positions, primarily in corporate and back-office functions. We expect to incur all remaining restructuring and integration costs associated with the merger by the first half of 2024, with cash expenditures extending beyond 2024. Macroeconomic trends may result in adverse impacts on our business, and we continue to monitor these potential impacts, including economic recession and geopolitical risks. We have established a trajectory model of organizational resilience focusing on how actors project temporal trajectories of responses toward disruptive events and reconfigure these trajectories toward the future. Our operational flexibility and adaptability have been tested by external pressures, and we have engaged in strategic initiatives to mitigate risks and enhance organizational health. The merger-related costs have been excluded from our calculations of adjusted EBITDA and core adjusted EBITDA, as we do not consider these costs to reflect our ongoing operating performance. We continue to monitor the impact of macroeconomic trends on our liquidity and operational capabilities, ensuring that we can respond effectively to environmental disruptions. Our financial condition reflects our ability to absorb strain and preserve functioning despite adversity, demonstrating resilience in the face of operational challenges. We have also focused on enhancing our organizational effectiveness through strategic management and resource allocation, ensuring that we maintain positive adjustment under challenging conditions. Our commitment to operational continuity and crisis management is evident in our approach to managing workforce changes and integrating systems post-merger. We recognize the importance of organizational agility and the need for effective decision-making processes to navigate complex situations and maintain performance under pressure. Our strategic response mechanisms are designed to enhance our resilience and ensure that we can confront future uncertainties while continuing to meet customer needs and expectations.

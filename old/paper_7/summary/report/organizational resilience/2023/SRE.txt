In the fourth quarter of 2023, Sempra realigned its reportable segments to reflect changes in how the Chief Operating Decision Maker (CODM) oversees its three platforms, which is consistent with how the CODM assesses performance due to the similarities of their operations, including geographic location and regulatory framework in California. Sempra's operational and financial results reflect its mission to be North America's premier energy infrastructure company, highlighting the importance of maintaining operational flexibility and adaptability in response to environmental perturbations and external pressures. The company has mechanisms in place for risk mitigation and resource allocation, which are critical for performance maintenance under challenging conditions. Sempra's businesses invest in, develop, and operate energy infrastructure, demonstrating a commitment to service innovation and strategic initiatives that enhance organizational health and resilience. 

The regulatory framework permits SDG&E and SoCalGas to recover certain program expenditures and other costs authorized by the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC), which supports business continuity and operational effectiveness. In 2023, SDG&E's earnings increased due to higher regulatory interest income and operational adjustments, reflecting the company's ability to reconfigure its operations in response to market conditions. The increase in earnings was also attributed to improved regulatory awards and lower authorized costs of capital, which are indicative of effective resource management and strategic foresight.

Sempra Infrastructure's projects, including the PA LNG Phase 1 and ECA LNG Phase 1, are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, including the need for securing binding customer commitments and obtaining regulatory approvals. The successful development of these projects is essential for Sempra's long-term resilience and ability to adapt to market demands. The company is also focused on sustainability and reducing greenhouse gas emissions, which aligns with its strategic adaptation to evolving regulatory environments and customer needs.

Sempra's liquidity is supported by cash flows from operations, unrestricted cash, and access to credit facilities, which are vital for maintaining operational continuity and funding capital expenditures. The company has mechanisms to recover credit losses, reflecting its preparedness for unexpected situations and the importance of maintaining stakeholder engagement. 

The impact of foreign currency and inflation rates on Sempra's results of operations underscores the complexities of managing financial resources in a turbulent market environment. The companyâ€™s ability to absorb strain and preserve functioning despite adversity is further demonstrated through its strategic planning and proactive measures in response to potential disruptions. Sempra's commitment to organizational resilience is evident in its focus on collaborative networks and inter-organizational collaboration, which enhance its capacity to confront challenges and ensure long-term success. 

Overall, Sempra's operational strategies and financial management practices are designed to foster resilience, adaptability, and a competitive advantage in the energy infrastructure sector, ensuring that it can navigate the complexities of the business environment effectively.

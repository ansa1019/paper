In fiscal 2023, we continued to promote adoption of our most predictive scores, including the fico® resilience index, which identifies consumers who are more resilient to economic stress relative to other consumers within the same fico score bands. Our strategic focus has led us to exit non-strategic products and services in the past few years, allowing us to dedicate our resources to expanding the capabilities and market penetration of the fico® platform. We also continued our transition from private data centers to external service providers to host our technology infrastructure, enhancing our operational flexibility. The increase in our on-premises and saas software revenue was primarily attributable to an increase in revenue recognized over the contract term largely driven by saas growth, indicating our ability to adapt to changing market conditions.

The fiscal 2023 over 2022 increase in cost of revenues was primarily attributable to a rise in personnel and labor costs, which underscores our commitment to maintaining service innovation and operational effectiveness.

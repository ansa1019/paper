The preparation of consolidated financial statements and related disclosures requires us to make judgments, assumptions, and estimates that affect the amounts reported, which are based on current facts, historical experience, and various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis, which reflects our ability to absorb strain and preserve functioning despite the presence of adversity. Our self-storage operations generate most of our net income, and our earnings growth is impacted by the levels of growth within our same store facilities as well as within our acquired facilities and newly developed and expanded facilities. We have grown and plan to continue to grow through the acquisition and development of new facilities and expansion of our existing self-storage facilities. We have implemented various initiatives to manage adverse impacts, such as enhancements in operational processes and investments in technology to reduce payroll hours, which demonstrates our operational flexibility and adaptability under changing conditions. To enhance the competitive position of certain of our facilities, we have embarked on a multi-year property program to upgrade the configuration and layout of the offices and other customer zones to improve the customer experience, which is a strategic initiative aimed at maintaining organizational health and performance. We expect to complete this program in 2024, reflecting our commitment to future planning and resilience strategies. The increase in net operating income for our non-same store facilities is due primarily to the impact of facilities acquired in recent years and the fill-up of recently developed and expanded facilities, indicating our ability to reconfigure and adapt to market demands. We have also embarked on a solar program to install solar panels on our self-storage facilities, which aligns with our sustainability objectives and resource generation strategies. Our operating results indicate that we are capable of maintaining performance under pressure, as evidenced by the increase in revenues generated by our same store facilities despite fluctuations in occupancy levels. We regularly adjust rental rates and promotional discounts to maximize revenue from new tenants, demonstrating our proactive measures in response to market conditions. The increase in marketing expenses reflects our strategic response to support move-in volumes, which is essential for organizational survival in a competitive landscape. Our financial flexibility allows us to adapt to changing conditions and opportunities, with significant access to sources of capital including debt and preferred equity. We believe that our cash provided by operating activities will continue to be sufficient to meet our ongoing cash requirements, which is critical for maintaining operational continuity and resilience in the face of potential future challenges. Overall, our strategic management practices, including risk assessment and resource allocation, contribute to our organizational resilience and ability to thrive in turbulent markets.

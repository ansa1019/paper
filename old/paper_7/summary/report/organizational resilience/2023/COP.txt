ConocoPhillips anticipates that commodity prices will continue to be cyclical and volatile, and a successful business strategy in the exploration and production industry must be resilient in lower price environments while also retaining upside during periods of higher prices. The company remains committed to its disciplined investment framework and continually monitors market fundamentals, including geopolitical tensions and conflicts, global demand for products, and supply chain disruptions. ConocoPhillips believes that maintaining balance sheet strength is a strategic asset that provides flexibility through price cycles, and the company strives to maintain its 'A'-rating. The foundational principles guiding the company include maintaining balance sheet strength, providing peer-leading distributions, making disciplined investments, and demonstrating responsible and reliable ESG performance, all of which support strong financial returns and mitigate uncertainty associated with volatile commodity prices. The company’s triple mandate represents its commitment to create long-term value for stakeholders by responsibly meeting energy transition pathway demand, delivering competitive returns on and of capital, and achieving net-zero operational emissions ambition. The energy industry has historically been subject to volatility in commodity prices, which fluctuate with the global economy's supply and demand for energy. ConocoPhillips' operational strategies focus on safely executing the business, achieving record production, and reaching key operational milestones in various international projects. The company’s operational flexibility is evident in its ability to adapt to changing market conditions and its commitment to optimizing its portfolio by directing capital towards the most competitive investments. The company’s approach to capital discipline involves controlling costs and ensuring that investments are sufficient to sustain production throughout price cycles. The strategic debt refinancing completed in 2023 extended the weighted average maturity of the company’s portfolio and reduced near-term debt maturities, further enhancing its resilience. ConocoPhillips recognizes the importance of environmental, social, and governance performance and has adopted a climate risk framework that includes an ambition to achieve net-zero scope 1 and 2 emissions by 2050. The company’s climate risk strategy aims to manage climate-related risks, optimize opportunities, and respond to changes in key uncertainties, including government policies, technologies for emissions reduction, and changes in consumer trends. The company’s commitment to building a resilient asset portfolio focuses on low cost of supply and low greenhouse gas intensity to meet transition pathway energy demand. ConocoPhillips continues to evaluate its assets to optimize capital allocation and enhance its ability to respond to environmental disruptions and operational challenges. The company’s strategic initiatives emphasize the importance of inter-organizational collaboration and stakeholder engagement to navigate complex situations and maintain operational continuity.

We manage our company for the long term, focusing on the fundamentals of growing customers, loans, deposits, and revenue while improving profitability and managing risk, expenses, and capital. Our approach is concentrated on organically growing and deepening client relationships across our businesses that meet our risk/return measures. We face a variety of risks that may impact various aspects of our risk profile from time to time, including operational risks related to new products and services, changes in processes and procedures, or the implementation of new technology. Our success will depend upon effectively managing capital and liquidity, prudent liquidity and capital management to meet evolving regulatory standards, and our ability to manage operational risks. We strive to maintain strong capital and liquidity positions, which are essential for resilience in the face of economic conditions and external pressures. Our capital and liquidity priorities support customers, fund business investments, and return excess capital to shareholders while maintaining appropriate capital and liquidity in light of economic conditions. We have a strong risk culture that helps ensure individuals conform to established protocols, reducing the potential for errors and enhancing our operational resilience. Our enterprise risk management framework is designed to help manage risks inherent in our business, including credit, market, liquidity, and operational risks. We utilize various tools and methodologies to identify, assess, and manage risks, ensuring that we can respond effectively to unexpected situations and maintain operational continuity. Additionally, we monitor our liquidity through early warning indicators and perform internal liquidity stress tests to ensure we can meet our obligations under both normal and stressful circumstances. Our operational risk management framework includes a systematic approach to identifying and managing risks associated with inadequate or failed internal processes, human errors, or adverse external events. We emphasize the importance of business continuity and have developed a contingency funding plan to address potential liquidity stress events. Our ability to adapt to changing market conditions and customer needs is critical for maintaining organizational health and effectiveness. We also recognize the importance of inter-organizational collaboration and strategic initiatives to enhance our resilience strategies. Our focus on operational flexibility and strategic adaptation allows us to confront challenges and leverage opportunities for growth. We continuously evaluate and enhance our risk management practices to ensure they align with our organizational objectives and the evolving regulatory landscape. Our proactive measures and strategic foresight enable us to navigate complex situations and maintain performance under pressure, ultimately contributing to our organizational resilience and long-term success.

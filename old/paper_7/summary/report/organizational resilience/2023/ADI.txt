During fiscal 2023, we invested to enhance our global resiliency, which is critical for maintaining operational continuity and adapting to external pressures. Our commitment to research and development is essential to maintain product leadership and to provide innovative new product offerings, reflecting our strategic initiatives aimed at fostering organizational resilience. The Q4 2023 plan, which includes voluntary and involuntary reductions-in-force and other cost-savings initiatives, was commenced to adjust our cost structure and business activities to better align with weaker market demand and continued economic uncertainty in our end markets, demonstrating our ability to reconfigure operations in response to disruptive events. We believe that our existing sources of liquidity and cash expected to be generated from future operations will be sufficient to fund operations and capital expenditures in the immediate future, which supports our resilience strategies. Our inventory levels are impacted by our need to support forecasted sales demand and variations between those forecasts and actual demand, illustrating our operational flexibility in managing resources under varying conditions. The decrease in accounts receivable was primarily due to variations in the timing of collections and billings, which reflects our adaptability to changes in market conditions. We have established a commercial paper program to issue short-term, unsecured commercial paper notes, which enhances our financial resources and supports our strategic response to market volatility. Our assessment of goodwill for impairment includes evaluating factors such as market conditions and operational performance, which is crucial for maintaining organizational health and effectiveness. The ongoing evaluation of our long-lived assets and the recognition of impairment when necessary reflects our proactive measures to ensure organizational strength and resilience against future uncertainties. Our approach to risk management includes assessing the likelihood of realization of deferred tax assets and recording a corresponding valuation allowance as necessary, which is vital for our financial stability. We regularly hedge our non-U.S. dollar-based exposures to mitigate foreign currency risk, which is part of our broader strategy to manage external disturbances and ensure operational coherence. We monitor our cash and cash equivalents closely to minimize credit risk and ensure sufficient liquidity, which is essential for sustaining our operations during adverse conditions. The increase in gross margin percentage was partially offset by lower utilization of our factories due to decreasing customer demand, highlighting the need for continuous adaptation to market dynamics. Our strategic planning includes future-oriented assessments of market conditions and operational capabilities, which are integral to our resilience in a turbulent business environment. We remain committed to fostering a culture of learning and innovation, which is fundamental to our organizational evolution and success in navigating complex situations.

Our financial condition for 2023 reflects strong operating results, with market rents continuing to grow in most global logistics markets, which, along with our existing lease mark-to-market, drove significant rent change on rollover and same-store growth in our operating portfolio. We believe we are well positioned to organically grow revenues over the long term given the cumulative growth in market rents over the last several years and our existing high lease mark-to-market. While uncertainties remain in the economic and geopolitical environment, our results are indicative of the resilience strategies we have implemented to maintain operational flexibility and adaptability under challenging conditions. Our total available liquidity of $6.0 billion, including borrowing capacity on our credit facilities, supports our ability to respond effectively to external pressures and environmental disruptions. We completed significant acquisition activities, including a $3.1 billion real estate portfolio acquisition, which enhances our resource allocation and operational management capabilities. The change in net operating income from our real estate segment was influenced by acquisition activity and positive rental rate growth, demonstrating our capacity to absorb strain and preserve functioning despite adversity. Our strategic capital segment revenues fluctuate due to changes in the size of portfolios through acquisitions and dispositions, reflecting our organizational agility in navigating complex situations. We allocate costs based on the square footage of relative portfolios, which supports our operational continuity and resource management. The increase in general and administrative expenses was driven by inflationary pressures and the expansion of our initiatives, indicating our commitment to maintaining organizational health. Our development portfolio, expected to be completed before July 2026, reflects our proactive measures in managing future planning and resource needs. We also recognize the importance of stakeholder engagement and inter-organizational collaboration in enhancing our resilience and performance under pressure. Our financing activities, including the amendment of our global senior credit facility, have strengthened our financial resources, allowing us to manage debt maturities effectively. The ability to generate cash from operating activities and distributions from co-investment ventures is crucial for meeting anticipated future development and acquisition requirements. We maintain a focus on strategic adaptation and transformation to confront market volatility and ensure organizational survival. Our investments in energy assets and sustainable building features demonstrate our commitment to long-term resilience and operational effectiveness. The management of our unconsolidated co-investment ventures emphasizes our focus on maintaining sufficient liquidity and adapting to changing market conditions. Our approach to risk management and resource deployment is designed to enhance our organizational capabilities and ensure we can navigate future uncertainties while continuing to deliver value to our stakeholders.

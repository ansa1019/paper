Becton, Dickinson and Company ("BD") is focused on creating more resilient operations through investments in an enterprise-wide renewable energy strategy. The company continues to pursue growth opportunities in emerging markets, which include regions with expanding healthcare systems. BD's strategic objectives emphasize delivering durable growth, creating shareholder value, and making appropriate investments for the future, which are anchored in the pillars of grow, simplify, and empower. The management team aligns the operating model and investments with these strategic pillars, focusing on developing and maintaining a strong portfolio of leading products and solutions that address significant unmet clinical needs, improve outcomes, and reduce costs. This includes investing in research and development that leads to innovation and expanding category leadership, as well as accelerating innovation in smart devices, robotics, analytics, and artificial intelligence to enable new care settings and streamline workflows. The company is also focused on cash management and an efficient capital structure to drive balance sheet productivity and strong shareholder returns. BD's operations, supply chain, suppliers, and customers are exposed to various global macroeconomic factors, including inflation, labor shortages, and geopolitical conditions, which may impact demand for products and services. The company has been mitigating the impacts of these macroeconomic factors through strategies that leverage procurement, logistics, and manufacturing capabilities. However, there can be no assurance that BD will effectively mitigate these pressures in future periods, and an inability to offset these pressures could adversely impact results of operations. The transition of healthcare delivery from acute to non-acute settings has increased financial pressure on hospitals and the broader healthcare system, which may lead healthcare institutions to take actions that could impact future demand for BD's products. The company continues to invest in geographic expansion and new product programs to drive further revenue and profit growth, emphasizing the importance of operational flexibility and organizational effectiveness in sustaining long-term growth. BD's ability to adapt to environmental disruptions and maintain performance under pressure is critical to navigating the complexities of the healthcare landscape. The company recognizes the need for strategic initiatives that foster a purpose-driven culture, cultivate an inclusive work environment, and drive sustainability initiatives to support enterprise-wide collaboration. In assessing outcomes related to these strategies, management reviews forecast data and monthly actual results, considering trends related to key financial data, including gross profit margin and return on invested capital. The company's financial position remains strong, with cash flows from continuing operating activities totaling $2.990 billion in 2023, underscoring its capacity to invest in innovation and strategic acquisitions while maintaining operational continuity and resilience in the face of external pressures.

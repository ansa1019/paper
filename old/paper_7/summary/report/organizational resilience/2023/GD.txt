The coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic caused significant disruptions to national and global economies and government activities, including supply chain and staffing challenges. The disruptions caused by these events continue to impact global economies and businesses, highlighting the importance of organizational resilience in maintaining operational continuity. The primary impact on our business is supply chain challenges, including inflationary pressures, which have affected our ability to ramp up production in response to strong customer demand. In our aerospace segment, supply chain challenges have paced our ability to ramp up production and have caused out-of-sequence manufacturing, which increases costs and decreases operational efficiency. The COVID-19 pandemic resulted in supply chain challenges and impacted the regional availability of skilled labor, which we continue to experience, particularly in our marine systems segment. The Russia-Ukraine conflict and increased threat environment have created additional demand for our products and services, particularly in our combat systems segment. Our long-term outlook for our U.S. defense business is influenced by the U.S. military's funding priorities, the diversity of our programs and customers, our insight into customer requirements stemming from our incumbency on core programs, our ability to evolve our products to address a fast-changing threat environment, and our proven track record of successful contract execution. We believe agility is a key component of our capital deployment strategy as market conditions change over time. Our emphasis on cash flow generation, which is underpinned by an operating discipline focused on cost control and working capital management, provides the flexibility for prudent capital deployment while preserving a strong balance sheet for future opportunities. We evaluate a variety of capital deployment options based on current market conditions and our long-term outlook. The increase in service revenue in 2023 was due to a higher volume of engineering work on the Columbia-class submarine program, increased demand for IT services, and additional aircraft maintenance work. The marine systems segment's backlog consists of very long-term submarine and surface ship construction programs, as well as numerous engineering and repair contracts, which are essential for maintaining operational resilience. Significant contract awards in the marine systems segment during 2023 included lead yard services and development studies, which support maintenance availabilities for Virginia-class submarines. The combat systems segment's backlog consists of a mix of U.S. and international combat vehicles, weapons systems, and munitions programs, which are critical for responding to evolving defense needs. Our total backlog, including funded and unfunded portions, was $93.6 billion on December 31, 2023, compared to $91.1 billion at the end of 2022, reflecting our ability to adapt to changing market demands. The technologies segment's backlog consists of thousands of contracts and task orders across a mix of U.S. and non-U.S. government and commercial customers, indicating a robust response mechanism to market volatility. We recognize that the actual amount of funding received in the future may be higher or lower than our estimate of potential contract value, emphasizing the need for effective risk management and adaptability in our organizational practices.

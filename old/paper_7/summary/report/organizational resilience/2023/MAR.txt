We are a worldwide operator, franchisor, and licensor of hotel, residential, timeshare, and other lodging properties in 139 countries and territories under more than 30 brand names. Under our asset-light business model, we typically manage or franchise hotels, rather than own them. Our operations reflect a focus on performance maintenance and operational flexibility, which are critical for adapting to external pressures and environmental disruptions. We discuss our operations in the following reportable business segments: U.S. & Canada and International. In January 2024, we modified our segment structure as a result of a change in the way management intends to evaluate results and allocate resources within the company. Our performance measures, including revenue per available room (RevPAR), occupancy, and average daily rate (ADR), are meaningful indicators of our operational effectiveness and resilience, as they reflect our ability to maintain performance under pressure. We saw strong global RevPAR improvement throughout 2023 compared to 2022, driven by strengthening demand and operational adjustments in response to market conditions. The increase in RevPAR was indicative of our adaptability and resource allocation strategies, which enabled us to confront and benefit from sudden disruptive changes. We expect to incur ongoing legal and other expenses associated with the data security incident, which underscores the importance of risk management and crisis response mechanisms in maintaining organizational health. Our system grew from 8,288 properties at year-end 2022 to 8,785 properties at year-end 2023, reflecting our strategic initiatives for growth and resilience in a turbulent market. The increase in properties and rooms in our development pipeline demonstrates our commitment to resource generation and operational continuity, even amidst external disturbances. We monitor the status of the capital markets and regularly evaluate the effect that changes in capital market conditions may have on our ability to fund our liquidity needs, which is essential for sustaining organizational resilience. Our anticipated capital expenditures include significant investments in technology systems transformation, which are expected to enhance our operational management and adaptability to future challenges. We have made, and expect to continue making, selective and opportunistic investments to add units to our lodging business, which may include property acquisitions and renovations. Our long-term financial objectives include maintaining diversified financing sources and optimizing the mix and maturity of our long-term debt, which are critical for ensuring organizational survival and resilience. We believe the credit facility, and our access to capital markets, together with cash we expect to generate from operations, remain adequate to meet our liquidity requirements. The ability of third-party purchasers to raise the debt and equity capital necessary to acquire properties depends in part on the perceived risks in the lodging industry, highlighting the importance of strategic foresight and stakeholder engagement in our operational practices.

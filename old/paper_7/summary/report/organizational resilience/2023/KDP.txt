This annual report on Form 10-K discusses the uncertainties and trends affecting our business, which include inflation in input costs, logistics, manufacturing, and labor costs, creating headwinds that may continue into 2024. The impact of these inflationary pressures has led to increased pricing on several products across our portfolio, which may result in a reduction of volume or net sales, potentially impacting our margins and operating results. We believe our financial condition and liquidity remain strong, and we continue to manage all aspects of our business, including monitoring the financial health of our customers, suppliers, and other third-party relationships. We are implementing cost management strategies through productivity initiatives and developing new opportunities for growth such as innovation and strategic partnerships that are accretive to our portfolio. Our integrated business model enables us to be more flexible and responsive to the changing needs of our large retail customers, allowing us to leverage our scale and reduce costs by creating greater geographic manufacturing and distribution coverage. We have revised our segment structure to align with how our Chief Operating Decision Maker manages the business, assesses performance, and allocates resources, reflecting our adaptability to internal and external variations. The strategic partnership with Grupo Pisa is expected to enhance our distribution capabilities and respond effectively to market demands. We recognize the importance of operational flexibility and resource allocation in maintaining performance under pressure, particularly in light of environmental disruptions and market volatility. Our cash conversion cycle has been optimized through efforts to improve cash flow and related liquidity, including adjustments in payment terms with suppliers. We are committed to investing in state-of-the-art manufacturing and warehousing facilities to optimize our supply chain network, which is crucial for maintaining operational continuity and resilience. We also focus on risk management strategies to mitigate potential adverse impacts from external disturbances. Our ability to adapt and reconfigure our operations in response to unexpected situations is vital for sustaining organizational health and achieving our major objectives. The ongoing assessment of our operational resources and strategic initiatives is essential for fostering organizational effectiveness and ensuring long-term growth. We continue to engage in inter-organizational collaboration and stakeholder engagement to enhance our resilience strategies and mechanisms, which are critical for navigating complex situations and ensuring organizational survival in turbulent markets.

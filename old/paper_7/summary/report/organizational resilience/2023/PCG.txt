PG&E Corporation and the utility believe that their financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows may be materially affected by uncertainties in connection with wildfires, wildfire mitigation, and associated cost recovery. In response to the wildfire threat facing California, PG&E Corporation and the utility have taken aggressive steps to mitigate the threat of catastrophic wildfires. The utility's wildfire mitigation initiatives include vegetation management, asset inspections, and system hardening. The success of these efforts depends on various factors, including the utility's ability to retain or contract for the workforce necessary to execute its wildfire mitigation actions. The utility is subject to a number of legal and regulatory requirements related to its wildfire mitigation efforts, which require periodic inspections of electric assets and ongoing reporting related to this work. Despite extensive measures, the potential that the utility's equipment will be involved in the ignition of future wildfires remains significant, attributable to various factors including climate conditions and infrastructure. The financial impact of past wildfires is substantial, with recorded aggregate liabilities for claims in connection with several significant fires. PG&E Corporation and the utility may mitigate future financial impacts through the wildfire fund or cost recovery through rates, though these mitigations involve uncertainties. The utility's ability to recover expenditures and other potential costs through rates is uncertain, and additional requirements could have a substantial impact on costs. The utility's operational flexibility is critical as it navigates the complexities of regulatory compliance and the financial implications of wildfire-related liabilities. The utility's ability to manage costs within authorized recovery amounts is essential to its financial health. The utility's capital investments aim to meet safety and climate goals while achieving operating cost savings through improved planning and execution. The utility's cash flows from operating activities are expected to be influenced by various factors, including the timing and amount of costs related to past wildfires and the potential for recovery through insurance and regulatory processes. The utility's future cash flows will also be affected by the timing and outcomes of pending regulatory proceedings, which may impact its business profile and financial results. The utility's extensive operating and security procedures are designed to assure safe operations and minimize the occurrence of unplanned outages. The utility has developed systemic corrective actions to address errors in inspections and maintenance of electric assets, which are critical for maintaining operational integrity and performance under challenging conditions. The utility's participation in the wildfire fund is contingent upon its ability to demonstrate that wildfire-related costs were just and reasonable, reflecting a strategic response to external pressures and risks. The utility's ongoing efforts to enhance its organizational resilience are evident in its commitment to adapt and respond to environmental disruptions and regulatory requirements, ensuring operational continuity and the maintenance of positive adjustment under adversity.

We have experienced significant costs, liabilities, fines, and penalties related to an incident that occurred in the first quarter, which may have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, or liquidity. The incident has resulted in numerous legal, regulatory, legislative, and other proceedings, including investigations and lawsuits, which could negatively impact our operational flexibility and ability to respond effectively to environmental disruptions. Our inability to comply with new or additional laws, regulations, or operating protocols resulting from the incident may have a material adverse effect on our operations. We are addressing multiple governmental actions as a result of the incident, which could impact our operational continuity and business resilience. The incident has heightened our awareness of the need for effective crisis management and emergency management strategies to maintain organizational health and performance under pressure. Additionally, we have incurred significant costs related to environmental cleanup and remediation efforts, which reflect our commitment to operational resilience and recovery from disruptive events. 

Our financial results were impacted by lower revenues and higher non-incident-related operating expenses, which were driven by inflationary pressures and investments in operational resiliency. The decline in net income and diluted earnings per share also reflects the absence of a prior year deferred tax benefit, which underscores the variability and unpredictability inherent in our operational environment. We face risks from supply chain constraints and the operational impacts of severe weather, which could further challenge our adaptability and resource allocation strategies. The potential for increased regulatory scrutiny and operational changes resulting from the incident may require us to reconfigure our operational practices and enhance our strategic response capabilities.

We recognize the importance of maintaining a functioning global supply chain and collaborative relationships with connecting carriers, as deterioration in these areas could adversely affect our ability to meet customer demands. Our ability to attract and retain skilled employees is critical to our operational effectiveness, and any disruptions in workforce availability could significantly impact our business operations. The ongoing challenges presented by climate change and severe weather conditions necessitate a proactive approach to risk assessment and resource management to ensure organizational survival and success. 

Our investments in technology and infrastructure are aimed at enhancing our operational resilience and agility in the face of future uncertainties. The need for continuous improvement in our organizational practices and the development of strategic tools to manage risks effectively is paramount. We are committed to fostering a learning organization that embraces change management and strategic foresight to navigate the complexities of the competitive landscape. As we move forward, our focus will remain on strengthening our organizational capabilities and ensuring that we are well-prepared to confront unexpected situations and environmental perturbations.

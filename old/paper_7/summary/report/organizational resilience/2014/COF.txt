Management monitors a variety of key indicators to evaluate our business results and financial condition, focusing on changes from year to year in certain key measures used by management to evaluate performance, such as profitability, growth, and credit quality metrics. We remain focused on creating value and sustained performance, which is essential for maintaining operational flexibility and adapting to unexpected situations. Our strategies and actions are designed to deliver and sustain strong returns and capital generation through the acquisition and retention of franchise-enhancing customer relationships across our businesses. We believe that franchise-enhancing customer relationships create and sustain significant long-term value through low risk-adjusted credit costs and loyal customer relationships. We continue to deliver risk-adjusted returns while investing to improve profitability, which reflects our commitment to resilience strategies in the face of external pressures and environmental perturbations. 

In 2014, our net income increased, driven by a combination of factors including lower funding costs and an increase in net interest income due to growth in our credit card and commercial loan portfolios. The allowance for loan and lease losses increased, primarily driven by loan growth in our domestic card, auto, and commercial loan portfolios, alongside portfolio-specific risks. We maintain an allowance for loan and lease losses that represents management's estimate of incurred loan and lease losses inherent in our held-for-investment credit card, consumer banking, and commercial banking loan portfolios. 

Our operational management practices are designed to ensure we have sufficient asset-based liquidity to withstand potential impacts from deposit attrition or diminished liquidity in the funding markets. We have established liquidity practices that include maintaining an adequate liquidity reserve to cover our funding requirements and potential deposit run-off. The chief risk officer, in conjunction with the chief market and liquidity risk officer, is responsible for the establishment of liquidity risk management policies and standards for governance and monitoring of liquidity risk at a corporate level. 

We recognize that compliance requirements for financial institutions are increasingly complex, and we continuously evaluate the regulatory environment to proactively adjust our compliance risk program. The chief compliance officer is responsible for establishing and overseeing our compliance risk management program, which includes regular compliance reporting to senior business leaders and the board of directors. 

Our credit risk management practices ensure our credit portfolio is resilient to economic downturns, employing sound underwriting and continuous monitoring of our portfolio. The chief risk officer, along with the consumer and commercial chief credit officers, establishes credit risk policies and procedures, including underwriting and hold guidelines. We utilize a variety of quantitative and qualitative factors to manage credit risk, including setting credit risk limits and guidelines for each of our lines of business. 

The ability to foresee and adapt to changing market conditions is critical for organizational resilience, and our comprehensive risk framework supports this adaptability by integrating governance processes, risk appetites, and effective challenge mechanisms across all levels of the organization.

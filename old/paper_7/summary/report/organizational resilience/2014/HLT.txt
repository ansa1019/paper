Hilton is one of the largest and fastest-growing hospitality companies globally, with a significant presence in 94 countries and territories. The company emphasizes its ability to adapt and respond effectively to environmental disruptions, which is crucial for maintaining operational continuity and performance under pressure. The management and franchise segment generates revenue through hotel management and licensing of brands, demonstrating operational flexibility and strategic initiatives that support business continuity. The company evaluates the economic viability of new hotels before adding them to its development pipeline, ensuring resource allocation aligns with major objectives and competitive advantage. 

Hilton's growth strategy includes expanding its development pipeline, with a focus on increasing the number of management and franchise agreements, which enhances resource generation and operational resilience. The company has a robust customer loyalty program, Hilton Honors, which reflects its commitment to understanding customer needs and adapting to market demands. The introduction of new brands, such as Canopy by Hilton and Curio, illustrates Hilton's proactive measures in service innovation and strategic adaptation to changing market conditions.

Therefore, Hilton employs risk management strategies to mitigate potential adverse effects on its operations. The organization maintains a focus on performance maintenance and operational effectiveness, which are essential for thriving in turbulent markets. 

Hilton's financial performance is closely tied to its ability to manage fixed expenses and respond to fluctuations in consumer demand.

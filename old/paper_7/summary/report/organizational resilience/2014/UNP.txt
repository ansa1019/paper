The railroad, along with its subsidiaries and rail affiliates, is our one reportable business segment. We continued focusing on safety to reduce risk and eliminate incidents for our employees, customers, and the public. Our safety initiatives and employee engagement efforts demonstrate our commitment to maintaining operational integrity under challenging conditions. We will continue using a multi-faceted approach to safety, utilizing technology, risk assessment, quality control, training, and targeted capital investments. In 2015, we will continue to add resources to support growth, improve service, and replenish our surge capability, which reflects our operational flexibility and adaptability in response to environmental perturbations. Our capital plan is a critical component of our long-term strategic plan, which aims to enhance the long-term value of the company by providing sufficient resources to replace and improve existing capital assets, increase network efficiency, and meet customer demand. We expect to use 55% to 60% of our capital investments to renew and improve existing capital assets. The ability to manage our financial resources effectively is essential for maintaining operational continuity and resilience in the face of market volatility. Our operating ratio improved to a record low of 63.5% in 2014, driven by core pricing, business demand, and productivity, which more than offset the incremental operating costs associated with a slower network and inflation. We recognize the importance of strategic initiatives and resource allocation in achieving our major objectives and sustaining performance under pressure. Our free cash flow is defined as cash provided by operating activities less cash used in investing activities and dividends paid, which is crucial for evaluating our financial performance and ability to generate cash without additional external financing. We believe that our ability to absorb strain and preserve functioning despite adversity is reflected in our operational management and strategic response to disruptions. Our ongoing productivity initiatives and the ability to leverage our resources will enhance the fluidity of our network, which is vital for maintaining organizational health and effectiveness. The challenges posed by fluctuating fuel prices and environmental disruptions require us to remain agile and responsive, ensuring that we can confront unexpected situations while sustaining our competitive advantage. We are committed to continuous improvement in our operational practices, which will enable us to adapt to complex situations and achieve organizational success. Our focus on safety, resource management, and strategic foresight will support our resilience strategies, allowing us to navigate future uncertainties and maintain a positive adjustment under challenging conditions.

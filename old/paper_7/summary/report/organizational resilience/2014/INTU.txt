Our growth strategy depends upon our ability to initiate and embrace disruptive technology trends, to enter new markets, and to drive broad adoption of the products and services we develop and market. The ongoing operation and availability of our information technology and communication systems and those of our external service providers is becoming increasingly important. We are investing significant management attention and resources in our information technology infrastructure and in our privacy and security capabilities. The industry in which we operate is dynamic and highly competitive, characterized by rapid technological change, shifting customer needs, and frequent new product introductions and enhancements. Our strategic focus on connected services reflects our adaptability to these changes. We believe that providing more frequent releases will create a better experience for customers who choose our desktop offerings, as well as a more seamless transition to our online offerings in the future. Our business is subject to significant seasonality, and we believe the seasonality of our business is likely to continue in the future. We expect to return excess cash generated by operations to our stockholders through repurchases of our common stock and payment of cash dividends, after taking into account our operating and strategic cash needs. We have historically generated significant cash from operations and we expect to continue to do so during fiscal 2015. Our strong liquidity profile enables us to respond nimbly to opportunities, which is critical for maintaining operational flexibility. We monitor counterparty risk associated with our institutional lenders and believe that our credit facility will be available should we choose to borrow under it. We assess the need for an adjustment to our valuation allowance for deferred tax assets on a quarterly basis, based on our estimates of future sources of taxable income. Our future growth increasingly depends on the strength of our third-party business relationships and our ability to continue to develop, maintain, and strengthen new and existing relationships. We are focused on enhancing our quickbooks online and quickbooks desktop subscription offerings, which reflects our commitment to resource allocation toward innovation and service enhancement. The transition to more connected services is a primary driver of our strategies, indicating our proactive measures to adapt to market demands. We have included the results of operations for acquired companies in our consolidated results from the date of acquisition, demonstrating our strategic response to market opportunities. Our operational management is characterized by a focus on performance maintenance and the effective deployment of resources to navigate environmental perturbations. We are committed to investing significant resources in our product development, marketing, and sales capabilities to ensure we remain competitive. The ability to absorb strain and preserve or improve functioning despite adversity is integral to our organizational resilience. We believe that an understanding of industry trends is important in order to understand our financial results and future prospects. We expect connected services revenue as a percentage of our total revenue to continue to grow, reflecting our adaptability to changing market conditions and customer needs.

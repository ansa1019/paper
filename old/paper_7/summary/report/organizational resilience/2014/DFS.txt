The discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements. Our business activities are funded primarily through consumer deposits, securitization of loan receivables, and the issuance of unsecured debt. We anticipate that investments in marketing and changes to simplify and ease reward redemption will contribute to new card account growth and wallet share gains with existing customers. We expect operating expenses to increase in 2015, primarily due to planned marketing, technology, and infrastructure investments, as well as increased legal, regulatory, and compliance costs. We continue to face substantial competition in the payments industry, which impacts our revenue margins, transaction volume, and business strategies. Despite these challenges, we leverage our network to support our card-issuing business. The evolving regulatory environment may require us to limit or change our business practices, which could impact our strategies and the value of our assets. Our liquidity management practices position us well to comply with new regulatory standards, and we maintain a liquidity risk and funding management policy to manage liquidity risk across our businesses.

We are focused on deploying capital in a manner that provides attractive returns to our stockholders while meeting regulatory requirements. Our capital adequacy assessment includes tax and accounting considerations in accordance with regulatory guidance. We are subject to minimum capital requirements that, if not met, could limit our business activities. We utilize a measure called the number of months of pre-funding to determine the length of time we can meet upcoming funding obligations using existing cash resources. We maintain a diversified funding profile to support our business operations and repay or refinance our maturing obligations. Our strategic initiatives include enhancing our offerings to customers and targeting solid growth in our private student and personal loan portfolios. We continue to evaluate our home loans strategy and anticipate challenges in our payments business due to competitive pressures and changes in network relationships.

We are a global media and technology company with two primary businesses, Comcast Cable and NBCUniversal. Our cable communications segment generates revenue primarily from subscriptions to our cable services and the sale of advertising. We anticipate that our programming expenses will continue to increase, and we have and will continue to attempt to maintain a consistent operating margin in our cable communications segment through rate adjustments, the sale of additional cable services, and the continued growth of business services, as well as by achieving operating efficiencies. Our cable communications segment leverages our existing cable distribution system to grow revenue by adding new customers, encouraging existing customers to add new or higher-tier services, and expanding our other services such as business services and home security. We believe that adding more content and delivering it through an increasing variety of platforms will assist in attracting and retaining customers for our cable services. The deployment of our IP and cloud-enabled video platform, referred to as our X1 platform, and the launch of our cloud DVR technology are part of our strategic initiatives to enhance operational flexibility and adaptability. Our theme parks segment generates revenue primarily from theme park attendance and per capita spending, which depend heavily on the general environment for travel and tourism. The increase in revenue in our theme parks segment was primarily due to new attractions, which reflect our commitment to service innovation and operational continuity. Our businesses are subject to seasonal and cyclical variations, and we believe that enhancing our video and high-speed internet services will assist in maintaining performance under pressure. The competitive landscape is rapidly changing, and we face pressures from various competitors, including new companies that provide internet streaming and downloading of video programming. In response to these external pressures, we continue to invest in original programming and sports programming rights at both our cable networks and broadcast networks, as well as in new attractions at our theme parks. Our capital expenditures have increased due to investments in our X1 platform, cloud DVR technology, and the expansion of business services. We expect to continue to invest in existing and new attractions at our universal theme parks and to enhance our operational management strategies. Our ability to respond effectively to environmental disruptions and transform ourselves to emerge stronger from challenging situations is critical to our organizational resilience. We have established mechanisms for risk assessment and mitigation, which are essential for maintaining organizational health and performance. Our strategic response to competition and market volatility involves continuous adaptation and reconfiguration of our resources to meet customer needs and expectations. We believe that our focus on operational management, strategic adaptation, and resilience strategies will enable us to navigate complex situations and ensure our long-term success in a turbulent market environment.

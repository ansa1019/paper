We design, make and sell semiconductors to electronics designers and manufacturers all over the world. Our business model is carefully constructed around several advantages that are unique to TI, including the industry's broadest portfolio of differentiated analog and embedded processing semiconductors. This breadth allows us to solve more customer needs than our competitors, providing access to a larger customer base and the opportunity to generate more revenue per system. We invest more than $1 billion each year to develop new products for our portfolio, which reflects our commitment to innovation and adaptability in a competitive landscape. Our strong foundation of manufacturing technology and low-cost production enables us to directly control our manufacturing processes, ensuring a consistent supply of products for our customers and enhancing our operational flexibility. The diversity and longevity of our products and markets contribute to our resilience, as we are not dependent on any single product or application, which strengthens our organizational health and financial performance. We believe that our focus on analog and embedded processing semiconductors serves highly diverse markets with dependable long-term growth opportunities. Our business model allows us to generate strong cash flow from operations, which is a critical component of our organizational resilience. In 2014, we returned $4.2 billion of cash to investors through stock repurchases and dividends, demonstrating our ability to maintain performance under pressure and adapt to changing market conditions. Our segments represent groups of similar products, and we allocate resources based on design and development requirements, which supports our strategic initiatives and enhances our organizational effectiveness. The exit from legacy wireless products has allowed us to reallocate resources and improve profitability across our remaining product lines. Our revenue growth in analog and embedded processing reflects our capacity to absorb strain and preserve functioning despite external pressures. We have consistently achieved strong gross margins, which are indicative of our operational efficiency and strategic response to market demands. Our financial condition at the end of 2014 shows total cash of $3.54 billion, which provides a buffer against potential adverse conditions and supports our liquidity. We believe we have the necessary financial resources and operating plans to fund our working capital needs and other business requirements for at least the next 12 months, reflecting our preparedness for unexpected situations. Our approach to risk management includes monitoring collectability of accounts receivable and adjusting estimates as necessary, which demonstrates our proactive measures in maintaining organizational resilience. We recognize the importance of collaboration networks and stakeholder engagement in navigating complex situations and enhancing our organizational capabilities. Our ability to foresee and confront disruptive changes is integral to our survival and growth, ensuring that we can flourish even in turbulent markets.

In 2014, we announced a major company reorganization effective as of 1 October 2014, which is expected to enable us to reduce costs and more effectively manage and utilize our existing assets. The reorganization is part of our strategic initiatives aimed at improving operational flexibility and adapting to changing market conditions. We recorded a goodwill and intangible asset impairment charge driven by lower economic growth and profitability, which highlights the need for effective risk assessment and resource allocation in response to external pressures. Our focus on cash flow and the introduction of adjusted EBITDA as a non-GAAP metric reflects our commitment to maintaining performance under pressure and ensuring organizational health. The actions taken in response to business restructuring and cost reduction plans are anticipated to provide significant annual savings, demonstrating our ability to reconfigure resources and adapt to adversity. We have also emphasized the importance of strategic response mechanisms to confront unexpected situations, including the impacts of environmental disruptions and market volatility. Our operational management strategies include a focus on customer needs and the development of resilience strategies that foster collaboration networks and inter-organizational collaboration. The financial position remains strong, with cash flows from operations expected to meet liquidity needs, which is essential for sustaining organizational resilience amidst economic fluctuations. We continue to evaluate acquisition opportunities and investments in equity affiliates, which contribute to our organizational capabilities and long-term growth. The ongoing assessment of our operational resources and the strategic adaptation of our business practices are critical for navigating complex situations and ensuring organizational survival. The integration of technological advancements and the development of human capital are also pivotal in enhancing our organizational agility and fostering a learning organization. Our commitment to environmental matters and compliance with regulations reflects our proactive measures to mitigate risks associated with operational continuity. The companyâ€™s ability to absorb strain and maintain functioning during challenging conditions underscores our organizational resilience, as we strive to foresee and respond effectively to disruptive changes in the business environment. The emphasis on leadership and emotional resources within teams is vital for fostering a culture of adaptability and ensuring that we can flourish despite external disturbances. The strategic planning processes in place are designed to enhance our organizational foresight and prepare for future challenges, thereby reinforcing our competitive advantage in turbulent markets.

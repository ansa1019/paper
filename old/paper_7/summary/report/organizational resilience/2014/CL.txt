The company's funding-the-growth initiatives are designed to enhance operational effectiveness and efficiency, which are critical for maintaining performance under pressure and adapting to external pressures. The 2012 restructuring program is expected to enhance the company's global leadership positions and ensure sustained sales and earnings growth by simplifying and standardizing operations, optimizing supply chains, and expanding commercial hubs. The company is well-prepared to meet future challenges due to its strong financial condition and experience in navigating challenging environments. The strategic initiatives include engaging to build brands, innovation for growth, and leading to win, which collectively position the company to increase shareholder value over the long term. The company recognizes that the global macroeconomic and market conditions remain highly challenging, with heightened competitive activity and volatile foreign currency fluctuations. However, the company continues to implement measures to mitigate these effects and believes that its operational flexibility and strategic response mechanisms will support resilience in the face of adversity. The ability to adapt and reconfigure operations in response to unexpected situations is central to the company's strategy, as is the focus on maintaining organizational health and effectiveness through continuous improvement and learning processes. The company is committed to managing risks associated with economic conditions, foreign currency exchange rates, and political uncertainties, particularly in challenging markets like Venezuela. The ongoing impacts of these conditions necessitate a proactive approach to crisis management and operational continuity, ensuring that the company can maintain performance and achieve its major objectives despite external disturbances.

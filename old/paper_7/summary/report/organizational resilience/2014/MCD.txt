The strength of the alignment among the company, its franchisees and suppliers has been key to long-term success, enabling the identification, implementation, and scaling of ideas that meet customers' changing needs and preferences. The company believes that its strategic growth priorities align with evolving customer needs and, combined with competitive advantages of convenience, scale, geographic diversification, and system alignment, will enhance customer experience and build shareholder value over the long term. In 2014, unforeseen events and weak operating performance pressured results across geographic segments, reflecting the impact of soft comparable sales performance and cost pressures. The company anticipates that many challenges will persist, particularly in the first half of 2015, but remains focused on making decisions that benefit shareholders and the system. The U.S. segment is addressing menu, service, and value opportunities to enhance customer relevance and loyalty, with a focus on operational excellence and investments in digital platforms. In Europe, the company is pursuing customer-focused initiatives to deliver menu variety and value enhancements while optimizing the restaurant experience through technology. In the Asia/Pacific, Middle East, and Africa (APMEA) segment, the company is executing brand recovery efforts in response to food quality issues and is committed to ongoing restaurant expansion. The company’s unique business model and structure enable significant cash flow generation, providing flexibility to invest in critical growth initiatives while returning cash to shareholders. The company is committed to growing sustainably and making a positive difference in society by serving good food through good people and being a good neighbor in the communities it operates. The company is focused on enhancing the appeal of core products, addressing food perceptions, and engaging customers in transparent dialogue. It plans to redefine menu choice and personalization while investing in geographically diversified new restaurant development and reimaging existing locations. The company expects to prioritize spending on initiatives that elevate the McDonald's experience and drive long-term growth in sales and market share. The company’s cash flow from operations and access to credit provide the necessary resources to fund operating and discretionary spending. The company has established a three-year cash return target of $18 to $20 billion, based on significant free cash flow generated from operations and refranchising efforts. The company’s operational flexibility and strategic response to environmental disruptions are designed to maintain performance under pressure and ensure organizational resilience. The company’s commitment to adapting to changing market conditions and customer needs reflects its focus on organizational health and sustainability, ensuring its ability to confront and recover from challenges while pursuing growth opportunities.

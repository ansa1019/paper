Our company's goals are targeted at serving our customers, our employees, the environment, the communities in which we work, and our stockholders, and achievement of our goals is intended to meet the needs of a changing industry. We recognize the value of the traditional waste stream as a potential resource and aim to address and anticipate the evolving needs of our customers. We believe we are uniquely equipped to meet the challenges of the changing waste industry and our customers' waste management needs. As the waste industry leader, we have the expertise necessary to collect and handle our customers' waste efficiently and responsibly, maximizing resource value while minimizing environmental impact. Drawing on our resources and experience, we pursue projects and initiatives that benefit the waste industry, the customers and communities we serve, and the environment. We remain dedicated to providing long-term value to our stockholders by successfully executing our strategy to know and service our customers better than anyone in our industry, extract more value from the materials we manage, and innovate and optimize our business. We plan to accomplish our strategic goals through competitive advantages derived from a "best cost" structure achieved through operational improvements and differentiation in our industry. We recognize that we must grow the business and do so as efficiently and cost-effectively as possible. We believe that execution of our strategy through key priorities will drive continued financial performance and leadership in a dynamic industry. Our operational performance is continuously improved, and we focus on taking advantage of opportunities in our current business while considering attractive acquisition opportunities. We also aim to minimize both operating costs and selling, general, and administrative expenses. Our commitment to operational flexibility and strategic initiatives enables us to adapt to external pressures and environmental perturbations. We monitor emerging diversion technologies that may generate additional value and focus on improving existing diversion technologies. In pursuit of these long-term goals, we recognize the importance of resource allocation and the need for effective risk management strategies to mitigate potential disruptions. We anticipate that our focus on key priorities will translate into continued strong free cash flow to pay our dividends, repurchase shares, and make other growth investments while maintaining a strong balance sheet. Our restructuring efforts are aimed at consolidating and realigning corporate functions to support our strategic goals, including cost reduction. We believe that our ability to respond effectively to environmental disruptions and transform ourselves will allow us to emerge stronger from challenging situations. The recognition of impairment charges and the management of our landfill assets reflect our ongoing assessment of operational performance and resource management. We continuously evaluate opportunities associated with the sale or discontinued use of assets that may no longer meet our strategic objectives or are underperforming. Our liquidity and capital resources are monitored to plan for present needs and fund unbudgeted business activities that may arise due to changing business conditions or new opportunities. We are committed to providing our shareholders with a return on their investment through dividend payments and share repurchases, which are integral to our long-term strategy for organizational resilience.

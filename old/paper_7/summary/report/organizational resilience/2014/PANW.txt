Our management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations emphasizes the importance of maintaining operational flexibility and resilience in the face of external pressures and disruptive events. We believe that the growth of our business and our short-term and long-term success are dependent upon many factors, including our ability to extend our technology leadership, grow our base of end-customers, and focus on end-customer satisfaction. To manage any future growth effectively, we must continue to improve and expand our information technology and financial infrastructure, our operating and administrative systems and controls, and our ability to manage headcount, capital, and processes in an efficient manner. We face intense competition in our market, and to succeed, we need to innovate and offer products that are differentiated from existing infrastructure products. Our commitment to innovation and strengthening our product portfolio reflects our strategic initiatives aimed at enhancing organizational resilience. We continue to invest in research and development, which we expect to increase in absolute dollars as we support future product and service offerings. Our hybrid SaaS revenue model, which consists of product, subscriptions, and support and maintenance, enables us to benefit from recurring revenues and demonstrates our adaptability to changing market conditions. The growth in subscription services, which increased significantly, indicates our ability to respond effectively to customer needs and market demands. We monitor our deferred revenue balance as it represents a significant portion of future revenue, highlighting our focus on business continuity and operational effectiveness. The legal settlement with Juniper Networks allows us to further concentrate on innovating and strengthening our product portfolio, which is essential for sustaining growth and improving operating results. Our cash flow provided by operating activities is driven by sales of our products and subscriptions, enabling us to analyze our financial performance and manage cash needs effectively. We recognize that our future capital requirements will depend on various factors, including the timing and extent of spending to support development efforts and the introduction of new products and services. We have made significant investments in expanding our sales force and increasing our channel partners, which enhances our organizational capabilities and positions us to thrive in a competitive landscape. Our operational management strategies focus on ensuring access to adequate manufacturing capacity and maintaining strong relationships with our independent contract manufacturers, which are crucial for our resilience in production and supply chain management. We are committed to addressing challenges and risks to sustain our growth and improve our operating results, emphasizing our strategic response to environmental disruptions and our focus on organizational health and performance maintenance.

We are a diversified technology company that operates businesses designed to develop software and engineered products for various niche end markets, including healthcare, transportation, food, energy, water, education, and academic research. We pursue consistent and sustainable growth in earnings and cash flow by emphasizing continuous improvement in the operating performance of our existing businesses and by acquiring other carefully selected businesses. Our acquisitions have represented both additions to existing businesses and new strategic platforms. The development of accounting estimates is the responsibility of our management, which discusses areas requiring significant judgments with the audit committee of our board of directors. Our management believes the positions taken regarding uncertainties are reasonable, although they can change over time as more information becomes available. We regularly compare inventory quantities on hand against anticipated future usage to evaluate obsolescence and excessive quantities. The returns and other sales credit allowance is treated as a reduction in revenue, and we analyze histories to determine likely future rates for such credits. Our expense for warranty obligations was less than 1% of net sales for each of the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013, and 2012. In 2014, our effective income tax rate was 29.9%, which was higher than the 2013 rate due to an increase in revenues and resulting pretax income in higher tax jurisdictions. We expect the effective tax rate to increase in 2015 due to a continued increase in revenues. The assessment of fair value for impairment purposes requires significant judgments to be made by management. We evaluate whether there has been an impairment of identifiable intangible assets when certain indicators of impairment are present. The increase in cash provided by operating activities in 2014 was primarily due to increased earnings net of intangible amortization related to acquisitions. We believe that internally generated cash flows and the remaining availability under our credit facilities will be adequate to finance normal operating requirements and future acquisition activities. We anticipate that our businesses will generate positive cash flows from operating activities, which will permit the reduction of currently outstanding debt in accordance with the repayment schedule. Our total debt was $2.2 billion at December 31, 2014, which reflects a decrease due to debt payments made using cash from operations. We were in compliance with all debt covenants related to our credit facility throughout the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase in orders was due to internal growth and orders from acquisitions, indicating a response to market demands and pressures. We expect existing cash and cash equivalents, cash generated by our U.S. operations, and our expected ability to access capital markets will be sufficient to fund operating requirements in the U.S. for the foreseeable future. Our management discusses those areas that require significant judgments with the audit committee of our board of directors, indicating a structured approach to risk management and organizational resilience. The fair value of each of our reporting units was in excess of its carrying value, with no impairment indicated, reflecting our ability to maintain performance under pressure and adapt to changing market conditions.

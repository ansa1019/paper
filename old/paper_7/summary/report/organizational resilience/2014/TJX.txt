In fiscal 2015, we continued to generate strong cash flows, allowing us to return value to our shareholders through cash dividends and share repurchases, while continuing to reinvest in our business by adding new stores, remodeling existing ones, and strengthening our infrastructure to support our next level of growth. The increase in same store sales was driven by increases in the value of the average transaction and in customer traffic, reflecting our adaptability to market conditions. We believe unfavorable weather in many regions where we operate had a negative impact on sales during the first and fourth quarters of fiscal 2014, demonstrating the need for operational flexibility in response to environmental perturbations. Our segment profit margin increased due to expense leverage on same store sales, particularly buying and occupancy costs, indicating our capacity for performance maintenance under varying conditions. The improvement in segment margin was primarily due to an increase in merchandise margins and expense leverage on same store sales, reflecting our strategic initiatives to enhance organizational effectiveness. We expect to open approximately 70 new Marmaxx stores and increase selling square footage by approximately 3% in fiscal 2016, which underscores our commitment to future planning and growth. The increase in customer traffic and the value of the average transaction during fiscal 2015 highlights our ability to foresee and respond to customer needs effectively. In fiscal 2015, we repurchased 27.7 million shares of our common stock for $1.7 billion, reflecting our strategic response to maintain shareholder value amidst market fluctuations. We have reserves for probable losses arising from future obligations of former operations, which require us to make estimates and assumptions about costs and expenses, demonstrating our proactive measures in risk management. Our liquidity and capital resources are supported by cash generated from operations, supplemented as needed by short-term bank borrowings, indicating our resilience in managing financial resources. The change in merchandise inventory, net of the related change in accounts payable, resulted in a favorable impact on cash flows, driven by the timing of receipt and payment of merchandise purchases, showcasing our operational management capabilities. We classify a store as a new store until it meets the same store sales criteria, which reflects our structured approach to resource management and operational continuity. Our segment profit increased significantly, driven by expense leverage on strong same store sales, particularly in buying and occupancy costs, which illustrates our organizational strength in adapting to market demands. The increase in segment profit margin was largely due to the positive impact of the mark-to-market adjustment on inventory-related derivatives, indicating our strategic agility in navigating financial complexities. We expect to add approximately 50 stores in Europe and plan to increase selling square footage, which aligns with our future orientation and commitment to growth in turbulent markets. Our assessment of contingent liabilities involves significant judgment, reflecting our organizational dynamics in managing risk and uncertainty. Overall, our performance reflects a multifaceted approach to organizational resilience, characterized by adaptability, strategic foresight, and effective resource allocation amidst varying market conditions.

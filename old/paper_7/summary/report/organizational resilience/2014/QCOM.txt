In fiscal 2014, our business practices continued to be the subject of an investigation by the China National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC), which presents significant challenges to our operations in China. We believe that certain licensees in China currently are not fully complying with their contractual obligations to report their sales of licensed products to us, and that unlicensed companies may seek to delay execution of new licenses while the NDRC investigation is ongoing. We are taking steps to address these matters, although the nature and timing of any resolution is uncertain. Our results were negatively impacted by the challenges we are facing in China, which underscores the importance of adaptability and risk mitigation strategies in response to external pressures. We continue to invest significant resources toward advancements in 3G, 3G/4G multimode, and 4G LTE technologies, which reflects our commitment to innovation and operational flexibility in a competitive landscape. The transition of wireless networks and devices to 3G/4G continued around the world, with significant growth driven by shipments to key customers in emerging regions. Our LTE leadership position contributed to growth from regions adopting 3G/4G LTE multimode. We expect continued growth in consumer demand for 3G, 3G/4G multimode, and 4G products and services, driven primarily by smartphones. However, we also anticipate that varying rates of economic growth by region and stronger growth of device shipments in emerging regions compared to developed regions will continue to impact our business. Our strategic initiatives include pursuing various exit strategies for our Qualcomm Strategic Initiatives (QSI) investments, which are focused on opening new or expanding opportunities for our technologies. We believe that our current cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities, along with expected cash flow generated from operations, will satisfy our working and other capital requirements over the next fiscal year and beyond. Our research and development expenditures were significant, reflecting our focus on new technologies, applications, and services for voice and data communications. The increase in accounts receivable was primarily due to the effects of increased revenues related to integrated circuits and a receivable related to a dispute with a licensee, which illustrates the complexity of our operational environment. We continue to evaluate repurchases as a means of returning capital to stockholders, subject to our periodic determinations that repurchases are in the best interests of our stockholders. The anticipated acquisition of CSR plc is expected to enhance our capabilities and accelerate our presence in growth categories, demonstrating our strategic foresight and commitment to transformation in response to market demands. Our segment results indicate that we are navigating through challenges while maintaining a focus on performance maintenance and organizational effectiveness. The multifaceted nature of our business requires ongoing assessment of risks and opportunities, emphasizing the importance of resilience strategies and mechanisms to ensure operational continuity and adaptability in the face of adversity.

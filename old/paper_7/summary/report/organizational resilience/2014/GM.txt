In the three months ended March 31, 2014, we changed our managerial and financial reporting structure to enhance operational flexibility and adapt to evolving market conditions. Our strategic plan includes several major initiatives aimed at achieving 9% to 10% margins on an EBIT-adjusted basis by early next decade, emphasizing the importance of developing a strong product pipeline and institutionalizing operational excellence to maintain competitive advantage. We anticipate that our financial targets will improve due to an increase in global industry vehicle sales and a favorable mix of full-size SUVs and pick-up trucks, despite facing external pressures such as unfavorable foreign currency effects and higher marketing costs. Our European operations are benefiting from improved market share, driven by strategic actions including investments in our product portfolio and a revised brand strategy, which are essential for enhancing organizational resilience in a challenging economic environment. We continue to assess additional strategic actions across the region to address significant volume pricing and foreign exchange pressures, which may necessitate further restructuring or rationalization actions. The success of these actions will depend on our ability to execute effectively and adapt to external factors beyond our control. In the year ended December 31, 2014, we recorded significant charges related to recall campaigns, which underscored the importance of maintaining quality control and customer satisfaction as part of our organizational practices. We have initiated a comprehensive safety review and established a new global product integrity organization to enhance our crisis management capabilities and ensure operational continuity. Our restructuring activities, including the rationalization of our manufacturing footprint, are aimed at improving operational efficiency and addressing the challenges posed by fluctuating market conditions. We have also implemented measures to bolster our capacity for identifying potential emerging issues and conducting product investigations, which are critical for maintaining organizational health and resilience. Furthermore, we expect to increase our automotive available liquidity to support our strategic initiatives, including investments in new technology and enhancing our financing capabilities. Our ability to manage liquidity effectively is vital for sustaining operations and supporting growth in turbulent markets. The ongoing evaluation of our operational strategies and financial performance, including the impact of economic conditions and market volatility, will inform our future planning and resource allocation decisions. We remain committed to fostering a culture of learning and adaptability within the organization, which is essential for navigating complex situations and ensuring long-term success.

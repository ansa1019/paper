The company believes that its global presence is an important competitive advantage as it allows the company to provide quality products on a timely and worldwide basis to its multinational customers. The company focuses its research and development efforts through close collaboration with its OEM customers to develop highly-engineered products that meet customer needs and have the potential for broad market applications and significant sales within a one-to-three year period. The company’s strategy is to provide comprehensive design capabilities, a broad selection of products, and a high level of service on a worldwide basis while maintaining continuing programs of productivity improvement and cost control in the areas in which it competes. The company has focused its global resources to position itself to compete effectively in this environment, which reflects its adaptability and operational flexibility in response to external pressures. The company’s strategic objective is to further enhance its position in its served markets by pursuing broad diversification, developing performance-enhancing interconnect solutions, expanding global presence, controlling costs, pursuing strategic acquisitions and investments, and fostering collaborative, entrepreneurial management. The company has consistently generated cash, which is a fundamental financial strength that provides significant flexibility to meet its financial commitments. The ability to generate cash from operating activities is critical for maintaining operational continuity and supporting strategic initiatives. The company’s liquidity and capital resources are bolstered by cash flow provided by operating activities, which increased due to an increase in net income and a lower increase in the net components of working capital. The company’s sources of liquidity could be adversely affected by a decrease in demand for its products or a deterioration in certain financial ratios. However, management believes that the company’s cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investment position, along with its ability to generate strong cash flow from operations, will allow it to meet its obligations for the next twelve months. The company’s primary ongoing cash requirements will be for operating and capital expenditures, product development activities, repurchase of its common stock, funding of pension obligations, dividends, and debt service. The company’s debt financing includes the use of a commercial paper program, revolving credit facilities, and senior notes as part of its overall cash management strategy. The company regularly reviews its optimal mix of short-term and long-term debt and may replace certain amounts of commercial paper, short-term debt, and current maturities of long-term debt with new issuances of long-term debt in the future. The company has a history of borrowing funds domestically and continues to have the ability to borrow funds at reasonable interest rates. The company evaluates its tax positions and establishes liabilities for uncertain tax positions that may be challenged by local authorities. The company believes that its operations are currently in substantial compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations and that the costs of continuing compliance will not have a material effect on its financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. The company strives to offset the impact of increases in the cost of raw materials, labor, and services through price increases, productivity improvements, and cost-saving programs, reflecting its commitment to resilience in the face of economic pressures.

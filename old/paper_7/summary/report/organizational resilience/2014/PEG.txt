In our pursuit of operational excellence, financial strength, and disciplined investment, we closely monitor significant regulatory and legislative developments that could impact our business. Our business plan seeks to achieve growth while managing risks, focusing on operational excellence and financial strength. We continue to invest capital in transmission and distribution infrastructure projects aimed at maintaining the reliability of our service to customers. These investments have altered the business mix of our overall results of operations, reflecting a higher percentage contribution from our utility operations. We emphasize operational performance while developing opportunities in both our competitive and regulated businesses, allowing us to respond effectively to environmental disruptions and capitalize on opportunities as they arise. Our diverse fuel mix and dispatch flexibility have enabled us to generate significant electricity while addressing unit outages and balancing fuel availability and price volatility. 

We have begun work in our gas and electric distribution systems to improve resiliency, with the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities approving our Energy Strong proposal, which aims to enhance the reliability and efficiency of our systems. We expect our future success to depend on our ability to maintain strong operational and financial performance in a slow-moving economy and a cost-constrained environment. This includes successfully managing our energy obligations and executing our capital investment program, which enhances the resiliency of our infrastructure. 

Our operational flexibility has allowed us to adapt to market volatility and capitalize on opportunities, while our disciplined investment approach ensures that we deploy resources effectively. We advocate for measures that promote fair and efficient electricity markets, and we engage multiple stakeholders, including regulators and customers, to ensure our strategic initiatives align with external pressures and demands. 

We have also faced significant challenges due to severe weather conditions, which have underscored the importance of our resilience strategies. The impacts of these events have prompted us to reconfigure our operational practices and enhance our crisis management capabilities. Our focus on maintaining operational continuity and organizational effectiveness is critical to our ability to confront adversity and ensure organizational survival. 

In summary, our strategic response to external disturbances and operational challenges is guided by a commitment to organizational resilience, which encompasses our ability to absorb strain and preserve functioning despite adversity. Our proactive measures and future planning are essential in navigating complex situations and ensuring we remain adaptable in a rapidly changing business environment.

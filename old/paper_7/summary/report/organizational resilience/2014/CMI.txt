We are a global power leader that designs, manufactures, distributes, and services diesel and natural gas engines and engine-related component products. Our financial performance depends, in large part, on varying conditions in the markets we serve, particularly the on-highway, construction, and general industrial markets. Economic downturns in these markets generally result in reduced sales of our products and can result in price reductions in certain products and/or markets. Our geographic diversity and broad product and service offerings have helped limit the impact from a drop in demand in any one industry or customer or the economy of any single country on our consolidated results. Amid continued international economic uncertainty, our international revenues remained flat compared to prior periods. We expect the North American heavy-duty and medium-duty on-highway markets to increase, while power generation markets are expected to remain weak. We plan to continue acquiring our partially-owned North American distributors, which will increase our distribution segment revenues. Our operations are also affected by currency, political, economic, and regulatory matters, including the adoption and enforcement of environmental and emission standards. We have long-standing relationships with many leading manufacturers in the markets we serve, which enhances our competitive advantage and organizational resilience. We invest in businesses in certain countries that carry high levels of risk, such as China, Brazil, India, Mexico, Russia, and countries in the Middle East and Africa. Our ability to absorb strain and preserve functioning despite adversity is reflected in our strategic initiatives and operational flexibility. We generated $2.3 billion of operating cash flows, and our liquidity remains strong, providing us with the financial flexibility needed to fund working capital, common stock repurchases, capital expenditures, dividend payments, and acquisitions. Our pension plans were 108 percent funded at year-end, indicating organizational health and stability. We expect to contribute $175 million to our global pension plans in the coming year. Our strategic response to market fluctuations includes a focus on research, development, and engineering expenses to support new product initiatives and meet future emission standards. The consolidation of partially-owned North American distributors has significantly contributed to our sales growth, demonstrating our adaptability in response to market demands. We anticipate economic improvements in most of our current markets over the long term, driven by tightening emissions controls, infrastructure needs in emerging markets, energy availability and cost issues, and the globalization of industries. Our ability to maintain positive adjustment under challenging conditions is further supported by our focus on operational management and strategic adaptation to environmental disruptions. We continue to invest in new product lines and targeted capacity expansions, reflecting our commitment to resilience and growth in a turbulent market environment.

We are a fully integrated biopharmaceutical company that discovers, invents, develops, manufactures, and commercializes medicines for the treatment of serious medical conditions. The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are rapidly evolving and highly competitive, and new developments may render our products and technologies uncompetitive or obsolete. Our ability to continue to generate profits and positive cash flow from operations depends significantly on our continued success in commercializing our products. Developing and commercializing new medicines entails significant risk and expense, and we must overcome numerous hurdles, including successfully completing research and development and obtaining regulatory approval. Our operating results may fluctuate and will depend on factors such as the net sales of our marketed products, the scope and progress of our research and development efforts, and the continuation of our collaborations. The planning, execution, and results of our clinical programs are significant factors that can affect our operating and financial results. We have 17 product candidates in clinical development, all of which were discovered in our research laboratories. Our research and development expenses have increased significantly, reflecting our commitment to innovation and the development of new therapies. We prepare estimates of research and development costs for projects in clinical development, which include direct costs and allocations of certain costs such as indirect labor and manufacturing costs. Our estimates of research and development costs for clinical development programs are subject to change based on various factors, including the results of our research and preclinical programs and regulatory requirements. We expect continued increases in our expenditures, particularly in connection with our research and development activities and commercialization of our products. Our existing capital resources, funds generated by anticipated product sales, and funding for reimbursement of development costs under collaboration agreements will enable us to meet our projected operating needs. We enter into research collaboration and licensing agreements that may require us to pay amounts upon the achievement of various development and commercial milestones. We have contingent contractual obligations to reimburse our collaborators for a defined percentage of agreed-upon development expenses incurred. Our share of profits from sales will be used to reimburse our collaborators for these obligations. We are committed to maintaining operational flexibility and adapting to changes in the competitive landscape. Our collaborations with partners such as Sanofi and Bayer Healthcare are critical to our strategy, allowing us to share costs and risks associated with drug development and commercialization. We recognize the importance of inter-organizational collaboration and the need to respond effectively to environmental disruptions. The ability to adapt and reconfigure our strategies in response to unexpected situations is essential for maintaining organizational resilience. Our focus on innovation and strategic initiatives will support our long-term objectives and enhance our organizational capabilities. We are committed to fostering a culture of learning and adaptability within our organization to ensure we can navigate future challenges and capitalize on opportunities for growth.

The separation of our former natural gas distribution business and the wind down of our former energy services business have necessitated a strategic reconfiguration of operations, reflecting our ability to adapt to significant organizational changes. The execution of capital investments aligns with our strategy to generate consistent growth and sustainable earnings, demonstrating our operational flexibility in response to external pressures. We have completed growth projects and acquisitions totaling approximately $5.9 billion from 2010 through 2014, which are expected to enhance our infrastructure and meet the needs of natural gas producers and processors, thereby improving our organizational health and competitive advantage. The decline in commodity prices and the resulting decrease in producer capital investment are anticipated to slow natural gas and NGL supply growth, which may adversely impact our results of operations and cash flows. However, our integrated assets enable us to mitigate the impact of these challenges through minimum volume commitments and optimization activities. The strategic initiatives undertaken, including the suspension of certain capital expenditures, reflect our proactive measures to align with market conditions and customer needs. We expect to resume suspended capital-growth projects as soon as market conditions improve, demonstrating our resilience strategies in navigating adverse economic environments. The completion of various natural gas processing plants has resulted in increased natural gas volumes gathered and processed, showcasing our adaptability to changing market demands. Our financial results indicate a positive adjustment under challenging conditions, with increased revenues and net margins primarily due to higher volumes across our systems. The ability to absorb strain and preserve functioning despite adversity is evident in our operational management and strategic response to fluctuating commodity prices. We continue to assess risks associated with market volatility and are committed to maintaining operational continuity through effective resource allocation and management. The anticipated capital expenditures for 2015 reflect our focus on sustaining growth while navigating the complexities of the current business environment. Our approach to crisis management and preparedness is evident in our financial strategies, including hedging against commodity price fluctuations and maintaining access to credit facilities. The organizational dynamics at play, including stakeholder engagement and inter-organizational collaboration, further enhance our resilience in the face of external disturbances. Overall, our strategic planning and operational practices are designed to ensure organizational survival and success, even amidst environmental disruptions and market uncertainties.

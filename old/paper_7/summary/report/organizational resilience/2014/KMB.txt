In 2014, we initiated a restructuring plan in order to improve organization efficiency and offset the impact of stranded overhead costs resulting from the spin-off of our health care business. The restructuring is intended to improve our underlying profitability and increase our flexibility to invest in targeted growth initiatives, brand building, and other capabilities critical to delivering future growth. The restructuring is expected to impact all of our business segments and our organizations in all major geographies. We executed our growth strategies in key markets, generating solid sales growth and launching innovations across several brands. To help fund our investments in innovations and growth initiatives and to improve our profit margins, we are generating cost savings through several initiatives, including leveraging our global procurement organization and deploying lean principles. The restructuring is expected to be completed by the end of 2016, with expected workforce reductions primarily impacting salaried employees. We have also focused on generating cash flow and allocating capital to shareholders, with significant cash provided by operations in 2014. Our ability to generate cash from operations and our capacity to issue short-term and long-term debt are adequate to fund working capital, capital spending, payment of dividends, pension plan contributions, and other needs for the foreseeable future. We anticipate that advertising spending will increase somewhat as a percentage of net sales to support targeted growth initiatives, brand building, and innovation activities. The strategic changes related to our western and central European consumer and professional businesses were aimed at focusing our resources and investments on stronger market positions and growth opportunities. We exited the diaper category in that region and divested or exited some lower-margin businesses, which resulted in cumulative pre-tax charges over the period. The restructuring actions involved the sale or closure of several manufacturing facilities and streamlining our administrative organization. Our strategic initiatives are designed to enhance our operational flexibility and adaptability in response to external pressures and market dynamics. We are committed to maintaining a focus on innovation and service enhancements to meet customer needs effectively. The organizational changes and strategic adaptations are expected to strengthen our competitive advantage and resilience in the face of environmental disruptions and uncertainties. We believe that our organizational capabilities, including our ability to absorb strain and preserve functioning despite adversity, will enable us to navigate complex situations and sustain performance under pressure. The ongoing assessment of risks and the implementation of proactive measures are integral to our resilience strategies, ensuring that we can confront challenges and capitalize on opportunities for growth and success in turbulent markets.

We are a cable operator providing services in the United States with approximately 6.2 million residential and commercial customers. Our business plans include goals for increasing customers and revenue, and we have actively invested in our network and operations, improving the quality and value of the products and packages that we offer. We have implemented a number of changes to our organizational structure, selling methods, and operating tactics, which we believe positions us for better customer service and growth. We expect that our enhanced product set combined with improved customer service will lead to lower customer churn and longer customer lifetimes, allowing us to grow our customer base and revenue more quickly and economically. Our capital expenditures are driven by ongoing investments in technology and infrastructure to support customer growth and service enhancements, which are critical to maintaining operational continuity and adapting to market demands. The increase in our operating costs and expenses reflects our commitment to improving service levels and customer satisfaction, which are essential for organizational resilience. We have a history of net losses primarily attributable to insufficient revenue to cover operating expenses and interest expenses incurred due to our debt. However, we continue to evaluate the deployment of our anticipated future free cash flow to reduce leverage and invest in business growth, which is crucial for sustaining organizational health and adaptability in a competitive landscape. Our strategic initiatives focus on enhancing operational flexibility and resource allocation to respond effectively to external pressures and environmental disruptions. We have also experienced revenue growth through the acquisition of Bresnan, which has contributed to our ability to absorb strain and preserve functioning despite market challenges. The changes in our organizational practices and the focus on driving penetration of our triple play offering demonstrate our commitment to service innovation and maintaining competitive advantage. We recognize the importance of risk management and have established mechanisms to assess and mitigate risks associated with operational changes and market volatility. Our approach to capital management involves careful consideration of our financial resources, ensuring that we can sustain operations and invest in future opportunities while navigating the complexities of the business environment. As we continue to adapt and transform in response to evolving customer needs and market conditions, our focus remains on fostering organizational resilience through strategic planning, operational management, and a commitment to learning and innovation.

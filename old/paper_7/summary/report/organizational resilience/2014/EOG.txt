EOG Resources, Inc. operates under a consistent business and operational strategy that focuses predominantly on maximizing the rate of return on investment of capital by controlling operating and capital costs and maximizing reserve recoveries. This strategy is intended to enhance the generation of cash flow and earnings from each unit of production on a cost-effective basis, allowing EOG to deliver long-term production growth while maintaining a strong balance sheet. EOG emphasizes the drilling of internally generated prospects to find and develop low-cost reserves, maintaining the lowest possible operating cost structure consistent with prudent and safe operations. EOG's efforts to identify plays with large reserve potential have proven successful, contributing substantially to crude oil and liquids-rich natural gas production. The company continues to evaluate potential exploration and development prospects, focusing on increasing drilling and completion efficiencies and testing methods to improve recovery factors. EOG's capital structure strategy includes maintaining a strong balance sheet with a consistently below-average debt-to-total capitalization ratio, which was 25% at December 31, 2014. The company has significant flexibility with respect to financing alternatives, including borrowings under its commercial paper program and other uncommitted credit facilities. EOG plans to continue focusing a substantial portion of its exploration and development expenditures in its major producing areas in the United States, particularly in high-rate-of-return crude oil assets. The anticipated capital expenditures for 2015 are structured to maintain capital discipline by funding exploration, development, and exploitation activities primarily from available internally generated cash flows. EOG's operations are expected to adapt to the current low commodity price environment by focusing on cost reductions and seeking opportunities to acquire high-quality acreage at low costs. The company recognizes the importance of environmental and operational pressures and is committed to managing risks associated with commodity price volatility, operational continuity, and market dynamics. EOG's strategic initiatives include enhancing operational flexibility and maintaining a robust prospect inventory, which reflects its commitment to organizational resilience in the face of external disturbances and market challenges. The company continues to monitor foreign currency exchange rates and may implement measures to protect against exchange rate risks, demonstrating its proactive approach to risk management. EOG's ability to respond effectively to environmental disruptions and transform itself to emerge stronger from challenging situations underscores its organizational resilience. The companyâ€™s focus on maximizing operational efficiencies and maintaining financial strength positions it to confront future uncertainties and sustain its competitive advantage in the oil and gas industry.

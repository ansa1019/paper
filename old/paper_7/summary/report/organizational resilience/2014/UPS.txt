The worldwide economic environment has remained challenging, and we have continued to undertake several initiatives to improve the flexibility and capacity in our delivery network, enhance yield management, and increase operational efficiency while containing costs across all segments. Our broad portfolio of product offerings and the flexibilities inherent in our transportation network have helped us adapt to changing trends, including the adjustment of our air capacity and cost structure to better match prevailing volume mix levels. The continued deployment of technology improvements, including facility automation projects and the deployment of our on-road integrated optimization and navigation system, is expected to increase our network capacity and improve operational efficiency, flexibility, and reliability. We have adjusted our air and ground networks to better match higher volume levels, utilize technology to increase package sorting and delivery efficiency, and benefit from improved pick-up and delivery densities, particularly for our residential products. These improvements allowed us to process increased volume at a faster rate than the increase in average daily aircraft block hours and vehicle miles driven. The significant variability in package volume during the holiday shipping season resulted in a sub-optimized transportation network and a reduction in productivity, necessitating increased staffing and equipment rentals to maintain service levels. We have continued to adjust our transportation network and utilize new or expanded operating facilities to improve time-in-transit for shipments in each region. The growth in business-to-consumer shipments has driven increases in both air and ground shipments, with business-to-consumer volume growing significantly. Our ability to respond effectively to environmental disruptions and transform ourselves to emerge stronger from challenging situations is reflected in our operational management strategies, which include enhancing our resource allocation and adapting to customer needs. The changes in our operational practices, including the management of our transportation network and the adjustment of our capacity, demonstrate our commitment to maintaining organizational resilience. We have also recognized the importance of collaboration networks and inter-organizational collaboration in achieving our strategic initiatives. The adjustments made in response to external pressures and environmental perturbations highlight our focus on operational flexibility and adaptability to ensure continued performance under pressure. Our strategic response mechanisms, including crisis management and emergency management, are designed to mitigate risks and enhance our organizational capabilities. The focus on resource generation and operational continuity is critical to our organizational health and effectiveness, ensuring that we can confront unexpected situations and maintain performance despite challenges. Our ongoing commitment to resource management and strategic adaptation reflects our understanding of the need for resilience in a turbulent market environment.

We are a global semiconductor company with facilities worldwide. During 2014, we continued to focus on introducing a more diverse product portfolio as part of our strategy to transform our business to attain approximately 50% of our revenue from high-growth adjacent markets by the end of 2015. The annual increase in embedded, enterprise, and semi-custom segment net revenue was offset by a decrease in computing and graphics segment net revenue, reflecting ongoing challenges in a competitive consumer PC market. We believe the pace of the decline in the PC market is slowing, which indicates our adaptability to changing market conditions. Our organizational change processes included a realignment of our organizational structure, which is part of our strategic initiatives to improve operational flexibility and resilience. In connection with our continued strategic transformation, we implemented a restructuring plan designed to improve operating efficiencies, which involved a reduction of global headcount and an alignment of our real estate footprint with the reduced headcount. We recorded a restructuring charge, which is expected to enhance our operational management and resource allocation. Our financial condition reflects our ability to absorb strain, as evidenced by our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities, which were sufficient to fund operations, including capital expenditures over the next twelve months. We believe that in the event we decide to obtain external funding, we may be able to access the capital markets on terms adequate to meet our objectives, indicating our preparedness for future challenges. The decrease in marketing, general, and administrative expenses was primarily due to a decrease in sales and marketing activities, which demonstrates our response strategies to external pressures. Our operating income in the enterprise, embedded, and semi-custom segment improved due to increased net revenue, which reflects our ability to reconfigure and adapt to market demands. The goodwill impairment charge recorded indicates the complexities and challenges we face in maintaining organizational health and performance under pressure. The ongoing changes in our financial condition and results of operations, including the significant adjustments made to our estimates and judgments, highlight our organizational capabilities in navigating through adverse conditions. We continue to focus on enhancing our competitive advantage through innovation and strategic adaptation, which are critical for our survival and growth in turbulent markets. Our strategic response to environmental disruptions includes a commitment to inter-organizational collaboration and the development of resilience strategies that allow us to confront and benefit from sudden disruptive changes. The formation of collaboration networks and the emphasis on knowledge management are integral to our organizational dynamics, enabling us to maintain operational continuity and positive adjustment under challenging conditions.

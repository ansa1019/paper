Despite global economic uncertainty, we have maintained profitability and positive cash flow on an annual basis in recent years. We achieved these results not only because of our solid execution, leading technology, and strong customer relationships, but also because of our time-based revenue business model. This model allows us to absorb fluctuations in customer spending, as decreases as well as increases in spending do not immediately affect our revenues in a significant way. Our business outlook remains solid based on our leading technology, customer relationships, business model, diligent expense management, and acquisition strategy, which collectively enhance our operational flexibility and adaptability to changing market conditions. The acquisition of Coverity has enabled us to enter into a new, growing market dedicated to helping companies deliver better software faster, thereby enhancing our resilience in the face of disruptive events. We believe this acquisition has expanded our total addressable market and contributed to our ability to respond effectively to environmental disruptions. Our revenue is subject to fluctuations primarily due to customer requirements, including payment terms and the timing and value of contract renewals, which necessitates a strategic response to maintain operational continuity. We continue to derive more than 90% of our revenue from time-based revenue, which reflects our ability to manage resource allocation effectively and mitigate risks associated with revenue variability. The increase in time-based license revenue for fiscal 2014 compared to fiscal 2013 was primarily attributable to increases in TSL license revenue due to our overall growth, including contributions of revenue from acquired companies. Our expenses are generally impacted by changes in personnel-related costs, driven by increased headcount from acquisitions, which supports our organizational capabilities and enhances our resilience strategies. We allocate certain human resource programs, information technology, and facility expenses among our functional income statement categories based on headcount, reflecting our commitment to maintaining organizational health and effectiveness. We believe that our current cash and cash equivalents, cash generated from operations, and available credit will satisfy our routine business requirements for at least the next twelve months, demonstrating our preparedness for future challenges. Our working capital at the end of fiscal 2014 was lower than at the end of fiscal 2013, primarily due to timing of billings and increased accounts payable, which indicates the need for ongoing management of our resource deployment. The increase in cash provided by operating activities was primarily driven by higher cash collections, which were partially offset by higher disbursements for operations, emphasizing the importance of effective cash flow management in sustaining our operational resilience. We proactively manage our cash and cash equivalents balances to ensure ample liquidity, which is essential for navigating turbulent markets and sustaining organizational success.

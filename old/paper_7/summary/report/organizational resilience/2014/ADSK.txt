The discussion in our management's discussion and analysis includes forward-looking statements regarding our business strategies, including our ability to effectively manage transitions to new business models and markets, which is critical for maintaining operational flexibility under challenging conditions. Our strategy is to lead our customers and the industries they serve to new cloud and mobile platforms, addressing both technological and business model shifts. This transition is designed to provide our customers with more flexibility, which is essential for adapting to environmental perturbations and unexpected situations. We believe that customer adoption of our new offerings will continue to grow as customers leverage the scalable computing power and flexibility provided through these services. Our commitment to helping customers address complex challenges such as globalization, urbanization, and sustainable design reflects our focus on enhancing organizational resilience. We capitalize on our competitive advantages, including the ability to bring advanced technology to mainstream markets and the breadth of our product portfolio, which allows our customers to address a wide variety of problems. The transition to cloud and mobile platforms is expected to increase our long-term revenue growth rate by expanding our customer base and enhancing customer value over time. We anticipate that our strategic initiatives will help us confront economic volatility and geopolitical risks, which are significant pressures in emerging economies. Our operational management strategy includes improving product functionality and expanding offerings through internal development and acquisitions, which are essential for resource generation and reconfiguration. We recognize that acquisitions entail integration challenges and may impact our operating margins, necessitating careful assessment of these trade-offs. Our business model transition is expected to result in an increase in deferred revenue, which reflects our ability to adapt to changing market conditions and customer needs. We also monitor our significant accounting policies and estimates, which involve judgments that can significantly impact our financial results, thereby ensuring organizational health and effectiveness. Our ability to manage risks associated with foreign currency fluctuations and economic conditions is critical for maintaining system integrity and operational continuity. We are committed to fostering a culture of learning and innovation, which is essential for enhancing our organizational capabilities and resilience. Our focus on stakeholder engagement and collaboration networks supports our strategic response to external pressures and enhances our adaptability in a turbulent market environment. We believe that our existing cash balances, anticipated cash flows, and available credit facilities will be sufficient to meet our operational resource needs and support our strategic initiatives for growth.

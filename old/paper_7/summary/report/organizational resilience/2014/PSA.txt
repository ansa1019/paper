Management's discussion and analysis indicates that our centralized information networks, national telephone and online reservation system, and the brand name "public storage" enable us to meet challenges effectively. We believe that our real estate development activities are beneficial to our business operations over the long run. However, the short run may present challenges due to the three to four year period it takes to fill up newly developed storage space and reach a stabilized level of cash flows. Our management and operating infrastructure is expected to result in newly acquired facilities stabilizing at a higher level of net operating income than was achieved by previous owners. The ultimate levels of net operating income can be affected by changes in general economic conditions. We expect the non-same store facilities to continue to provide earnings growth during 2015 as these facilities approach stabilized occupancy levels. Our evaluation that we have met the REIT requirements could be incorrect, as compliance with tax rules requires factual determinations, and unidentified circumstances could result in noncompliance. We believe that our geographic diversification and scale provide some insulation from localized economic effects and add to the stability of our cash flows. Our financial profile is characterized by a low level of debt-to-total-capitalization, and we seek to finance our investment activities and debt obligations with retained operating cash flow. We anticipate that we may seek to expand the borrowing capacity of our bank credit facility and utilize the facility as a bridge to the issuance of longer-term debt. We have generally been able to raise capital through the issuance of preferred securities at an attractive cost of capital relative to the issuance of our common shares. Our liquidity and capital resources are expected to be sufficient to meet our ongoing requirements for operating expenses, capital improvements, and distributions to our shareholders. We have capital commitments totaling approximately $356 million, consisting of remaining spend on our development pipeline, property acquisitions, and maturities on notes payable. We expect to continue to seek additional development projects; however, the level of future development may be limited due to various constraints such as difficulty in finding available sites that meet our risk-adjusted yield expectations and challenges in obtaining building permits for self-storage activities in certain municipalities. We believe that our management and operational capabilities will enable us to adapt to environmental perturbations and maintain operational flexibility. The performance of our self-storage operations has shown resilience, with net income increasing due to improvements in same-store facilities and acquisitions of new facilities. Our approach to maximizing cash flows from existing self-storage facilities and seeking additional investments reflects our commitment to organizational resilience. We aim to maintain an average occupancy level of at least 90% by regularly adjusting rental rates and promotions to attract new tenants. The demand for self-storage space fluctuates due to various local and regional factors, including the overall economy, which influences our strategic response to market conditions. We continue to monitor performance under pressure and adjust our strategies accordingly to ensure organizational effectiveness and sustainability.

For over three decades, minimally invasive surgery (MIS) has reduced trauma to patients by allowing selected surgeries to be performed through small ports rather than large incisions, thus maintaining positive adjustment under challenging conditions. Our technology is designed to provide surgeons with a range of motion of MIS instruments in the surgical field, analogous to the motions of a human wrist, while filtering out the tremor inherent in a surgeon's hand. We focus our organization and investments on developing, marketing, and training for those products and targeted procedures where da Vinci can bring patient value relative to alternative treatment options and/or economic benefit to healthcare providers. The adoption of da Vinci surgery has the potential to grow for those procedures that offer greater patient value than non-da Vinci alternatives, within the prevailing economics of healthcare providers. Our strategy is to provide hospitals with attractive clinical and economic solutions in each of these procedure categories, reflecting our ability to adapt and respond to external pressures and demands in the healthcare landscape. 

The installed base of da Vinci surgical systems has grown, reflecting our operational flexibility and resilience in responding to market needs. Our recurring revenue has generally grown at a faster rate than system revenue, indicating a strong customer base that supports our operational continuity. We believe that our leasing program has been an effective and well-received strategy that allows us to expand da Vinci surgery availability while leveraging our balance sheet. The growth in our overall procedure volume has been driven by increased acceptance among surgeons and health systems, supported by expanded global evidence validating the clinical and economic value of our procedures. 

We have made substantial investments in our commercial operations, product development activities, facilities, and intellectual property, which are essential for sustaining our competitive advantage and ensuring organizational health. Our ability to generate recurring revenue is largely reflective of continued procedure adoption on a growing base of installed da Vinci surgical systems. We expect that our international procedures and revenue will make up a greater portion of our business in the long term, aligning with our future orientation and strategic initiatives. 

Our research and development expenses have increased to support a broader set of product development initiatives, which is crucial for our organizational transformation and resilience strategies. The successful execution of these initiatives is vital for maintaining our performance under pressure and adapting to complex situations in the healthcare environment. We are committed to investing in several strategic areas to advance key product development innovations, which will enhance our organizational capabilities and ensure we can confront future challenges effectively. 

Our financial flexibility, supported by significant cash reserves, positions us well to navigate uncertainties and invest in growth opportunities. We anticipate that we will continue to be able to fund future growth through cash provided from operations, reflecting our resilience and resourcefulness in a turbulent market.

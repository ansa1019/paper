The acquisition of Guardian Digital Communications Limited (GDCL) enables us to geographically diversify our global managed and support services offerings, while offering a proven service delivery platform to build on for providing innovative, leading, mission-critical communications solutions and services to customers. Our services segment is expected to grow at a higher rate than our products segment, reflecting our ability to adapt to changing market conditions and customer needs. We have shifted our offerings to align with technology trends in serving our customers, which helps us manage, support, and upgrade their networks. The acquisition of GDCL has expanded our managed and support services business, providing significant net sales growth and enhancing our operational flexibility. 

We have implemented various productivity improvement plans aimed at continuing operating margin improvements by driving efficiencies and reducing operating costs. Our ability to absorb strain and preserve functioning despite adversity is reflected in our record backlog position of $8.4 billion, which is up 29% compared to the previous year. The integration of our services and products segments allows us to respond effectively to environmental disruptions and transform our operations to emerge stronger from challenging situations. 

We believe we are well-positioned to compete in both our core markets and adjacent growth areas, supported by our broad, compelling products and services portfolio tailored for our mission-critical communications customer base. Our operational management strategies include proactive measures to optimize our capital structure, enabling prioritized investments in the business and targeted acquisitions as a source of generating solid future operating cash flows. 

The expected demands for our managed and support services are indicative of our organizational resilience, as these services help customers utilize features, applications, and data in new ways, including predictive policing and proactive support. We have experienced a downward trend in certain product sales, primarily due to macroeconomic pressures, yet our strategic initiatives and resource allocation have allowed us to maintain a competitive advantage. 

Our financial performance demonstrates our organizational health, with increased operating earnings and a commitment to returning capital to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. The strategic response to external pressures, including the strengthening U.S. dollar and economic challenges in various regions, has been mitigated by our diversified revenue streams and operational strategies. 

We continue to assess risks and opportunities, ensuring that our organizational practices are aligned with our major objectives. The complexity of our operations necessitates a systemic perspective, allowing us to manage environmental perturbations effectively. Our focus on innovation and adaptability positions us to confront future challenges and leverage opportunities for growth, thereby enhancing our organizational resilience in a turbulent market landscape.

EOG operates under a consistent business and operational strategy that focuses predominantly on maximizing the rate of return on investment of capital by controlling operating and capital costs and maximizing reserve recoveries. This strategy is intended to enhance the generation of cash flow and earnings from each unit of production on a cost-effective basis, allowing EOG to deliver long-term production growth while maintaining a strong balance sheet. EOG continues to focus on increasing drilling and completion efficiencies using precision lateral targeting and advanced completion methods and reducing operating and capital costs through efficiency improvements and service cost reductions. EOG has significant flexibility with respect to financing alternatives, including borrowings under its commercial paper program and other uncommitted credit facilities, bank borrowings, borrowings under its $2.0 billion senior unsecured revolving credit facility, and equity and debt offerings. Management continues to believe EOG has one of the strongest prospect inventories in EOG's history. EOG's efforts to identify plays with large reserve potential have proven to be successful, contributing substantially to EOG's crude oil and liquids-rich natural gas production. The financial results of EOG's mergers and related asset purchase transactions with Yates Petroleum Corporation and other entities were included in EOG's consolidated financial statements, enhancing its operational capabilities and resource generation. EOG's capital expenditures are structured to maintain its strategy of capital discipline by funding exploration, development, and exploitation activities primarily from available internally generated cash flows and cash on hand. EOG's anticipated capital expenditures for 2017 are estimated to range from approximately $3.7 billion to $4.1 billion, focusing on U.S. crude oil drilling activities. The company plans to continue to improve well performance and lower drilling and completion costs through efficiency gains and lower service costs. EOG's adaptability to environmental disruptions is reflected in its operational management strategies, which include maintaining a strong balance sheet with a consistently below-average debt-to-total capitalization ratio. EOG's debt-to-total capitalization ratio was 33% at December 31, 2016, compared to 34% at December 31, 2015. The company continues to evaluate opportunities to add drilling inventory through leasehold acquisitions and tactical acquisitions, demonstrating its proactive measures in response to market conditions. EOG's operational flexibility is further illustrated by its ability to adjust its exploration and development expenditure budget as circumstances warrant, ensuring resilience in the face of external pressures and market volatility. The company recognizes the importance of maintaining operational continuity and organizational effectiveness amidst fluctuating commodity prices and evolving market dynamics. EOG's strategic initiatives emphasize the integration of acquired properties into its operations, enhancing its organizational capabilities and overall performance. The company's focus on reducing operating costs through efficiency improvements and its commitment to maintaining a strong balance sheet underpin its resilience strategies, enabling it to confront challenges and capitalize on opportunities in the competitive landscape of the oil and gas industry.

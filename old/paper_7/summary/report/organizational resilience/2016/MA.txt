In the fourth quarter of 2016, Mastercard began using the term "switched" transactions to differentiate its authorization, clearing, and settlement activities from issuer/acquirer processing activities, reflecting an adaptation in terminology to enhance operational clarity. The company monitors material litigation judgments and settlements separately from ongoing operations, evaluating ongoing performance without these amounts, which indicates a strategic response to external pressures and risk management. Mastercard's management believes that non-GAAP financial measures facilitate an understanding of its operating performance and provide a meaningful comparison of results between periods, demonstrating a focus on maintaining operational flexibility and performance under pressure. The global nature of Mastercard's business helps protect operating results from adverse economic conditions in a single or few countries, highlighting the importance of organizational resilience in the face of environmental perturbations. The competitive and evolving nature of the global payments industry presents both challenges and opportunities, necessitating a proactive approach to strategic initiatives and resource allocation to sustain growth. Adverse economic trends have impacted the environment in which Mastercard operates, and the company continues to monitor political and economic conditions globally to identify opportunities for growth and evaluate the evolution of the payments industry. The significant concentration of revenue generated in the United States makes the business susceptible to economic conditions, underscoring the need for effective crisis management and organizational health strategies. Mastercard's management uses various financial measures to evaluate ongoing operations in relation to historical results, supporting the company's adaptability and resilience strategies. The company generates cash required to meet operational needs through its operations, and its existing cash, cash equivalents, and investment securities balances are deemed sufficient to satisfy future operating cash needs and obligations. The company has established a commercial paper program and a committed unsecured revolving credit facility to provide liquidity for general corporate purposes, including business continuity in the event of settlement failures. The company’s ability to respond effectively to environmental disruptions and transform itself to emerge stronger from challenging situations is critical for sustaining organizational success. Mastercard's strategic planning includes assessing the impact of foreign currency rates on operating results, which reflects an understanding of the complexities of the global business environment. The company’s operational management practices are designed to ensure resilience and adaptability in the face of market volatility and uncertainty, which are essential for maintaining performance and achieving major objectives. The company’s financial results may be negatively impacted by actions taken by financial institutions or regulatory bodies, necessitating a robust approach to risk assessment and management. Mastercard's focus on future planning and strategic foresight is integral to its organizational transformation and resilience, enabling it to confront challenges and leverage opportunities in a dynamic market landscape.

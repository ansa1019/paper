We achieved strong performance in fiscal 2016, delivering record net income and sales growth, which reflects our ability to maintain operational effectiveness under varying economic conditions. Our business is impacted by various factors within the economy that affect both our consumer and our industry, including fuel costs and unemployment rates. Given the unpredictability of gas prices, we cannot predict how future changes will impact our sales. Our primary response to fluctuations in demand is to adjust our advertising message, store staffing, and product assortment, demonstrating our operational flexibility. We initiated strategic tests focused on increasing inventory availability, which led to adjustments in our hub distribution model and increased delivery frequency to our domestic stores. These initiatives are part of our efforts to enhance business continuity and adapt to changing market demands. We believe the improvement in our sales categories was driven by regional weather patterns and improved merchandise assortments, indicating our capacity for resource allocation and adaptation to external pressures. Our experience shows that as the number of miles driven increases, consumers' vehicles are more likely to need service and maintenance, which supports our sales growth. We have not experienced fundamental shifts in our category sales mix, although we did see a slight increase in the mix of sales of failure and discretionary categories. Our investments in technology and supply chain infrastructure are expected to enhance our operational management and support our strategic initiatives. The aging vehicle population is anticipated to increase demand for our products, reinforcing our resilience strategies. Our liquidity is supported by cash flows from operations, and we have maintained a strong interest coverage ratio, reflecting our financial resilience. We expect to continue investing in new locations and enhancements to existing locations, which are crucial for our long-term growth and adaptability. Our ability to leverage our inventory purchases and negotiate extended payment terms with vendors demonstrates our resourcefulness and operational agility. We have established a robust framework for managing our self-insurance reserves and pension obligations, which reflects our commitment to organizational health and risk management. The timing of future payments for our liabilities is predictable based on historical patterns, indicating our preparedness for potential financial strains. We regularly review our tax reserves and assess the adequacy of the amounts recorded, which underscores our proactive measures in managing uncertainties. Our strategic planning includes leveraging our capital resources effectively to maintain our investment-grade credit ratings, which is vital for sustaining operational continuity and organizational success. We believe our strategic response to market volatility and external disturbances positions us favorably for future challenges, ensuring our organizational resilience in a turbulent business environment.

Chipotle's focus during 2017 is to return to sales and profitability growth and restore its restaurant economic model. The company has implemented enhanced food safety procedures in response to food-borne illness incidents, which have increased food costs as a percentage of revenue. These measures reflect an organizational response to external pressures and aim to mitigate risks associated with food safety. The company anticipates that the ongoing impact of these enhanced procedures will be approximately 1% compared to pre-crisis levels, demonstrating an adaptation strategy to maintain operational integrity under challenging conditions. In 2016, Chipotle's sales and profitability were adversely impacted due to these incidents, leading to a significant decrease in comparable restaurant sales. However, there was a sequential improvement in sales trends throughout 2016, indicating a recovery process and operational flexibility in response to adverse events. The company has also increased its marketing and promotional spend to regain customers, which reflects a strategic initiative aimed at enhancing customer experience and organizational health. In terms of restaurant development, Chipotle plans to open between 195 and 210 restaurants in 2017, primarily in markets with an established presence, which aligns with its resource allocation strategy for growth and resilience. The anticipated reduction in capital expenditures is due to fewer planned restaurant openings and lower average investment costs per restaurant, indicating a reconfiguration of resource deployment to adapt to market conditions. Furthermore, Chipotle's management and governance enhancements, including the appointment of new board members, signify a commitment to organizational change processes that support resilience and adaptability. The company expects to reduce restaurant-level operating costs as a percentage of revenue in 2017, which is based on anticipated sales improvements and operational efficiencies. This expectation highlights the importance of strategic response mechanisms in maintaining performance under pressure. The companyâ€™s ability to absorb strain and preserve functioning despite adversity is evident in its proactive measures to address operational challenges and enhance its competitive advantage. Overall, Chipotle's trajectory model of resilience is reflected in its efforts to confront and benefit from sudden disruptive changes, ensuring organizational survival and success in a turbulent business environment.

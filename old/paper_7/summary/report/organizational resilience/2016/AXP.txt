In a challenging economic, competitive, and regulatory environment, we remain focused on our key priorities of accelerating revenue growth, optimizing investments, and resetting our cost base. Our management strategies include leveraging our strong capital position to return capital to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends, which reflects our commitment to maintaining operational flexibility and adaptability under external pressures. We made a record level of business-building investments during 2016 and continued to progress on plans to remove $1 billion from our overall cost base by the end of 2017. The ability to respond effectively to environmental disruptions is critical for our organizational resilience, allowing us to transform and emerge stronger from challenging situations. We anticipate spending less on marketing and promotion in 2017, while continuing to enhance our card product value propositions, which is part of our strategic response to maintain performance under pressure. 

Our provisions for losses increased modestly, driven by higher card member loans and a slight increase in delinquency rates, indicating our need for effective risk assessment and management strategies. The management of operational resources and the ability to adapt to unexpected situations are essential for maintaining organizational health and performance. We recognize the importance of inter-organizational collaboration and strategic initiatives to enhance our competitive advantage and resilience strategies. 

Our business segments operate with a focus on maintaining coherence and effectiveness in their respective markets, which is crucial for navigating turbulent conditions and ensuring survival. The insights gained from our operational management and strategic adaptation efforts help us to foresee potential challenges and reconfigure our approaches accordingly. The emphasis on knowledge management and the absorption of internal and external knowledge contribute to our organizational intelligence and resilience. 

We also prioritize the management of liquidity risk to ensure that we can meet our financial obligations, even under adverse conditions. This involves maintaining diversified funding sources and projecting cash inflows and outflows under various economic scenarios. Our comprehensive enterprise-wide risk management program is designed to identify, aggregate, monitor, and manage risks, ensuring that we can effectively confront and mitigate potential hazards. 

The integration of operational management with strategic planning allows us to maintain a solid equity capital profile and to support future business growth. Our focus on resource allocation and utilization is aimed at enhancing our organizational capabilities and ensuring that we can adapt to changing market dynamics. The ability to maintain positive adjustment under challenging conditions is a testament to our resilience and commitment to long-term success in a complex and evolving business environment.

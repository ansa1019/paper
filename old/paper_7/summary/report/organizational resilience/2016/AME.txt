Ametek's operations are affected by global, regional, and industry economic factors; however, the company's strategic geographic and industry diversification, along with its mix of products and services, have helped to mitigate the potential adverse impact of unfavorable developments in any one industry or the economy of any single country on its consolidated operating results. The company experienced lower sales in its process businesses that have exposure to oil and gas markets and in its engineered materials, interconnects, and packaging businesses that have exposure to metals markets. Contributions from recent acquisitions, combined with successful operational excellence initiatives, helped to partially offset the weakness in oil and gas and metals markets. The company also benefited from its strategic initiatives under Ametek's four key strategies: operational excellence, strategic acquisitions, global and market expansion, and new products. The full-year impact of the 2016 acquisitions and continued focus on operational excellence initiatives, including the 2016 realignment actions, are expected to have a positive impact on the company's results. The company recorded realignment costs primarily related to severance costs for a reduction in workforce and asset write-downs in response to the impact of a weak global economy and a strong U.S. dollar. The expected annualized cash savings from the 2016 realignment costs is anticipated to be approximately $35 million, with approximately $15 million expected to be realized in 2017. The company's strategic initiatives and operational excellence efforts reflect its commitment to maintaining organizational resilience by adapting to environmental perturbations and enhancing operational flexibility. The company believes it has sufficient cash-generating capabilities from domestic and unrestricted foreign sources, available credit facilities, and access to long-term capital funds to meet its operating needs and contractual obligations in the foreseeable future. The company is committed to investing in research, development, and engineering activities to design and develop new and improved products, which is vital for sustaining competitive advantage and organizational health. The company’s differentiated and global business activities help to reduce the impact of market risks, including fluctuations in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, and commodity prices. The company's operational management strategies, including the establishment of a five-year revolving credit facility, provide additional financial flexibility to support growth plans, including its acquisition strategy. The company’s focus on operational continuity and strategic adaptation is evident in its approach to managing risks and uncertainties, ensuring that it can respond effectively to disruptive events and maintain performance under pressure. The company’s ability to foresee and confront challenges, along with its emphasis on collaboration networks and inter-organizational collaboration, further enhances its organizational resilience. The company’s historical experience with environmental matters and the establishment of reserves for probable remediation activities demonstrate its proactive measures in managing potential hazards and ensuring compliance with regulations. Overall, Ametek’s strategic planning and operational management reflect a multifaceted approach to fostering organizational resilience and sustaining performance amidst external pressures and market volatility.

The evolving cyber threat environment is unprecedented both in terms of volume and sophistication of attacks, necessitating increased visibility and security orchestration across a widely distributed ecosystem of networks. Our cybersecurity solutions are designed to provide broad, rapid protection against dynamic and sophisticated security threats while simplifying the IT and security infrastructure of our end-customers. The Fortinet Security Fabric is built around an open framework to ensure interoperability and synchronization of intelligence and response across the distributed network security infrastructure. This integrated security architecture connects our products, services, and ecosystem partner solutions to help provide visibility and protection at all points in the network, from endpoint to data center to the cloud. Our strategy of investing in sales and marketing enables us to continue to gain market share and customers, reflecting our ongoing success in driving sales of low-end and high-end service bundles. We are also starting to see a shift from product revenues to higher-margin, recurring service revenues, which is indicative of our adaptability to changing market dynamics. Our continued investments in research and development are aimed at strengthening our technology leadership position, which is critical for maintaining operational flexibility and responding effectively to external pressures. The increase in our deferred revenue balance, which consists of unrecognized service revenue from Fortiguard security subscription and Forticare technical support service contracts, reflects our ability to absorb strain and preserve functioning despite the presence of adversity. The growth of our sales to enterprise, service provider, and government organizations is a key driver of long-term growth and operating leverage. Our business model is designed to ensure operational continuity and resilience by leveraging strategic initiatives that enhance our organizational capabilities. We believe that continued product innovation has strengthened our technology and resulted in market share gains, contributing to our organizational health and effectiveness. The integration of acquired companies and technologies, along with the implementation of a new ERP system, is expected to improve operational efficiencies and support our strategic response to complex situations. We monitor our deferred revenue balance and growth as it represents a significant portion of revenue to be recognized in future periods, which is essential for our financial stability. The increase in cash flows from operating activities is a result of our ability to successfully manage our working capital, reflecting our organizational resilience in navigating through uncertain market conditions. Our focus on developing new products and enhancing existing ones is crucial for maintaining our competitive advantage and ensuring that we meet customer needs effectively. The substantial majority of our product sales are derived from our Fortigate appliances, which are designed to address sophisticated threats and next-generation environments, thus enabling us to adapt and thrive in a rapidly changing business landscape.

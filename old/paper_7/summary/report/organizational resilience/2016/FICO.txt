During fiscal 2016, our growth initiatives continued to generate significant free cash flow, which we utilized to enhance shareholder value through investments in long-term growth initiatives and acquisitions of relevant technologies and products that strengthen our portfolio and competitive position. We expanded our traditional on-premises software into cloud-based solutions, providing growth opportunities with customers who can benefit from the affordability and simplicity of these solutions. Our software solutions are available through the FICO® analytic cloud, and we are adding delivery via third-party cloud environments, which are offered through large vendors in other geographic locations across the world. We introduced the FICO® decision management suite 2.0, which allows customers to quickly integrate our tools and components with their data, helping organizations of all sizes realize the promise of advanced analytics and decision management in a cost-effective, scalable cloud or on-premise solution. We continued to pursue additional partners to distribute the FICO® scores with their product offerings sold directly to consumers, which reflects our adaptability and strategic initiatives in response to market demands. Our acquisition of Quadmetrics, a provider of enterprise security assessment analytics, accelerates our efforts to provide a suite of complementary cyber-related analytics solutions to market. We shifted some of our resources to distribution in our expanded market, demonstrating operational flexibility and resource deployment in response to evolving customer needs. We expect to broaden our investment into product delivery, support, and infrastructure operations, which aligns with our strategic response to enhance organizational resilience. Our revenue fluctuations are primarily driven by changes in transactional volume and license fees, reflecting our ability to absorb strain and preserve functioning despite external pressures. The increase in operating income was attributable to a higher percentage of revenues derived from our higher-margin products, indicating our organizational strength and resilience strategies. We have established a partnership agreement with Experian, which continues to accelerate our growth and enhances our competitive advantage in the market. Our focus on research and development, particularly in cloud computing and software-as-a-service, reflects our commitment to innovation and organizational learning processes. We believe these investments will enable us to confront future challenges and maintain positive adjustment under challenging conditions. The increase in our customer communication services revenue was primarily due to growth in the mobile communication market, showcasing our ability to adapt to environmental perturbations. We have not experienced significant variances between our estimates and actual results in the past, indicating our effective risk management and knowledge absorption capabilities. Our strategic planning and future orientation are evident in our ongoing evaluations of acquiring technology or businesses, which will further enhance our organizational capabilities and resilience in a turbulent market environment.

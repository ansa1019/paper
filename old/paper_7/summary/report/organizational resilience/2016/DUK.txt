Duke Energy advanced a number of important strategic initiatives to transform its energy future with a focus on customers, employees, operations, and growth. The company has responded to an environment of changing customer demands, investing in electric and gas infrastructure that customers value and that provide an opportunity for sustainable growth. The acquisition of Piedmont reflects the growing importance of natural gas to the future of the energy infrastructure within the company's service territory and throughout the U.S., establishing a strategic platform for future growth in natural gas infrastructure. Duke Energy's exit from the Latin American market results in a portfolio of domestic electric and gas infrastructure businesses with a lower risk profile and enhances the ability to generate more consistent earnings and cash flows over time. Duke Energy continues to focus on the safe and efficient operation of its generation fleet, with safety performance metrics leading the utilities industry. During Hurricane Matthew, over 1.7 million customers in Florida and the Carolinas were without power, and 1.4 million outages were restored in record time, helping communities start the rebuilding process. The commitment and resolve of employees and contractors were crucial in restoring power to customers. Duke Energy has a demonstrated track record of driving efficiencies and productivity, including merger integration, which helps keep overall customer rates below the national average while moderating customer bill increases over time. The company has advanced a multi-year portfolio transition, which includes significant investments in natural gas-fired combined cycle plants, allowing Duke Energy to replace older, less efficient coal units early. The company also expects to continue to advance other cleaner energy sources within its regulated electric jurisdictions, including hydro, wind, solar, and combined heat-and-power projects, increasing the flexibility of the system and allowing Duke Energy to continue lowering carbon emissions. Duke Energy's objectives for 2017 and beyond include delivering exceptional value to customers, being an integral part of the communities in which it does business, and providing attractive returns to investors. The company is committed to leading the way to cleaner, smarter energy solutions that customers value through a strategy focused on transformation of the customer experience, modernization of the electric grid to improve reliability and flexibility, and operational excellence through engagement with employees. Duke Energy intends to work constructively with regulators to evaluate the current construct and seek modernized recovery solutions that benefit both customers and shareholders. The company has also faced significant external pressures, including environmental regulations and the need for compliance with coal ash management requirements, which have necessitated strategic responses and adaptations to its operational practices. The ongoing integration of Piedmont and investments in gas local distribution systems will help maintain system integrity and expand gas distribution to new customers. Duke Energy's focus on operational flexibility and strategic initiatives positions it to confront challenges and adapt to changing market conditions, ensuring organizational resilience in the face of adversity.

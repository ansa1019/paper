We are engaged in a number of research and mid- and early-stage development programs, including in the areas of pain and neurology, and we plan to continue investing in our research programs and fostering scientific innovation in order to identify and develop transformative medicines. We believe that pursuing research in diverse areas allows us to balance the risks inherent in drug development and may provide drug candidates that will form our pipeline in future years. Our collaborations with biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies enhance our pipeline and research capabilities, reflecting our strategic initiatives to adapt and respond to external pressures. We closely monitor the results of our discovery, research, clinical trials, and nonclinical studies and frequently evaluate our drug development programs in light of new data and scientific, business, and commercial insights, with the objective of balancing risk and potential. This process can result in abrupt changes in focus and priorities as new information becomes available, demonstrating our operational flexibility and adaptability under challenging conditions. Our corporate compliance program is designed to actively identify, prevent, and mitigate risk through the implementation of compliance policies and systems, promoting a culture of compliance that supports organizational health. We expect to continue to devote substantial resources to maintain, administer, and expand these compliance programs globally, which is essential for our resilience strategies in navigating regulatory complexities. Our financial results and the commercial prospects for drug candidates are influenced by our ability to respond effectively to environmental disruptions, including regulatory delays that could harm our financial results. We have entered into collaboration agreements that include funding of certain research, development, and commercialization efforts, with the potential for future milestone and royalty payments contingent upon continued involvement in the programs. Our obligation to fund these efforts is contingent upon the lack of any adverse events that could cause the discontinuance of the programs, highlighting the importance of risk assessment and management in our operational strategies. We have also out-licensed internally developed programs to collaborators who are responsible for the research, development, and commercialization costs associated with these programs, allowing us to mitigate resource constraints while maintaining a focus on our major objectives. Our investments in drug candidates are subject to considerable risks, and we continuously evaluate our research and development expenses, which include internal and external costs incurred for the research and development of our drugs and drug candidates. The successful development of our drug candidates is highly uncertain and subject to a number of risks, including the potential for adverse data from clinical trials that could lead to the discontinuation or redirection of development activities. We believe that our ability to foresee, confront, and benefit from sudden disruptive change is critical for our survival and growth, enabling us to flourish in a competitive landscape characterized by uncertainty and environmental turbulence.

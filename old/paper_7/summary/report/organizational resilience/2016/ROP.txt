We are a diversified technology company that pursues consistent and sustainable growth in earnings and cash flow by emphasizing continuous improvement in the operating performance of our existing businesses and by acquiring other carefully selected businesses. Our acquisitions have represented both additions to existing businesses and new strategic platforms, which contribute to our ability to adapt and respond effectively to environmental disruptions. The preparation of financial statements requires the use of estimates, assumptions, judgments, and interpretations that can affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses, highlighting the need for operational flexibility in the face of uncertainties. We regularly review accounts receivable collectibility and inventory quantities to evaluate obsolescence and excessive quantities, which are critical for maintaining organizational health and performance under pressure. Our management discusses significant judgments with the audit committee, ensuring a systemic perspective in our financial reporting processes. The development of accounting estimates is the responsibility of our management, reflecting our commitment to organizational effectiveness and resilience strategies. We assess the fair value of our reporting units and consider various qualitative factors, including macroeconomic conditions and relevant industry trends, to determine potential impairments, which is essential for maintaining organizational integrity during adverse conditions. Negative industry or economic trends, disruptions to our business, and actual results significantly below projections may have a negative effect on the fair value of our reporting units, underscoring the importance of proactive measures and risk management. Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles, which provide a framework for evaluating our financial performance and resilience in the face of external pressures. We expect existing cash and cash equivalents, cash generated by our U.S. operations, our unsecured credit facility, and our expected ability to access the capital markets will be sufficient to fund operating requirements in the U.S. for the foreseeable future. The assessment of fair value for impairment purposes requires significant judgments to be made by management, reflecting our organizational capabilities and strategic foresight. We anticipate that our businesses will generate positive cash flows from operating activities, which will permit the reduction of currently outstanding debt in accordance with the repayment schedule, thereby enhancing our organizational resilience and adaptability. We also evaluate whether there has been an impairment of identifiable intangible assets when certain indicators of impairment are present, ensuring that we can confront and manage potential adversities effectively. The increase in backlog was due to acquisitions, which added to our capacity for future planning and resource generation. We believe that internally generated cash flows and the remaining availability under our credit facility will be adequate to finance normal operating requirements and future acquisition activities, demonstrating our commitment to operational continuity and strategic management in a turbulent market environment.

In 2016, we achieved record revenue of $59.4 billion, driven by growth in various business segments, including the data center and internet of things markets. The year was transformative as we transitioned from a PC-centric company to one that powers the cloud and billions of smart, connected devices. This strategic shift involved a 2016 restructuring program aimed at reducing headcount and reallocating resources to growth segments, thereby enhancing operational flexibility and adaptability in response to evolving business needs. The restructuring actions are expected to impact approximately 15,000 employees, with anticipated annual headcount savings of approximately $1.6 billion, which will be reinvested in areas that extend our leadership in technology and expand market opportunities. The integration of acquired businesses, such as Altera, has been a focal point, allowing us to deliver new products and grow despite external pressures. Our investment in research and development totaled $12.7 billion, reflecting our commitment to innovation and the development of new technologies, which are essential for maintaining competitive advantage and organizational resilience. The operational management strategies implemented during this period are designed to enhance our ability to absorb strain and maintain performance under challenging conditions. We have also focused on improving efficiencies and reallocating resources to align with strategic initiatives that support our long-term objectives. The ongoing assessment of our liquidity and capital resources indicates that we have sufficient financial resources to meet our business requirements, including capital expenditures and potential acquisitions. Our operational continuity is supported by a diverse investment portfolio and a robust cash flow from operations, which was approximately $21.8 billion in 2016. This financial stability enables us to confront unexpected situations and environmental disruptions effectively. The strategic planning processes in place facilitate our response to market volatility and ensure that we remain agile in the face of disruptive changes. Our commitment to organizational health is further demonstrated through our focus on stakeholder engagement and the development of collaborative networks that enhance our resilience strategies. The planned divestiture of non-core segments, such as the Intel Security Group, is part of our strategy to concentrate on areas with the highest growth potential, thereby reinforcing our organizational coherence and adaptability. Overall, our ability to reconfigure resources and respond to market demands positions us to thrive in a competitive landscape characterized by rapid technological advancements and changing customer needs.

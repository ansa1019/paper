In 2016, we continued to make progress on our three main revenue growth priorities, which include capitalizing on the shift to mobile, growing the number of marketers using our ad products, and enhancing the relevance and effectiveness of our ads through the adoption of newer formats and tools. We believe these strategic initiatives will support our organizational resilience by enabling us to adapt to changing market conditions and customer needs. Our investments in our ecosystem, particularly in the Facebook app and platform, as well as in long-term technology initiatives such as virtual reality and artificial intelligence, reflect our commitment to maintaining operational flexibility and enhancing our competitive advantage in a turbulent business environment. We anticipate that our expenses will continue to grow as we execute on these priorities, which include hiring top engineering talent and expanding our data center capacity to support rapid growth. The increase in user engagement metrics, such as daily and monthly active users, indicates our ability to absorb strain and maintain performance under challenging conditions. We define a daily active user as a registered Facebook user who logged in and visited Facebook through our website or mobile device, which underscores our focus on operational continuity and user engagement as key components of our resilience strategy. Our revenue growth is driven by an increase in demand for our ad inventory, influenced by user growth and engagement, as well as the quality and relevance of our ads. The significant increase in advertising revenue, particularly from mobile platforms, demonstrates our adaptability in responding to external pressures and market demands. We recognize that the performance of our business is influenced by various factors, including the geographic distribution of our users and the associated revenue generation capabilities. Our strategic response to these dynamics includes a focus on research and development, which has seen a substantial increase in investment to foster innovation and enhance our organizational capabilities. We also continually assess our operational resources and financial management practices to ensure we are well-positioned to confront potential risks and uncertainties. The complexities of our operational environment necessitate a multifaceted approach to resilience, encompassing effective resource allocation and strategic foresight. As we navigate through environmental disruptions and unexpected situations, our commitment to learning and adaptation remains paramount. We have established mechanisms for impact assessment and event management to enhance our crisis response capabilities. Our organizational practices are designed to foster collaboration and knowledge sharing, which are essential for maintaining organizational health and effectiveness. Overall, our focus on strategic adaptation and resource management positions us to thrive amid challenges and sustain our growth trajectory in the future.

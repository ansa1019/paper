The following discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this annual report on Form 10-K. Our clients look to us for an integrated view of the drivers of risk and return in their portfolios, which supports their needs for business continuity and operational flexibility. Our analytical tools and content help clients measure and manage risk across all major asset classes, enabling them to respond effectively to environmental disruptions. We focus on expanding and deepening our relationships with investment institutions worldwide, which is a strategic initiative aimed at enhancing our organizational resilience. Our growth strategy includes developing new and enhancing existing product offerings, which reflects our commitment to service innovation and adaptability in a competitive landscape. 

In evaluating our financial performance, we utilize operating metrics, including run rate and aggregate retention rate, which provide insight into our latest reported portfolio of recurring business. The aggregate retention rate is important because subscription cancellations decrease our run rate and ultimately our operating revenues. Our business model is characterized by recurring subscription revenues, which represent fees earned from clients primarily under renewable contracts. This model supports our ability to maintain performance under pressure and adapt to changing market conditions. 

We have made significant investments in our information technology infrastructure, which enhances our operational management capabilities and supports our resilience strategies. Our operating expenses are managed through strong expense management, particularly in the analytics segment, which reflects our ability to absorb strain and preserve functioning despite external pressures. The increase in our cash and cash equivalents indicates our financial resources are sufficient to fund ongoing operations and growth initiatives, ensuring our organizational health and sustainability.

As of December 31, 2016, our consolidated leverage ratio was 3.50:1.00, indicating our capacity to manage financial resources effectively while maintaining operational continuity. Our liquidity, along with other financing alternatives, will provide the necessary capital to fund acquisitions and achieve planned growth, which is essential for organizational transformation and resilience. The increase in cash flows from operating activities demonstrates our ability to generate resources that support our strategic response to market demands. 

We recognize the importance of stakeholder engagement and inter-organizational collaboration as mechanisms to enhance our resilience. Our focus on developing a learning organization fosters knowledge management and supports our adaptability in complex situations. The ability to foresee and confront challenges is integral to our organizational identity and success. We continue to assess risks and implement proactive measures to mitigate potential disruptions, ensuring our organizational capabilities are aligned with our major objectives.

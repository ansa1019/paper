The discussion in our management's discussion and analysis reflects our expectations regarding the continued transition of our business model and our ability to respond effectively to environmental disruptions. We are undergoing a business model transition in which we have discontinued selling new perpetual licenses for most of our products in favor of new model subscriptions. This transition has impacted revenue, margins, and cash flow from operations as more revenue is recognized ratably rather than upfront. We believe that customer adoption of our new offerings will continue to grow as customers across a range of industries begin to take advantage of the scalable computing power and flexibility provided through these new services. Our strategy entails both a technological shift and a business model shift, which requires us to reassess the way we allocate resources and evaluate financial performance. We have accelerated our move to the cloud and mobile devices and are offering more flexible licensing, which provides a device-independent, collaborative design workflow for designers and their stakeholders. The transition has necessitated a significant reassessment of our operational resources and capabilities, particularly as we adapt to the complexities and demands of a changing market landscape. 

Our significant reliance on major distributors and resellers has implications for our business continuity and operational flexibility. We anticipate that our channel mix will continue to change, particularly as we scale our digitally transacted online business. The establishment of a worldwide user group organization and online user communities facilitates the exchange of information related to the use of our products, enhancing our organizational resilience. We employ various incentive programs and promotions to align our direct and indirect channels with our business strategies, which are essential for maintaining competitive advantage in a turbulent market. 

Our restructuring plan aims to rebalance staffing levels and reduce operating expenses to better align them with the evolving needs of the company. The restructuring charges recorded during fiscal 2017 reflect our commitment to adapting to exceptional conditions and maintaining operational continuity. We continually review the trade-offs involved in making decisions regarding acquisitions, which are integral to our strategy of improving product functionality and expanding our offerings. 

As we progress through the business model transition, we expect to see fluctuations in our performance metrics, including annualized recurring revenue and growth of subscriptions, which better reflect business momentum. Our operational management strategies are designed to ensure that we can effectively confront and adapt to unexpected situations and external pressures. We believe that our existing balances, anticipated cash flows from operations, and available credit facility will be sufficient to meet our working capital and operating resource expenditure requirements for at least the next 12 months. The ongoing assessment of our organizational capabilities and the strategic initiatives we implement will be crucial in navigating the complexities of the current business environment and ensuring long-term sustainability and success.

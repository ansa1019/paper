The coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has caused significant disruptions to national and global economies, leading us to conduct our operations while responding to the pandemic with actions to mitigate adverse consequences to our employees, business, supply chain, and customers. We continue to prioritize the health and safety of our employees, encouraging and promoting vaccination across the company. The long-term impact on our business remains uncertain due to the pandemic's duration and broader implications. Our aerospace segment's operating results have experienced the most significant impact from the pandemic, with new aircraft deliveries reflecting our decision to reduce production rates to accommodate supply chain challenges and reduced demand. However, aircraft demand has been strong in 2021, with orders reaching their highest level in over a decade, indicating a recovery and adaptation to changing market conditions. Our U.S. government business continues to experience some disruption from the pandemic, particularly in our technologies segment, which highlights the need for operational flexibility and resilience strategies to navigate external pressures. The long-term outlook for our U.S. defense business is influenced by military funding priorities and our ability to evolve products to address a fast-changing threat environment, showcasing our organizational capabilities in adapting to complex situations. We expect our investment in the development of new aircraft products and technologies to support long-term growth in our aerospace segment, reflecting our commitment to innovation and resilience in the face of adversity. The technologies segment has seen increased IT services revenue due to the ramp-up of several new programs and higher volume on existing programs, demonstrating our ability to absorb strain and maintain operational continuity. Our emphasis on cash flow generation and cost control provides us with the flexibility for prudent capital deployment, allowing us to respond effectively to environmental disruptions and maintain a strong balance sheet for future opportunities. The total backlog, including funded and unfunded portions, was $87.6 billion, reflecting our capacity to manage resource allocation and strategic initiatives effectively. Our significant liabilities under defined benefit retirement plans are managed in accordance with IRS regulations, ensuring that our future cash requirements are met. We recognize the importance of stakeholder engagement and inter-organizational collaboration to enhance our resilience and adaptability. The diverse nature of our programs and customers, along with our insight into customer requirements, positions us to confront challenges and capitalize on opportunities in turbulent markets. Our ability to foresee and respond to changing conditions is crucial for maintaining organizational health and ensuring long-term success.

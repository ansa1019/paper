PG&E Corporation and the utility have taken aggressive steps to mitigate the threat of catastrophic wildfires, the spread of wildfires should they occur, and the impact of public safety power shutoff (PSPS) events. The utility has implemented operational changes and investments that reduce wildfire risk, including enhanced vegetation management, PSPS, and system hardening programs. These programs have been subject to significant scrutiny and criticism by various stakeholders, including the California Governor and the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC). The utility is committed to taking aggressive wildfire mitigation actions, although additional requirements imposed beyond current expectations could substantially impact its financial condition and operational effectiveness. The success of these wildfire mitigation efforts depends on various factors, including the utility's ability to retain or contract for the necessary workforce to execute these actions. The utility's financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows may be materially affected by uncertainties related to future wildfires, wildfire insurance, and regulatory reforms. The utility's wildfire mitigation initiatives will continue to involve substantial and ongoing expenditures, with the extent of cost recovery through rates remaining uncertain. The utility's ability to recover costs associated with wildfire-related claims is contingent upon regulatory approvals and the effectiveness of its risk mitigation strategies. The utility has recorded significant liabilities related to past wildfires, which may exceed potential amounts recoverable under applicable insurance policies. The financial impact of future wildfires could be mitigated through insurance, the wildfire fund, or other forms of cost recovery, although the utility may not be able to obtain sufficient wildfire insurance coverage at a reasonable cost. The utility's participation in the wildfire fund is subject to conditions set forth in AB 1054, and the financial impact of this legislation is uncertain. The utility is also subject to enhanced oversight and enforcement processes by the CPUC, which include additional reporting requirements and monitoring. The utility's financial results may continue to be impacted by the outcome of various enforcement, litigation, and regulatory matters. The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly affected the utility's financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows, primarily due to the economic hardship of its customers and the moratorium on service disconnections. The utility continues to monitor the overall impact of the pandemic and expects additional financial impacts in the future. The utility's ability to fund operations, finance capital expenditures, and make scheduled principal and interest payments depends on its operating cash flows and access to capital markets. The utility's credit ratings may be affected by the outcomes of pending enforcement and litigation matters, which could impact the cost and availability of short-term borrowings and long-term debt. The utility's operational flexibility and resilience strategies are critical in navigating the complexities of regulatory compliance, environmental disruptions, and market volatility. The utility's approach to risk management includes assessing the potential impact of external pressures and adapting its strategies to maintain operational continuity and organizational health.

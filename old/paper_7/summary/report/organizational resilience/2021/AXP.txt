We are a globally integrated payments company with a significant ownership position in American Express Global Business Travel (GBT). Our strategy of investing in our customers, brand, and talent is helping to drive share, scale, and relevance. The adverse impacts on our business due to the COVID-19 pandemic were mitigated through the successful execution of our investment strategy, resulting in a steady recovery in our business. We believe that continuing our strategy of investing at high levels will position us well to deliver sustainable and profitable long-term growth. Our results reflect strong growth momentum, with worldwide network volumes increasing 24 percent compared to the prior year, indicating operational flexibility and adaptability in response to external pressures. The increase in discount revenue was driven primarily by growth in card member spending, demonstrating our resilience in maintaining performance under pressure. Provisions for credit losses decreased, resulting in a net benefit primarily due to improved portfolio quality and macroeconomic outlook, showcasing our ability to absorb strain and preserve functioning despite adversity. Our ongoing investments in differentiated value propositions and the expansion of our digital capabilities are helping to drive increased card member engagement and strong retention rates, which are critical for organizational health and competitive advantage. We expect to continue to manage our capital levels and ratios within our target range, reflecting a proactive approach to risk management and resource allocation. The global macroeconomic outlook remains uncertain, but we monitor the changing environment and manage our balance sheet to reflect evolving circumstances. Our capital strategy aims to retain sufficient levels of capital generated through net income to maintain a strong balance sheet and provide flexibility to support future business growth. We have implemented a comprehensive enterprise-wide risk management program to identify, aggregate, monitor, and manage risks, which includes defining our risk appetite and governance structure. The risk committee of our board provides oversight of our risk management processes, ensuring that we can confront and adapt to unexpected situations. Our operational risk management framework is designed to measure and manage risks associated with inadequate or failed processes, people, or systems, ensuring that we can recover from operational disruptions. Additionally, we are enhancing our focus on climate-related risks within our risk governance framework, recognizing the interconnected nature of these risks with our overall organizational resilience. Our ability to effectively manage compliance risk is crucial to maintaining our reputation and operational continuity, as we seek to mitigate legal and reputational harm through a robust compliance risk management program. The implementation of our strategic initiatives is guided by our commitment to operational excellence and continuous improvement, ensuring that we can navigate complex situations and maintain our organizational effectiveness in a turbulent market environment.

The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly impacted the global economy and strained the hospitality industry since the beginning of 2020. The pandemic has had a material adverse impact on our results, and the ultimate impact on the company's business, financial performance, and results of operations remains uncertain. Although we have observed signs of economic recovery, we cannot determine when the global economy will fully recover. The restrictions and reduction in travel resulted in the suspensions of operations at certain hotels throughout 2020; however, reopenings significantly outpaced new suspensions during 2021, with nearly all hotels that suspended operations reopening by December 31, 2021. We are focused on the growth of our business by expanding our share of the global hospitality industry through our development pipeline, which includes hotels that we expect to add to our system in the future. Our strategic objectives include the continued expansion of our global portfolio and fee-based business. We evaluate the economic viability of new hotels based on geographic location and other factors, thereby ensuring resource allocation aligns with our major objectives. The current economic environment has posed challenges to the execution of our strategy, including delays in openings and new development. We believe that we have good relationships with our third-party owners, franchisees, and developers, which allow us to maintain our presence and generate new opportunities for property development that can support our growth. The effectiveness of any cost-cutting efforts related to owning and leasing hotels is limited by the amount of inherent fixed costs. We have taken steps to reduce our fixed costs to levels we believe are appropriate to maximize profitability and respond to expected future market conditions. The hospitality industry is seasonal in nature, and we expect our revenues to be lower in the first quarter of each year than in the subsequent quarters. Our relationships with third-party owners and franchisees allow us to maintain our current presence and generate new incremental opportunities for property development. The COVID-19 pandemic has caused us to temporarily change our cash management strategy, but we have a long-term investment policy focused on the preservation of capital and maximizing returns. We have continued access to debt markets and expect to be able to obtain financing if necessary. Our objectives include maintaining the availability of liquidity while minimizing operational costs. We believe that our cash position and sources of liquidity will meet anticipated requirements for operating and other expenditures for the foreseeable future. The pandemic has highlighted the importance of operational flexibility and adaptability in our business model. We are committed to the continued growth and development of our relationships with third-party owners, franchisees, and developers, which are essential for our organizational resilience. The ongoing recovery from the pandemic has resulted in increased occupancy and revenues, reflecting our ability to adapt to changing market conditions and customer needs. Our strategic initiatives and resilience strategies are designed to enhance our operational capabilities and ensure our long-term sustainability in a turbulent market environment.

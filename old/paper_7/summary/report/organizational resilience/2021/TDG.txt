The COVID-19 pandemic has continued to cause a significant adverse impact on our net sales, net income, and EBITDA as defined when compared to pre-pandemic levels. Historically, we have achieved steady, long-term growth in sales and improvements in operating performance due to our competitive strengths and execution of our value-driven operating strategy. Our strategy includes obtaining profitable new business, carefully controlling the cost structure, and pricing our highly engineered value-added products to reflect the value we provide and the resources required. The integration of certain acquisitions into our existing businesses has resulted in improvements in financial performance. Our diversified revenue base reduces dependence on any particular product or market channel, which has been significant in maintaining financial performance. As a result of the pandemic, many of our businesses have explored new opportunities by developing highly engineered solutions for emerging needs, including anti-viral technology and air purification. We believe that our selective acquisition strategy, combined with our operational flexibility and knowledge of niche markets, positions us to adapt to changing customer needs and market conditions. The pandemic has prompted us to take immediate and aggressive action to minimize its spread in our workplaces and reduce costs, including workforce reductions to align with customer demand. We have incurred restructuring costs related to these actions, which are not expected to recur once the pandemic subsides. Our management continues to strategically manage cash and liquidity in response to the ongoing uncertainties caused by the pandemic. We expect our efforts to generate strong margins and provide sufficient cash from operating activities to meet our interest obligations and liquidity needs. The company remains committed to maintaining a lean cost structure and improving operational efficiency, which are critical for resilience in the face of external pressures. We continue to monitor for any indicators of impairment of goodwill and intangible assets, particularly in light of the adverse global economic conditions attributable to the pandemic. Our ability to respond effectively to these challenges is supported by our organizational practices, which emphasize adaptability and strategic foresight. The ongoing management of our cash and capital resources is crucial for navigating the complexities of the current business environment, ensuring that we can meet our obligations and pursue growth opportunities. The companyâ€™s focus on innovation and strategic adaptation is integral to maintaining operational continuity and achieving long-term success in a turbulent market landscape.

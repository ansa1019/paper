The companies make forward-looking statements with full knowledge that risks and uncertainties exist that may cause actual results to differ materially from predicted results. Factors that may cause actual results to differ include unusual weather conditions and their effect on energy sales to customers and energy commodity prices, extreme weather events and other natural disasters, including hurricanes and flooding, and the impact of extraordinary external events, such as the current pandemic health event resulting from COVID-19. These factors can lead to extended disruption of economic activity in the markets and global supply chains, affecting operational flexibility and business continuity. Risks associated with operational hazards, including adverse developments with respect to pipeline and plant safety or integrity, operator error, and other catastrophic events, highlight the importance of resilience strategies and mechanisms to mitigate risks. The companies face challenges related to changes in regulatory structures and environmental laws, which may impose additional pressures on operational management and resource allocation. The inability to complete planned construction or growth projects due to increased public involvement or litigation can impact organizational performance and adaptability. The companies are also subject to risks associated with competition in the industries in which they operate, including potential competition from alternative energy sources. Changes in demand for services, fluctuations in energy-related commodity prices, and the need for effective crisis management and response strategies are critical for maintaining organizational health and performance under pressure. The companies' ability to foresee and confront sudden disruptive changes is essential for survival and growth, necessitating a focus on strategic initiatives and inter-organizational collaboration. The evaluation of regulatory assets and liabilities is influenced by the likelihood of recovery through future rates, which requires a systemic perspective on resource deployment and financial management. The companies must also navigate uncertainties related to domestic and international natural gas production and consumption, which can affect their operational resources and strategic response to market volatility. The anticipated impacts of future environmental regulations and climate change initiatives necessitate proactive measures to ensure compliance and sustainability. The companies' strategic planning includes considerations for capital expenditures and the potential for significant investments in support of clean energy initiatives, reflecting a commitment to organizational resilience in the face of evolving market demands and regulatory landscapes.

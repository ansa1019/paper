BlackRock continues to actively monitor COVID-19 developments and their potential impact on the company's employees, business, and operations, particularly in jurisdictions where BlackRock has significant employee populations and/or business activity. The aggregate extent to which COVID-19, including existing and new variants, affects BlackRock's business, results of operations, and financial condition will depend on future developments that are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted. BlackRock's diversified platform, in terms of style, product, client, and geography, enables it to generate more stable cash flows through market cycles, positioning BlackRock to invest for the long term by striking an appropriate balance between investing for future growth and prudent discretionary expense management. BlackRock's strategy continues to be guided by the company's purpose and focus on the long-term, which the company believes better enables it to deliver durable returns for shareholders and create value for all of its stakeholders. The company's framework for long-term shareholder value creation is predicated on generating differentiated organic growth, leveraging scale to increase operating margins over time, and returning capital to shareholders on a consistent basis. BlackRock's long-term strategy remains to keep alpha at the heart of BlackRock; accelerate growth in ETFs, illiquid alternatives, and technology; deliver whole portfolio solutions and become the global leader in sustainable investing. BlackRock believes it is well positioned for a rising rate environment due to the breadth, diversification, and performance of its fixed income platform, which encompasses active, ETF, and non-ETF index fixed income products, and a range of strategies. The company's highly diversified multi-product platform was created to meet client needs in all market environments. BlackRock is positioned to provide alpha-seeking active, index, and cash management investment strategies across asset classes and geographies. The diversity of BlackRock's platform facilitates the generation of organic growth in various market environments and as client preferences evolve. BlackRock's investment management revenue is primarily comprised of fees earned as a percentage of assets under management (AUM) and, in some cases, performance fees, which are normally expressed as a percentage of fund returns to the client. Numerous factors, including price movements in the equity, debt, or currency markets, or in the price of real assets, commodities, or alternative investments in which BlackRock invests on behalf of clients, and BlackRock's ability to maintain strong investment performance, could impact BlackRock's AUM, revenue, and earnings. BlackRock continues to invest in technology services offerings, which enhance the ability to manage portfolios and risk, effectively serve clients, and operate efficiently. Anticipated industry consolidation and regulatory requirements should continue to drive demand for holistic and flexible technology solutions. BlackRock is focused on enhancing Aladdin, with continued investment into areas such as whole portfolio, private markets, wealth, and a leading sustainable investing solution. BlackRock is committed to helping clients build more resilient portfolios, making sustainability integral to the way BlackRock manages risk, constructs portfolios, designs products, and engages with companies. The company has been deepening the integration of sustainability into technology, risk management, and product choice across BlackRock, and plans to accelerate those efforts.

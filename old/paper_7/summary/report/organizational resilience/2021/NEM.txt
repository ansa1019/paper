Newmont has been closely monitoring the COVID-19 pandemic and its impacts on our business, recognizing that the unprecedented nature of the pandemic makes it difficult to predict the extent and duration of any potential adverse financial impact. The company has adopted a risk-based approach to business travel, providing flexible and remote working plans for employees, and maintaining effective contact tracing procedures and social distancing protocols. We incurred incremental direct costs related to our response to the COVID-19 pandemic, which reflect our commitment to operational continuity and the health of our workforce and local communities. The company’s goal is to create value and improve lives through sustainable and responsible mining, which aligns with our strategic initiatives aimed at enhancing organizational resilience. We have developed a disciplined cash allocation strategy to maintain financial flexibility, allowing us to self-fund development projects and make strategic partnerships focused on profitable growth while reducing debt and returning cash to stockholders. The COVID-19 pandemic has had a material impact on the global economy, and we recognize the need for operational flexibility and adaptability in response to potential disruptions. Our financial position, including cash and cash equivalents, is viewed as adequate to fund operations and corporate activities, enabling us to manage near-term impacts effectively. We have also engaged in strategic collaborations, such as our alliance with Caterpillar Inc., to develop and implement a comprehensive all-electric autonomous mining system aimed at achieving zero emissions mining, which supports our long-term sustainability objectives. The company’s operational practices include maintaining robust controls at our mines, which are essential for resilience in the face of external pressures and environmental perturbations. We continuously evaluate our strategic priorities and the deployment of capital to ensure we execute on our major objectives and provide long-term value. The establishment of joint ventures, such as the Nevada Gold Mines LLC, exemplifies our approach to inter-organizational collaboration, enhancing our competitive advantage and operational effectiveness. We are committed to the implementation of the Global Industry Standard on Tailings Management and compliance with evolving environmental regulations, which are critical for maintaining our organizational health and integrity. The company’s ongoing efforts to assess risks, including those related to climate change and operational challenges, reflect our proactive measures to enhance resilience and ensure the sustainability of our operations. Our strategic response to disruptions, including the COVID-19 pandemic, demonstrates our ability to adapt and recover, maintaining performance under pressure and ensuring the long-term success of our operations.

We operate in the highly competitive omni-channel retail industry in all of the markets we serve, facing strong sales competition from various types of stores and ecommerce businesses. Our performance is influenced by numerous factors, including catastrophic events, weather and climate change risks, global health epidemics such as the COVID-19 pandemic, competitive pressures, consumer behavior, supply chain disruptions, and economic conditions. We expect continued uncertainty in our business and the global economy due to the duration and intensity of the COVID-19 pandemic, supply chain disruptions, and volatility in employment trends and consumer confidence, which may impact our results. We have taken certain strategic actions to strengthen our portfolio for the long term, including divestitures that have allowed us to reallocate resources and focus on core operations. Our commitment to helping customers save money and live better through everyday low prices is supported by a financial framework that emphasizes strong, efficient growth, consistent operating discipline, and strategic capital allocation. We prioritize strong, efficient growth by focusing on productive opportunities, increasing comparable store and club sales, and expanding ecommerce initiatives that complement our overall strategy. Our operational discipline involves managing expenses, optimizing efficiency, and investing in technology and process improvements to enhance productivity and reduce costs. We measure operating discipline through expense leverage, ensuring that net sales grow at a faster rate than operating expenses. Our strategic capital allocation focuses on enhancing customer-facing initiatives, supply chain improvements, and technology investments, while reducing capital expenditures on new store openings. Our liquidity and capital resources are bolstered by strong cash flows from operations, which provide a significant source of liquidity to fund operations and investments. We utilize intercompany financing arrangements to ensure cash availability in the necessary jurisdictions, and we have access to various credit facilities to support our international operations. Our approach to risk management includes assessing potential impacts from external disturbances and maintaining operational flexibility to adapt to changing market conditions. We continuously evaluate our organizational practices and capabilities to ensure resilience against future challenges, focusing on maintaining operational continuity and performance under pressure. Our ability to absorb strain and preserve functioning despite adversity is critical to our long-term success, as we navigate complex situations and strive for sustainable growth. We recognize the importance of collaboration networks and inter-organizational collaboration in enhancing our resilience strategies, enabling us to confront challenges effectively and emerge stronger from disruptive events. Our commitment to organizational learning and adaptability is essential in maintaining a competitive advantage in a turbulent market environment.

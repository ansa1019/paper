In fiscal 2021, we delivered growth in revenue in a very challenging environment, as customers accelerated their digitization and cloud investments stemming from the COVID-19 pandemic. We focused on executing and innovating to support and assist that transition, reflecting our commitment to organizational resilience. The pandemic has driven organizations globally to digitize their operations and support remote workforces at an unprecedented scale. Our strategy is to help our customers connect, secure, and automate to accelerate their digital agility in a cloud-first world, which is essential for maintaining operational flexibility and adapting to external pressures. We have partnered with several of our key suppliers to address supply chain challenges, demonstrating our resource allocation and risk mitigation strategies. The actions we have taken include providing a variety of free offers and trials for our technologies, which support business continuity and customer needs during this period of disruption. We are moving towards a hybrid work model, giving our employees the flexibility to work offsite or at onsite locations, which enhances our organizational health and adaptability. Our ongoing consideration of the economic implications of the COVID-19 pandemic on our critical accounting estimates reflects our resilience strategies in navigating uncertainty. The restructuring plan initiated during fiscal 2021 aimed to realign the organization and enable further investment in key priority areas, which is expected to generate significant cost savings and enhance our operational management. We continue to operate in a challenging macroeconomic and highly competitive environment, yet we remain focused on accelerating innovation across our portfolio. The increase in deferred product revenue was primarily due to increased deferrals related to our recurring software offerings, indicating our ability to adapt and respond to changing market conditions. Our liquidity and capital resources remain strong, allowing us to utilize our cash resources for strategic investments, which is critical in times of environmental turbulence. The increase in purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers demonstrates our proactive measures to secure long-term supply and pricing for certain product components, reflecting our strategic foresight and resilience in managing supply chain complexities. We believe our inventory and purchase commitments are in line with our current demand forecasts, ensuring we can confront future challenges effectively. Our commitment to supporting our employees, customers, partners, and communities during this extraordinary time underscores our organizational capabilities and crisis management approach, positioning us for future success amidst ongoing uncertainties.

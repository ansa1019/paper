We are North America's leading provider of comprehensive waste management environmental services, providing services throughout the United States and Canada. Our company has a long-standing commitment to sustainability and environmental stewardship, which includes a focus on making the communities we serve safe, resilient, and sustainable. Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, we have proactively taken steps to prioritize our employees' and customers' needs, ensuring business continuity and operational flexibility. Our disciplined execution in daily operations has positioned the company to manage the challenges presented by COVID-19 effectively. The impacts of the pandemic on the global economy have influenced our business across various customer types, but we have seen a recovery in volumes that have now surpassed pre-pandemic levels in many areas. We monitor developments in the waste industry to adapt our service offerings, including expanding traditional recycling services and increasing organics collection to meet evolving customer needs. Our sustainability agenda includes expanding recycling and focuses on meeting specific sustainability goals that align with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. We encounter intense competition and must dynamically manage our cost structure in response to volume changes and inflation. Our strategic pricing efforts aim to recover inflationary cost increases, and we are focused on operational efficiencies and cost controls to maintain and grow our earnings and cash flow. The constrained labor market has resulted in increased costs for wage adjustments and training new hires, impacting our operational management. Our focus on investing in our people and digital platforms is intended to enhance our organizational capabilities and ensure we can adapt to future challenges. We have made significant investments in recycling automation technology and customer service digitalization to optimize operational efficiency and improve labor productivity. Our integration of Advanced Disposal has been a key focus, ensuring uninterrupted service to our customers through the integration of digital platforms. We believe our industry-leading asset network and strategic focus will provide the necessary tools to address evolving challenges. The companyâ€™s commitment to continuous improvement, resilience strategies, and adaptability in the face of external pressures is evident in our operational practices and strategic initiatives. We remain focused on delivering outstanding customer service while managing variable costs and investing in technology that enhances customer experience. Our approach to risk management includes assessing the impact of environmental disruptions and market volatility, which informs our strategic response and preparedness for future uncertainties. We are optimistic about our volume recovery and overall economic recovery, while acknowledging the potential for future challenges that could impact our operations and financial performance.

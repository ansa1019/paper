In fiscal year 2021, we continued to execute our growth strategy, including the announcement of several new gasification, carbon capture, and hydrogen projects that will drive the world's energy transition from fossil fuels. We remained focused on our base business, delivering consistent results despite external challenges globally and absorbing costs for additional resources needed to support growth. Our operations were organized into five reportable business segments under which we managed our operations, assessed performance, and reported earnings. We experienced significantly higher energy and natural gas costs in the second half of fiscal year 2021, particularly in North America and Europe. Contractual provisions associated with our on-site business allow us to pass these costs to our customers, which supports our operational flexibility and resilience in the face of external pressures. The duration and extent of ongoing global challenges, such as rising energy costs and supply chain disruptions, remain uncertain, yet we plan to continue pricing actions to recover higher energy costs. We expect to add new projects to our onsite business model, which generates stable cash flow and has contractual protection from energy cost fluctuations. Our commitment to sustainability goals, including reducing carbon dioxide emissions intensity, reflects our strategic initiatives toward organizational resilience. We have built leading positions in growth markets such as helium and liquefied natural gas process technology and equipment, which enhances our competitive advantage. The positive volumes from new assets and merchant demand recovery from COVID-19 were partially offset by reduced contributions from the Lu'an gasification project. Our focus on pricing actions, including energy cost recovery, resulted in price improvement across our regional segments, demonstrating our adaptability to market conditions. We expect our equity affiliates' income to grow in future periods due to our investment in the Jazan integrated gasification and power company joint venture, which aligns with our future orientation and resilience strategies. Our management's discussion and analysis emphasizes the importance of maintaining operational continuity and organizational effectiveness amid external disturbances. We recognize the need for effective risk management and resource allocation to navigate complex situations and ensure performance maintenance. The anticipated impacts of rising energy costs and planned maintenance activities on our facilities in fiscal year 2022 highlight the necessity of proactive measures and strategic foresight in our operations. Our commitment to creating shareholder value through capital deployment and delivering increased dividends reflects our organizational health and resilience. The strategic reorganization of our industrial gases segments, effective October 1, 2021, aims to enhance our operational coherence and adaptability to market demands. We continue to focus on our internal knowledge and capabilities, fostering a learning organization that can effectively confront and benefit from sudden disruptive changes. Our approach to managing environmental perturbations and operational resources underscores our commitment to organizational survival and transformation in a turbulent market landscape.

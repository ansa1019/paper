In 2021, we delivered strong sales performance in an environment where COVID-19 infections impacted business activity and further disrupted global supply chains, which together impacted the global recovery. We undertook extraordinary measures to assure our customers were supplied with our critical products and services. The impact of COVID-19 on our operations has required us to adapt and respond effectively to environmental disruptions, demonstrating our organizational resilience. We have continued to generate strong cash flow from operations, allowing us to fund our ongoing operations, investments in our business, acquisitions, debt repayments, pension obligations, and return cash to our shareholders through share repurchases and dividend payments. Our strong balance sheet has allowed us continued access to capital at attractive rates, which is a critical component of our organizational health and resilience strategies. 

The restructuring activities we implemented, including the institutional advancement program and accelerate 2020, are designed to enhance our organizational capabilities and operational flexibility. These initiatives aim to reduce complexity and management layers, consolidate facilities, and focus on key long-term growth areas by leveraging technology and structural improvements. We anticipate that these restructuring charges will be completed by 2023, with expected annual cost savings that will contribute to our resilience in facing future challenges. 

The COVID-19 pandemic has also led to increased demand for certain products, which we have worked hard to meet, reflecting our ability to absorb strain and preserve functioning despite adversity. Our operational management strategies have included adjustments to our resource allocation and deployment to ensure we can respond to unexpected situations effectively. 

We recognize the importance of maintaining a strong operational continuity plan to navigate through crises and external pressures. Our commitment to strategic initiatives, including inter-organizational collaboration and future planning, has positioned us to confront the challenges posed by environmental perturbations and market volatility. We have also focused on enhancing our organizational intelligence and absorptive capacity to better manage risks and uncertainties.

Our financial metrics, including net debt to EBITDA ratios, indicate the operational and financial health of our organization, which is essential for maintaining resilience. We continue to evaluate our cash position in light of future developments, ensuring we are prepared for any potential disruptions. The ongoing global economic and political environment, including the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and geopolitical tensions, underscores the need for strategic foresight and adaptability in our business operations. 

Overall, our organizational practices reflect a commitment to resilience, enabling us to foresee, confront, and benefit from sudden disruptive changes, thereby ensuring our survival and growth in a turbulent market landscape.

Moody's continues to closely monitor the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on all aspects of its business, including decisions on the reopening of offices and business travel policies. The company has reopened most of its offices for employees to access on a voluntary basis. The pandemic has not had a material adverse impact on the company's reported results to date and is currently not expected to have a material adverse impact on its near-term outlook. However, Moody's is unable to predict the longer-term impact that the pandemic may have on its business due to numerous uncertainties. The company leverages its industry expertise across multiple risks to deliver integrated risk assessment solutions that enable business leaders to identify, measure, and manage the implications of interrelated risks and opportunities. The strategic reorganization of the MA segment, which was completed in the second quarter of 2021, aimed to enhance operational flexibility and resource allocation by reconfiguring reporting units to better align with business objectives. This reorganization did not result in a change to the company's reportable segments, and qualitative assessments were performed to ensure that the fair value of reporting units was maintained. Moody's evaluates its reporting units on an annual basis or more frequently if there are changes in the reporting structure due to acquisitions or indicators of potential impairment, thereby ensuring adaptability and resilience in its operational practices. The company assesses various qualitative factors to determine whether the fair value of a reporting unit may be less than its carrying amount, which reflects a proactive approach to risk management and organizational health. The company's ability to absorb strain and preserve functioning despite adversity is evident in its strategic initiatives and operational management practices. The company has also recognized the importance of collaboration networks and stakeholder engagement in enhancing organizational resilience. The impact of acquisitions on comparative results reflects the company's commitment to growth and adaptation in a competitive landscape, while the focus on strategic planning and future orientation underscores its resilience strategies. The companyâ€™s financial resources and operational continuity are managed to ensure performance under pressure, which is critical for maintaining organizational effectiveness and success. The emphasis on learning organization principles and knowledge management further supports the company's resilience in navigating complex situations and external disturbances. Moody's recognizes that the ability to foresee and confront disruptive change is essential for survival, and it continues to invest in technological advancements and human capital to foster organizational agility and transformation.

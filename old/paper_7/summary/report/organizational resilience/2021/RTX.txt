We are leveraging the raytheon merger to undertake various strategic initiatives to transform the company and increase our existing focus on operational excellence. These initiatives include significant investments in digital technologies across our business to enhance our products and services, which reflects our commitment to service innovation and operational flexibility. The COVID-19 pandemic continues to negatively affect the global economy, our business and operations, supply chains, and the industries in which we operate. Our RIS and RMD businesses, although experiencing some negative impacts, primarily from supply chain pressures and labor shortages, have not experienced significant business disruptions as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. We continue to monitor for any further government guidance related to COVID-19 that may be issued. The impact of the pandemic has created uncertainties that could impact our businesses, and we believe that our long-term outlook remains positive due to the fundamental drivers of air travel demand. However, we acknowledge that the recovery is tied to general economic conditions and may be impacted by inflation or government budget deficits. We are continuously evaluating our cost structure and have implemented restructuring actions in an effort to keep our cost structure competitive, which is essential for maintaining organizational health and resilience. Our focus on program execution and the prudent management of capital and investments is aimed at maximizing operating income and cash, which are critical for performance maintenance under pressure. We have a strong focus on risk management and have implemented measures to mitigate risks associated with our operations. Our total backlog was approximately $156 billion as of December 31, 2021, which represents our remaining performance obligations and reflects our ability to adapt to changing market conditions. The organizational changes we have made, including the reorganization of certain product areas, are intended to efficiently leverage our capabilities and enhance our resilience strategies. We believe that our cash on hand and future operating cash flows will be sufficient to meet our future operating cash needs, which is vital for our operational continuity. We are also focused on developing advanced technologies through specific technology-focused business acquisitions, which supports our strategic adaptation and enhances our competitive advantage. The ongoing assessment of our operational resources and strategic response mechanisms is crucial in navigating the complexities of the current business environment. The challenges posed by external pressures, including political factors and economic fluctuations, require us to maintain a proactive approach to crisis management and organizational change processes. Our commitment to fostering a learning organization is evident in our efforts to absorb knowledge and adapt to unexpected situations, ensuring that we remain resilient in the face of adversity.

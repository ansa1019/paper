Throughout fiscal 2021, the COVID-19 pandemic impacted our business results and operations globally, leading to temporary store closures and reduced hours due to mandatory lockdowns. Despite these disruptions, we achieved record revenues, which increased 19% to $44.5 billion, demonstrating our ability to maintain performance under pressure. Our Nike Direct business fueled growth during the pandemic, leveraging digital platforms to connect directly with consumers, resulting in a 60% increase in digital revenues on a currency-neutral basis. We have focused on increasing our speed and agility to market, aligning our product creation and category organizations around a new consumer construct, and simplifying our operating model to optimize effectiveness. The strategic initiatives implemented, including the Consumer Direct Acceleration strategy, are designed to create a marketplace of the future that aligns more closely with consumer needs and preferences. This approach emphasizes operational flexibility and responsiveness, allowing us to adapt to unexpected situations and external pressures. 

Management announced a series of leadership and operating model changes to streamline execution, resulting in a net reduction of our global workforce, which is expected to yield future annual wage-related savings that will be reinvested to support the next phase of our strategy. We continue to monitor the evolving situation and may take additional actions based on guidance from health authorities, indicating our preparedness for crisis management. The pandemic has highlighted the importance of business continuity and resilience strategies, as we navigate supply chain disruptions and adjust our operating plans accordingly. 

Our financial position remains strong, with $13.5 billion in cash and equivalents, reflecting effective resource allocation and risk management. The transition to a distributor operating model in certain markets is anticipated to enhance profitability while reducing exposure to foreign exchange rate volatility. We are committed to effectively managing our business and mitigating financial market risks to achieve long-term financial goals. The resilience demonstrated during fiscal 2021 underscores our capacity to confront and benefit from sudden disruptive changes, ensuring organizational survival and success in a turbulent market environment. 

We have significantly reduced the number of undifferentiated wholesale accounts and prioritized product allocation to benefit Nike Direct and strategic wholesale customers, indicating a proactive approach to reconfiguring our market strategy. The increase in comparable store sales, despite temporary closures, reflects our ability to adapt and respond to changing consumer demands. Our strategic focus on digital transformation and operational continuity positions us to thrive amidst environmental disruptions and complex situations, reinforcing our organizational strength and agility.

We have a history of innovation in the semiconductor industry and offer thousands of products that are used in end products such as enterprise and data center networking, home connectivity, broadband access, telecommunication equipment, and data center servers. Our infrastructure software solutions enable customers to plan, develop, automate, manage, and secure applications across mainframe, distributed, mobile, and cloud platforms, thereby enhancing operational flexibility and resilience. We seek to achieve a robust business model designed to drive diversified and sustainable operating and financial results through responsibly financed acquisitions and extensive investment in research and development. The demand for our products has been affected by various factors, including economic conditions and the shift to cloud-based solutions, which may adversely affect the timing and volume of sales. In response to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, we have taken extensive measures to protect the health and safety of our employees, modifying workplace practices globally, which has resulted in some employees working remotely. We continue to monitor the implications of the pandemic on our business, as well as on our customers' and suppliers' businesses, demonstrating our adaptability to unexpected situations. We have also taken various actions to de-risk our business in light of ongoing uncertainty and strengthen our balance sheet, including closely managing working capital and debt instruments. Our ability to predict the impact of COVID-19 on our business remains limited, and we recognize that the effects of the pandemic may not be fully realized until future periods. The macroeconomic environment remains uncertain, and we continue to experience various constraints in our supply chain due to the pandemic. We recognize revenue upon the delivery of our products to distributors, which can cause our quarterly net revenue to fluctuate significantly. Our relationships with large global electronic component distributors and leading OEM customers have been built over years of collaborative product development, providing us with key insights into our customers' businesses and enabling us to better serve our target markets. Our strategy includes combining technology leadership with unmatched scale to deliver a comprehensive suite of infrastructure technology products. The organizational structure has been refined to align costs with the segments benefiting from shared expenses, enhancing our operational coherence. We believe our enterprise-wide license model will continue to offer customers reduced complexity and increased flexibility, which is essential for maintaining organizational health and performance under pressure. Our financial condition reflects the strategic initiatives we have undertaken to adapt to market demands and external pressures, ensuring our resilience in a turbulent business environment. The ongoing evaluation of our operational practices and intercompany transfer pricing is critical for maintaining our organizational effectiveness and managing risks associated with tax compliance. We continuously assess our operational resources and capabilities to ensure we can respond effectively to environmental disruptions and maintain performance.

Regulatory and legislative risks could affect our ability to respond effectively to environmental disruptions and transform ourselves to emerge stronger from challenging situations. The covid-19 pandemic has impacted our operations and business continuity, as a significant number of essential employees may be quarantined, which could affect our functioning and operational flexibility. We are monitoring and reacting to the evolving nature of the pandemic and governmental responses, which may heighten many of the other risks described. A significant cybersecurity incident could disrupt our business operations, and while we maintain comprehensive security programs, we are continually targeted by threat actors. Such disruptions could interrupt our service, cause operational difficulties, and impact our efficiency. Our operations are subject to extensive federal and state environmental laws, and the risk of incurring environmental liability is inherent in the railroad business. Severe weather and disasters have caused significant business interruptions, and climate change may increase the frequency and severity of adverse weather conditions, leading to increased costs and decreased revenues. We face competition from other transportation providers, and any future improvements in alternative modes of transportation could materially affect our ability to compete. Capacity constraints related to increased demand for rail services or severe weather could negatively impact our service and operational efficiency. Our ability to provide rail service depends on a functioning global supply chain and maintaining collaborative relationships with connecting carriers. Labor agreements and potential strikes could also adversely affect our operations. The potential for terrorism or war poses a risk of significant business interruption. We may be affected by supply constraints resulting from disruptions in fuel markets, which could impact our operations and customer service. We are subject to various claims and lawsuits that could result in significant expenditures, and catastrophic rail accidents could compromise critical parts of our rail network. Our financial condition may be adversely affected by negative changes in economic conditions, including reduced import and export volumes. We rely on capital markets for financing, and instability could restrict our access to financing sources. Our goal is to maintain a capital structure with appropriate leverage to support our business strategy and provide flexibility through business cycles. We regularly review estimates and assumptions based on historical experience and changes in the business environment. Our business may be seriously harmed if we fail to develop, implement, maintain, upgrade, enhance, protect, and integrate our information technology systems. Future pandemics or similar events may cause operational challenges that could adversely affect our financial results. The ongoing impacts of the covid-19 pandemic could lead to a reduction in cash flows from operations, and we continue to monitor these risks closely.

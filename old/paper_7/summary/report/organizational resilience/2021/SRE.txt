In 2021, we set out to simplify Sempra's business model and sharpen our focus on our mission to be North America's premier energy infrastructure company, which reflects our adaptability and strategic initiatives in response to external pressures. Our operational and financial results demonstrate our ability to absorb strain and maintain performance despite challenges, including the consolidation of our non-utility energy infrastructure assets and significant capital expenditures. We formed Sempra Infrastructure to develop, build, operate, and invest in energy infrastructure, which is crucial for enabling the energy transition in North American markets and globally. Our operations have been identified as critical or essential services during the COVID-19 pandemic, highlighting our organizational resilience in maintaining service continuity. We have taken proactive measures to protect the health and well-being of our employees and stakeholders while ensuring minimal interruption to our services. Our liquidity is supported by cash flows from operations, unrestricted cash, and access to credit facilities, which are vital for funding capital expenditures and maintaining operational flexibility. We expect to meet our cash requirements through various sources, including project financing and distributions from equity method investments, which underscores our resource allocation strategies. The impact of foreign currency and inflation rates on our results of operations has been monitored closely, and we utilize foreign currency derivatives to mitigate risks associated with these external disturbances. Our discussions on significant changes in revenues, costs, and earnings reflect our ongoing assessment of operational effectiveness and adaptability to market conditions. The establishment of new franchise agreements and the successful completion of major construction projects further illustrate our commitment to organizational strength and resilience. We continuously evaluate our capital expenditures and investments in response to regulatory changes, economic conditions, and customer needs, ensuring that we remain agile and responsive to complex situations. The challenges posed by the Aliso Canyon natural gas leak and subsequent regulatory matters have required us to implement strategic responses and maintain a focus on recovery and performance maintenance. Our ability to navigate these challenges is indicative of our organizational capabilities and commitment to sustainability. As we continue to invest in infrastructure and technology, we remain focused on enhancing our operational management and strategic adaptation to ensure long-term organizational success. The ongoing development of our energy-related businesses and the pursuit of innovative solutions are essential components of our resilience strategies, enabling us to confront adversity and thrive in a turbulent market environment.

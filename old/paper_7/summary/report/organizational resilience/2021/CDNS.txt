During fiscal 2021, we continued to execute our intelligent system design strategy, which is essential for maintaining operational flexibility and adapting to the evolving demands of our customers. The ongoing global pandemic has resulted in numerous external pressures, including travel bans and business limitations, which could disrupt our operations and those of our key customers and suppliers for an indefinite period. Despite these challenges, we have managed to maintain our performance and operational continuity, demonstrating our organizational resilience. Our efforts to comply with containment measures have necessitated a remote working environment for the majority of our employees, which has impacted our day-to-day operations but has not materially adversely affected our results of operations, financial condition, liquidity, or cash flows during fiscal 2021. We have begun a limited pilot program for employees to voluntarily return to work in jurisdictions with lower rates of new COVID-19 cases and higher vaccination rates, indicating our adaptability and proactive measures in response to changing conditions. Our revenue growth during fiscal 2021 exceeded the growth of our costs and expenses, reflecting our ability to absorb strain and preserve functioning despite the presence of adversity. The acquisitions of technologies and talent from Numeca and Pointwise have broadened our system design and analysis portfolio, enhancing our organizational capabilities and resilience strategies. The increase in our product and maintenance revenue is driven by our customers' investments in new, complex designs, which underscores our role as a primary actor in enabling innovation and service continuity in turbulent markets. Our strategic initiatives, including continued investment in research and development, have focused on expanding and enhancing our product portfolio, which is crucial for maintaining competitive advantage and organizational health. The restructuring plans initiated in recent years to align our resources with our business strategy demonstrate our commitment to strategic adaptation and resilience in the face of changing market dynamics. Our cash flows from operating activities have improved due to better results from operations and the timing of cash receipts, further supporting our organizational strength and resource generation capabilities. We expect that our current cash and cash equivalent balances, along with cash flows generated from operations, will be sufficient to meet our capital and liquidity requirements, ensuring our organizational survival and resilience in the foreseeable future.

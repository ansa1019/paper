The COVID-19 pandemic has directly and indirectly impacted our business, and we continue to address it with a global task force team working to mitigate potential impacts on our people and business. We are proud of the teamwork exhibited by our employees, co-packers, and distributors who are endeavoring to maintain the integrity of our supply chain. Despite the ongoing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, we achieved record annual net sales in 2021. The pandemic has created risks that may continue to affect our ability to recruit and retain employees, as well as impact our co-packers, bottlers, and suppliers. We experienced global supply chain challenges due to unanticipated increases in demand, which adversely impacted both cost of sales and operating costs. We have addressed these challenges by expanding our network and securing additional manufacturing capacity. Our organizational structure for our existing energy beverage business will remain unchanged, while we continue to implement measures to mitigate increased operating costs through pricing actions and reductions in promotions. We believe that our key value drivers include international growth, profitable growth, cost management, and an efficient capital structure, all of which contribute to our resilience in the face of external pressures. Our growth strategy includes expanding our international business, which exposes us to risks inherent in conducting operations globally. We recognize that consumer discretionary spending represents a challenge to the successful marketing and sale of our products. Our commitment to consumers includes a broad product line that strives to meet changing consumer needs through beverage innovation. The ability to develop and introduce innovative beverages is critical for retaining and expanding market share. We have identified challenges and risks for the beverage industry, including economic uncertainty and changes in consumer preferences. We are focused on managing legal and regulatory requirements while addressing the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our operations. Our ability to absorb, mitigate, or pass on increases in costs is essential for maintaining our competitive advantage. We continue to incur expenditures related to the development and introduction of new products and flavors, which are vital for our organizational resilience. The ongoing uncertainty in our domestic and international economic markets could negatively affect both the stability of our industry and our company. We are committed to maintaining our brand image, product quality, and corporate reputation while navigating the complexities of the beverage market. Our ability to manage relationships with bottlers and distributors is crucial for ensuring the ongoing commitment to our products. We must continue to adapt to the changing retail landscape and consumer preferences to sustain our current level of sales and achieve growth. The strategic initiatives we implement will be essential for enhancing our organizational capabilities and ensuring our long-term success in a turbulent market environment.

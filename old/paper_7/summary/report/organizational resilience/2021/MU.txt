For an overview of our business and certain related trends, we continuously evaluate alternatives for efficiently funding our capital expenditures and ongoing operations. Our investments consist primarily of bank deposits, money market funds, and liquid investment-grade, fixed-income securities, which are diversified among industries and individual issuers. To mitigate credit risk, we invest through high-credit-quality financial institutions and by policy generally limit the concentration of credit exposure by restricting the amount of investments with any single obligor. We must continue to invest in manufacturing technologies, facilities and equipment, and R&D to develop new product and process technology, support future growth, achieve operating efficiencies, and maintain product quality. Our overall gross margin percentage increased to 38% for 2021 from 31% for 2020, primarily due to increases in DRAM average selling prices and cost reductions resulting from strong execution in delivering products featuring advanced technologies, partially offset by the declines in NAND average selling prices. Our gross margins included the impact of underutilization costs at MTU, which declined in 2021 primarily due to the plan to sell MTU's Lehi facility and classification of assets as held for sale. We are continuously evaluating the impact of environmental disruptions on our operations and adjusting our strategies accordingly. Our assessment of planned technology node transitions, capital spending, and re-use rates reflects our adaptability to changing market conditions. We recognize that our ability to respond effectively to environmental disruptions and transform ourselves to emerge stronger from challenging situations is critical for sustaining operational continuity. We expect to receive proceeds from the sale of our Lehi facility, which will enhance our liquidity and support our strategic initiatives. Our cash flows from operations are highly dependent on selling prices for our products, which can vary significantly from period to period. We are committed to maintaining operational flexibility and resilience in the face of potential adversities, including supply chain constraints and market volatility. We have implemented strategic tools for risk management and performance maintenance, ensuring that we can confront unexpected situations while preserving organizational health. Our focus on research and development is integral to our resilience strategies, as it enables us to innovate and adapt to the competitive landscape. We have established collaborative networks to enhance our organizational capabilities and foster inter-organizational collaboration, which is essential for navigating complex situations. Our approach to resource management and allocation reflects a systemic perspective that prioritizes sustainability and long-term growth. We recognize the importance of emotional resources and stakeholder engagement in fostering a culture of resilience and adaptability. Our operational management practices are designed to enhance our performance under pressure, ensuring that we can effectively respond to crises and maintain our competitive advantage. The strategic foresight embedded in our planning processes allows us to project future trajectories and prepare for potential challenges, reinforcing our commitment to organizational resilience.

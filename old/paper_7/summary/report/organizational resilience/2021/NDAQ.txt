We manage, operate, and provide our products and services in four business segments, which allows for effective resource allocation and performance assessment. Our financial performance reflects our ability to adapt to changing market conditions and maintain operational flexibility. The comparability of our results is impacted by strategic initiatives such as the acquisition of Verafin and the divestiture of our U.S. fixed income business, which are indicative of our capacity for reconfiguring resources and responding to external pressures.

The increase in operating expenses, driven by higher performance-linked compensation and investments in growth, reflects our commitment to sustaining organizational capabilities and enhancing our service innovation. We assess risks associated with our operations, including credit risk and market volatility, and implement measures to mitigate these risks, thereby reinforcing our organizational resilience. Our ability to foresee and confront disruptive changes is demonstrated through our proactive measures and strategic foresight, which are essential for navigating complex situations and ensuring operational continuity. The integration of new technologies and the expansion of our service offerings further exemplify our adaptability and commitment to organizational transformation.

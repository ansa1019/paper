Management's discussion and analysis for resolution and recovery planning requirements emphasizes the importance of effective risk management as vital to the success of business activities. The enterprise risk management (ERM) framework integrates diverse roles of risk management into a holistic structure, facilitating the incorporation of risk assessment into decision-making processes across the firm. This framework is essential for identifying, measuring, monitoring, escalating, mitigating, and controlling principal risks, including market, credit, operational, and strategic risks. The firm maintains a risk management culture that is knowledgeable about specialized products and markets, subject to ongoing review and enhancement, which is critical for operational flexibility and adaptability under challenging conditions. The risk appetite defines the aggregate level and types of risk that the firm is willing to accept to achieve its business objectives, ensuring that risk management is embedded in strategic planning and operational continuity. The board oversees the ERM framework, ensuring that risks are managed soundly and that the firm is prepared for unexpected situations and external pressures. The governance structure includes independent oversight and accountability across business divisions, facilitating effective communication of risk matters and enhancing organizational resilience. The firm has established policies and procedures for risk management that include comprehensive supervision of risk exposures and processes, ensuring that risk limits are adhered to and updated as necessary. The firm’s commitment to continuous improvement in risk management practices supports its ability to respond effectively to environmental disruptions and to transform itself in the face of adversity. The risk management framework also emphasizes the importance of collaboration among departments and teams, which enhances the organization’s capacity to absorb strain and maintain performance. The firm actively develops transition plans to address potential risks associated with changes in interest rate benchmarks, demonstrating its proactive measures to mitigate risks and ensure business continuity. The strategic risk management philosophy underlines the pursuit of risk-adjusted returns through prudent risk-taking, which protects the capital base and franchise. The firm’s risk limits framework provides a basis for monitoring risk-taking activity and avoiding outsized risk, while the risk management process incorporates stress testing and scenario analyses to assess the impact of adverse conditions. The firm’s approach to credit risk management includes evaluating and monitoring credit exposures, ensuring timely communication of material risks, and conducting stress tests to identify and control credit risk concentrations. The firm’s commitment to its core values and culture reinforces adherence to risk management practices, enhancing organizational health and resilience in the face of market volatility and uncertainty.

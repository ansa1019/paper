Our management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations reflects our ability to adapt to changing conditions and maintain operational continuity. We reported net sales of $151.2 billion in fiscal 2021, demonstrating resilience through a 14.4% increase driven by strong home improvement demand and strategic efforts to enhance our interconnected experience in both physical and digital environments. The increase in comparable sales, which rose 11.4%, indicates our capacity to respond effectively to market pressures and customer needs. Our operational flexibility is evident in our inventory management, where we adjusted inventory levels to support demand, reflecting our ability to absorb strain and preserve functioning despite external disturbances. The strategic allocation of resources has allowed us to invest approximately $3 billion back into our business for capital expenditures, which is essential for sustaining our competitive advantage and ensuring future growth. We also maintained a disciplined approach to capital allocation, prioritizing investments that enhance long-term strategic positioning while returning excess cash to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Our liquidity position, bolstered by cash flow generated from operations and access to capital markets, supports our resilience strategies, enabling us to confront unexpected situations and mitigate risks associated with economic fluctuations. The increase in our quarterly cash dividend and share repurchase authorization reflects our commitment to maintaining organizational health and stakeholder engagement. Our operational management strategies, including the integration of acquired businesses, demonstrate our capacity for transformation and adaptation in response to market dynamics. The evaluation of long-lived assets for indicators of impairment underscores our proactive measures in risk management, ensuring that we can navigate complex situations and maintain organizational effectiveness. Our ability to foresee and confront challenges is further illustrated by our response to the COVID-19 pandemic, where we adjusted operational practices to ensure continuity and resilience. The emphasis on strategic initiatives and collaboration networks enhances our organizational capabilities, fostering a culture of learning and innovation that is critical for thriving in turbulent markets. Our financial performance metrics, including return on invested capital, reflect our operational agility and the effectiveness of our strategic management practices. Overall, our ability to maintain positive adjustment under challenging conditions is a testament to our organizational resilience, enabling us to flourish despite adversity and external pressures.

Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. is a fully integrated biotechnology company that discovers, invents, develops, manufactures, and commercializes medicines for serious diseases. Our ability to generate profits and positive cash flow from operations depends significantly on the continued success in commercializing Eylea and Dupixent. We expect to incur substantial expenses related to our research and development activities, which require additional resources. The financial results may fluctuate and will depend on various factors, including the scope and progress of our research and development efforts and the continuation of collaborations, particularly with Sanofi and Bayer. We have entered into various collaborative arrangements to research, develop, manufacture, and commercialize products, which may require us to deliver various rights, services, and goods across the entire life cycle of a product or product candidate. The preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts and related disclosures, which may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. The uncertainties associated with drug development include safety and efficacy data, enrollment and performance of clinical trials, changes in regulatory requirements, and other risks. There is variability in the duration and costs necessary to develop a pharmaceutical product, and any failure to obtain or delay in obtaining regulatory approvals could materially adversely affect our business. We expect continued increases in expenditures, particularly in connection with our research and development activities. The amount required to fund operations will depend on various factors, including the potential regulatory approval and commercialization of our product candidates. We believe that our existing capital resources, borrowing availability under the credit facility, and funds generated by anticipated product sales will enable us to meet our anticipated operating needs. We anticipate continuing to incur substantial commercialization costs for Eylea, Dupixent, and Libtayo. Commercialization costs will depend on market potential for product candidates, whether costs are shared with a collaborator, and regulatory approval of additional product candidates. We expect that expenses related to the filing, prosecution, defense, and enforcement of patents will be substantial. Under certain collaboration agreements, we may elect to independently fund research and development costs in excess of capped amounts. We also expect to continue to incur development and manufacturing costs for our COVID-19 monoclonal antibodies, with funding requirements subject to clinical data results and regulatory outcomes. Our financial condition includes cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities, and working capital, which are essential for operational continuity and resilience against environmental disruptions. The agreements governing our lease financing contain financial and operating covenants, and we were in compliance with all covenants as of December 31, 2021. We have a share repurchase program authorized by our board of directors, which allows us to repurchase common stock through various methods, reflecting our strategic response to market conditions. The future impact of accounting standards is not expected to have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations, but we continue to assess the implications of changes in tax law and other regulatory requirements on our operational flexibility and organizational resilience.

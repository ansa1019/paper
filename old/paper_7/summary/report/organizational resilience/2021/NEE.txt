In 2021, nee delivered a total shareholder return of approximately 251.8%, reflecting its resilience in a competitive landscape. The fpl segment's net income increased primarily due to continued investments in plant in service and other property, demonstrating adaptability to external pressures and environmental perturbations.

The corporate and other segment's results improved due to favorable non-qualifying hedge activity, indicating effective risk management and strategic response mechanisms in navigating market volatility.

Nee's liquidity and capital resources are critical for supporting and growing its businesses, with funds sourced from cash flows, borrowings, and asset sales. The company emphasizes maintaining a strong investment-grade credit rating to ensure access to capital markets, which is vital for sustaining its operational effectiveness and resilience strategies.

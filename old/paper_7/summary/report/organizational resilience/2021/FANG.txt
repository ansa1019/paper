We operate under a strategic approach that focuses predominantly on enhancing return through our low-cost development strategy of resource conversion, capital allocation, and continued improvements in operational and cost efficiencies. Our commitment to delivering results in a socially and environmentally responsible manner reflects our adaptability to external pressures and the need for operational flexibility. The emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic contributed to economic and pricing volatility, requiring us to evaluate industry conditions and production outlook. We expect to continue building on our execution track record, generating free cash flow while keeping capital costs under control, which will help mitigate inflationary pressures across our business. Our operational efficiencies are critical in maintaining performance under pressure, particularly as we navigate the complexities of the market. We have implemented significant enhancements to our commitment to environmental, social responsibility, and governance performance, including emission intensity reduction targets, which demonstrate our proactive measures in response to environmental perturbations. Our capital return program is focused on sustainable and growing dividends, stock repurchases, and maintaining flexibility in capital deployment based on market conditions. We expect to operate between 10 and 12 drilling rigs and between three and four completion crews in 2022, which allows us to respond effectively to operational demands and maintain production levels. The strategic initiatives we have undertaken, including the acquisition of assets and the divestiture of non-core properties, are aimed at strengthening our organizational resilience and ensuring long-term sustainability. Our liquidity position is supported by cash flows from operations and available credit facilities, which are essential for funding our operational needs and capital expenditures. We recognize that future cash flows are subject to various variables, including commodity prices and production levels, and we have entered into derivative contracts to mitigate risks associated with market volatility. Our ability to foresee and confront sudden disruptive changes is vital for organizational survival and growth. The integration of acquired assets from the QEP merger and the Guidon acquisition has enhanced our operational capabilities and positioned us to better absorb strain during challenging conditions. We remain committed to capital discipline and operational continuity, ensuring that we can adapt to unforeseen circumstances while maintaining a focus on our major objectives. Our approach to risk management includes assessing the implications of external disturbances and the need for strategic adaptation in response to evolving market dynamics. We believe that our organizational practices and resilience strategies will enable us to thrive in a turbulent business environment, ultimately contributing to our long-term success and stability.

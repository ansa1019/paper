The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements. We believe that one of our major strengths is our ability to deliver comprehensively structured insurance and risk management services to our clients. Our brokers, agents, and administrators act as intermediaries between underwriting enterprises and our clients, and we do not assume net underwriting risks. We expanded our international operations through both acquisitions and organic growth, which reflects our adaptability in a competitive landscape. Our ability to generate additional tax credits from our clean energy investments ended in December 2021, and unless Congress reinstates the law allowing for such tax credits, we do not expect to generate any revenue or earnings from such investments in 2022. The management's discussion and analysis contains certain statements relating to future results which are forward-looking statements. We experienced significant expense savings during the pandemic as a result of reduced travel and other costs, which demonstrates our operational flexibility under challenging conditions. As we increased our business activities, we saw increases in travel and entertainment, full restoration of advertising, and more normalized usage of our employee medical plan, indicating our recovery and adaptation strategies in response to external pressures. The insurance market is cyclical and may vary widely based on market conditions, which requires us to maintain a strategic response to fluctuations in premiums charged by property/casualty underwriting enterprises. Our brokerage segment generates revenues by providing risk-shifting, risk-sharing, and risk-mitigation consulting services, which are crucial for maintaining organizational health and resilience. We believe that in a positive rate environment with growing exposure units, our professionals can demonstrate their expertise and high-quality, value-added capabilities by strengthening our clients' insurance portfolios. The impact of hard and soft market fluctuations has historically had a greater impact on changes in premium rates than inflationary pressures. We have historically viewed organic revenue growth as an important indicator when assessing and evaluating the performance of our brokerage and risk management segments. Our risk management segment operations provide contract claim settlement, claim administration, loss control services, and risk management consulting, which are essential for organizational resilience. The increase in revenues from our risk management segment operations benefited from our clients' improving business conditions, which increases new arising workers' compensation and general liability claims. We believe these favorable trends should continue; however, a slower recovery or new COVID variants could impact future performance. Our liquidity describes the ability to generate sufficient cash flows to meet the cash requirements of our business operations, and we believe we have sufficient liquidity on hand to continue business operations during this uncertain period. We preserved liquidity during 2020 by reducing capital expenditures and renegotiating longer payment terms on vendor payables, demonstrating our proactive measures and crisis management capabilities. Our cash flows from operations and borrowings under our credit agreement will provide us with adequate resources to meet our liquidity needs in the foreseeable future. We believe that our history of strong new business generation, solid retentions, and enhanced value-added services for our carrier partners should all result in further organic growth opportunities around the world.

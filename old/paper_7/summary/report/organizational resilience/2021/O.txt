Realty Income has been acquiring and managing freestanding commercial properties that generate rental revenue under long-term net lease agreements with commercial clients. The company believes that its cash and cash equivalents on hand, cash provided from operating activities, and borrowing capacity are sufficient to meet liquidity needs for the next twelve months. The impact of real estate and credit markets on the company is significant, as property prices continue to fluctuate, and the global credit markets have experienced volatility, which may affect access to and cost of capital. The company continually monitors these markets and may adjust its business strategy accordingly. In 2021, Realty Income completed its merger with Vereit, which included merger and integration-related costs that primarily consisted of advisory fees and other integration costs necessary to operate the acquired assets efficiently. The company has a conservative capital structure, aiming to maintain a conservative debt level and solid interest coverage ratios. As of December 31, 2021, total outstanding borrowings were approximately 26.5% of total market capitalization, indicating a focus on maintaining financial stability under varying market conditions. The company’s portfolio had an occupancy rate of 98.5%, reflecting effective management and operational flexibility in maintaining high occupancy levels despite external pressures. The company is structured to operate as an equity REIT, acquiring and leasing properties while distributing a substantial portion of net cash flow to stockholders. The company’s strategy includes retaining an appropriate amount of cash as working capital and utilizing permanent or long-term capital for property acquisitions and debt repayment. The company's operational practices demonstrate resilience through effective resource allocation and management of financial obligations, including the use of credit facilities and commercial paper programs to support short-term financing needs. The company has also implemented measures to mitigate financial exposure to exchange rate risks for properties acquired outside the U.S. by issuing debt securities denominated in local currencies. The company’s ability to adapt to changing market conditions and maintain operational continuity is evident in its approach to managing its portfolio and financial resources. The company’s leasing results indicate a proactive stance in re-leasing properties, with a rent recapture rate of over 100% on re-leased units, demonstrating effective management of client relationships and market conditions. The company’s focus on maintaining a diversified portfolio across various industries and geographic locations enhances its resilience against market volatility. The ongoing evaluation of the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on its operations and clients reflects the company's commitment to adaptability and preparedness in facing unexpected challenges. Overall, Realty Income's strategic initiatives, operational management, and financial practices illustrate a multifaceted approach to organizational resilience, enabling the company to navigate complex market dynamics while maintaining performance and stability.

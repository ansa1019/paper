We are a global leader in supplying electronic design automation (EDA) software that engineers use to design and test integrated circuits (ICs), which helps companies overcome the challenges of developing increasingly advanced electronics products while also helping them reduce their design and manufacturing costs. Our software integrity business delivers products and services that enable software developers to test their code for known security vulnerabilities and quality defects, which is integral to maintaining operational continuity and organizational effectiveness. We have consistently grown our revenue since 2005, despite periods of global economic uncertainty, reflecting our organizational resilience and ability to adapt to changing market conditions. The COVID-19 pandemic has changed the physical working environment of the substantial majority of our workforce to working from home, yet it has caused only minor disruptions to our business operations with a limited impact on our operating results thus far. We have not observed any changes in the design activity of customers, although we experienced a slowdown in customer commitments in our software integrity segment, indicating the need for ongoing risk assessment and adaptation strategies. Our growth strategy is based on maintaining and building on our leadership in our EDA products, expanding our IP offerings, and driving growth in the software security and quality market, which demonstrates our commitment to resilience strategies and operational flexibility. We recognize that our sales could be affected based on our customers' research and development budgets, and their spending decisions may be influenced by their business outlook and willingness to invest in new and increasingly complex chip designs. Our revenue growth from period to period is expected to vary based on the mix of our time-based and upfront products, reflecting the complexities of customer requirements and market dynamics. The increase in maintenance revenue for fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020 was primarily due to an increase in the volume of hardware and IP arrangements that include maintenance, showcasing our ability to respond to customer needs and maintain service continuity. We have experienced minor disruptions in our hardware supply chain, which we have been able to address with minimal impact to our business operations to date. Our existing cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments, along with our sources of liquidity, will be sufficient to satisfy our cash requirements and capital return program over the next 12 months and beyond, indicating our organizational strength and resourcefulness in navigating financial pressures. We will continue to consider the potential impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business operations, acknowledging the substantial uncertainty in the nature and degree of its continued effects over time, which affects management's accounting estimates and assumptions. Our restructuring plan initiated as part of a business reorganization demonstrates our proactive measures to enhance organizational coherence and adaptability in response to evolving market conditions.

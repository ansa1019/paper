Autodesk is committed to advancing a more sustainable, resilient, and equitable world, focusing efforts to advance positive outcomes across three primary areas: energy and materials, health and resilience, and work and prosperity. The company believes that its investment in cloud products and a subscription business model provides a robust foundation to navigate economic challenges, including those posed by the COVID-19 pandemic. Autodesk is actively monitoring the situation and may take further actions that alter business operations as required by authorities or determined to be in the best interests of stakeholders. The company has observed changes in the way it works, moving to a more hybrid workforce, which has led to an evaluation of its office space needs and a reduction in its facilities portfolio. This optimization of facilities costs is aimed at better deploying capital to further its strategy and drive growth. Autodesk's strategy includes improving product functionality and expanding offerings through internal development and acquisitions, which often increase the speed of delivering product functionality to customers. The company recognizes the importance of maintaining operational flexibility and adaptability in response to external pressures and disruptions. Autodesk's approach to risk management involves assessing potential impacts of environmental disturbances and ensuring that it can respond effectively to unexpected situations. The firm’s strategic initiatives emphasize collaboration networks and inter-organizational collaboration to enhance resilience and innovation. The company’s extensive global network of distributors, resellers, and third-party developers is considered a key competitive advantage, providing a broad reach into volume markets. Autodesk’s commitment to sustainability and resilience is reflected in its focus on designing and making net-zero carbon buildings and resilient infrastructure. The firm is also dedicated to supporting employees, customers, and communities in leveraging technology to create positive social and environmental impacts. The company’s financial health is monitored through key performance metrics, including recurring revenue and net revenue retention rates, which are indicative of organizational health and resilience. Autodesk anticipates that its existing cash and cash equivalents, anticipated cash flows from operations, and available credit facilities will be sufficient to meet liquidity needs, thereby supporting operational continuity. The company continually reviews its strategic investments and operational resources to ensure alignment with its long-term objectives and resilience strategies. As it navigates the complexities of the business environment, Autodesk remains focused on maintaining organizational effectiveness and performance under pressure, leveraging its capabilities to adapt and thrive amidst challenges.

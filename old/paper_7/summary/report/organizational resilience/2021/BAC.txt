The corporation regularly evaluates protocols and processes in place to execute its business continuity plans, particularly in response to the ongoing impacts of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. The future direct and indirect impact of the pandemic on our businesses, results of operations, and financial condition remains uncertain. Our risk management framework enables us to serve our customers and deliver for our shareholders, emphasizing the importance of sound risk management to mitigate potential financial loss, regulatory sanctions, and reputational damage. We take a comprehensive approach to risk management with a defined risk appetite statement, which is approved annually by the enterprise risk committee and the board. The corporation's risk appetite indicates the amount of capital, earnings, or liquidity we are willing to put at risk to achieve our strategic objectives and business plans, ensuring that our risk profile remains aligned with our risk appetite. 

The corporation has developed and maintains contingency plans designed to prepare us in advance to respond to potential adverse economic, financial, or market stress. These plans include monitoring, escalation, actions, and routines to enable us to increase capital, access funding sources, and reduce risk through various options. Our strategic plan is consistent with our risk appetite, capital plan, and liquidity requirements, specifically addressing strategic risks. The executive management team monitors business performance throughout the year and provides the board with regular progress reports on whether strategic objectives and timelines are being met, including reports on strategic risks.

We have established protocols to manage reputational risk, which may arise from the management of our strategic, operational, compliance, and credit risks. Our global compliance and operational risk teams independently assess compliance and operational risk, monitor business activities and processes, and evaluate adherence to applicable laws, rules, and regulations. The corporation's global information security program is focused on preparing for, preventing, detecting, mitigating, responding to, and recovering from cyber threats and incidents. 

The corporation's climate risk management efforts are overseen by the global climate risk executive, who chairs the climate risk steering council. This council shapes our approach to managing climate-related risks in line with our risk framework. We have publicly announced a goal to achieve net-zero greenhouse gas emissions in our financing activities, operations, and supply chain before 2050. Our progress towards achieving this goal is based on establishing the baseline for emissions associated with our financing activities. 

We utilize various risk mitigation techniques to manage commercial credit risk concentrations, including increasing the frequency and intensity of portfolio monitoring and hedging activities. Our commercial credit quality improved as the economic recovery gained momentum, driven by increased consumer spending and COVID-19 vaccination progress. The allowance for credit losses decreased significantly due to improvements in the macroeconomic outlook and credit quality, indicating our capacity to adapt and respond effectively to changing conditions. 

Overall, the corporation's resilience strategies are designed to maintain operational continuity and positive adjustment under challenging conditions, ensuring that we can confront and manage the complexities and uncertainties inherent in our business environment.

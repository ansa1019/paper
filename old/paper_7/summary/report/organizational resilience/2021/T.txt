AT&T's business strategies reflect bundled product offerings that cut across product lines and utilize shared assets. The company’s operations and support expenses decreased in 2021, reflecting business divestitures, lower bad debt expense, and lower personnel costs associated with ongoing transformation initiatives. The company expects revenue growth in its wireless and broadband businesses as customers demand instant connectivity and higher speeds made possible by wireless network enhancements through 5G deployment and fiber network expansion. The pandemic-related partial closure of movie theaters is expected to continue to pressure revenues; however, AT&T is working towards a shorter but exclusive theatrical window for its film slate. The company plans to use its strong fiber and wireless assets, broad distribution, and converged product offers to strengthen its overall market position. AT&T continues to transform its operations to be more efficient and effective, reinvesting savings into growth areas of the business, restructuring businesses, and improving customer service through digital transformation. The company is also focused on enhancing operational flexibility and adapting to market demands, particularly in response to environmental disruptions and competitive pressures. 

The effective management of subscriber churn is critical to maximizing revenue growth and maintaining and improving margins.

The company’s mobility segment provides services that are essential for maintaining operational continuity and addressing customer needs in a rapidly changing environment. The integration of data/broadband and streaming services allows AT&T to provide unique integrated mobile and broadband/fiber solutions, which is vital for organizational resilience. 

The company’s financial results indicate a focus on strategic initiatives that enhance organizational effectiveness and resilience. AT&T's operational management strategies include prioritizing efficiency through cost transformation initiatives and transitioning from hardware-based network technology to more efficient software-based technology, which is expected to result in a more efficient use of capital and lower network-related expenses in the coming years. The company’s ability to absorb strain and preserve functioning despite adversity is reflected in its strategic response to changing market conditions and its commitment to future planning and resilience strategies. 

AT&T's ongoing transformation efforts and strategic adaptation to market demands demonstrate its organizational resilience, allowing it to confront challenges and capitalize on opportunities for growth. The company’s focus on operational management, resource allocation, and strategic foresight positions it to navigate complex situations and maintain performance under pressure.

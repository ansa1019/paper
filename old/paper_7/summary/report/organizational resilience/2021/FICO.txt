In fiscal 2021, we introduced the FICOÂ® Resilience Index, a complement to FICO scores that identifies consumers who are more resilient to economic stress relative to other consumers within the same FICO score bands. We continued to develop scores that utilize alternative data to enhance conventional credit bureau data, thereby generating scores for otherwise unscorable consumers. During fiscal 2021, we advanced our platform-first, cloud-delivered strategy in our software segment, which led to the exit of less strategic areas of our business to facilitate incremental investment in higher value, more strategic areas. This strategic shift included the divestiture of the non-platform-based collections and recovery business and the sale of certain assets related to our software operations. We have maintained a voluntary work-from-home policy, providing our employees with flexibility while adapting to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, which has necessitated substantial modifications to employee travel and work locations. Although we have not experienced material disruptions to our operations from the pandemic, we acknowledge the uncertainty regarding its full impact on our operations and future financial performance, including customer demand and actions taken by governmental authorities. Our management's discussion and analysis reflect a focus on maintaining operational continuity and adaptability amid external pressures. The transition to a single software subscription contract with bundled license and maintenance components has changed the timing of our revenue recognition, impacting our revenue recognized from term software licenses, but does not negatively affect our cash flows. We believe our cash and cash equivalents, along with available borrowings from our revolving line of credit, will be sufficient to fund our working and capital requirements for at least the next 12 months. Our strategic initiatives emphasize resource allocation and operational flexibility to respond to environmental disruptions and maintain organizational health. The restructuring and impairment charges incurred in fiscal 2021 were part of our ongoing efforts to adapt to changing market conditions and optimize our operational structure. We continue to assess risks and uncertainties that may affect our business environment, including the potential for adverse outcomes from various proceedings and claims, which require significant judgment in evaluating potential liabilities and their impact on our financial position. Our approach to risk management includes evaluating the merits of acquiring technology or businesses and establishing strategic relationships to enhance our resilience and competitive advantage. The organizational changes implemented during fiscal 2021, including the reevaluation of our operating segments, reflect our commitment to aligning our resources with our strategic objectives and enhancing our organizational capabilities in the face of complex situations. We have also focused on maintaining a strong balance sheet, with a significant increase in cash flow from operations, which supports our ability to confront future challenges and sustain our growth trajectory.

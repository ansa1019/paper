Citi's expenses increased 10% versus the prior year, driven by increased investments in technology, including other risk and controls and transformation initiatives. The increase in expenses was partially offset by productivity savings and expense reductions from exited markets. Citi's services segment reported revenues of $18.1 billion, an increase of 16%, primarily driven by net interest income growth, which was significantly influenced by higher interest rates and effective cost of funds management across currencies. The segment's performance reflects the application of technology capabilities and management skills to enhance operational efficiency and support business needs. In the markets segment, expenses increased 7%, primarily due to investments in transformation, technology, and other risk and controls, indicating a strategic focus on enhancing IT capabilities to improve overall performance. The banking segment experienced a net loss of $48 million, driven by lower revenues and higher expenses, with total operating expenses increasing 9%, influenced by business-led investments and the absence of an operational loss reserve release. U.S. Personal Banking (USPB) reported a decrease in net income, reflecting higher cost of credit and increased expenses, which included continued investments in technology and other risk and controls. The wealth segment's revenues decreased 5%, largely due to lower net interest income and investment product revenue headwinds, but expenses increased by 10%, driven by ongoing investments in technology. The overall financial performance of Citi demonstrates the importance of mobilizing and deploying IT-based resources in combination with leveraging other capabilities to support business transformation and enhance competitive advantage. The company continues to assess its strategic resource allocation in response to evolving market dynamics and external influences, emphasizing the significance of IT governance and capability development in achieving organizational goals.

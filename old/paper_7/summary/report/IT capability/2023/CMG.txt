During the year ended December 31, 2023, we expect to incur about $635.0 million in total capital expenditures, which includes approximately $130.0 million related to investments in existing restaurants including remodeling and similar improvements, new equipment and hardware, technology to optimize efficiencies. We expect a portion of our incurred capital expenditures to be for additional corporate initiatives including investments in technology to boost innovation, enhance the guest experience, and improve operations. The majority of our purchase obligations relate to food, beverage and packaging, capital projects, information technology, marketing initiatives and corporate sponsorships, and other miscellaneous items. Our cash flow from operations is expected to be sufficient to meet ongoing capital expenditures, working capital requirements and other cash needs for the foreseeable future, assuming no significant declines in comparable restaurant sales. We believe these metrics are useful to investors because management uses these metrics to assess the growth of our business and the effectiveness of our marketing and operational strategies. Digital sales represented 37.4% of total food and beverage revenue, indicating a significant integration of digital technologies into our operational framework. The cultivation of our next fund is a venture formed to make early-stage investments into strategically aligned companies that further our mission to cultivate a better world, which reflects our commitment to leveraging technology resources and innovation partnerships. The increase in comparable restaurant sales is primarily attributable to higher transactions and, to a lesser extent, an increase in average check, demonstrating our operational flexibility and responsiveness to consumer demands. We expect that at least 80% of our new restaurants will include a chipotlane, which enhances our operational capabilities and customer service efficiency. Our strategic resource allocation is evident in our decision to invest in technology that supports business innovation and operational efficiency. We anticipate that our investments in technology will not only improve our internal processes but also enhance our market-based performance and competitive positioning. The expected increase in menu prices in California to mitigate higher wage costs resulting from legislation highlights our strategic management practices in response to external influences. Our cash and marketable investments balance of $1.8 billion, along with our undrawn borrowing capacity under a line of credit facility, positions us to effectively mobilize resources for future growth and operational needs. The integration of technology into our business processes is crucial for maintaining our competitive advantage and ensuring the reliability and accuracy of information management. Our focus on technology deployment and infrastructure capability is essential for optimizing operational efficiency and enhancing customer relationships. The anticipated capital expenditures reflect our commitment to transforming our business through strategic investments in technology and innovation, which are critical for sustaining our organizational performance and achieving long-term growth objectives.

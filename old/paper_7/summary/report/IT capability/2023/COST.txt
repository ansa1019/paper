In 2023, we spent $4,323 on capital expenditures, which included investments in information systems, manufacturing and distribution facilities, and initial warehouse operations. Our investments in merchandise pricing may include reducing prices on merchandise to drive sales or meet competition and holding prices steady despite cost increases instead of passing the increases on to our members. We believe that our e-commerce business, domestically and internationally, generally has a lower gross margin percentage than our warehouse operations. Our financial performance depends heavily on controlling costs, and we believe that we have achieved successes in this area, although some significant costs are partially outside our control. Changes in our net investment in merchandise inventories are impacted by several factors, including inventory levels and turnover, the forward deployment of inventory to accelerate delivery times, and payment terms with suppliers. Our operating model is generally the same across our U.S., Canadian, and other international operating segments, and we expect that our cash and investment position will be sufficient to meet our liquidity and capital requirements for the foreseeable future. We opened 26 new warehouses in 2023, and our philosophy is to provide our members with quality goods and services at competitive prices, which we believe enhances our operational efficiency. The impact of changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar negatively impacted net sales and gross margin, and we have been successful historically in adapting our business to changes in competition, such as through adjustments to our pricing and merchandise mix. Our investments in technology resources and management skills are crucial for enhancing our business capabilities and achieving operational flexibility. We also achieve net sales growth by opening new warehouses, although the negative aspects of such growth, including lower initial operating profitability, are continuing to decline in significance. Our membership format is integral to our business and influences our profitability, with higher penetration of executive members benefiting renewal rates. We believe that achieving our longer-term objectives requires maintaining compensation levels that are better than the industry average for much of our workforce. The effective tax rate in 2023 was impacted by net discrete tax benefits, and our cash flow provided by operations is primarily from net sales and membership fees. We believe that our investments in technology capabilities and operational processes will support our business strategies and enhance our competitive positioning. The degree of our exposure to government actions relating to tariffs, particularly in China and the United States, has affected the costs of some of our merchandise. Our investments in information technology assets and operational processes are essential for maintaining our competitive advantage and ensuring effective support for business needs. We believe that our organizational capabilities, including our ability to mobilize and deploy IT-based resources, are key in transforming our firm into a competitive force.

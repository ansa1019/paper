The medical technology industry is highly competitive and continues to evolve, with success measured by the development of innovative products and the value brought to stakeholders. We are committed to developing new technologies and providing innovative patient care, which underscores the importance of mobilizing and deploying IT-based resources in combination with leveraging the value of other resources and capabilities. Our vision for growth involves treating patients with both valvular and non-valvular structural heart disease, which necessitates a focus on operational flexibility and strategic resource allocation to enhance our IT capabilities. In 2023, we invested 17.8% of our net sales in research and development, reflecting our commitment to innovation and the integration of digital technologies into our operations. The planned tax-free spin-off of our critical care product group aims to sharpen our focus on expanded opportunities and new investments in interventional heart failure technologies, which will require effective IT governance and management capabilities to support these strategic initiatives. Our priority has been to maintain access for patients to our life-saving technologies while providing continuous front-line support to our clinician partners, which highlights the need for reliable information management capabilities that ensure data accuracy, timeliness, and security. The ongoing impacts of COVID-19 and macroeconomic uncertainties have necessitated a reevaluation of our operational strategies, emphasizing the need for agility and responsiveness in our market approach. We have continued to experience adverse effects related to these conditions, particularly as hospital systems face budget constraints and staffing shortages, which impact our ability to deploy resources effectively. Our commitment to innovation is further demonstrated by our recent product launches and regulatory approvals, which require robust IT systems and processes to manage clinical trials and product development efficiently. The integration of technology into our operations is essential for optimizing business processes and enhancing organizational effectiveness, enabling us to respond to consumer demands and market dynamics. The challenges posed by the competitive landscape necessitate a strategic alignment of our technology capabilities with our business objectives, ensuring that we leverage our IT resources to drive performance gains and maintain our position as a leader in patient-focused medical innovations. As we navigate these complexities, our focus remains on building organizational capabilities that support our long-term goals and enhance our operational efficiency, ultimately contributing to improved firm performance and value creation in the healthcare sector.

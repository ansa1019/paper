During 2023, we implemented various initiatives to manage the adverse impacts of inflation on our cost of operations, including enhancements in operational processes and investments in technology to reduce payroll hours. We have embarked on a multi-year property of tomorrow program to enhance the competitive position of certain of our facilities relative to local competitors, which includes upgrades to the configuration and layout of the offices and other customer zones to improve the customer experience. Investments in technology are aimed at achieving economies of scale from recent acquisitions, with centralized management costs allocated over a broader number of self-storage facilities. Centralized management costs include information technology support, hardware, and software, as well as centralized administration of payroll, benefits, training, repairs and maintenance, customer service, pricing and marketing, operational accounting and finance, and legal costs. The increase in technology and data team costs that support property operations reflects our focus on leveraging IT capabilities to enhance operational efficiency and support business needs. We have also invested in solar power and LED lights to lower utility usage, which aligns with our strategic resource allocation towards sustainable practices. Our general and administrative expenses increased due to higher spending in IT applications and software development, reflecting our commitment to enhancing our technology infrastructure. We believe that these incremental investments improve customer satisfaction, the attractiveness and competitiveness of our facilities to new and existing customers, and reduce operating costs. The ability to mobilize and deploy IT-based resources in combination with leveraging the value of other resources and capabilities has become key in transforming our firm into a competitive force. Our IT capabilities have evolved to encompass the coordination of our assets and internal processes, which supports our strategic decisions and enhances our organizational effectiveness. We expect our investments in technology to contribute to performance gains and operational flexibility, allowing us to respond effectively to market dynamics and consumer demands. The integration of technology into our business processes is essential for maintaining our competitive advantage and achieving our organizational goals. As we continue to grow through acquisitions and expansions, our focus on IT capability will remain critical in supporting our business transformation and enhancing our overall firm performance.

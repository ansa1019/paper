Cadence is a leading pioneer in electronic system design software and IP, building upon more than 35 years of computational software expertise. Our intelligent system design strategy allows us to quickly adapt to our customers' dynamic design requirements, enabling them to develop complex and innovative semiconductor and electronic systems. Demand for our technology and expertise is driven by increasing complexity and our customers' need to invest in new designs and products that are highly differentiated. We completed several acquisitions that enhance our talent, technology portfolio, and ability to pursue attractive opportunities in the markets we serve. Our strategy allows us to deliver essential computational software, hardware, and IP that our customers use to turn their design concepts into reality. The growth in revenue from our software and emulation and prototyping hardware offerings reflects our continued investment in research and development activities and technical sales support. Our revenue is significantly affected by the mix of software, hardware, and IP products generating revenue in any given period, which is influenced by our customers' investment decisions and market dynamics. The increase in product and maintenance revenue during fiscal 2023 was primarily due to increased demand across our five product categories, driven by our customers' investments in new, complex designs for their products. Our services revenue increased due to our cadence-managed cloud-based offerings, including computational molecular modeling and simulation solutions. The timing of our revenue is significantly affected by the delivery of hardware and IP products to our customers, which is essential for maintaining operational efficiency and meeting customer needs. Our operating expenses reflect changes in the number of employees due to hiring and acquisitions, as well as our continued investment in attracting and retaining talent dedicated to technical sales support and research and development activities. We expect to continue attracting and retaining talent through hiring and acquisitions, which is crucial for enhancing our IT capabilities and supporting business needs. Our operating margin increased during fiscal 2023, primarily because revenue growth in each of our five product categories exceeded growth in operating expenses. The provision for income taxes was primarily attributable to federal, state, and foreign income taxes on our fiscal 2023 income, reflecting the impact of our operational decisions and investments. We continuously monitor geopolitical conflicts and their effects on our business, which may influence our operational flexibility and strategic resource allocation. The growth in revenue from our emulation and prototyping hardware offerings contributed to the overall revenue growth experienced in each geography, driven by increased production capacity to address continued demand. Our business model provides some resilience against macroeconomic factors, and we will continue to monitor the direct and indirect impacts of these circumstances on our business and financial results. The allocation of the purchase price in business combinations requires significant estimates in determining the fair values of acquired assets and assumed liabilities, which can affect our operational capabilities and strategic management practices. We believe that our estimates and assumptions related to the fair value of our acquired intangible assets are reasonable, but significant judgment is involved.

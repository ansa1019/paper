Management's discussion and analysis highlights that Lam Research Corporation has built a strong global presence with core competencies in areas like nanoscale applications enablement, advanced systems engineering, and a broad range of operational disciplines. Our core technical competency is integrating hardware, process, materials, software, and process control, enabling results on the wafer. The demand for increasingly powerful and cost-efficient semiconductors is driven by markets such as cloud computing, 5G, and the Internet of Things, which necessitate sophisticated process technologies to integrate new materials with precise control. We believe we are in a strong position with our leadership and expertise to facilitate significant innovations in semiconductor device manufacturing. Our customer support business group provides products and services to maximize installed equipment performance, predictability, and operational efficiency, which are essential for enhancing our customers' business processes. We focus on research and development, with ongoing programs relating to sustaining engineering, product and process development, and concept and feasibility, which are critical for maintaining competitive advantage. Our ability to effectively leverage cycles of learning from our broad installed base and our collaborative focus with semi-ecosystem partners create opportunities for sustainable differentiation. The restructuring plan initiated in fiscal year 2023 aims to better align the company's cost structure with our outlook for the economic environment and business opportunities, reflecting our commitment to operational flexibility and resource management. We anticipate that secular demand for semiconductors, combined with technology inflections in our industry, will drive sustainable growth and increase the served available market for our products and services. Our strategic decisions are influenced by external factors, including trade restrictions and supply chain challenges, which may impact our revenue and gross margin. The increase in research and development investments is focused on leading-edge semiconductor manufacturing processes, which are essential for maintaining our market positioning. The liquidity and capital resources section indicates that maintaining sufficient liquidity reserves is important to support sustaining levels of investment in research and development and capital infrastructure, which are vital for enhancing our IT capabilities and overall business performance. Our cash flows from operating activities are expected to support our anticipated levels of operations, investments, and capital expenditures through the next twelve months, although external factors could impact customer demand and our operational decisions. The evaluation of uncertain tax positions and critical accounting policies reflects our commitment to robust governance practices that align with our strategic resource allocation and operational objectives. Overall, our emphasis on integrating IT capabilities with business processes and maintaining operational efficiency is central to our strategy for achieving long-term performance excellence in the semiconductor industry.

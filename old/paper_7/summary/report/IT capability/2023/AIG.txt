Disruptions in the availability or accessibility of AIG's or a third party's information technology systems, including hardware and software, infrastructure or networks, and the inability to safeguard the confidentiality and integrity of customer, employee or company data due to cyberattacks, data security breaches, or infrastructure vulnerabilities, may adversely affect AIG's business and results of operations. AIG's ability to effectively implement technological advancements, including the use of artificial intelligence (AI), and respond to competitors' AI and other technology initiatives is crucial. The company recognizes that the impact of adverse developments affecting economic conditions in the markets in which it operates, including fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates, inflationary pressures, and geopolitical events, can influence its operational flexibility and strategic resource allocation. AIG's investment strategies are tailored to support estimated cash flows of its outstanding liabilities and provide diversification from an asset class, sector, issuer, and geographic perspective. The company actively manages its exposure to the interest rate environment through portfolio construction and asset-liability management, including spread management strategies for its investment-oriented products and economic hedging of interest rate risk from guarantee features in its variable and fixed index annuities. AIG employs a comprehensive risk management framework that integrates risk management functions across its business units, focusing on the identification, measurement, and management of various risks, including market, credit, and operational risks. The company utilizes a three lines of defense model to ensure accountability for risks and controls within its segments. AIG's operational risk management function oversees adherence to the operational risk policy and risk and control framework, which includes monitoring and managing risks associated with inadequate or failed internal processes, systems, or external events. The company also emphasizes the importance of mobilizing and deploying IT-based resources in combination with leveraging the value of other resources and capabilities to enhance its competitive advantage. AIG's insurance operations are exposed to various risks, including loss reserves, underwriting, catastrophe exposure, and reinsurance, which are managed through sound underwriting practices, pricing procedures, and actuarial analysis. The company recognizes the significance of maintaining adequate financial resources to meet its obligations, including those arising from reasonably foreseeable contingencies or events, through cash from operations and, if necessary, monetization of invested assets. AIG's liquidity risk framework is designed to ensure sufficient liquidity during normal operations and under defined stress scenarios. The company actively monitors its liquidity position, ensuring that it can meet its financial obligations and capital needs. The integration of technology into AIG's operations is essential for enhancing operational effectiveness, improving service delivery, and facilitating the delivery of target customer experiences. The company's focus on technology management and innovation is integral to its strategic objectives and overall performance.

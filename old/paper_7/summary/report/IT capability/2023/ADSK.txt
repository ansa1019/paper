Autodesk is changing how the world is designed and made, with technology spanning architecture, engineering, construction, product design, manufacturing, media, and entertainment, empowering innovators to solve challenges. Our strategy focuses on delivering a trusted design and make platform that connects people through automation, data, and insights, enhancing business outcomes. We equip users with tailored tools, services, and access, helping them harness the power of data to explore new ways of collaborating and creating. Our cloud offerings, including Autodesk Construction Cloud, provide tools to streamline design, collaboration, and data management processes. We believe customer adoption of these offerings will grow as industries leverage scalable computing power and flexibility. To support our digital transformation strategy in architecture, engineering, and construction, we are strengthening our solutions with both organic and inorganic investments. Recent acquisitions, such as a cloud-connected extended reality platform, enhance our capabilities in augmented and virtual reality, meeting the increasing needs of the AEC industry. Our strategy includes improving product functionality and expanding offerings through internal development and acquisitions, which can accelerate product delivery but also entail integration challenges. We are building a trusted, outcome-focused platform for critical customer workflows that enables end-to-end digital transformation. Our focus is on providing granular, interoperable, and accessible data, centralizing critical capabilities across key offerings. We have invested in AI capabilities that add value through augmentation, automation, and analysis. Our API-based architecture facilitates third-party development of complementary products, allowing for customization of solutions. Our extensive global network of distributors, resellers, and third-party developers provides a competitive advantage, ensuring resources for customers to purchase, deploy, and support our solutions efficiently. We are committed to advancing sustainability and resilience, leveraging technology to help customers design net-zero carbon buildings and resilient infrastructure. Our strategy relies on making technology available to mainstream markets and improving product performance and functionality. We anticipate that our transition to annual billings for multi-year contracts will impact cash collections and billings timing. Our revenue model, which includes subscription revenue from cloud services and flexible enterprise business arrangements, is designed to provide customers with flexibility and access to a complete set of tools. The introduction of a new transaction model for our offerings aims to enhance customer interactions and streamline processes, allowing us to transact directly with end customers. We expect our channel mix to evolve as we scale our business, with a significant portion of revenue continuing to come from indirect channels. Our investments in cloud products and subscription models provide a robust foundation to navigate global economic challenges while driving operational efficiency and enhancing firm capabilities.

PG&E Corporation and the utility believe that their financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows may be materially affected by uncertainties in connection with wildfires, wildfire mitigation, and associated cost recovery. The utility's wildfire mitigation initiatives include vegetation management, asset inspections, and system hardening, which significantly reduce the number of reportable ignitions and acres burned. The success of these efforts depends on the utility's ability to retain or contract for the workforce necessary to execute its wildfire mitigation actions. The utility is subject to numerous legal and regulatory requirements related to its wildfire mitigation efforts, which require periodic inspections of electric assets and ongoing reporting related to this work. The utility continually reviews compliance and has identified instances of noncompliance, which could lead to fines or penalties. The financial impact of past wildfires is significant, with recorded aggregate liabilities for various fire incidents. The utility may mitigate future wildfire impacts through the wildfire fund or cost recovery through rates, though uncertainties remain regarding the extent of recoveries. The utility's revenue requirements consist primarily of a base amount set to enable recovery of reasonable operating expenses and capital costs, with regulatory ratemaking proceedings being a key aspect of its business. The utility has set a goal to increase capital investments to meet safety and climate goals while achieving operating cost savings through improved planning and execution. The utility's operational flexibility and efficiency are critical in managing costs within authorized recovery amounts. The utility's cash flows from operating activities are expected to increase primarily due to increases in its rate base, influenced by various factors including wildfire-related costs and regulatory proceedings. The utility's investing activities primarily consist of constructing new and replacement facilities necessary for safe and reliable service, with future cash flows dependent on capital expenditures. The utility's financing activities are driven by its financing needs, which depend on cash flows from operating and investing activities and the conditions in capital markets. The utility actively manages market risk through risk management programs designed to support business objectives and reduce commodity cost volatility. The utility's risk management activities include the use of derivative instruments for non-trading purposes. The utility's exposure to commodity price risk is managed through procurement activities, and fluctuations in electricity and natural gas prices do not affect earnings as long as costs are recoverable. The utility's regulatory accounting practices allow for the recognition of regulatory assets and liabilities for amounts deemed probable of recovery from customers, which helps stabilize financial results. The utility's operational and financial performance is subject to regulatory oversight, with significant implications for its investment and operational strategies. The utility's ability to recover costs through rates and maintain compliance with regulatory requirements is essential for its financial health and operational effectiveness.

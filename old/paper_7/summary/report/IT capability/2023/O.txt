During the year ended December 31, 2023, we invested $9.5 billion at an initial weighted average cash yield of 7.1%, including an investment in 1,408 properties, properties under development or expansion, investments in loans, and a preferred equity investment. We established a joint venture with Digital Realty Trust, Inc. to support the development of two build-to-suit data centers in Northern Virginia, investing approximately $199.8 million to acquire an 80% equity interest in the venture. This investment aligns with our strategy of leveraging technology capabilities to enhance our operational efficiency and market responsiveness. Our strategic focus on the use of net lease agreements reduces our exposure to rising property expenses due to inflation, as the client is responsible for property expenses. We continually monitor the commercial real estate and global capital markets carefully and, if required, will make decisions to adjust our business strategy accordingly. Our goal is to deliver dependable monthly dividends to our stockholders that increase over time, which necessitates effective resource allocation and management capabilities to support our operational and financial strategies. The merger with Spirit Realty Capital, which closed on January 23, 2024, enhances the diversification and depth of our real estate portfolio and will allow us to strengthen our longstanding relationships with existing clients and curate new ones, demonstrating our commitment to business transformation through strategic partnerships. We believe our cash on hand and funds from operations are sufficient to support our current level of cash distributions to our stockholders, which reflects our operational effectiveness and strategic resource management. The increase in monthly dividends during 2023 reflects our ability to generate consistent cash flow and maintain a competitive advantage in the market. Our total market capitalization was $65.4 billion as of December 31, 2023, with total outstanding borrowings of $22.1 billion, indicating a strong financial position that supports our ongoing investments and operational flexibility. We expect to fund our operating expenses and other short-term liquidity requirements primarily through cash provided by operating activities, borrowings under our revolving credit facility, and public securities offerings, which underscores our strategic alignment with market dynamics and investment opportunities. The appointment of a new Chief Financial Officer effective January 1, 2024, signifies our commitment to enhancing our managerial capabilities and governance practices to navigate the evolving business environment. Our focus on strategic management practices and technology deployment is essential for optimizing our business processes and achieving performance excellence, particularly in the context of regulatory uncertainty and environmental factors impacting our operations.

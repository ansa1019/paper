The management and franchise segment provides services, including hotel management and licensing of our IP, which encompasses marketing and information technology services. The revenues from this segment include management and franchise fees charged to third-party hotel owners and licensing fees from strategic partners. As a manager of hotels, we are responsible for supervising or operating the hotel in exchange for management fees, while as a franchisor, we charge franchise fees for the use of our brand names and related commercial services. Our strategic objectives include the continued expansion of our global hotel network, particularly our fee-based business, which is supported by the effective deployment of technology resources. We evaluate the economic viability of new hotels based on geographic location and the credit quality of third-party owners, which reflects our capability to leverage strategic resources in support of business needs. The current economic environment, including elevated levels of inflation and interest rates, poses challenges to our growth strategy, which may affect our operational flexibility and investment decisions. Our cash management policy aims to maintain liquidity and minimize operational costs, which is crucial for supporting our technology infrastructure and overall business performance. The increase in franchise and management fees was primarily due to increases in RevPAR at our comparable franchised and managed hotels, which indicates the effective alignment of our IT capabilities with market dynamics. The growth in our management and franchise contracts is expected to enhance our revenues and overall return on invested capital, demonstrating the importance of IT capability in transforming our firm into a competitive force. Our relationships with third-party hotel owners and franchisees are vital for maintaining our presence and generating new opportunities for property development, which is facilitated by our information management capability. The increase in revenues from owned and leased hotels reflects improved performance driven by higher occupancy rates and average daily rates, which are supported by our technology deployment and operational efficiencies. Additionally, we are focused on enhancing our organizational capabilities through strategic resource allocation and investment in technology management, which is essential for responding to consumer demands and market restructuring. The effective mobilization and deployment of IT-based resources, combined with leveraging other organizational capabilities, are central to our business transformation and achieving competitive advantage in the hospitality industry.

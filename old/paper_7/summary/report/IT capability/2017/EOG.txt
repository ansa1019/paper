EOG Resources, Inc. operates under a consistent business and operational strategy that focuses predominantly on maximizing the rate of return on investment of capital by controlling operating and capital costs and maximizing reserve recoveries. EOG emphasizes the drilling of internally generated prospects to find and develop low-cost reserves, which involves applying horizontal drilling and completion expertise to unconventional crude oil and liquids-rich reservoirs. The company continues to focus on increasing drilling, completion, and operating efficiencies using precision lateral targeting and advanced completion methods, thereby reducing operating and capital costs through efficiency improvements and service cost reductions. EOG's operational flexibility is enhanced by its ability to look for opportunities to add drilling inventory through various acquisition strategies. The company recognizes the importance of mobilizing and deploying IT-based resources in combination with leveraging the value of other resources and capabilities to transform into a competitive force. EOG's management believes that the application of technology resources, management skills, and business process understanding contributes significantly to achieving organizational goals and enhancing firm capabilities. The company continues to evaluate potential crude oil and liquids-rich natural gas exploration and development prospects, which requires effective information management capability to provide data and information to users with appropriate levels of accuracy, timeliness, reliability, and security. EOG's strategy also involves maintaining a strong balance sheet and capital discipline, focusing on funding exploration, development, and exploitation activities primarily from available internally generated cash flows. The anticipated capital expenditures for 2018 are structured to support this strategy, with a focus on enhancing the economics of its major producing areas in the United States. EOG's ability to effectively integrate acquired properties into its operations and accurately estimate reserves and production costs is critical to its operational success. The company is exposed to various external influences, including market dynamics and regulatory contexts, which necessitate a robust IT governance framework to manage risks and optimize resource allocation. EOG's commitment to operational efficiency and performance improvement is evident in its ongoing efforts to reduce costs and enhance production capabilities, thereby ensuring its competitive positioning in the market. The company recognizes the need for continuous innovation and technology deployment to adapt to changing market conditions and consumer demands, which is essential for maintaining its market agility and achieving long-term growth objectives.

Broadcom is a leading designer, developer, and global supplier of a broad range of semiconductor devices, focusing on complex digital and mixed signal complementary metal oxide semiconductor-based devices and analog III-V based products. The demand for Broadcom's products is influenced by various factors, including the ability to define specifications for, develop or acquire, complete, introduce, and market new products and technologies in a cost-effective and timely manner. The company has established strong relationships with leading OEM customers across multiple target markets and has a direct sales force focused on supporting large OEMs. The qualification, availability, and pricing of competing products and technologies affect sales and pricing of Broadcom's products. The company recognizes that uncertainty in global economic conditions poses significant risks to its business, as customers may defer purchases in response to tighter credit and negative financial news, adversely affecting product demand and results of operations. 

Broadcom's total net revenue increased primarily due to the full-year contribution from acquired BRCM products compared to only three quarters in fiscal year 2016, as well as strong organic year-over-year growth. Research and development expenses increased due to a full year of expense from the acquired BRCM businesses and higher share-based compensation expense. The company expects to incur additional amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets in future periods as a result of the Brocade merger. Operating income benefited from reductions in operating expenses related to restructuring actions following the Broadcom merger. 

The company’s liquidity needs increased as a result of completing the Brocade merger, which was financed with the issuance of senior notes. Broadcom engages in discussions regarding potential acquisitions of, or investments in, businesses, technologies, and product lines, which could require significant use of cash or increased borrowings. The ability to fund these requirements will depend on future cash flows, which are determined by operating performance and subject to various external factors. 

Broadcom's overall cash tax costs are expected to increase due to the redomiciliation from Singapore to the U.S. and the implementation of the 2017 tax reform act. The company’s strategic resource allocation and investment decisions are influenced by the need to support business innovation, operational flexibility, and market responsiveness. The integration of acquired companies and the management of technology resources are critical to enhancing organizational capabilities and achieving competitive advantage. The company's ability to mobilize and deploy IT-based resources in combination with other capabilities is essential for transforming into a competitive force in the market. 

Broadcom recognizes that its IT capabilities, encompassing the coordination of assets and internal processes, are vital in supporting business strategies and enhancing operational efficiency. The firm’s IT resources play a significant role in information management, ensuring data and information are provided to users with appropriate levels of accuracy, timeliness, reliability, and security, which are crucial for meeting changing business needs and directions.

The firmâ€™s IT capabilities represent the application of IT resources, including technology, knowledge, and management skills, to further organizational goals and maintain competitive advantage. The company recognizes the need for flexibility in decision-making and resource allocation to respond effectively to market dynamics and external influences. FIS's commitment to improving information security and compliance reflects its understanding of the challenges posed by evolving regulatory contexts and the necessity for robust IT governance. The firm is also aware of the potential impacts of industry consolidation on its business, as mergers and acquisitions can lead to opportunities for expanding service usage or risks of revenue loss.

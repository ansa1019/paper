Digital Realty Trust, Inc. focuses on owning, acquiring, developing, and operating data centers, which are critical to supporting the applications and operations of technology industry customers. The company believes that the growth in data center demand and the technology-related real estate industry will continue to outpace the overall economy. A significant component of internal growth is anticipated through the development of existing space held for development, acquisition of land, and new properties, targeting high-quality, strategically located properties that contain the physical and connectivity infrastructure necessary for data center operations. The firm has developed detailed, standardized procedures for evaluating new real estate investments to ensure they meet financial and technical criteria. The company expects to continue acquiring additional assets as part of its growth strategy and aims to manage and lease its assets aggressively to increase cash flow. As of December 31, 2017, the portfolio included 205 data centers with approximately 32.1 million rentable square feet, including significant space under active development and held for future development. The firm emphasizes operational efficiency and flexibility in its investment decisions, targeting properties that can support the evolving needs of customers in a competitive market. The company’s ability to grow earnings depends on developing and leasing space at favorable rates, which requires significant capital investment and may encounter delays in securing tenants. The firm’s operational strategy is influenced by market dynamics, including demand for data center space, which is subject to fluctuations based on economic conditions and technological advancements. The company is committed to maintaining a conservative capital structure, targeting a debt-to-adjusted EBITDA ratio at or less than 5.5x, and seeks to maximize available sources of capital while minimizing costs. Digital Realty Trust also actively pursues opportunities for acquisitions and development, with future capital expenditures expected to be substantial, reflecting the anticipated demand for data center space. The firm recognizes that changes in technology or market conditions could impact the viability of its offerings, necessitating continuous innovation and adaptation to maintain competitive advantage. The company’s operational practices include leveraging IT capabilities to enhance business strategies and processes, ensuring that its resources are effectively mobilized to support organizational goals.

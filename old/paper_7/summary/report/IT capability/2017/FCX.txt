We are a leading international mining company with significant proven and probable reserves of copper, gold, and molybdenum, operating large, long-lived, geographically diverse assets. Our portfolio includes the Grasberg minerals district in Indonesia, one of the world's largest copper and gold deposits. We believe we have a high-quality portfolio of long-lived copper assets positioned to generate long-term value. We have commenced a project to develop the Lone Star oxide ores near the Safford operation in eastern Arizona and are pursuing other opportunities to enhance net present values. The timing of these developments will depend on market conditions. Our financial results vary as a result of fluctuations in market prices primarily for copper, gold, and molybdenum, as well as other factors. We focus on sales volumes, unit net cash costs, operating cash flow, and capital expenditures as key measures in managing our business operations. Our consolidated operating cash flows vary with sales volumes, prices realized from copper, gold, and molybdenum sales, production costs, income taxes, and other working capital changes. We expect to generate significant operating cash flows for further debt reduction. Our estimated consolidated recoverable proven and probable mineral reserves were determined using specific price assumptions for copper, gold, and molybdenum, reflecting the economic feasibility of mining these reserves. We have significant mineral reserves and future development opportunities within our portfolio of mining assets. The Cerro Verde expansion project achieved capacity operating rates and benefits from large-scale, long-lived reserves and cost efficiencies. We continue to evaluate potential major expansions at El Abra to process additional sulfide material and achieve higher recoveries. Our operations in Indonesia include PT Freeport Indonesia (PT-FI), which is engaged in negotiations with the Indonesian government regarding regulatory changes that could impact its long-term mining rights. The Grasberg block cave underground mine is expected to produce large-scale quantities of copper and gold following the transition from the Grasberg open pit. We have made substantial progress in preparing for this transition, with estimated annual capital spending on these projects expected to average $0.9 billion per year over the next five years, subject to reaching a definitive agreement with the Indonesian government. Our consolidated revenues can vary significantly due to fluctuations in the market prices of copper, gold, and molybdenum, and we have taken actions to restore our balance sheet strength through asset sale transactions and capital market transactions. We continue to manage costs and capital spending and expect to generate significant operating cash flows for further debt reduction. Our operational performance is monitored through unit net cash costs, which provide insight into the cash-generating capacity of our mining operations. We utilize technology and management practices to optimize our operations and enhance our competitive position in the market.

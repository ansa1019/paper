Information technology (IT) capabilities have been evolving in scope to more comprehensively encompass the coordination of a firm’s assets and internal processes and their interfirm transactions and relationships. IT capability is a firm's ability to acquire, deploy, combine, and reconfigure IT resources in support and enhancement of business strategies and work processes. We focus on information management capability—that is, the ability to provide data and information to users with the appropriate levels of accuracy, timeliness, reliability, security, confidentiality, connectivity, and access and the ability to tailor these in response to changing business needs and directions. At its core, the notion of IT capability underscores the importance of mobilizing and deploying IT-based resources in combination with, and leveraging the value of, other resources and capabilities. A firm’s IT capabilities represent the application of physical or intangible IT resources such as technology, knowledge, practices, relationships, management skills, business process understanding, and human resources to further organizational goals. The acquisition of Linear Technology Corporation is expected to enhance our IT capabilities and support our business transformation efforts. We believe that a continued commitment to research and development is essential to maintain product leadership with our existing products as well as to provide innovative new product offerings, which are critical to our future growth. The increase in research and development expenses in fiscal 2017 was primarily due to the acquisition and an increase in operational spending, indicating a strategic resource allocation towards enhancing our technological capabilities. We continue to assess opportunities for improved operational effectiveness and efficiency, which are integral to our IT governance and capability enhancement strategies. The integration of acquired technologies and processes is expected to provide significant performance gains and operational flexibility, aligning with our business strategy and market responsiveness. Our ongoing investments in IT infrastructure and capabilities are designed to facilitate better information management and support our organizational effectiveness. The strategic decisions made in relation to IT investments are aimed at leveraging our technological resources to create business value and enhance our competitive positioning in the market. As we navigate the complexities of market dynamics and external influences, our focus remains on optimizing our IT capabilities to support our business processes and improve overall firm performance. The evolving landscape of digital technologies necessitates a robust IT architecture that can adapt to changing market demands and consumer choices, ensuring that we remain agile and responsive in our operations. The emphasis on innovation partnerships and strategic management practices will further strengthen our IT effectiveness and contribute to our long-term success in the industry.

During the year ended December 31, 2017, we completed several transactions that repositioned our portfolio and streamlined our co-investment ventures, which included the acquisition of our remaining partner's interest in Prologis North American Industrial Fund and the formation of new ventures for investment in the U.K. and Brazil. These strategic actions reflect our capability to mobilize and deploy resources effectively, enhancing our operational efficiency and aligning with our business strategies. The operating fundamentals in the markets in which we operate continue to be strong, which has driven rents higher and kept occupancies high, fueling development activity. Our ability to generate cash from operating activities, distributions from our co-investment ventures, and proceeds from the disposition of properties supports our anticipated future development and acquisition needs. We evaluate our business operations based on the net operating income (NOI) of our two operating segments: real estate operations and strategic capital, which helps management and investors understand the core operations of our real estate assets. Our strategic capital segment includes revenues from asset and property management and other fees for services performed, reflecting our management capability and operational flexibility in responding to market dynamics. We also recognize the importance of information management capability, which involves providing data and information to users with appropriate levels of accuracy, timeliness, reliability, and security, tailored to changing business needs. Our investment decisions are influenced by the performance metrics of our operating properties, and we capitalize certain costs related to our development and leasing activities, which are essential for maintaining operational effectiveness. The integration of our technology resources and the alignment of our business strategies with market opportunities enhance our competitive positioning. We continue to assess our organizational capabilities and strategic resource allocation to ensure we remain agile in a dynamic business environment. Our financial activities, including the issuance of senior notes and the management of our debt portfolio, reflect our commitment to maintaining liquidity and optimizing our capital structure. The ability to leverage our IT capabilities in conjunction with other strategic resources is critical in transforming our firm into a competitive force. We focus on the coordination of our assets and internal processes, as well as our interfirm transactions and relationships, to enhance our overall business performance and value creation. Our governance practices ensure that we remain compliant with regulatory contexts while adapting to environmental factors that may impact our operations. The ongoing evaluation of our investment processes and the strategic alignment of our technology infrastructure are vital for achieving long-term performance excellence and resilience in the face of market restructuring and competitive actions.

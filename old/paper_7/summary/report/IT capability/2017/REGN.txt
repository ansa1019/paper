The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are rapidly evolving and highly competitive, and new developments may render our products and technologies uncompetitive or obsolete. Our ability to continue to generate profits and to generate positive cash flow from operations over the next several years depends significantly on our continued success in commercializing Eylea. The planning, execution, and results of our clinical programs are significant factors that can affect our operating and financial results. Our financial results may fluctuate from quarter to quarter and will depend on, among other factors, the scope and progress of our research and development efforts, the timing of certain expenses, and the continuation of our collaborations. The amount required to fund operations will depend on various factors, including revenues from net product sales, the potential regulatory approval and commercialization of our product candidates, the status of competitive products, and the success of our research and development programs. We expect to incur substantial costs related to the commercialization of Eylea, Dupixent, Praluent, and Kevzara, as well as preparation for potential commercialization of Cemiplimab and other indications of Dupilumab. We anticipate continuing to incur substantial commercialization costs for Eylea, Dupixent, Praluent, and Kevzara, as well as in connection with our late-stage antibody product candidates, including Cemiplimab. Our research and development activities outside our collaborations, the costs of which are not reimbursed, are expected to expand and require additional resources. The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are characterized by rapid technological advancements and a high degree of competition, necessitating continuous innovation and adaptation to maintain a competitive advantage. The success of our clinical programs and the commercialization of our products are contingent upon effectively managing our IT capabilities, which play a crucial role in supporting our business strategies and operational processes. Our IT capabilities must evolve to encompass the coordination of our assets and internal processes, as well as our interfirm transactions and relationships. The ability to mobilize and deploy IT-based resources in combination with other resources and capabilities is essential for transforming our firm into a competitive force. Our IT governance and management practices are critical in ensuring that our information management capabilities provide accurate, timely, and reliable data to support decision-making processes. The integration of digital technologies into our operations enhances our operational efficiency and agility, enabling us to respond effectively to market dynamics and consumer demands. Our strategic resource allocation and investment decisions are influenced by the need to leverage our IT capabilities to optimize our business processes and enhance overall firm performance. The evolving landscape of the biotechnology sector requires us to remain vigilant in monitoring external influences and adapting our strategies accordingly to sustain our competitive positioning and achieve long-term business value.

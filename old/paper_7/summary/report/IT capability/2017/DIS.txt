The company's IT capabilities have been evolving in scope to more comprehensively encompass the coordination of a firm’s assets and internal processes and their interfirm transactions and relationships. These capabilities represent the application of physical or intangible IT resources such as technology, knowledge, practices, relationships, management skills, business process understanding, and human resources to further organizational goals. The company’s media networks segment generates revenue from affiliate fees, ad sales, and other revenues, which include the sale and distribution of television programming, with significant expenses including technical support costs and operating labor. The parks and resorts segment generates revenue from the sale of admissions to theme parks, food, beverage, merchandise, and hotel room nights, with operating expenses including infrastructure costs, which encompass information systems expenses. The studio entertainment segment generates revenue from the distribution of films and incurs costs related to programming and production, which are influenced by the company's IT capabilities in managing these processes. The consumer products & interactive media segment generates revenue from licensing characters and content, with significant expenses related to product development and marketing, reflecting the importance of IT resources in operational efficiency. The company evaluates the performance of its operating segments based on segment operating income, and management uses aggregate segment operating income as a measure of the overall performance of the operating businesses. The increase in operating cash flow at parks and resorts reflects higher operating cash receipts due to increased revenues, partially offset by higher payments for labor and other costs, indicating the role of IT capabilities in optimizing operational processes. The company’s investments in parks, resorts, and other property include significant expenditures on technology infrastructure, which are essential for enhancing operational flexibility and supporting business innovation. The company believes that information about aggregate segment operating income assists investors by allowing them to evaluate changes in the operating results of the company's portfolio of businesses separate from factors other than business operations that affect net income. The company’s strategic resource allocation and investment decisions are influenced by its IT capabilities, which support business transformation and enhance competitive advantage. The effective management of information systems capability is critical for ensuring information reliability, accuracy, and timeliness, which are essential in meeting changing business needs and directions. The company’s governance contexts and regulatory frameworks also impact its IT investment strategies, emphasizing the importance of aligning technology capabilities with organizational goals. The integration of IT resources across segments facilitates improved performance metrics and enhances the company’s ability to respond to market dynamics and consumer demands.

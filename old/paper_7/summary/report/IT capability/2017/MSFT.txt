Microsoft is a technology company whose strategy is to build best-in-class platforms and productivity services for an intelligent cloud and an intelligent edge infused with artificial intelligence. Our platforms and tools help drive small business productivity, large business competitiveness, and public-sector efficiency. The markets for software, devices, and cloud-based services are dynamic and highly competitive, with frequent changes in both technologies and business models. Each industry shift is an opportunity to conceive new products, new technologies, or new ideas that can further transform the industry and our business. Our success is highly dependent on our ability to attract and retain qualified employees, as we compete for talented individuals globally by offering an exceptional working environment, broad customer reach, scale in resources, and competitive compensation and benefits. The investments we are making in infrastructure and devices will continue to increase our operating costs and may decrease our operating margins. Research and development expenses include investments in cloud engineering and are primarily driven by the acquisition of LinkedIn, which has been integrated into our operations and contributes to our strategic resource allocation. Our intelligent cloud revenue increased primarily due to higher revenue from server products and cloud services, with Azure revenue growth of 99%. Operating expenses increased, driven by investments in sales capacity, cloud engineering, and developer engagement, reflecting our commitment to enhancing our technology capabilities. The acquisition of LinkedIn has also enhanced our business processes and organizational capabilities, allowing us to leverage strategic resources more effectively. We recognize that our operational efficiency and performance gains are closely tied to our ability to innovate and respond to market dynamics. The integration of cloud services and the shift to subscription-based models for our products necessitate a focus on information management capabilities, ensuring data and information are provided to users with appropriate levels of accuracy, timeliness, and reliability. Our financial performance is influenced by global macroeconomic and geopolitical factors, which remain dynamic, and we must continue to evolve and adapt over time in pace with this changing environment. The strategic management practices we employ are designed to optimize our resource deployment and enhance our organizational effectiveness, ensuring we maintain a competitive advantage in the marketplace. Our commitment to research and development is reflected in our increased expenditures aimed at driving cloud innovation and enhancing our technology infrastructure. The operational flexibility we achieve through these investments is critical to our ability to respond to consumer demands and market restructuring. Overall, our IT capabilities are integral to transforming our business strategy and enhancing our market positioning, enabling us to create value and drive performance excellence across our operations.

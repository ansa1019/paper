The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with other cautionary statements and risks described elsewhere in this annual report on Form 10-K. Our company has extended its focus in recent years to the revolutionary field of AI, which reflects the evolving scope of IT capabilities to encompass the coordination of a firmâ€™s assets and internal processes. Our proprietary processors have created platforms that address large markets where our expertise is critical, including gaming, professional visualization, datacenter, and automotive. Revenue for fiscal year 2018 grew 41% to $9.71 billion, reflecting broad growth in each of our market platforms, driven by strong demand for our Pascal-based GeForce gaming GPUs and significant sales of our Volta architecture, including V100 GPU accelerators. The GPU business revenue increased by 40%, led by growth in gaming, datacenter, and professional visualization, while the Tegra processor business revenue increased by 86%, driven by automotive revenue and development services. We recorded a favorable shift in gross margin, reflecting the growth of our GeForce gaming GPUs and the GPU computing platform for cloud, deep learning, AI, and graphics virtualization. Our operating expenses reflect investments in growth initiatives, including gaming, AI, and autonomous driving, which are essential for enhancing our IT capabilities and supporting business needs. The increase in research and development expenses was driven primarily by employee additions and increases in employee compensation, which are crucial for maintaining our competitive advantage in technology deployment and innovation. Our datacenter platform has been chosen by nearly every major cloud provider to deliver AI and HPC, demonstrating our capability to support business transformation and operational efficiency. We also announced the NVIDIA Drive AI self-driving platform, which enables automakers to accelerate production of automated vehicles, showcasing our commitment to leveraging technology capabilities for strategic resource allocation and market responsiveness. Our financial performance has been significantly impacted by our ability to mobilize and deploy IT-based resources in combination with other resources and capabilities, underscoring the importance of IT capability in transforming our firm into a competitive force. The overall gross margin was 59.9%, reflecting strong sales of our gaming GPU products and revenue growth in datacenter, including Tesla, GRID, and DGX. The increase in gross margin was partially offset by the conclusion of our patent license agreement with Intel. Our management continues to evaluate the impact of the recent tax law changes on our business, which may affect our operational flexibility and investment decisions moving forward. As of January 28, 2018, we had $7.11 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities, reflecting our strong liquidity position, which is essential for supporting future investments in technology infrastructure and capabilities. The strategic management of our cash and marketable securities is aligned with our commitment to enhancing our IT capabilities and ensuring long-term organizational effectiveness.

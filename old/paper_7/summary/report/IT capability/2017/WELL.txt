Welltower Inc. is driving the transformation of health care infrastructure by investing with leading seniors housing operators, post-acute providers, and health systems to scale innovative care delivery models and improve overall health care experiences. The company’s capital programs, combined with comprehensive planning, development, and property management services, create a single-source solution for acquiring, planning, developing, managing, repositioning, and monetizing real estate assets. The firm’s objectives include protecting stockholder capital and enhancing stockholder value through consistent cash dividends and opportunities for increases in dividends resulting from annual increases in net operating income and portfolio growth. The company monitors investments through various methods, including reviewing financial statements, operating data, creditworthiness, and property inspections to mitigate risks associated with operating difficulties of obligors/partners. The asset management process supports the collectability of revenue and the value of investments by intervening early to address negative trends. Welltower’s internal property management division manages outpatient medical portfolios through comprehensive processes that include tenant relations and market conditions evaluation. The company’s investments are structured to mitigate payment risks, with operating leases typically credit-enhanced and loans cross-defaulted and cross-collateralized. The firm’s revenues are primarily derived from operating lease rentals, resident fees/services, and interest earned on loans receivable, which are critical for funding distributions. The company continuously evaluates opportunities to finance future investments, with new investments generally funded from borrowings under its primary unsecured credit facility, internally generated cash, and proceeds from investment dispositions. The firm’s key performance indicators, including net income and funds from operations, are utilized to evaluate various aspects of the business and facilitate internal and external comparisons to historical operating results. Welltower’s credit strength is measured through leverage and coverage ratios, which are essential for maintaining a capital structure consistent with its profile. The company evaluates concentration risk in terms of net operating income by property mix, relationship mix, and geographic mix to understand potential risks associated with sector downturns. The firm’s ability to achieve financial objectives depends on effectively executing strategic plans and responding to emerging economic trends. Welltower is committed to maintaining investor confidence through ethical business practices and corporate governance guidelines that emphasize stockholder value while complying with legal requirements. The company’s liquidity is deemed sufficient to fund cash uses, including dividend distributions and property investments, while continuously evaluating financing opportunities. The firm’s operational performance metrics, including net operating income and same store net operating income, are critical for assessing property-level performance and making resource allocation decisions. Welltower’s investments in technology and data management capabilities are integral to enhancing operational efficiency, supporting business processes, and maintaining competitive advantage in the evolving health care landscape.

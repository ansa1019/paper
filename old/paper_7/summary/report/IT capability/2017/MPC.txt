Management's discussion and analysis includes various forward-looking statements concerning trends or events potentially affecting our business, emphasizing the importance of mobilizing and deploying IT-based resources in combination with, and leveraging the value of, other resources and capabilities. Our operations consist of three reportable operating segments: refining & marketing; speedway; and midstream, which are organized based on the nature of the products and services they offer. The refining & marketing segment income from operations is influenced by our refining & marketing margin and refinery throughputs, which are affected by factors such as the selling prices realized for refined products and the types of crude oil processed. The midstream segment profitability is affected by prevailing commodity prices and the volumes shipped through pipelines, which are directly influenced by the supply of crude oil and refiner demand. Our integrated midstream energy asset network links producers of natural gas and NGLs from some of the largest supply basins in the United States to domestic and international markets, enhancing our operational flexibility and market responsiveness. 

The strategic actions to enhance shareholder value include significant dropdowns of assets to MPLX, which are expected to provide a clear valuation of our midstream platform and ongoing returns of capital to shareholders. The capital investment plan totals approximately $1.6 billion for capital projects and investments, focusing on optimizing refinery operations and expanding infrastructure capabilities. Our technology management practices are designed to support business needs and enhance operational efficiency, with a focus on maximizing distillate production and increasing export capabilities. 

We continuously evaluate our capital plan and make changes as conditions warrant, ensuring that our investments align with strategic resource allocation and market dynamics.

Our digital infrastructure supports the coordination of a firmâ€™s assets and internal processes, facilitating interfirm transactions and relationships.

Our strategic management practices are focused on enhancing organizational capabilities and aligning business strategies with market-based performance metrics.

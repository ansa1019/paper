Our premier brand portfolio includes technology and information technology services that support our management and franchise operations. The management and franchise segment generates revenue from management and franchise fees, which are influenced by our ability to provide effective technology functionalities and support to third-party hotel owners. We charge franchise fees that cover the costs of internet, technology, and reservation systems, which are critical for maintaining competitive advantage and operational efficiency. The performance of our hotels is closely linked to the deployment of IT resources, which enhance business processes and support revenue generation through improved customer relationships and operational flexibility. Our strategic objectives include the continued expansion of our global footprint, which relies on our capability to leverage technology resources effectively in managing and franchising hotels. The evaluation of new management and franchise contracts includes assessing the economic viability of properties, which is increasingly influenced by technology integration and the ability to respond to market dynamics. Our relationships with third-party owners and franchisees are essential for generating new opportunities for property development, which depend on access to capital and effective technology management. The growth of our hotel system is supported by our IT capabilities, which facilitate the coordination of assets and processes across our operations. We believe that our IT capabilities, including data management and information systems, play a crucial role in transforming our firm into a competitive force in the hospitality industry. The ability to provide accurate, timely, and reliable information to users is critical for aligning our business strategies with operational goals. Our management and franchise segment's performance is also linked to the effective deployment of technology, which enhances our ability to respond to consumer demands and market changes. As we continue to expand our portfolio, the integration of technology into our business processes will be vital for achieving operational excellence and maximizing shareholder value. The effectiveness of our IT governance and the management of our technology infrastructure are key factors influencing our overall performance and ability to adapt to environmental uncertainties. Our investment choices in technology resources are guided by the need to enhance our operational capabilities and improve market responsiveness, ensuring that we remain competitive in a rapidly evolving business environment. The strategic alignment of our IT capabilities with our business objectives is essential for driving performance gains and achieving sustainable growth in the hospitality sector.

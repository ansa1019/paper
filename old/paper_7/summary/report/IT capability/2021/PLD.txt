Our financial condition and operating results were strong during 2021, with e-commerce continuing to grow well above its historical average, indicating robust demand for space. As demand surges, having the right logistics real estate in the right location is mission critical for our customers. The increase in market rents and asset valuations is expected to drive our operating results, as well as our execution of profitable deployment activities. We generated net proceeds of $5.2 billion and realized net gains of $1.6 billion, principally from the contribution of properties to our unconsolidated co-investment ventures and dispositions to third parties. Our financial performance is also supported by our ability to mobilize and deploy IT-based resources in combination with leveraging the value of other resources and capabilities. We evaluate our business operations based on the net operating income (NOI) of our two operating segments: real estate operations and strategic capital, which helps management and investors understand our operating results. The strategic capital segment includes revenues from asset management and property management services performed, and these revenues fluctuate due to changes in the size of the portfolios through acquisitions and dispositions. We believe that reviewing our operating fundamentals on an owned and managed basis allows management to understand the entire impact on the financial statements. Our development activities are expected to increase in 2022, with a current investment in the development portfolio of $2.7 billion and a total expected completion value of $4.7 billion. We continue to maintain high margins as a result of lower capitalization rates and higher market rents, which are critical for operational efficiency and business transformation. Our liquidity position is strong, with total available liquidity of $5.0 billion, which is essential for funding our anticipated future development, acquisition, and operational needs. The ability to provide data and information to users with appropriate levels of accuracy, timeliness, reliability, and security is vital for supporting our business strategies and enhancing our operational capabilities. Our strategic management practices are designed to ensure that we effectively align our resources with our business needs, thereby optimizing our performance outcomes. The management of our IT resources is integral to our operational flexibility and responsiveness to market dynamics, enabling us to capitalize on investment opportunities and manage our technology portfolio effectively. The integration of technology capabilities into our business processes is essential for achieving competitive advantage and enhancing our organizational effectiveness. Our focus on innovation partnerships and strategic resource allocation further supports our capability development and enhances our overall firm performance. The ability to adapt to changing market conditions and consumer demands is critical for maintaining our competitive positioning and achieving long-term business resilience.

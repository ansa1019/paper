The automotive industry and GM are currently experiencing a global semiconductor supply shortage, which has impacted multiple suppliers that incorporate semiconductors into the parts they supply. This shortage has led to interruptions in planned production schedules and temporary suspensions of certain manufacturing sites to prioritize production of popular vehicles. In June 2021, GM announced plans to increase investment in electric vehicles (EVs) and autonomous vehicles (AVs) to more than $35 billion from 2020 through 2025, part of a strategy to strengthen market position and drive significant cost efficiencies. The company is also monitoring the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and government actions, which may affect operations. GM's vision for the future includes a commitment to sustainable operations and a leading health and safety culture while leveraging technology capabilities to enhance business processes. The company aims to transform its operations and capitalize on the future of personal mobility through strategic resource allocation and investment in technology infrastructure. GM Financial's leasing program is exposed to residual values, which are dependent on used vehicle prices, and the company believes that offering a comprehensive suite of financing products will generate incremental sales and support operations throughout various economic cycles. The management uses non-GAAP measures to view operating trends and benchmark performance, which aids in investment decisions and operational decision-making processes. The ongoing global semiconductor supply shortage and macroeconomic impacts continue to place pressure on GM's vehicle sales, particularly in China, where the automotive industry faces unique operational and regulatory risks. GM is focused on maintaining strong relationships with joint venture partners in China to drive improvements in vehicle mix and cost. The company's strategic management practices include evaluating opportunities to strengthen competitive positioning while maintaining a strong investment-grade balance sheet. Additionally, GM is committed to enhancing its information technology systems to support business needs and improve operational efficiency. The company recognizes the importance of mobilizing and deploying IT-based resources in combination with leveraging the value of other resources and capabilities to further organizational goals. The ongoing evaluation of performance and the needs of the evolving business may require additional restructuring actions, which could impact operating results. GM's cash management strategy includes maintaining access to capital markets and utilizing intercompany loans to support global operations. The company continues to monitor risks related to security breaches and disruptions to information technology systems, which are critical to maintaining operational integrity and competitive advantage.

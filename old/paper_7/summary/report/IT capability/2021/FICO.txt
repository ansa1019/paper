During fiscal 2021, we continued to advance our platform-first, cloud delivered strategy in our software segment, which reflects our commitment to enhancing IT capabilities and aligning with evolving business needs. This strategic shift involved exiting less strategic areas of our business to facilitate incremental investment in higher value, more strategic areas. We divested the non-platform-based collections and recovery business, which underscores our focus on leveraging IT resources effectively to support business transformation and operational efficiency. Our transition from selling term software licenses with separate license and maintenance components to a single software subscription contract with bundled services illustrates our efforts to optimize revenue recognition and align with market dynamics. 

The annual recurring revenue for our software segment as of September 30, 2021, was $524.0 million, indicating a 6% increase from the previous year, which reflects our capability to adapt to changing consumer demands and market agility. The dollar-based net retention rate for our software segment during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021 was 106%, demonstrating our success in retaining and growing revenue from existing customers, a key indicator of our IT effectiveness and strategic resource allocation.

Our research and development expenses, which are essential for developing new products and services, increased due to our continued investments in innovation and technology management. This investment is crucial for maintaining competitive advantage and enhancing our organizational capabilities. The decrease in selling, general, and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues to 30% during fiscal 2021 from 33% in fiscal 2020 was primarily due to increased sales of our high-margin scores products, which reflects our operational flexibility and strategic alignment with market opportunities.

We also recognize the importance of information management capability, as our revenue recognition practices are designed to ensure information accuracy and reliability. The changes in our revenue recognition approach, particularly regarding our on-premises software subscriptions, highlight our focus on aligning business processes with IT capabilities to enhance overall performance outcomes. 

Our capital resources and liquidity outlook indicate that we believe our cash and cash equivalents, along with available borrowings from our revolving line of credit, will be sufficient to fund our working capital requirements and strategic investments in technology. We evaluate the merits of acquiring technology or businesses, which underscores our commitment to resource mobilization and capability enhancement in response to competitive pressures. 

Overall, our strategic decisions reflect an ongoing commitment to leveraging IT capabilities to support business innovation, enhance operational efficiency, and drive performance gains across our organizational framework. The evolution of our IT capabilities is integral to our ability to respond to market dynamics and maintain a competitive positioning in the industry.

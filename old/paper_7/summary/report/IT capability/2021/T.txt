AT&T's business strategies reflect bundled product offerings that cut across product lines and utilize shared assets. The communications segment provides services to businesses and consumers located in the U.S. and businesses globally, emphasizing the importance of mobilizing and deploying IT-based resources in combination with leveraging the value of other resources and capabilities. The company has launched a wide variety of plans, including its FirstNet and prepaid products, and arrangements that bundle services, which are intended to encourage existing subscribers to upgrade their current services and/or add devices. The effective management of subscriber churn is critical to maximizing revenue growth and maintaining and improving margins, which is supported by the ongoing transformation initiatives aimed at improving operational efficiency through automation and digitization. The mobility segment's operating income margin was 29.8% in 2021, reflecting the impact of higher volumes and increased content costs associated with bundling services. The company expects revenue growth in its wireless and broadband businesses as customers demand instant connectivity and higher speeds made possible by wireless network enhancements through 5G deployment and fiber network expansion. The integration of data/broadband and streaming services is a focus area, with plans to expand wireless network capabilities and provide broadband offerings that allow customers to integrate their home or business fixed services with mobile service. The ongoing deployment of 5G technology and the transition from hardware-based network technology to more efficient software-based technology are expected to enhance operational flexibility and efficiency. AT&T's investments in technology infrastructure and digital transformation initiatives are aimed at meeting increased customer demand for enhanced wireless and broadband services, including video streaming and smart technologies. The company is also restructuring its operations to be more efficient and effective, with a focus on improving customer service and ordering functions. The strategic resource allocation towards fiber and mobile connectivity, as well as growth in value-added services, is designed to strengthen AT&T's overall market position. The company's financial activities, including cash management and capital expenditures, are influenced by demand for services, capacity needs, and network enhancements, with a significant portion of capital expenditures directed towards network upgrades and expansion. The anticipated combination of the WarnerMedia segment with a subsidiary of Discovery, Inc. is expected to close in the second quarter of 2022, which will further align AT&T's strategic capabilities with its operational goals. The company continues to support regulatory measures that reduce burdens inhibiting its ability to compete effectively and offer needed services to customers, while also seeking to ensure that legacy regulations do not extend to broadband or wireless services.

MetLife is one of the world's leading financial services companies, providing insurance, annuities, employee benefits, and asset management. The company continues to closely monitor developments relating to the COVID-19 pandemic and assess its impact on business operations, investment portfolio, and derivatives. The COVID-19 pandemic has caused volatility in the global equity, credit, and real estate markets, which affects the company's financial performance. MetLife has implemented risk management and business continuity plans, enabling it to maintain critical business processes, customer service levels, and internal controls. The company emphasizes the importance of mobilizing and deploying IT-based resources in combination with leveraging the value of other resources and capabilities to transform into a competitive force. The life insurance industry remains highly competitive, with larger companies investing in brand equity, product development, technology optimization, risk management, and innovation, which are fundamental for sustained profitable growth. Insurers are increasingly seeking alternative sources of revenue, focusing on monetization of assets and fee-based services, which include providing value-added services along with traditional products. The company believes that technological efficiency and organizational agility are prerequisites for sustainable growth in the life insurance industry. The ability to adapt to changes in the competitive environment is a significant differentiator for success in the life insurance and broader financial services industry. MetLife's investment portfolio is managed using disciplined asset-liability management principles, focusing on cash flow and duration to support current and future liabilities. The company actively manages its assets using a liability-driven approach, balancing quality, diversification, and investment return while ensuring that assets and liabilities are reasonably aligned on a cash flow and duration basis. The investment process aims to optimize risk-adjusted investment income and total return while managing credit risk through fundamental credit analysis and diversification. MetLife's economic capital model measures risk in the business and provides a basis for capital deployment, aligning segment allocated equity with emerging standards and consistent risk principles. The company has established several senior management committees to oversee capital and risk positions, approve asset-liability management strategies, and ensure comprehensive coverage of risk reporting. MetLife's global risk management department coordinates across all risk committees to ensure that all material risks are properly identified, measured, monitored, managed, and reported. The company employs a three lines of defense model for risk management, with the lines of business and corporate functions as the first line of defense, global risk management as the second, and internal audit as the third. The company's risk management framework includes market risk, credit risk, insurance risk, non-financial risk, and liquidity risk. The company has a robust process for managing information security risk, overseen by the enterprise chief information security officer, which aims to protect information and technology assets through various safeguards.

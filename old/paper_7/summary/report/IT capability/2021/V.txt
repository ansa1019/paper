This management's discussion and analysis provides a review of the results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity and capital resources of Visa Inc. and its subsidiaries. Visa is a global payments technology company that enables innovative, reliable, and secure electronic payments across more than 200 countries and territories. We facilitate global commerce and money movement across a global network of consumers, merchants, financial institutions, businesses, strategic partners, and government entities through innovative technologies. Our advanced transaction processing network, Visanet, enables authorization, clearing, and settlement of payment transactions and allows us to offer products and solutions that facilitate secure, reliable, and efficient money movement for all participants in the ecosystem. We expect to continue investing in technology assets and payments system infrastructure to support our digital solutions and core business initiatives. Our capital expenditures decreased slightly, but we anticipate ongoing investments in technology resources to enhance our operational efficiency and support our business transformation. The ongoing effects of COVID-19 remain difficult to predict, impacting our operational flexibility and business performance. Our net revenues are primarily generated from payments volume on Visa products for purchased goods and services, as well as the number of transactions processed on our network. The growth in payments volume and processed transactions is indicative of our IT capabilities, which have evolved to encompass the coordination of our assets and internal processes. We utilize non-GAAP financial measures to provide greater transparency into management's view and assessment of our ongoing operating performance, which includes the strategic allocation of resources towards technology integration and innovation partnerships. Our liquidity management policies provide guidelines to ensure timely completion of payments settlement activities and planned capital investments in our business. We maintain a commercial paper program to support our working capital requirements and for other general corporate purposes. Our treasury policies aim to provide adequate liquidity to cover operating expenditures and ensure payments on required litigation settlements. We are also involved in pending acquisitions, including agreements to acquire Tink AB and Currencycloud, which are subject to customary closing conditions. These acquisitions represent strategic investments in technology capabilities that align with our business strategy and enhance our competitive advantage. The management of our liquidity includes evaluating cash requirements for current operations and potential investment opportunities, ensuring we can mobilize resources effectively to meet our organizational goals. Our ongoing evaluation of the impact of external factors on our business environment underscores the importance of maintaining robust IT governance and capability leverage to respond to market dynamics. We continue to assess our liquidity position and potential sources of supplemental liquidity in view of our operating performance and current economic conditions.

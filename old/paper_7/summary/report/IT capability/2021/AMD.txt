In 2021, we expanded the AMD Ryzen mobile processor family with the launch of the AMD Ryzen 5000 series mobile processors designed for gamers, creators, and professionals, which underscores our commitment to enhancing IT capabilities through high-performance products. The AMD Ryzen Pro series mobile processors are built to provide powerful computing experiences with security features for demanding business environments like remote working, reflecting our focus on IT capability in supporting business needs. We also introduced the AMD Instinct MI200 series accelerators optimized for HPC and AI/ML workloads, highlighting our investment in technology resources that enhance operational efficiency and firm performance. Our strategic investments through long-term purchase commitments and prepayment arrangements in our supply chain to secure additional capacity are indicative of our resource allocation strategies aimed at supporting future revenue growth and market agility. The introduction of the AMD FidelityFX Super Resolution software for game developers exemplifies our commitment to innovation and enhancing customer value through technology functionalities. The AMD Epyc 7003 series processors, which include security features through AMD Infinity Guard, are designed to drive faster times to results and improve business outcomes, showcasing our focus on IT governance and operational flexibility. Our leadership portfolio of high-performance products and robust customer demand reflects our capability to leverage IT resources effectively in response to market dynamics. The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has impacted our business operations, yet we experienced limited disruptions in 2021, demonstrating our organizational resilience and adaptability in a challenging environment. We are actively monitoring public health measures and have taken safety measures to protect our employees, which illustrates our commitment to maintaining operational efficiency while navigating external influences. Our financial condition improved significantly, with net revenue for 2021 reaching $16.4 billion, an increase of 68% compared to 2020, driven by our strategic focus on high-performance computing and innovation partnerships. The increase in gross margin was primarily driven by a richer mix of Epyc, Radeon, and Ryzen processor sales, reflecting our ability to optimize our technology portfolio and enhance performance metrics. We believe our cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments, and cash flows from operations will be sufficient to fund operations, including capital expenditures and purchase commitments, over the next 12 months and beyond, indicating our strong financial position to support ongoing investments in IT capabilities. Our strategic management practices, including the evaluation of critical accounting estimates and resource management, are designed to align with our organizational goals and enhance our competitive positioning in the market. As we continue to innovate and develop our technology capabilities, we remain focused on delivering high-quality products that meet evolving consumer demands and drive business transformation.

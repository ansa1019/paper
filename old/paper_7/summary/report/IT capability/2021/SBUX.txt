In fiscal 2021, we began to enhance our digital capabilities and drive beverage innovation, which are integral to our long-term growth strategy. We believe that our investment in technology is essential to support our core businesses and improve customer experiences. This includes strategic investments in technology that enable operational efficiencies and enhance our ability to respond to changing customer demands. The restructuring plan announced in fiscal 2020 aimed to optimize our North America store portfolio by developing new store formats to better cater to evolving customer tastes and preferences, which reflects our commitment to leveraging technology in business transformation. Additionally, we have made incremental investments in technology to support our operational needs and enhance our management capabilities. Our financial results indicate that the growth in company-operated store revenue was driven by a significant increase in comparable store sales, which can be attributed to our ability to effectively deploy resources and manage operational processes. The overall strength and resilience of our brand were demonstrated through a 24% increase in consolidated revenues, which highlights our capability to adapt and thrive in a competitive market environment. The increase in operating margin was primarily due to sales leverage from business recovery and lapping higher COVID-19 related costs in the prior year, showcasing our operational flexibility and strategic resource allocation. Our investments in digital infrastructure and technology functionalities have positioned us to enhance our customer relationships and improve our market responsiveness. The transition of certain product activities to Nestl√© and the growth in our ready-to-drink business are examples of how we are leveraging partnerships and technology to drive performance gains. We anticipate that our planned wage investment in the U.S., along with increased supply chain costs, will impact operating margins; however, these will be offset by pricing decisions and productivity efficiencies. Our ability to manage cash flows and investments is crucial for financing capital requirements and supporting our growth initiatives. We are committed to using our cash resources to invest in new ways to serve our customers and support our store partners, which aligns with our strategic objectives. The ongoing evaluation of our operational processes and technology deployment will continue to enhance our organizational capabilities and drive performance improvement. We expect that our focus on digital transformation and IT effectiveness will create actionable options for future growth and innovation, ensuring that we remain competitive in a rapidly changing business environment.

We operate in an environment characterized by complexity in global security and continuing economic pressures, where a significant component of our strategy is to focus on program execution and improving the quality and predictability of the delivery of our products and services. We recognize that our customers are resource constrained, which drives our considerable focus on affordability initiatives while developing and extending our portfolio in a disciplined manner. We invest substantially in our people to ensure we have the technical skills necessary to succeed and expect to continue investing internally in innovative technologies that address rapidly evolving mission requirements for our customers. Our strategy includes deepening our connection to commercial industry through cooperative partnerships, joint ventures, and equity investments. The COVID-19 pandemic presented business challenges, impacting our operations and financial performance, including increased costs and delays in supplier deliveries. We continue to monitor risks driven by the pandemic and expect to prioritize small and COVID-19 impacted businesses in our supplier payments. Our financial outlook assumes continued support and funding of our programs, with a focus on maintaining operational flexibility and managing our cash flow effectively. We continuously strive to strengthen our portfolio of products and services to meet current and future customer needs, which includes independent research and development activities and selective acquisitions. Our business segments are engaged in the research, design, development, manufacture, integration, and sustainment of advanced technology systems, products, and services, with a focus on defense, space, intelligence, and information technology, including cybersecurity. We recognize revenue as performance obligations are satisfied and the customer obtains control of the products and services, with most contracts accounted for using the percentage-of-completion cost-to-cost method. Our contracts often involve complex technical requirements and long-term commitments, necessitating careful monitoring of risks associated with technical, schedule, and cost aspects. We have a balanced cash deployment strategy to invest in our business and key technologies, enhancing stockholder value and positioning ourselves for new business opportunities. Our capital expenditures include investments in information technology to support programs and general enterprise infrastructure, which are essential for operational efficiency and effectiveness. We also engage in strategic resource allocation to leverage our IT capabilities in support of business needs and to enhance our competitive advantage. The management of our pension obligations and environmental liabilities reflects our commitment to operational excellence and compliance with regulatory requirements, ensuring that we maintain a strong financial position while addressing the evolving demands of our business environment. Our organizational capabilities are further enhanced through ongoing investments in technology management and process optimization, which are critical for sustaining our performance and achieving our strategic objectives.

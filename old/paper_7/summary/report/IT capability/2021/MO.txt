Altria's critical information technology systems have remained operational. Altria continues to monitor the risks associated with facility disruptions and workforce availability as a result of uncertainty related to the COVID-19 pandemic and guidance from public health officials as it evolves its safety protocols. Altria believes that the COVID-19 pandemic altered adult tobacco consumer behaviors and purchasing patterns, particularly in the earlier stages of the pandemic. Altria continues to monitor the macroeconomic risks of the COVID-19 pandemic, including risks associated with the timing and extent of vaccine administration and the impact of COVID-19 variants, and their effect on adult tobacco consumers, including stay-at-home practices and disposable income. Altria also continues to monitor adult tobacco consumers' purchasing behaviors, including overall tobacco product expenditures, mix between premium and discount brand purchases, and adoption of smoke-free products. Altria's suppliers and those within its distribution chain continue to be subject to potential facility closures, remote working protocols, labor shortages, supply chain disruptions, and inflation. Altria continues to monitor the risk that the business of one or more suppliers, distributors, or any other entities within its supply and distribution chains may be disrupted. Altria's operations have been affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, but it believes its tobacco businesses have not experienced any material adverse effects associated with governmental actions to restrict consumer movement or business operations. Altria continues to operate in a remote working environment for many employees and believes that remote working due to the COVID-19 pandemic has had minimal impact on productivity. Altria continues to evaluate potential outcomes and work to mitigate risks related to liquidity, operations, supply and distribution chains, and economic conditions. Altria's operations and those of its investees are under continuous assessment to ensure that the impacts of external factors, including the pandemic, are managed effectively. Altria has not experienced a material adverse impact on its liquidity despite some temporary volatility in commercial paper markets. The company remains focused on any potential impact to its liquidity and operations, including supply chain disruptions and inflationary pressures. Altria continues to monitor the inflationary environment arising in part from the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on its financial position and results of operations. Altria's tobacco businesses previously suspended operations temporarily at several of their manufacturing facilities but resumed operations under enhanced safety protocols. Altria's critical information technology systems have remained operational throughout these challenges, supporting the firm's ability to adapt to changing market dynamics and consumer behaviors. Altria will continue to monitor the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on its business, including near-term supply chain constraints and inflation, as it conducts its periodic assessments and valuations. Altria's strategic management practices include ongoing evaluations of its investments and the performance of its business segments in light of evolving market conditions and consumer demands.

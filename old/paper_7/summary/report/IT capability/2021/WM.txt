The integration of advanced disposal has involved the integration of certain customer-facing and back-office digital platforms to ensure uninterrupted service. We believe that our industry-leading asset network, combined with our strategic investments in technology, will enhance our competitive advantage and support our operational flexibility in a dynamic market environment. The impacts of COVID-19 have underscored the importance of maintaining business continuity and adapting our service offerings to meet changing customer needs. We are actively monitoring market dynamics and regulatory developments to adapt our service offerings, which include expanding traditional recycling services and increasing organics collection and processing. Our sustainability agenda aligns with our commitment to innovation and meeting the evolving needs of our diverse customer base. The companyâ€™s strategic pricing efforts are focused on recovering inflationary cost increases by increasing average unit rates, while a significant portion of our revenue is tied to a price escalation index that has resulted in a timing lag in our ability to recover increased costs. We continue to leverage technology to automate certain aspects of our operations, which is crucial for mitigating inflationary pressures and enhancing overall efficiency. Our focus on technology management, including investments in digital infrastructure and process automation, is integral to our operational strategy and long-term business resilience. The integration of technology capabilities within our operations is expected to enhance our organizational effectiveness and support our strategic resource allocation decisions. As we navigate the competitive landscape, our commitment to leveraging IT capabilities will be essential in transforming our business processes and enhancing our market responsiveness. We are dedicated to continuous improvement and innovation, which are critical for maintaining our leadership position in the waste management industry.

The management's discussion and analysis highlights that our financial performance is significantly influenced by varying conditions in the markets we serve, particularly the on-highway, construction, and general industrial markets, which tend to fluctuate in response to overall economic conditions. Our operations are affected by external influences such as currency, political, and regulatory matters, including the adoption and enforcement of environmental and emission standards. As part of our growth strategy, we invest in businesses in countries with high levels of risk, which requires us to mobilize and deploy IT-based resources effectively to support our business strategies and work processes. The pandemic has triggered supply chain disruptions that have limited our ability to meet end-user demand, emphasizing the importance of operational flexibility and the need for effective information management capabilities. Our research and development efforts focus on developing new products to meet future emission standards and improve the fuel economy performance of our engines, which reflects our commitment to innovation and technology deployment. The increase in net sales was driven by higher demand across all operating segments, indicating our capability to respond to market dynamics and consumer choice effectively. We continue to enhance our organizational capabilities through strategic resource allocation and investment decisions that align with our business needs. Our liquidity position, supported by cash and marketable securities, provides us with the financial flexibility needed to fund common stock repurchases, dividend payments, and targeted capital expenditures, which are essential for maintaining competitive advantage and operational efficiency. The increase in gross margin was primarily due to higher volumes and favorable pricing, although it was partially offset by increased compensation expenses and higher material costs, highlighting the challenges we face in managing operational costs amidst supply chain constraints. Our focus on digital transformation and the development of our new power segment, which includes hydrogen production solutions and electrified power systems, demonstrates our commitment to adapting to changing market conditions and enhancing our technology portfolio. The strategic management practices we employ, including monitoring systems and evaluation systems, are designed to ensure that we leverage our IT capabilities effectively to support our organizational goals and enhance firm performance. Our approach to managing information processing capacity and ensuring information reliability and security is critical in navigating the complexities of the current business environment. The ongoing evaluation of our strategic decisions and the integration of technology capabilities into our operations are vital to achieving performance excellence and maintaining our position as a competitive force in the industry.

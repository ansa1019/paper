In 2021, we incurred an increase in selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses, which included a write-off of certain information technology assets in the fourth quarter that are no longer expected to be utilized as part of the modernization of our information systems. Our capital requirements for information systems are significant, as they encompass acquiring technology for new and remodeled warehouses, manufacturing and distribution facilities, and initial warehouse operations. We believe that our investments in technology resources and information systems are critical to enhancing operational efficiency and supporting our business strategies. Our e-commerce business growth, which has increased sales, generally has a lower gross margin percentage relative to our warehouse operations, indicating the need for effective IT capabilities to optimize this channel. The integration of digital technologies into our operations is essential for maintaining competitive advantage and responding to market dynamics. Our operational model relies on leveraging technology to enhance decision-making speed and improve information management, which is vital for adapting to external influences and market changes. The effective deployment of IT resources is necessary for achieving our organizational goals and enhancing performance metrics. As we continue to expand our warehouse base, the coordination of our IT capabilities with other organizational resources becomes increasingly important to ensure operational flexibility and support business transformation initiatives. The impact of changes in foreign currencies and gasoline prices on our financial performance highlights the need for robust information processing capabilities to manage these variables effectively. Our financial performance is also influenced by our ability to mobilize and integrate technology resources, which is critical for sustaining growth and enhancing profitability. The strategic alignment of our IT capabilities with business processes is a key factor in achieving market responsiveness and operational effectiveness. As we face challenges related to supply chain management and external relationships, our IT governance and management skills will play a crucial role in navigating these complexities. The ongoing evolution of our IT capabilities underscores the importance of investing in technology infrastructure to support our long-term objectives and enhance our competitive positioning in the marketplace.

The company has built its own global content delivery network ("open connect") to help efficiently stream a high volume of content to members over the internet, which reflects the integration of technology capabilities into operational processes. Technology and development expenses consist primarily of payroll and related expenses for technology personnel responsible for making improvements to service offerings, including testing, maintaining, and modifying user interfaces, recommendations, merchandising, and infrastructure. The increase in technology and development expenses for the year ended December 31, 2021, was primarily due to a growth in average headcount to support the increase in production activity and continued improvements in the streaming service. The company's service continues to grow globally, with over 90% of paid net membership additions for the year ended December 31, 2021, coming from outside the United States and Canada, indicating a strategic response to market dynamics and consumer demands. The operational flexibility demonstrated through the ability to adapt pricing and membership plans based on regional market conditions illustrates the firm's capability to leverage technology resources for competitive advantage. The increase in operating margin is attributed to content amortization growing at a slower rate compared to the increase in revenues, partly due to delays in content releases influenced by the COVID-19 pandemic, which highlights the challenges faced in managing technology deployment and operational efficiency. The company anticipates that cash flows from operations, available funds, and access to financing sources will continue to be sufficient to meet cash needs, reflecting a strategic resource allocation approach in response to evolving business environments. The preparation of consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, emphasizing the importance of information management capability in supporting decision-making processes. The company's ability to acquire, deploy, combine, and reconfigure IT resources in support of business strategies is crucial for transforming the firm into a competitive force, as IT capabilities are essential for enhancing organizational effectiveness and achieving business goals. The focus on technology management and the integration of IT systems into business processes are indicative of the firm's commitment to continuous improvement and innovation in its operational framework. The strategic management practices employed by the company reflect an understanding of the dynamic capabilities necessary to respond to market restructuring and environmental turbulence, ensuring that the organization remains agile and competitive in a rapidly changing landscape.

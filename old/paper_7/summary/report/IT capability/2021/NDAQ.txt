The following discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations of Nasdaq should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes. We manage, operate, and provide our products and services in four business segments: market technology, investment intelligence, corporate platforms, and market services. The acquisition of Verafin in February 2021 and the divestiture of our U.S. fixed income business in June 2021 have impacted the comparability of our results of operations. Our market technology segment has seen significant growth, particularly in anti-financial crime technology, which increased primarily due to the inclusion of revenues from our acquisition of Verafin and continued growth in surveillance solutions. The investment intelligence segment has benefited from proprietary data revenues from new sales, particularly outside the U.S., and higher licensing revenues from futures trading linked to Nasdaq indexes. Our corporate platforms segment has experienced increased revenues due to a higher number of listed companies and adoption of our investor relations intelligence products. The increase in operating expenses is primarily driven by higher performance-linked compensation, consulting costs, and increased cloud storage costs due to our acquisition of Verafin. We have pursued various strategic initiatives and completed acquisitions and divestitures, which have resulted in expenses related to integration costs and other transaction costs. Our liquidity and capital resources remain healthy, and we continue to assess our capital deployment strategy through balancing acquisitions, internal investments, debt repayments, and shareholder return activity. The strategic management of our technology resources, including the deployment of IT capabilities, is essential for enhancing business strategies and operational efficiency. Our focus on information management capability underscores the importance of providing data and information to users with appropriate levels of accuracy, timeliness, reliability, security, and access, tailored to changing business needs. The integration of technology capabilities into our business processes is critical for transforming our firm into a competitive force, enabling us to leverage IT-based resources in conjunction with other strategic resources to enhance organizational performance and drive innovation. Our operational flexibility and responsiveness to market dynamics are supported by our technology infrastructure, which facilitates effective communication and coordination across business segments. The ongoing evolution of our IT capabilities is aligned with our commitment to enhancing business value and achieving performance excellence in a rapidly changing business environment. The management of our technology portfolio, including investments in digital infrastructure and data analytics, is integral to our strategic resource allocation and decision-making processes. As we navigate the complexities of market competition and regulatory contexts, our ability to mobilize and deploy IT resources effectively will be pivotal in sustaining our market positioning and driving future growth.

Cintas' principal objective is to exceed customers' expectations in order to maximize long-term value, which provides the framework and focus for its business strategy. This strategy aims to achieve revenue growth by increasing penetration at existing customers and broadening the customer base to include market segments not historically served. The company identifies additional product and service opportunities for current and future customers. Cintas has a highly talented and diverse team of service professionals visiting customers regularly, enabling the development of close personal relationships. The combination of the distribution system and strong customer relationships provides a platform for launching additional products and services. The company regularly reviews its operating segments for reporting purposes based on information its chief operating decision maker reviews for resource allocation and performance assessment. During fiscal 2021, Cintas' business operations were impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, which affected the ability to conduct normal operations and had an adverse effect on business performance. The company increased inventory in response to customer needs related to safety and cleanliness requirements, which resulted in additional inventory reserves. Cintas evaluates operating segment performance based on revenue and income before income taxes, with a focus on operational efficiency and resource management. The company’s cash flows from operating activities have historically supplied a significant source of liquidity, which is used to fund operations, expansion activities, and dividends. Cintas expects cash flows from operating activities to remain sufficient for short-term liquidity. The company has access to a revolving credit facility, which provides additional liquidity for growth and expansion opportunities. The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic continues to evolve, creating uncertainty about the pace of economic recovery and its effects on future financial results. Cintas' revenue growth was positively impacted by increased sales productivity and the penetration of additional products and services into existing customers. The company has implemented cost control measures, which have contributed to improvements in selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue. The firm’s ability to leverage IT capabilities effectively supports business needs and enhances operational flexibility, contributing to its competitive advantage and market responsiveness. Cintas continues to pursue strategic acquisitions and investments in technology resources to align with business strategy and respond to market dynamics. The company’s focus on innovation and technology deployment is essential for maintaining operational effectiveness and achieving long-term performance excellence.

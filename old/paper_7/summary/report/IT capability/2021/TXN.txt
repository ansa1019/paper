Technology is the foundation of our company, and our strategy to maximize free cash flow per share growth has three elements: a great business model that is focused on analog and embedded processing products and built around four sustainable competitive advantages, discipline in allocating capital to the best opportunities, and efficiency, which means constantly striving for more output for every dollar spent. We make our investments with an eye towards long-term strengthening and leveraging of these advantages. Our focus on analog and embedded processing allows us to generate strong cash flow from operations, underscoring the strength of our business model. Our strategic focus is on analog and embedded processing products sold into six end markets, with additional strategic emphasis on designing and selling those products into the industrial and automotive markets, which we believe represent the best growth opportunities. We expect our capital expenditures to be higher than historical levels as we continue to invest to strengthen our competitive advantage in manufacturing and technology as part of our long-term capacity planning. Our results of operations provide details of our financial results, reflecting the quality of our product portfolio and the efficiency of our manufacturing strategy. We believe that our business model with the combined effect of our competitive advantages sets us apart from our peers and will for a long time to come. The coronavirus pandemic and its effects are impacting and will likely continue to impact market conditions and business operations across industries worldwide, including at our company. Therefore, we remain cautious about how the economy might behave for the next few years and continue to monitor potential impact on our operations. Our segments represent groups of similar products that are combined based on similar design and development requirements, product characteristics, manufacturing processes, and distribution channels, and how management allocates resources and measures results. Our cash flow from operations of $8.76 billion reflects the strength of our business model, while free cash flow was $6.29 billion, representing 34.3% of revenue. We returned $4.41 billion to shareholders through dividends and stock repurchases, underscoring the sustainability of our dividend, which represented 62% of free cash flow. Our financial condition at the end of 2021 shows total cash of $9.74 billion, an increase from the previous year, and we believe we have the necessary financial resources and operating plans to fund our working capital needs, capital expenditures, dividend and debt-related payments, and other business requirements for at least the next 12 months. We recognize potential liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues and must assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets can be recovered. Our judgment regarding future recoverability of our deferred tax assets may change due to various factors, including changes in tax laws and market conditions. We also consider the impact of technology shifts and customer demands on our inventory valuation allowances, which are determined based on historical disposals of inventory and current backlog. Our commitment to operational efficiency and strategic resource allocation is evident in our approach to capital expenditures and investment choices, ensuring we maintain a competitive edge in the market.

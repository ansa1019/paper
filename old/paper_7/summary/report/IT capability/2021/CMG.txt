During 2021, we completed several company initiatives which we believe contributed to sales growth, including the digital launch of new menu items and enhancements to our loyalty program, Chipotle Rewards, aimed at improving customer relationships and engagement. Additionally, we expect to incur capital expenditures related to investments in technology to optimize efficiencies, enhance the customer experience, and improve operations. We have not experienced significant disruptions in our supply chain; however, we have experienced inflationary pressures in freight and the costs of some of our ingredients, which could impact our operational efficiency. Our restaurant operating costs were 77.4% of total revenue, a decrease from 82.6% in the previous year, driven primarily by higher comparable restaurant sales, which reflects our ability to leverage operational capabilities effectively. The digital sales segment, which includes delivery and customer pick-up, represented a significant portion of total revenue, indicating the importance of digital technologies in our business model. We anticipate that ongoing investments in technology infrastructure will further support our operational flexibility and enhance our market agility. The integration of technology in our operations is critical for maintaining competitive advantage and responding to changing consumer demands. Our strategic resource allocation includes investments in technology for support centers to boost innovation and improve operational processes. We believe that cash from operations, alongside our cash and investment balances, will be sufficient to meet ongoing capital expenditures and working capital requirements, facilitating our ability to adapt to market dynamics. The anticipated restaurant wage increases and supply chain costs are expected to impact operating costs; however, we aim to offset these through pricing actions and revenue growth leverage. Our ability to manage and deploy IT resources effectively is essential for achieving our organizational goals and enhancing overall firm performance. The strategic alignment of our technology capabilities with business needs is fundamental to our transformation into a competitive force within the industry. We continue to monitor external influences and market conditions that could affect our operational strategies and investment decisions, ensuring that we remain responsive to environmental opportunities and challenges. The ongoing development of our IT capabilities, including data management and information systems, is vital for supporting business processes and enhancing decision-making speed. We recognize the importance of maintaining information reliability, security, and confidentiality as we leverage technology to drive performance gains and improve customer value. Our focus on process optimization and the integration of digital solutions will enable us to navigate the complexities of the current business environment while pursuing long-term growth objectives.

We are an independent oil and natural gas company focused on the acquisition, development, exploration, and exploitation of unconventional, onshore oil and natural gas reserves. Our activities are primarily directed at the horizontal development of formations in the Permian Basin. We intend to continue to develop our reserves and increase production through development drilling and exploitation activities on our multi-year inventory of identified potential drilling locations and through acquisitions that meet our strategic and financial objectives. We believe that in the current commodity price environment we are positioned to generate significant free cash flow while continuing to grow production at industry-leading rates. We will continue monitoring the ongoing commodity price environment and expect to retain the financial flexibility to adjust our drilling and completion plans in response to market conditions. We focus on low-cost operations and best-in-class execution. Our capital budget for 2019 includes significant expenditures for horizontal drilling and midstream infrastructure investments. We expect to drill and complete numerous gross horizontal wells, which reflects our commitment to operational efficiency and strategic resource allocation. Our operational updates indicate that we continue to achieve positive results across our core development areas, focusing on drilling long-lateral, multi-well pads targeting specific formations. We have also entered into various agreements to fund oil and natural gas development, which will enhance our operational capabilities and financial flexibility. Our midstream services revenue represents fees charged for the transportation of oil and natural gas, which complements our operations in areas with significant production. The increase in our midstream services revenue reflects our strategy to integrate operations and enhance our value chain. We have capitalized on opportunities to optimize our processes and improve our performance metrics, which are critical for maintaining competitive positioning in a volatile market. Our financial activities include significant capital expenditures for drilling and infrastructure, which are essential for supporting our growth and operational capabilities. We are committed to leveraging our technology resources and management skills to enhance our information management capabilities, ensuring that we can provide timely and accurate data to support decision-making processes. Our investments in technology infrastructure and operational flexibility are aimed at maximizing our business value and ensuring that we can respond effectively to market dynamics. The strategic alignment of our business processes with our overall objectives is critical for achieving operational excellence and enhancing our organizational effectiveness. We continue to evaluate our investment choices and operational strategies to ensure that we remain agile and responsive to changes in the business environment, thereby sustaining our competitive advantage and driving long-term value creation.

The company's fiscal year begins on April 1 and ends on March 31. Revenues increased in 2019 and 2018 primarily due to market growth, including expanded business with existing customers and business acquisitions, partially offset by loss of customers within the U.S. pharmaceutical and specialty solutions segment. The increase in revenue was also offset by the 2017 contribution of the majority of our McKesson Technology Solutions businesses to form the Change Healthcare joint venture. Operating expenses for 2019 were affected by non-cash pre-tax goodwill impairment charges and restructuring charges, which were primarily due to declines in estimated future cash flows attributed to additional government reimbursement reductions and competitive pressures. The company announced a strategic growth initiative intended to drive long-term incremental profit growth and increase operational efficiency, which includes the centralization and outsourcing of certain administrative functions. Corporate expenses increased primarily due to higher restructuring-related charges and costs for technology initiatives. The company is a defendant in many cases alleging claims related to the distribution of controlled substances, which may require operational changes or commercial arrangements to mitigate adverse impacts on results of operations.

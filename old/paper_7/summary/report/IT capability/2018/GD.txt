The information technology segment's revenue increased due primarily to the CSRA acquisition in the second quarter of 2018. Operating margin decreased 110 basis points compared with 2017 due to intangible asset amortization expense from the CSRA acquisition. Excluding the impact of this amortization, the segment's margin would have been 9.6%, reflecting the favorable impact of CSRA's mix of higher-margin, fixed-price work. The segment achieved a book-to-bill ratio of 1-to-1 for the fourth consecutive year driven by several significant contract awards during the year, including $375 from the New York State Department of Health to provide engineering and technical improvements to the state's health benefits exchange, and $195 from the U.S. Air Force for the Battlefield Information Collection and Exploitation System (BICES) program to provide information sharing support to coalition operations. The segment's backlog at year-end 2018 included $1.1 billion to provide classified IT infrastructure services to an agency of the DOD with an additional $1.1 billion of estimated potential contract value remaining under the contract. The total backlog was $8 billion at the end of 2018, up 120.6% from $3.6 billion at year-end 2017 due to the CSRA acquisition. This amount does not include $17.1 billion of estimated potential contract value associated with its anticipated share of IDIQ contracts and unexercised options on December 31, 2018. The information technology segment's revenue increased due primarily to the CSRA acquisition, which has enhanced the firm's IT capabilities. The acquisition has allowed for the mobilization and deployment of IT-based resources, leveraging the value of other resources and capabilities to further organizational goals. The segment's operating earnings increased significantly, reflecting strong program performance and favorable contract mix across the portfolio. The integration of CSRA is expected to support the long-term growth of the information technology segment by enhancing its ability to respond to changing business needs and directions. The segment's operational flexibility and capability to adapt to market dynamics have positioned it to capitalize on emerging opportunities in the information technology landscape, thereby reinforcing its competitive advantage. The ability to provide data and information to users with appropriate levels of accuracy, timeliness, reliability, security, confidentiality, connectivity, and access has been critical in supporting the firm's strategic resource allocation and investment decisions. The information technology segment's performance is indicative of the firm's broader commitment to leveraging technology capabilities and resources to drive business transformation and enhance overall firm performance. The strategic alignment of IT resources with business processes has facilitated improved operational efficiency and effectiveness, enabling the firm to navigate complex market environments and achieve sustainable growth.

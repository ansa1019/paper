The malware incident on June 27, 2017, significantly impacted our business, affecting a substantial portion of our global sales, distribution, and financial networks. During this period, we executed business continuity and contingency plans to contain the impact, minimize damages, and restore our systems environment. The incident highlighted the importance of enhancing our system security and overall information technology capabilities. Following the malware incident, we continued efforts to strengthen our security measures and enhance general information technology, business process, and disclosure controls. We have devoted focused resources to network security, backup and disaster recovery, and enhanced training to protect our systems and data. We also focus on enhancing the monitoring and detection of threats in our environment, including operational technologies, and adjusting information security controls based on updated threats. 

Our strategy to drive long-term growth emphasizes operational excellence and creating a winning growth culture, which includes leveraging our strong foundation of iconic global and local brands and deep innovation, marketing, and distribution capabilities. We believe that the successful implementation of our strategic priorities will drive top- and bottom-line growth, enabling us to create long-term value for our shareholders. We recognize that our competitive positioning relies heavily on meeting consumer needs and preferences through agile product innovation and high standards of product quality, which are supported by our technology capabilities.

We continuously monitor developments and trends that could impact our revenue and profitability objectives, including long-term demographics and consumer trends that correlate with GDP growth and urbanization. Our investment in technology resources, including digital and e-commerce initiatives, is critical to positioning ourselves for long-term growth. We also acknowledge that our growth strategy depends on our ability to expand operations, particularly in emerging markets, which are subject to greater political, economic, and currency volatility.

The simplification of our operations through the "simplify to grow" program is designed to bring about significant reductions in our operating cost structure, enhancing our operational efficiency. We are committed to investing in our brands and new routes to market, which includes significant investments in our technology infrastructure to support these initiatives. Our focus on improving our technology deployment and IT architecture is essential for optimizing our business processes and enhancing our overall firm capabilities.

We recognize that our IT capabilities must evolve to encompass the coordination of our assets and internal processes, as well as interfirm transactions and relationships. The ability to acquire, deploy, combine, and reconfigure IT resources is vital in supporting and enhancing our business strategies and work processes. Our management capability in information management is crucial for providing data and information to users with the appropriate levels of accuracy, timeliness, reliability, and security, tailored to respond to changing business needs and directions.

Our fiscal year ended on the Sunday closest to September 30, and the fiscal years ended on September 30, 2018, and October 1, 2017, included 52 weeks. Financial highlights indicate that consolidated operating income decreased to $3.9 billion in fiscal 2018 compared to operating income of $4.1 billion in fiscal 2017, with operating margin compression primarily driven by higher salaries and benefits related to digital platforms, technology infrastructure, and innovations. The restructuring and impairment charges increased to $224 million in fiscal 2018 compared to $154 million in fiscal 2017, primarily related to higher asset impairments associated with the decision to close certain company-operated stores and higher goodwill impairment charges related to our Switzerland retail reporting unit. The results for fiscal 2018 reflect the impact of restructuring and streamlining efforts to focus on accelerating growth in high-returning businesses and removing non-core, slow-growth activities, which include the acquisition of our East China joint venture and the conversion of our Singapore, Taiwan, and Brazil operations to licensed models. These efforts span across all segments and corporate functions, indicating a strategic alignment with our business transformation goals. In fiscal 2019, we expect continued growth through thoughtful long-term investments that create value and reward shareholders, driven by strategic priorities that include enhancing the in-store experience and delivering customer-relevant beverage innovation and digital relationships. We anticipate moderate revenue growth in fiscal 2019, reflecting the implementation of our streamlining activities and driven by comparable store sales growth and the opening of approximately 2,100 net new stores globally. The capital expenditures in fiscal 2019 are expected to be approximately $2.0 billion, primarily related to our retail portfolio, including investments in our new and existing stores and strategic store-related initiatives. The increase in cash flows from operations to $11.9 billion in fiscal 2018 compared to $4.3 billion in fiscal 2017 was primarily due to the receipt of the upfront payment from Nestl√© related to the global coffee alliance. Our investment portfolio includes highly liquid available-for-sale securities, and we actively manage our cash and investments to internally fund operating needs and make scheduled interest and principal payments on our borrowings. We have a $2.0 billion unsecured 5-year revolving credit facility and a $1.0 billion unsecured 364-day credit facility available for working capital, capital expenditures, and other corporate purposes, including acquisitions and share repurchases. The effective tax rate for fiscal 2018 was 21.8%, a decrease from 33.2% for fiscal 2017, primarily due to the gain on the purchase of our East China joint venture and the tax act. We expect to use our available cash and investments to invest in our core businesses, including capital expenditures, new product innovations, and digital investments, as well as to make strategic acquisitions to leverage existing capabilities and further build our business in support of our growth agenda. The combination of these changes indicates a focus on leveraging IT capabilities to enhance operational efficiency and support business transformation initiatives.

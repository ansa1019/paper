We provide vehicle sellers with a full range of services to process and sell vehicles primarily over the internet through our virtual bidding third generation internet auction-style sales technology, which we refer to as vb3. Our operations are supported by technology resources that facilitate the coordination of a firmâ€™s assets and internal processes. We monitor and analyze a number of key financial performance indicators in order to manage our business and evaluate our financial and operating performance. These indicators include service and vehicle sales revenue, which are influenced by our IT capabilities in managing transactions and relationships with vehicle sellers and buyers. Our technology infrastructure allows us to deploy and combine IT resources effectively, enhancing our operational efficiency and supporting business strategies. We believe that our IT capabilities have evolved to encompass the integration of technology functionalities that enhance our service offerings and improve customer relationships. The increase in service revenues has been driven primarily by increased volume and revenue per car due to higher average auction selling prices, which we attribute to our effective use of digital technologies and data management practices. Our general and administrative expenses include costs related to data processing and technology management, which are essential for maintaining our competitive advantage in the market. The increase in yard operations expenses resulted from growth in volume and the costs associated with technology assets placed into service in our U.S. and international locations. We continue to invest in technology development, including capitalized software development costs for new software for internal use and major software enhancements to existing software, which are critical for our operational flexibility and business transformation initiatives. Our strategic resource allocation includes investments in technology that support our expansion strategies in domestic and international markets. We recognize the importance of IT governance and management skills in leveraging our IT capabilities to respond to market dynamics and consumer demands. The adoption of new accounting standards, such as ASU 2014-09, will impact our revenue recognition practices and reflects our commitment to aligning our financial reporting with industry standards. We assess our IT effectiveness regularly to ensure that our technology deployment aligns with our organizational goals and enhances our performance outcomes. Our liquidity and capital resources are influenced by our ability to generate cash flows from operations, which are supported by our IT systems that facilitate transaction processing and information management. The integration of technology into our business processes is essential for optimizing performance and achieving sustainable profits for our stockholders while also producing environmental and social benefits. We expect to continue leveraging our IT capabilities to enhance our operational efficiency and maintain our position as a leading provider in the vehicle remarketing industry.

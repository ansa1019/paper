During fiscal 2018, we reported strong financial results consistent with the continued execution of our long-term plans for our two strategic growth areas, digital media and digital experience, while continuing to market and license a broad portfolio of products and solutions. Our digital media segment, which includes Creative Cloud, provides tools and solutions that enable individuals and enterprises to create, publish, promote, and monetize their digital content. The integration of our offerings, such as Adobe Experience Cloud, enhances our ability to measure, personalize, and optimize marketing campaigns and digital experiences across channels for optimal marketing performance. We are a market leader in the fast-growing category addressed by our digital experience segment, which provides comprehensive solutions including analytics, social marketing, targeting, media optimization, and marketing automation. The integration of technologies acquired from companies like Marketo and Magento into our digital experience business enhances our capabilities in delivering value to customers through improved connectivity and operational efficiency. Our strategy focuses on leveraging technology resources to drive business innovation and transformation, aligning with our organizational goals to enhance firm performance and market responsiveness. The investments in research and development are critical to remain competitive, directly related to the timely development of new and enhanced offerings and solutions. We continue to implement strategies that will accelerate awareness, consideration, and purchase of subscriptions to our Creative Cloud offerings, which include increasing the value users receive through new applications and targeted promotions. The growth in annual recurring revenue (ARR) reflects our success in driving subscription revenue across our offerings, indicating a strong market response and capability enhancement in our digital media and experience segments. The comprehensive solutions we offer enable marketers to optimize their campaigns through actionable insights derived from big data, enhancing our competitive advantage in the marketplace. Our investments in technology infrastructure and capabilities are designed to support our business processes and enhance operational flexibility, ensuring that we can respond effectively to changing market dynamics and consumer demands. The integration of acquired technologies and the strategic alignment of our offerings facilitate a seamless workflow for our customers, allowing them to effectively manage and monetize their content across every channel. Our commitment to improving IT capabilities underscores the importance of mobilizing and deploying IT-based resources in combination with leveraging the value of other resources and capabilities, ultimately driving business value and performance improvement. The anticipated growth in revenue from our digital experience solutions, driven by the addition of Marketo and Magento, is expected to further enhance our market positioning and operational effectiveness.

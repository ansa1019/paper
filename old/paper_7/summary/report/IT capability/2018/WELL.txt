Welltower Inc. is driving the transformation of health care infrastructure by investing with leading seniors housing operators, post-acute providers, and health systems to scale innovative care delivery models and improve overall health care experience. The company’s capital programs, combined with comprehensive planning, development, and property management services, create a single-source solution for acquiring, planning, developing, managing, repositioning, and monetizing real estate assets. To protect stockholder capital and enhance stockholder value, the company seeks opportunities across the full spectrum of seniors housing and health care real estate, diversifying its investment portfolio by property type, relationship, and geographic location. Substantially all revenues are derived from operating lease rentals, resident fees/services, and interest earned on outstanding loans receivable, which depend on the obligors' ability to make contractual payments and the profitability of operating properties. The company monitors investments through various methods, including reviewing financial statements, creditworthiness, property inspections, and covenant compliance. The asset management process for seniors housing properties includes evaluating market conditions to determine trends in operating performance and intervening early to address negative trends, thereby supporting revenue collectability and investment value. Operating leases and loans are typically credit enhanced by guarantees or letters of credit, and structured to mitigate payment risk. The company’s primary sources of cash include resident fees/services, rent and interest receipts, borrowings under its unsecured credit facility, and public issuances of debt and equity securities. New investments are generally funded from temporary borrowings, internally generated cash, and proceeds from investment dispositions. The company evaluates opportunities to finance future investments and expects to reinvest proceeds from any investment dispositions into new investments. The management regularly monitors economic factors to develop strategic plans aimed at improving performance and maximizing competitive positioning. The company’s ability to achieve financial objectives relies on effectively executing these plans and responding to emerging economic and company-specific trends. The corporate governance framework emphasizes ethical business practices and aims to increase stockholder value while adhering to legal requirements. The company’s liquidity is deemed sufficient to fund cash uses, and it continuously evaluates investment opportunities to ensure alignment with market conditions. The financial covenants in the company’s debt agreements require maintaining specific financial ratios, which are critical for managing capital structure and ensuring compliance. The company utilizes various key performance indicators to evaluate business aspects, including operating performance, credit strength, and concentration risk, which are essential for making informed operating decisions and budget planning.

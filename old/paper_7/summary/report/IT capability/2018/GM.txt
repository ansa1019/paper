Management has adopted a strategic plan to transform GM into the world's most valued automotive company, which includes leading in technology and innovation, including electrification, autonomous, and data connectivity. The company faces continuing market, operating, and regulatory challenges due to weak economic conditions, competitive pressures, and heightened emissions standards. The strategic decisions made by management are aimed at improving operational performance and achieving acceptable returns on invested capital. The company expects transformation activities to drive approximately $6.0 billion of annual cash savings by the end of 2020, resulting from reductions in automotive and other costs of sales, as well as reduced capital expenditures. This target includes significant cost savings achieved through staffing, manufacturing, and product initiatives. The management team continues to assess performance and the needs of the evolving business, which may require additional restructuring and rationalization actions that could impact results of operations. The company has implemented measures to improve overall business performance, including the reorganization of global product development staffs and the realignment of manufacturing capacity in response to market-related volume declines. The board of directors uses certain non-GAAP measures as key metrics to determine management performance under performance-based compensation plans, which allows for the evaluation of investment decisions made by management to improve return on invested capital. The company’s IT capabilities are critical in supporting business needs and transforming the firm into a competitive force, emphasizing the importance of mobilizing and deploying IT-based resources in combination with other resources and capabilities. The ability to provide data and information with appropriate levels of accuracy, timeliness, reliability, security, and access is essential for tailoring responses to changing business needs. The firm’s IT capabilities represent the application of technology, knowledge, practices, and management skills to further organizational goals. The company continues to leverage its technology infrastructure and digital capabilities to enhance operational efficiency and support strategic resource allocation. The focus on technology management and process optimization is integral to achieving business transformation and improving firm performance. The company’s strategic resource allocation decisions are influenced by market dynamics and competitive positioning, with an emphasis on maintaining a strong investment-grade balance sheet while pursuing opportunities for innovation and growth. The management evaluates opportunities to strengthen competitive position over the long term, which may include investments with joint venture partners and strategic alliances that generate significant advantages. The firm’s commitment to digital transformation and IT deployment is evident in its initiatives aimed at improving customer relationships and enhancing business processes, thereby creating value and ensuring market responsiveness in a rapidly changing environment.

The management's discussion and analysis highlights that our growth strategy includes expanding our international business, which is a key value driver for corporate growth. Our commitment to consumers begins with a broad product line and a wide selection of diet, light, and low-calorie beverages within our energy drink product lines. We continuously strive to meet changing consumer needs through beverage innovation, choice, and variety. The principal focus of cost management will continue to be on reducing input procurement and production costs, including raw material costs and co-packing fees, as well as reducing freight costs by securing additional co-packing facilities strategically localized. We believe that tailored branding, packaging, pricing, and distribution channel strategies help achieve profitable growth. Our capital structure is designed to optimize our working capital to finance expansion, both domestically and internationally, and we believe that our strong capital position provides a competitive advantage. We continue to incur expenditures in connection with the development and introduction of new products and flavors, which are essential for maintaining market responsiveness and competitive positioning. 

The company recognizes that consumer discretionary spending represents a challenge to the successful marketing and sale of our products, and we must continue to develop and introduce different and innovative beverages to retain and expand our market share. Our historical success is attributable, in part, to our introduction of innovative beverages that have been positively accepted by consumers. The beverage industry is subject to changing consumer preferences that may adversely affect us if we misjudge such preferences. Our future success will depend, in part, upon our continued ability to develop and introduce innovative beverages that meet consumer preferences. Additionally, we face risks associated with the realization of benefits from our relationship with TCCC, changes in consumer preferences, economic uncertainty, and the risks associated with foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations.

Management has identified certain challenges and risks for the beverage industry and the company, including the impact of legislation proposed or adopted to restrict the sale of energy drinks and the increasing concern over health matters related to our products. Our ability to manage legal and regulatory requirements in foreign jurisdictions and the potential difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations are also critical. The effectiveness of our information technology systems is vital, as disruptions or breaches could negatively impact customer relationships and business operations. We must effectively manage our inventories and accounts receivables while ensuring compliance with evolving industry standards regarding consumer privacy and data use and security. 

Our ability to achieve profitability from operations outside the United States and to absorb increases in freight costs are essential for maintaining operational flexibility. The management of our technology resources and capabilities is integral to our strategic resource allocation and overall organizational effectiveness. We believe that the introduction of new package formats and strategic positioning will capitalize on industry growth, while our commitment to reducing our cost base will enhance our competitive advantage.

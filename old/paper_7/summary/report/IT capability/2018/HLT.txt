Our premier brand portfolio includes technology and information technology services that facilitate our operations and support our management and franchise segments. The management and franchise segment generates revenue from fees for managing our owned and leased hotels, which includes the use of our reservation system, marketing, and information technology services. Our strategic objectives include the continued expansion of our global footprint and fee-based business, which relies on the effective deployment of technology resources to enhance operational efficiency and support business strategies. We evaluate the economic viability of new properties based on various factors, including the credit quality of third-party owners and the technological capabilities required for successful management. The management and franchise contracts we maintain with third-party owners and franchisees are crucial for generating management and franchise fee revenues, highlighting the importance of our IT capabilities in sustaining these relationships. Our ability to provide data and information to users with appropriate levels of accuracy, timeliness, reliability, security, and connectivity is essential for meeting changing business needs and directions. The integration of technology into our operations enhances our competitive advantage and supports our business transformation efforts. We capitalize costs associated with certain software development projects, indicating our commitment to investing in IT capabilities that align with our organizational goals. The success of our management and franchise business is dependent on our ability to leverage IT resources effectively, which in turn influences our market-based performance and operational flexibility. The revenues we derive from our operations are closely linked to consumer demand and global economic conditions, which are increasingly influenced by technological advancements and market dynamics. Our relationships with third-party owners and franchisees generate new opportunities for property development, further emphasizing the role of IT in resource mobilization and strategic resource allocation. The effectiveness of our IT governance and management practices is critical in navigating the challenges posed by external influences and ensuring that our technology infrastructure supports our overall business strategy. We recognize that the hospitality industry is subject to significant volatility due to economic downturns, which can impact our revenues and profitability. Therefore, our strategic management practices must include a focus on enhancing our IT capabilities to respond effectively to market changes and consumer demands. The operational efficiency achieved through our technology deployment not only supports our internal processes but also enhances our external relationships and customer value. Our investment in digital transformation initiatives reflects our commitment to evolving our IT capabilities to meet the demands of a rapidly changing business environment. The ability to manage information effectively and ensure its reliability is paramount in maintaining our competitive positioning and achieving performance excellence.

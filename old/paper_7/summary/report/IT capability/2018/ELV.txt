We are one of the largest health benefits companies in the United States, serving approximately 40 million medical members through our affiliated health plans. Our operations are managed through three reportable segments: commercial & specialty business, government business, and other. Our results of operations depend in large part on our ability to accurately predict and effectively manage healthcare costs through effective contracting with providers of care and our medical management and health and wellness programs. We strategically reduce our participation in the individual ACA-compliant market, focusing on regions with a path toward sustainability, including expected financial performance and regulatory environment. In October 2017, we established a new pharmacy benefits manager, IngenioRx, to improve our ability to integrate pharmacy benefits within our medical and specialty platform. We strive to price our healthcare benefit products consistent with anticipated underlying medical trends, frequently adjusting to respond to legislative and regulatory changes as well as pricing actions taken by competitors. Our medical cost trends are primarily driven by increases in service utilization and unit cost increases, which we work to mitigate through various medical management programs. The ACA has introduced new risks and regulatory challenges, requiring changes in how products are designed, underwritten, priced, distributed, and administered. We have established a growth strategy designed to enable us to take advantage of economies of scale and access to evolving technologies and products, which is essential for maintaining competitive advantage. Our financial condition and liquidity position are strong, with consolidated cash, cash equivalents, and investments in fixed maturity and equity securities. We manage our cash and investments to meet both short-term and long-term obligations while preserving our asset base. Our investment strategy is consistent with insurance statutes and regulatory requirements, focusing on maximizing returns while minimizing financial risk. We have a commercial paper program and a senior revolving credit facility to ensure liquidity. Our ability to borrow is subject to compliance with covenants, and we regularly review our capital use, including acquisitions and stock repurchases. Our regulated subsidiaries are subject to various government regulations that restrict the timing and amount of dividends that may be paid to parent companies. We maintain a strong focus on operational efficiency and strategic resource allocation to enhance our IT capabilities, which are critical for supporting business needs and driving performance improvements. The integration of technology into our operations is essential for optimizing processes, enhancing customer relationships, and achieving organizational goals. We continually evaluate our IT architecture and governance to ensure alignment with our strategic objectives and market demands.

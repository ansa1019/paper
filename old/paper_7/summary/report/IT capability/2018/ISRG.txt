The da Vinci surgical systems enable surgeons to extend the benefits of minimally invasive surgery (MIS) by using computational, robotic, and imaging technologies to overcome limitations of traditional open surgery. Our technology is designed to provide surgeons with a range of articulation of the surgical instruments used in the surgical field, facilitating operational flexibility and enhancing clinical outcomes. We focus on making our technology easy and safe to use, which is critical for supporting business needs and improving operational efficiency. Our products are designed to decrease variability in surgery by offering dependable, consistent functionality and user experiences for surgeons seeking better outcomes. We have commercialized several generations of da Vinci surgical systems, each representing advancements in technology capabilities that align with evolving market dynamics and competitive positioning. The success of these systems is dependent on positive experiences and improved clinical outcomes, which are essential for securing additional clinical clearances and expanding our market presence. Our business model generates revenue from placements of da Vinci surgical systems and recurring revenue from sales of instruments, accessories, and service, reflecting our strategic resource allocation and investment decisions in technology resources. The growth of instrument and accessory revenue has been driven by continued procedure adoption, which is influenced by the installed base of da Vinci surgical systems and the operational capabilities of healthcare providers. We have made substantial investments in research and development to support a broader set of product development initiatives, including advanced imaging and analytics, which are integral to enhancing our information management capability and overall firm performance. Our strategic management practices focus on expanding procedure adoption and acceptance of our products, which is critical for driving market-based performance and achieving competitive advantage. The adoption of robotic-assisted surgery using da Vinci systems has the potential to grow for procedures that offer greater patient value than non-da Vinci alternatives, supported by expanded global evidence validating the clinical and economic value of da Vinci procedures. We anticipate that our investments in digital transformation and technology deployment will continue to enhance our organizational capabilities and operational effectiveness, ultimately contributing to performance gains and value creation in the healthcare sector. The integration of our technology infrastructure with clinical workflows is essential for optimizing process performance and ensuring that our products meet the evolving needs of healthcare providers and patients alike.

The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the other sections of this annual report on Form 10-K, including the consolidated financial statements and related notes contained in Item 8. Altria Group, Inc.'s wholly-owned subsidiaries include PM USA, which is engaged predominantly in the manufacture and sale of cigarettes in the United States; Middleton, which is engaged in the manufacture and sale of machine-made large cigars and pipe tobacco; and UST, which is engaged in the manufacture and sale of smokeless tobacco products and wine. Altria Group, Inc.'s access to the operating cash flows of its wholly-owned subsidiaries consists of cash received from the payment of dividends and distributions, and the payment of interest on intercompany loans by its subsidiaries. Altria Group, Inc. also holds approximately 27% of the economic and voting interest of SABMiller, which Altria Group, Inc. accounts for under the equity method of accounting. The financial services and the innovative tobacco products businesses are included in an all other category due to the continued reduction of the lease portfolio of PMCC and the relative financial contribution of Altria Group, Inc.'s innovative tobacco products businesses to Altria Group, Inc.'s consolidated results. The increase of $470 million in operations was due primarily to higher income from the smokeable products and smokeless products segments and lower interest and other debt expense, net. In January 2016, Altria Group, Inc. forecasted that its 2016 full-year adjusted diluted EPS growth rate is expected to be in the range of 7% to 9% over 2015 full-year adjusted diluted EPS. This forecast does not include any impact from the anticipated AB InBev and SABMiller business combination, as the transaction remains subject to certain approvals and the closing date has not yet been determined. The factors described in Item 1A represent continuing risks to this forecast. The changes in Altria Group, Inc.'s net earnings and diluted earnings per share attributable to Altria Group, Inc. for the year ended December 31, 2015, from the year ended December 31, 2014, were due primarily to various adjustments, including asset impairment, exit, integration and acquisition-related costs, and tobacco and health litigation items.

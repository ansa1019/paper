In 2015, Norfolk Southern Corporation faced significant headwinds as operating revenues were negatively impacted by the steep decline in energy prices, which drove both reduced fuel surcharge revenue and volume decreases in coal and energy-related products. Despite these challenges, the company continued its focus on deploying resources to improve network velocity and service while streamlining corporate assets, indicating an ongoing commitment to operational efficiency and resource allocation. The restructuring of the Triple Crown Services subsidiary and the closure of the Roanoke, Virginia corporate office were part of this strategy, aimed at enhancing performance and reducing costs. The company expected to produce expense savings of $130 million in 2016 while increasing productivity and efficiency, demonstrating a proactive approach to managing operational flexibility in response to market dynamics. The anticipated modest growth in intermodal and automotive markets was expected to temper weakness in commodity-related markets, reflecting an adaptive enterprise strategy to navigate competitive pressures. The focus on improving rail service and generating higher returns on capital underscored the importance of leveraging IT capabilities to support business needs. The companyâ€™s investments in technology, including a budgeted $80 million for new or upgraded systems and computers, were aimed at enhancing operational capabilities and supporting strategic management practices. Furthermore, the implementation of positive train control (PTC) was expected to contribute to operational improvements and safety, with a budget of $250 million allocated for its continued implementation. The restructuring efforts and technology investments reflect a broader trend of integrating IT capabilities into business processes to enhance organizational effectiveness and responsiveness to market changes. The company also emphasized the need for strategic resource allocation and capability enhancement to maintain competitive advantage in a challenging environment. The ongoing evaluation of operational performance metrics and the integration of technology into business processes were critical for achieving desired performance outcomes. The focus on information management capability, ensuring data accuracy, reliability, and security, was essential for supporting decision-making processes and enhancing customer relationships. Overall, the strategic initiatives undertaken by Norfolk Southern Corporation highlight the evolving role of IT capabilities in coordinating assets and internal processes, thereby transforming the firm into a competitive force within the transportation industry.

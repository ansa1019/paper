Visa is a global payments technology company that connects consumers, businesses, financial institutions, and governments to fast, secure, and reliable electronic payments. We provide our financial institution clients with a global payments infrastructure and support services for the delivery of visa-branded payment products. Our business performance reflects the impacts of economic conditions and consumer spending, which influence our operational efficiency and market-based performance. We continue to explore opportunities to enhance our competitive position by expanding the scope of payment solutions we provide, which requires effective management capability and strategic resource allocation. Our financial results are driven by growth in processed transactions and nominal payments volume, which are critical components of our operational framework. We recognize the importance of investing in technology assets and infrastructure to support our digital solutions and core business initiatives. The increase in operating expenses is primarily due to higher personnel costs reflecting our strategy to invest for future growth, particularly in internal technology resources, and additional depreciation from ongoing investments in technology assets. Our operating revenues are generated from payments volume on visa-branded cards and payment products, as well as the number of transactions processed on our network, which underscores the significance of our IT capabilities in facilitating transaction and information processing among our clients globally. We maintain a focus on information management capability, ensuring the provision of data and information to users with appropriate levels of accuracy, timeliness, reliability, security, and access. The acquisition of Visa Europe represents a strategic move to enhance our operational capabilities and market presence, with the transaction contingent upon regulatory approvals. Our liquidity management policies aim to provide adequate liquidity to cover operating expenditures and ensure timely completion of payments settlement activities, which are essential for maintaining operational flexibility. We are committed to optimizing our income by investing excess cash in securities that meet our working capital and liquidity needs. The integration of technology resources is vital for our business transformation and competitive advantage, as we leverage IT capabilities to enhance customer relationships and streamline internal processes. Our focus on process optimization and technology deployment aligns with our organizational goals and enhances our overall performance. The ongoing evolution of our IT capabilities is critical in navigating market dynamics and meeting the changing business needs of our clients, thereby reinforcing our position as a leader in the electronic payments industry.

Autodesk's strategy is to lead the industries it serves to cloud-based technologies and business models, which entails both a technological shift and a business model shift. The company is undergoing a business model transition in which it will discontinue selling new perpetual licenses in favor of subscriptions and flexible license arrangements. This transition is expected to expand Autodesk's customer base by eliminating higher up-front licensing costs and providing more flexibility in how customers gain access to and pay for its products. The firm aims to capitalize on two of its strongest competitive advantages: the ability to bring advanced technology to mainstream markets and the breadth and depth of its product portfolio. The software architecture allows for extensibility and integration with other products, which is critical in helping customers address complex challenges such as globalization, urbanization, and sustainable design. Autodesk's products are designed to be easy to learn and use, providing customers with a low cost of deployment and a rapid return on investment. The company is committed to improving product functionality and expanding offerings through internal development and acquisitions, which often increase the speed at which it can deliver product functionality to customers. However, acquisitions entail cost and integration challenges that may negatively impact operating margins. The firm’s IT capabilities represent the application of physical or intangible IT resources such as technology, knowledge, practices, relationships, management skills, and business process understanding to further organizational goals. The increase in operating expenses during fiscal 2016 was driven by higher employee-related costs due to increased headcount and an increase in IT costs allocated to various functions, including marketing and sales, research and development, and general and administrative expenses. The company believes that its technological leadership and global brand recognition have positioned it well for long-term growth and industry leadership. Autodesk's move to the new model increases the number of potential markets by connecting all participants in the process of designing and making things, which enhances its capability to address the complex challenges faced by customers. The firm’s strategy also includes improving operational efficiency and leveraging IT resources to support business needs and enhance performance. The transition to a subscription model is expected to impact billings, revenue, gross margin, and cash flow from operations as more revenue is recognized ratably rather than upfront. The company anticipates that as it progresses through this transition, traditional metrics like billings and reported revenue will become less relevant, while annualized recurring revenue and subscription additions will better reflect business momentum. The firm is also focused on increasing global penetration, particularly in emerging economies, which represent significant opportunities for growth despite the challenges posed by economic volatility and local competition. Overall, Autodesk's IT capabilities and strategic resource allocation are central to its efforts in transforming the business and enhancing its competitive positioning in the market.

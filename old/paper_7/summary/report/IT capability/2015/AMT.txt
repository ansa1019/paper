During the fourth quarter of 2015, we reviewed and changed our reportable segments to better align with our operational capabilities and market dynamics. Our primary business involves the leasing of space on communications sites to various service providers, which underscores the importance of mobilizing and deploying IT-based resources in combination with other capabilities. We believe that our site leasing revenue is likely to increase due to the growing use of wireless services and our ability to meet the corresponding incremental demand for our wireless real estate. Our established tenant base provides us with new business opportunities, resulting in consistent and predictable organic revenue growth as wireless carriers seek to enhance their network coverage and capacity. The deployment of advanced wireless technology across existing networks will further enable fixed broadband substitution, compelling our tenants to deploy additional equipment. Our holistic master lease agreements with certain tenants facilitate strong strategic partnerships, significantly reducing collocation cycle times and enabling rapid and efficient equipment deployment. Our ability to lease additional space is influenced by the rate at which wireless carriers deploy capital to improve and expand their networks, which is affected by the growth of wireless services and the financial performance of our tenants. We continue to evaluate opportunities to acquire communications real estate portfolios to determine their alignment with our risk-adjusted return on investment objectives. The revenues generated by our property operations may be affected by cancellations of existing tenant leases, yet our tenant leases are predominantly multiyear contracts, which typically are non-cancellable. Our diversified communications site portfolio allows us to adapt to various market conditions, and we anticipate that our tenant lease rates will vary based on several factors, including the amount and type of tenant equipment on the tower and existing zoning regulations. The growth in operating profit across our segments is primarily attributable to increases in gross margin, which is influenced by our strategic resource allocation and operational efficiencies. Our financial flexibility and ability to grow our business are enhanced by our significant financing transactions, including the issuance of common and preferred stock to fund acquisitions. We utilize our cash flows to fund operations and investments, including tower maintenance and improvements, and we expect to continue deploying capital through our annual capital expenditure program. Our liquidity is dependent on our ability to generate cash flow from operating activities and maintain compliance with our debt covenants, which are critical to understanding our financial results and liquidity. The majority of our revenues are derived from a small number of tenants, and our ability to generate cash flow is contingent upon maintaining these relationships and ensuring the reliability of our information management capabilities. We actively monitor the creditworthiness of our tenants to mitigate risks associated with revenue concentration. The strategic alignment of our technology infrastructure with our business processes is essential for optimizing performance and enhancing our competitive positioning in the market.

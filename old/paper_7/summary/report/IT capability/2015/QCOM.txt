The transition of wireless networks and devices to 3G/4G continued around the world, with 3G/4G connections increasing to approximately 3.4 billion, representing approximately 47% of total cellular connections. The competitive environment in China has presented significant challenges, including a decline in share at a large customer and an increased shift in share among customers within the premium tier, which has negatively impacted sales of integrated Snapdragon processors. Qualcomm continues to invest significant resources toward advancements in 3G, 3G/4G multimode, and 4G LTE technologies, as well as in targeted opportunities that utilize existing technical and business expertise to deploy new business models and enter into new industry segments. The strategic realignment plan announced in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015 is designed to improve execution, enhance financial performance, and drive profitable growth, with core elements including right-sizing the cost structure and making disciplined investments in areas that build upon core technologies and capabilities. The QCT segment's results were negatively impacted by a shift in share among customers, which reduced sales of higher-margin products and skewed the product mix towards lower-margin modem chipsets. The QTL segment experienced revenue fluctuations due to units believed to be underreported by certain licensees and sales of unlicensed products in China. Qualcomm's strategic investments focus on opening new or expanding opportunities for technologies and supporting the design and introduction of new products and services for voice and data communications. The company is also investing in advancements in digital media, e-commerce, healthcare, and wearable devices, as well as in wireless charging and machine learning. The strategic investments aim to enhance the firm's capabilities and leverage technology resources to create long-term value. Qualcomm's operational flexibility is supported by a robust capital return program, which intends to return a minimum of 75% of free cash flow to stockholders through stock repurchases and dividends. The company is committed to enhancing its information management capability to provide data and information to users with appropriate levels of accuracy, timeliness, reliability, security, and confidentiality, thereby supporting business strategies and work processes. The firmâ€™s IT capabilities, which encompass the coordination of assets and internal processes, are critical in transforming Qualcomm into a competitive force in the market. The company continues to face challenges related to compliance and contractual obligations in China, which may impact future performance. The ongoing negotiations with licensees and unlicensed companies are expected to result in improved reporting and compliance, ultimately enhancing business performance and operational efficiency. The focus on innovation partnerships and strategic management practices is essential for aligning business strategies with market dynamics and consumer demands, ensuring that Qualcomm remains agile and responsive to changes in the competitive landscape.

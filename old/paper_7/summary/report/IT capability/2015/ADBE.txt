During fiscal 2015, we continued to execute our long-term plans for our strategic growth areas, digital media and digital marketing, while focusing on the transformation of our business model to a subscription-based offering. Our Adobe Creative Cloud, a subscription-based service, has enabled us to deliver value through more frequent product updates and enhanced connectivity across devices, thereby supporting our IT capabilities in managing customer relationships and operational efficiency. The integration of acquired companies, such as Fotolia and Neolane, has further enhanced our technology resources and capabilities in the digital marketing space, allowing us to leverage these assets for competitive advantage and innovation. Our strategy with Creative Cloud is designed to increase revenue with users and attract new customers, while also ensuring that existing customers remain current with the latest releases, thereby optimizing our business processes and enhancing our operational flexibility. The growth in annual recurring revenue (ARR) from Creative Cloud subscriptions reflects our effective deployment of IT resources to meet evolving business needs and market demands. Additionally, our Adobe Marketing Cloud solutions have shown strong demand, contributing to a 16% year-over-year revenue growth, which underscores the importance of IT capabilities in driving market-based performance. Our investments in research and development are critical for maintaining competitiveness in the marketplace and are directly related to the timely development of new and enhanced products. The operational efficiencies gained through our digital infrastructure and IT systems have allowed us to respond effectively to market dynamics and consumer demands. The increase in deferred revenue indicates a successful transition to a subscription model, which is supported by our IT governance and management capabilities. Our ability to provide data and information with appropriate levels of accuracy, timeliness, and reliability is essential for supporting strategic decisions and enhancing organizational effectiveness. The integration of digital technologies into our business processes has facilitated improved information management and operational efficiency, which are vital for sustaining firm performance and achieving long-term growth. The strategic alignment of our technology portfolio with business objectives has enabled us to optimize resource allocation and enhance our capability to respond to external influences and market restructuring. Overall, our focus on IT capabilities and digital transformation has positioned us to capitalize on emerging opportunities and maintain a competitive edge in the evolving digital landscape.

In operating our business, we seek to manage our portfolio to balance growth, profit margin and cash flow, invest in our brands, innovation and growth initiatives, deliver sustainable cost reductions, and provide disciplined capital management to improve return on invested capital and return cash to shareholders. We executed our growth strategies in developing and emerging markets with a focus on China, Eastern Europe and Latin America, benefiting from innovation, expansion, category development and higher net selling prices. To help fund our investments in innovations and growth initiatives and to improve our profit margins, we are generating cost savings through several initiatives, including leveraging our global procurement organization and deploying lean principles. The restructuring initiated in October 2014 is intended to improve organization efficiency and offset the impact of stranded overhead costs resulting from the spin-off of our health care business, which is expected to enhance our flexibility to invest in targeted growth initiatives, brand building and other capabilities critical to delivering future growth. The restructuring is expected to impact all of our business segments and our organizations in all major geographies. Our focus on generating cash flow and allocating capital to shareholders reflects our commitment to operational flexibility and strategic resource allocation. We anticipate capital spending to be in a range of $950 to $1,050 million, which supports our operational efficiency and investment in strategic resources. Our business outlook for 2016 includes expectations for growth in sales volumes, net selling prices and product mix, as well as anticipated cost savings from our force program and the 2014 organization restructuring. We believe that our ability to generate cash from operations and our capacity to issue short-term and long-term debt are adequate to fund working capital, capital spending, payment of dividends, pension plan contributions and other needs for the foreseeable future. The anticipated costs, scope, timing and financial effects of the 2014 organization restructuring, along with the expected cost savings from the company's force program, reflect our strategic management practices aimed at enhancing organizational capabilities and performance outcomes. The changes in our operational structure and strategic initiatives are designed to align our business strategy with market dynamics and consumer demands, thereby reinforcing our competitive positioning and market agility. The integration of our technology capabilities with our operational processes is critical in transforming our firm into a competitive force, leveraging IT resources and management skills to support business needs and enhance overall organizational performance.

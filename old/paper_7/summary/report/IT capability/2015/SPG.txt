The company generates the majority of its revenues from leases with retail tenants, which include base minimum rents, overage and percentage rents based on tenants' sales volume, and recoverable expenditures. We seek growth in earnings, funds from operations, or FFO, and cash flows by enhancing the profitability and operation of our properties and investments. This growth is accomplished through attracting and retaining high-quality tenants, utilizing economies of scale to reduce operating expenses, and selectively acquiring or increasing interests in high-quality real estate assets or portfolios. The company also generates supplemental revenue by establishing malls as leading market resource providers for retailers and other businesses, including payment systems and marketing alliances. We focus on high-quality real estate across the retail real estate spectrum and expand or redevelop properties to enhance profitability and market share when the investment meets our risk-reward criteria. Our international strategy includes partnering with established real estate companies and financing international investments with local currency to minimize foreign exchange risk. We employ a three-fold capital strategy to support growth, which includes providing necessary capital, maintaining flexibility to access capital in various forms, and managing our financial structure to preserve investment-grade credit ratings. Our financing strategy relies primarily on long-term fixed-rate debt, with floating rate debt comprising only a small percentage of total consolidated debt. We derive liquidity from positive net cash flow from operations and distributions of capital from unconsolidated entities. The company routinely reviews and evaluates acquisition opportunities based on their ability to enhance our portfolio. We expect to generate positive cash flow from operations and consider these projected cash flows in our sources and uses of cash. Our business model requires us to regularly access the debt markets to raise funds for acquisition, development, and redevelopment activity. We believe we have sufficient cash on hand and availability under credit facilities to address our debt maturities and capital needs. The company also engages in joint ventures to enhance its capabilities and market positioning, contributing capital for improvements and sharing in the operational management of these ventures. Our focus on enhancing profitability through strategic resource allocation, operational efficiency, and effective management of our technology infrastructure supports our overall business strategy. The company recognizes the importance of mobilizing and deploying IT-based resources in combination with leveraging the value of other resources and capabilities to transform into a competitive force. We continuously evaluate our investments in technology to ensure alignment with our business needs and market dynamics, thereby enhancing our operational flexibility and responsiveness to consumer demands.

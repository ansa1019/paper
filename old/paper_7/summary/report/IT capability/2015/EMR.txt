The information from the 2015 annual report set forth in exhibit 13 hereto under "results of operations," "business segments," "financial position, capital resources and liquidity," "critical accounting policies," "other items" and "safe harbor statement" is hereby incorporated by reference. Management believes that the following non-GAAP financial measures provide investors and analysts useful insight into the company's financial position and operating performance. Management closely monitors operating profit and operating profit margin of each business to evaluate past performance and actions required to improve profitability. Free cash flow is an indicator of the company's cash generating capabilities after considering investments in capital assets which are necessary to maintain and enhance existing operations. Management believes that free cash flow is useful to both management and investors as a measure of the company's ability to generate cash. The determination of operating cash flow adds back noncash depreciation expense to earnings and thereby does not reflect a charge for necessary capital expenditures. Management's discussion emphasizes the importance of evaluating performance and operational efficiency, which are critical for aligning business strategies with market dynamics and competitive positioning. The focus on operational performance and ongoing profitability reflects the need for effective resource allocation and management capability to respond to changing business needs and directions. The strategic resource allocation decisions made by management are essential for enhancing the firm's capabilities and achieving competitive advantage. The emphasis on non-GAAP financial measures indicates a broader understanding of performance metrics that extend beyond traditional accounting measures, highlighting the significance of operational flexibility and the ability to adapt to market conditions. This approach underscores the importance of leveraging IT capabilities and resources to support business processes and enhance organizational effectiveness. The integration of technology resources and management skills is crucial for optimizing processes and achieving desired performance outcomes. The management's perspective on free cash flow and operational metrics illustrates a commitment to improving business value through effective information management and strategic decision-making. The focus on underlying sales and operating profit margins as indicators of performance aligns with the need for continuous evaluation of business processes and operational strategies to maintain market agility and responsiveness. Overall, the management's discussion reflects a comprehensive view of the firm's operational landscape, emphasizing the interplay between financial performance, IT capabilities, and strategic resource management in driving business transformation and achieving long-term success.

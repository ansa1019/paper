Our primary ongoing cash requirements are for merchandise inventory purchases, payroll, rent, taxes, and capital expenditures in connection with new and existing stores, and investments in distribution centers, information systems, and buying and corporate offices. We continually evaluate opportunistic real estate acquisitions and opportunities for potential new store locations. We also evaluate our current store locations and determine store closures based on similar criteria. Our capital expenditures include costs to build or expand distribution centers, open new stores and improve existing stores, and for various other expenditures related to our information technology systems, buying, and corporate offices. We are forecasting approximately $425 million in capital expenditures for fiscal year 2016 to fund costs for fixtures and leasehold improvements to open new Ross and dd's discounts stores, the upgrade or relocation of existing stores, investments in information technology systems, and for various other expenditures related to our stores, distribution centers, buying and corporate offices. We expect to primarily fund capital expenditures with available cash and cash flows from operations. Our capital expenditures over the last three years include significant investments in information technology systems, which are essential for enhancing operational efficiency and supporting our business strategies. The ability to leverage technology resources is critical for maintaining our competitive advantage in the off-price retail sector. Our strategies and store expansion program contributed to sales gains in fiscal 2015, 2014, and 2013, and we intend to strengthen our organization and more fully develop our systems to improve regional and local merchandise offerings. We regularly review the age and condition of our merchandise and are able to maintain current merchandise inventory in our stores through replenishment processes and liquidation of slower-moving merchandise through clearance markdowns. Changes in packaway inventory levels impact our operating cash flow, which is driven by net earnings excluding non-cash expenses for depreciation and amortization. Our effective management of information systems is crucial for optimizing our operational processes and enhancing our decision-making capabilities. The integration of technology into our business processes facilitates improved information management and supports our strategic resource allocation decisions. We recognize that our IT capabilities, including the ability to provide data and information to users with appropriate levels of accuracy, timeliness, reliability, security, and confidentiality, are vital for responding to changing business needs and directions. Our investments in IT infrastructure and systems are designed to enhance our operational flexibility and improve our market responsiveness. The coordination of our IT resources with other organizational capabilities is essential for achieving our business objectives and maintaining a competitive position in the market. We anticipate that our effective use of information technology will continue to drive performance improvements and contribute to our overall business success.

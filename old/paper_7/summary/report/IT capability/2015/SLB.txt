Schlumberger's financial performance in 2015 was significantly impacted by the large decrease in land activity, particularly in the U.S., where the year-end land rig count was less than 700 rigs. This created massive overcapacity in the land market that impacted pricing levels across a broad range of oilfield services. The company continues to focus on what it can control, taking actions to streamline and resize its organization as it navigates the current market downturn. Despite current conditions, Schlumberger remains constructive in its view of the market outlook in the medium term, believing that the underlying balance of supply and demand will tighten, driven by growth in demand and weakening supply as the massive exploration and production investment cuts take effect. The decline in drilling activity, coupled with persistent pricing pressure and operational disruptions from exhausted customer budgets, has lowered revenues across all geographies, particularly in the Europe, CIS & Africa area. The company's pretax operating margin decreased as a result of pricing pressure that impacted all services and products. Schlumberger's revenue was also affected by customer budget cuts, project cancellations, and delayed start-ups of new projects, which contributed to the sequential reduction in pretax operating margin. The company’s investments in technology and operational efficiency improvements are critical for maintaining competitive advantage and addressing the challenges posed by market dynamics. Schlumberger's focus on integrating technology resources and enhancing its IT capabilities is essential for supporting business strategies and operational flexibility. The firm’s ability to mobilize and deploy IT-based resources in combination with leveraging the value of other resources and capabilities underscores the importance of IT capability in transforming the firm into a competitive force. The strategic management practices employed by Schlumberger aim to align its technology portfolio with business needs, thereby enhancing organizational effectiveness and performance. The company continues to adapt its operational strategies in response to external influences and market restructuring, emphasizing the need for agility and responsiveness in its operations. Schlumberger's commitment to innovation and process optimization is evident as it seeks to enhance its information management capabilities, ensuring that data and information are provided to users with appropriate levels of accuracy, timeliness, and reliability. The integration of digital technologies and the development of IT infrastructure are pivotal in supporting the firm’s long-term objectives and enhancing its market positioning. As Schlumberger navigates the complexities of the oil and gas industry, its focus on IT capability development and resource allocation will be crucial in driving performance improvements and achieving strategic goals.

The company's investment portfolio is managed using disciplined asset-liability management principles, focusing on cash flow and duration to support current and future liabilities, while optimizing risk-adjusted net investment income and total return. The use of derivatives is integral to managing various risks, including interest rate, foreign currency exchange rate, credit, and equity market risks. MetLife's operational flexibility is supported by a diverse mix of funding sources, including commercial paper and credit facilities, which enhance liquidity and capital management. The company actively manages its capital position to maintain financial strength and credit ratings, which are critical for accessing liquidity and funding. The regulatory environment impacts the company's ability to pay dividends and repurchase stock, as insurance regulators impose restrictions based on surplus levels and statutory net gain from operations.

The company also conducts annual reviews of its actuarial assumptions, which can lead to adjustments in reserves and future policy benefits. The sustained low interest rate environment poses challenges to investment yields, necessitating proactive management of interest crediting rates and product design features.

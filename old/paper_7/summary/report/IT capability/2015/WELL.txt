Our capital programs, combined with comprehensive planning, development, and property management services, create a single-source solution for acquiring, planning, developing, managing, repositioning, and monetizing real estate assets. We monitor our investments through a proactive and comprehensive asset management process, which includes the review of monthly financial statements, operating data, and property inspections. Our personnel utilize a proprietary database to collect and analyze property-specific data, conducting extensive research to ascertain industry trends and evaluate the operating environment in each property's market. This enables us to determine likely trends in operating performance and mitigate risks associated with unacceptable trends. Our investment strategy is supported by the capital markets, allowing us to raise significant funds through the issuance of common stock and unsecured debt, which supports new investments. We believe that our investments generate cash from net operating income and principal payments on loans receivable, and we continuously evaluate opportunities to finance future investments. Our ability to achieve financial objectives depends on effectively executing strategic plans and responding to emerging economic and company-specific trends. We utilize various key performance indicators to evaluate aspects of our business, including operating performance, credit strength, and concentration risk. The leverage and coverage ratios indicate our ability to service interest and fixed charges, which are crucial for maintaining compliance with our debt covenants. Our corporate governance emphasizes ethical business practices and maintaining investor confidence. We assess our liquidity and capital resources, which include cash receipts from rent and interest, resident fees, and services, as well as borrowings under our unsecured credit facility. Our investments in technology and data management capabilities enhance our operational efficiency and support our strategic resource allocation.

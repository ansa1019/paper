Grainger plans to continue to execute changes in the U.S. and Canada in 2016 while continuing to make investments in its supply chain, ecommerce capabilities, information systems, sales force productivity tools, and inventory management services. These investments will support the company's revenue growth objectives of continuing to grow its share of business with large, complex customers, creating a unique value proposition to further penetrate the medium customer segment, and further leveraging its ecommerce capabilities to serve smaller customers. In 2015, Grainger's ecommerce sales were $4,133 million, an increase of 16% over the prior year, representing 41% of total sales, primarily driven by an increase in sales via EDI and electronic purchasing platforms in the United States. Operating expenses included an incremental $132 million in growth-related spending on ecommerce, new sales representatives, supply chain, and inventory management solutions. Grainger's investments in technology infrastructure, including the completion of the common ERP platform for North America, are aimed at enhancing operational efficiency and supporting sales initiatives. The company expects to fund 2016 capital spending primarily from operating cash, with projected spending including continued investments in supply chain, ecommerce, and inventory management solutions. Grainger's strong working capital position and cash flows from operations are anticipated to continue supporting growth initiatives, capital expenditures, acquisitions, and share repurchases. The company maintains a debt ratio and liquidity position that provides flexibility in funding working capital needs and long-term cash requirements. Grainger's operating results have included the results of each business acquired since the respective acquisition dates, and its strategic resource allocation focuses on leveraging technology capabilities to enhance business performance. The company recognizes the importance of mobilizing and deploying IT-based resources in combination with leveraging the value of other resources and capabilities to transform into a competitive force. Grainger's operational flexibility is supported by its investments in technology management and process optimization, which are essential for maintaining market responsiveness and achieving performance gains. The firm’s IT capabilities represent the application of physical or intangible IT resources such as technology, knowledge, practices, relationships, management skills, and business process understanding to further organizational goals. Grainger's strategic management practices emphasize the need for effective information management capability, which includes providing data and information to users with appropriate levels of accuracy, timeliness, reliability, security, confidentiality, connectivity, and access. The company’s focus on enhancing its IT architecture and governance is critical for supporting its business innovation and transformation efforts, ensuring that it can adapt to changing market dynamics and consumer demands. Grainger's commitment to process automation and technology integration is aimed at improving operational efficiency and enhancing customer relationships, thereby contributing to overall organizational effectiveness and performance outcomes.

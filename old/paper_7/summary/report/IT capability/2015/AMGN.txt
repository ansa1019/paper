Amgen's transformation and process improvement efforts across the company have enabled the reallocation of resources to fund many of its innovative pipeline and growth opportunities to deliver value to patients and shareholders. The company is committed to unlocking the potential of biology for patients suffering from serious illnesses by discovering, developing, manufacturing, and delivering innovative human therapeutics. This approach begins by using tools like advanced human genetics to unravel the complexities of disease and understand the fundamentals of human biology. Amgen focuses on areas of high unmet medical need and leverages its biologics manufacturing expertise to strive for solutions that improve health outcomes and dramatically improve people's lives. The company continues to innovate with patient- and provider-friendly delivery systems to differentiate its products. The neulasta® onprotm kit was approved by the FDA and now represents approximately one fourth of Amgen's U.S. neulasta® business. Amgen's progress can also be seen in six innovative new launches, including expanding indications for its products. The company has advanced its biosimilar program and continues to execute transformation and process improvement efforts, which include a more focused operating model. These efforts are aimed at enabling Amgen to invest in continuing innovation, expand into new countries, and launch new products while improving its cost structure. The restructuring plan is delivering cost savings and funding investments, allowing the company to reallocate resources effectively. Amgen's long-term success depends significantly on its ability to continue to discover, develop, and commercialize innovative products and acquire or collaborate on therapies currently in development by other companies. The company devotes considerable resources to research and development activities, which are essential for the continued strength of its business. The discovery and development of safe and effective new products, as well as the development of additional indications for existing products, are necessary for maintaining revenue and earnings growth. Amgen's financial performance was strong, with total revenues and product sales increasing, driven by strong performance across the portfolio. The company also faced challenges, including increasing competitive pressure from product launches and pricing pressures due to global economic conditions. Amgen's ability to respond to market dynamics and competitive actions is crucial for maintaining its market positioning and ensuring operational efficiency. The company continues to focus on collaborating with innovators and value-creating business development activities to expand its approach to deliver significant impact for patients. The ongoing transformation efforts are designed to enhance operational flexibility and support strategic resource allocation, which are vital for achieving organizational goals and improving overall performance.

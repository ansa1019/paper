MSCI significantly invested in and expanded its operating functions and infrastructure, including additional product management, sales and client support staff and facilities, as well as research and data operations and technology functions. This investment aimed to maximize medium-term revenue and profit growth while ensuring MSCI remains a leading provider of investment decision support tools. The company’s growth strategy includes developing new and enhancing existing product offerings, which involves combining existing product features or data derived from its products to create new products. The increase in revenues from recurring subscriptions was primarily driven by growth from index products and higher analytics products' revenues. The company’s operating expenses included costs related to the production and servicing of its products, which primarily encompassed information technology costs, including data center, platform, and infrastructure costs. Research and development expenses increased due to the costs associated with developing new or enhancing existing products and technology platforms for service delivery. The company’s adjusted EBITDA margin improved, reflecting higher growth in revenues outpacing the growth in expenses, attributable in part to the benefits of incremental investments made in prior periods. The rate of growth of investments and expenses had, in recent years, exceeded that of revenues, which slowed the growth of earnings.

In 2015, we experienced significant growth in our digital channel sales, which increased by more than 30 percent, contributing 0.8 percentage points to our comparable sales growth. Our segment operations are designed to enable guests to purchase products seamlessly in stores or through our digital sales channels, reflecting our commitment to enhancing IT capabilities in support of business needs. We have made investments in technology to support our omnichannel efforts and security enhancements, which are critical for maintaining operational efficiency and competitive advantage. Our capital expenditures for information technology, distribution, and other initiatives totaled $1,289 million in 2015, reflecting our focus on improving technology functionalities and infrastructure capability. We expect these investments to drive growth, improve in-stocks, and enhance customer experiences, aligning with our strategic resource allocation. The integration of technology into our business processes is essential for optimizing operational flexibility and achieving performance gains. Our management believes that adjusted earnings per share is meaningful for providing period-to-period comparisons of our operating results, which underscores the importance of effective information management capability. The reduction in selling, general, and administrative expenses in 2015 was primarily due to cost-saving initiatives and reduced marketing expenses, partially offset by investments in technology and other initiatives. We continue to seek efficiency savings to reinvest in our business, emphasizing the role of IT governance in resource mobilization and capability leverage. The favorable category sales mix and lower promotional activity were significant factors in our gross margin rate improvement, which was influenced by our digital channel's growth. Our strategic management practices include evaluating the effectiveness of our capital allocation over time, as evidenced by our return on invested capital, which increased to 16.0 percent. The sale of our pharmacy and clinic businesses to CVS for $1.9 billion allowed us to recognize a pretax gain of $620 million and provided cash flow that we utilized for share repurchases and investments in technology. Our ability to access capital markets and manage our net exposure to floating interest rate volatility is critical for maintaining liquidity and supporting our IT investments. We are committed to continuing our investments in technology to enhance our operational capabilities and ensure that we remain responsive to market dynamics and consumer demands. The strategic alignment of our technology portfolio with our business strategy is essential for driving innovation and maintaining competitive positioning in the retail sector. Our focus on digital transformation and IT deployment is expected to yield significant benefits in terms of market agility and organizational effectiveness, ultimately contributing to our overall business performance.

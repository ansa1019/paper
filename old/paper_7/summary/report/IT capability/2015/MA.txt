Mastercard's business model involves four participants in addition to the company: cardholders, merchants, issuers, and acquirers. The company generates revenue based on transactional information accumulated by its systems or reported by customers, which reflects the coordination of a firm’s assets and internal processes. The competitive and evolving nature of the global payments industry provides both challenges and opportunities for continued growth. The company monitors political and economic conditions to identify opportunities for growth and evaluate the evolution of the global payments industry. The increase in adjusted net income was driven by net revenue growth, primarily from increases across revenue categories and the impact from acquisitions, which contributed to enhancing critical capabilities, including in the area of data analytics. Mastercard's management uses non-GAAP financial measures to evaluate ongoing operations in relation to historical results and for internal planning and forecasting purposes. The company’s general and administrative expenses increased due to higher data processing costs, which support its global payments network infrastructure and the operation and maintenance of computer systems. The company has not experienced material impacts from information security breaches, although it acknowledges the increasing risks associated with cyber-attacks. The effective tax rate for 2015 was lower than in previous years due to settlements with tax authorities, which reflects the company's strategic management practices in navigating regulatory contexts. The company’s liquidity and access to capital are sufficient to satisfy future operating cash needs, capital asset purchases, and potential obligations. The company’s revenue is significantly impacted by domestic or cross-border transactions and the nature of volumes, types of transactions, and types of products and services offered. The company’s operational flexibility is enhanced through its technology infrastructure, which supports the processing of transactions and the provision of payment-related products and services. The company’s investments in strategic initiatives and acquisitions are aimed at enhancing its capabilities and operational efficiency. The company’s ability to provide data and information to users with appropriate levels of accuracy, timeliness, reliability, and security is critical to its operational success. The company’s financial results may be negatively impacted by actions taken by financial institutions or governmental bodies, highlighting the importance of effective IT governance and risk management. The company’s strategic resource allocation and investment decisions are influenced by market dynamics and competitive actions, which are essential for maintaining a competitive advantage in the payments industry. The company’s focus on innovation partnerships and technology deployment is integral to its business transformation and performance improvement efforts.

Our software integrity segment delivers products and services that enable software developers to test their code for known security vulnerabilities and quality defects, which is essential for managing software risks across the application lifecycle. The tools and services we provide are integral to our customers' development processes, helping them reduce design and manufacturing costs while addressing increasingly complex chip designs. Our growth strategy is based on maintaining leadership in electronic design automation (EDA) products, expanding our intellectual property (IP) offerings, and driving growth in the software security and quality market, which reflects our commitment to enhancing IT capabilities that support business needs. The revenue we recognize is influenced by customer spending decisions, which may be affected by their business outlook and willingness to invest in new technologies. Our solutions help our customers navigate market dynamics and competitive pressures, enabling them to make actionable investments in technology resources that align with their strategic goals. The ongoing macroeconomic environment, including inflation and supply chain disruptions, has led some customers to postpone decision-making and spending, which may impact our revenue growth. However, we have consistently grown our revenue due to solid execution, leading technologies, and strong customer relationships. Our EDA and IP customers are primarily semiconductor and electronics systems companies, and our offerings are designed to enhance operational efficiency and support their innovation efforts. The integration of our software integrity products into the software development lifecycle allows our customers to build security into their processes, reflecting our focus on IT governance and capability enhancement. Our business model, which includes time-based and upfront products, provides stability and flexibility in response to changing market conditions. We recognize that our IT capabilities, encompassing technology resources and management skills, are crucial for transforming our firm into a competitive force. The strategic allocation of resources and investment in technology infrastructure are key components of our operational strategy, enabling us to respond effectively to market demands and enhance our organizational capabilities. Our ability to mobilize and deploy IT-based resources in conjunction with other strategic resources is essential for achieving business value and maintaining our competitive positioning in the industry. As we continue to monitor regulatory changes and macroeconomic factors, we remain committed to leveraging our IT capabilities to drive performance gains and support our customers' evolving needs.

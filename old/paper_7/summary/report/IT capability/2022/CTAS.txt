Cintas helps more than one million businesses of all types and sizes get ready to open their doors with confidence every day by providing a wide range of products and services that enhance customers' image and help keep their facilities and employees clean, safe, and looking their best. This strategy is to achieve revenue growth for all products and services by increasing penetration at existing customers and broadening the customer base to include market segments not historically served. The combination of the distribution system and strong customer relationships provides a platform from which to launch additional products and services. Cintas evaluates operating segment performance based on revenue and income before income taxes, regularly reviewing its operating segments for reporting purposes based on information its chief operating decision maker regularly reviews for purposes of allocating resources and assessing performance. The ongoing rollout of COVID-19 vaccines and gradual lifting of restrictions had a positive impact on the business during fiscal 2022, although uncertainty remains about the pace of economic recovery and its impact on future consolidated financial results. Revenue from the uniform rental and facility services reportable operating segment increased due to organic growth resulting from new business and penetration of additional products and services into existing customers. The increase in capital expenditures was due to investments in operating segments to support continued market penetration and revenue growth. Cintas' effective tax rate on continuing operations was impacted by certain discrete items, primarily the tax accounting impact for stock-based compensation. The company has access to $2.0 billion of debt capacity from its amended and restated revolving credit facility, which provides sufficient liquidity to operate in the current business environment. The ability to continue to access the commercial paper and long-term debt markets on favorable terms will depend on ratings assigned by credit rating agencies. Cintas has historically provided a significant source of liquidity through cash flows from operating activities, which are expected to remain sufficient to fund operations and expansion activities. The company regularly reviews its cash flows and maintains compliance with debt covenants, which limit its ability to incur certain liens and engage in sale-leaseback transactions. Future contributions to defined contribution plans are expected to be significant, and management has mitigated inflationary pressures through pricing and efficiency initiatives. Cintas is subject to legal proceedings arising from the ordinary course of business, but management believes that any aggregate liability will not have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial position. The preparation of consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that could materially impact reported amounts, including revenue recognition and the valuation of uniforms and rental items in service. Cintas has identified four reporting units for purposes of evaluating goodwill impairment and has not recognized any impairment for the fiscal years presented. The company continues to perform impairment tests annually and when indicators of impairment exist, ensuring that its financial reporting remains accurate and reliable.

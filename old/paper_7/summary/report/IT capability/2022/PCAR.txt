The company has been affected by an industry-wide undersupply of component parts, which may continue to impact deliveries, indicating a need for effective resource management and operational efficiency.

The company’s strategic management practices include a focus on information management capability to provide data and information to users with appropriate levels of accuracy, timeliness, reliability, security, confidentiality, connectivity, and access. The financial services segment’s revenues decreased primarily due to lower unit volume of used truck sales, reflecting the need for effective decision-making and market responsiveness. The company’s investments in technology infrastructure and digital transformation are aimed at enhancing operational efficiency and supporting business innovation.

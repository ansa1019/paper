As part of our name change to Elevance Health, we announced that over the next several years we will organize our brand portfolio into core go-to-market brands, which reflects our evolving business strategy and operational capabilities. We are evaluating and making changes to how we manage our business, aligning strategies and allocating resources effectively. Our growth strategy is designed to enable us to take advantage of additional economies of scale and provide access to new and evolving technologies and products. We believe geographic and product diversity reduces our exposure to local or regional regulatory, economic, and competitive pressures, providing increased opportunities for growth. Our subsidiary CarelonRx is expected to continue to improve our ability to integrate pharmacy benefits within our medical and specialty platform, enhancing our operational efficiency and customer value. We are committed to expanding through a combination of organic growth, strategic acquisitions, and efficient use of capital in both existing and new markets. The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted our membership, benefit expense, and member behavior, necessitating a close monitoring of market dynamics and regulatory changes to manage our response effectively. We strive to price our health benefit products consistent with anticipated underlying medical cost trends, which are influenced by various external factors, including regulatory mandates and competitive actions. Our results of operations depend significantly on our ability to accurately predict and effectively manage healthcare costs through effective contracting with providers, product pricing, medical management, and innovative product design. We utilize our technology resources to enhance our operational flexibility and decision-making speed, ensuring we meet the evolving needs of our members. Our comprehensive pharmacy benefits management services include features such as formulary management and member services, which are crucial for maintaining competitive advantage in the marketplace. We continue to monitor the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on our pricing and operational strategies, adjusting our approach as necessary to ensure sustainability and resilience in our business model. Our commitment to technology deployment and process optimization is evident in our enterprise-wide initiatives aimed at becoming a more agile organization, which includes process automation and the integration of digital technologies into our operations. We recognize the importance of mobilizing and deploying IT-based resources in combination with leveraging the value of other resources and capabilities to transform our firm into a competitive force in the healthcare industry. Our IT capabilities are essential in supporting our business strategies and enhancing our work processes, ultimately driving performance gains and improving organizational effectiveness. We believe that our strategic resource allocation and investment decisions will facilitate our ongoing business transformation and enhance our capability to respond to market changes and consumer demands effectively.

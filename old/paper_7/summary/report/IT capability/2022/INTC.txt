Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of consolidated financial statements for external purposes. The design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Management assessed our internal control over financial reporting based on criteria established in internal control-integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission. Management's assessment included evaluation of elements such as the design and operating effectiveness of key financial reporting controls, process documentation, accounting policies, and our overall control environment. Based on this assessment, management has concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of consolidated financial statements for external reporting purposes. Our management, including the principal executive officer and principal financial officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well-designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the control system's objectives will be met. The evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures is based on management's evaluation, and our principal executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms. Changes in internal control over financial reporting indicate that there were no changes that occurred during the quarter ended December 31, 2022, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. The effectiveness of the company's internal control over financial reporting was independently assessed by our independent registered public accounting firm. The assessment included the evaluation of the design and operating effectiveness of key financial reporting controls and the overall control environment. The results of management's assessment were reviewed with the audit committee of our board of directors. The disclosures regarding our internal control over financial reporting are intended to provide stakeholders with a clear understanding of our governance and operational capabilities, particularly in the context of evolving market dynamics and the increasing importance of IT capabilities in supporting business strategies and enhancing operational efficiency. The integration of IT resources into our management practices is critical for maintaining competitive advantage and ensuring that our organizational goals are met in a timely and effective manner. The mobilization and deployment of IT-based resources, in conjunction with other strategic resources, are essential for leveraging business value and enhancing overall firm performance.

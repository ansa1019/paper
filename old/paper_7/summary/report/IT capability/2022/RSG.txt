In 2022 and 2021, we incurred restructuring charges primarily related to the redesign of our general ledger, budgeting, and procurement enterprise resource planning systems. These systems were placed into production in 2022, and we do not expect to incur future costs related to their implementation. In 2023, we expect to incur additional restructuring charges primarily related to the implementation of replacement billing and collection software systems. Our acquisition growth strategy focuses primarily on acquiring privately held recycling and solid waste companies and environmental solutions businesses that complement our existing business platform. We continue to invest in value-enhancing acquisitions in existing markets. We expect to invest at least $500 million in acquisitions in 2023. Our operational activities are supported by technology, which is essential for enhancing productivity and increasing customer retention. We financed the acquisition of US Ecology using the proceeds from a new $1.0 billion unsecured term loan credit agreement and borrowings under our existing $3.0 billion unsecured revolving credit facility. The integration of the US Ecology business includes costs related to the integration of certain software systems as well as rebranding the business. We expect to be substantially complete with our integration activities by the end of 2023. Our information technology capabilities have been evolving to encompass the coordination of our assets and internal processes. The effective support of business needs through IT capabilities has become a key factor in transforming our firm into a competitive force. We utilize technology resources to enhance our operational efficiency and improve our business processes. Our management information systems play a crucial role in supporting our organizational capabilities and strategic decisions. The integration of technology into our operations facilitates improved customer relationships and enhances our ability to respond to market dynamics. We believe that the presentation of adjusted diluted earnings per share provides an understanding of operational activities before the financial effect of certain items, which is critical for evaluating our performance. We have incurred comparable charges and costs in prior periods, and similar types of adjustments can reasonably be expected to be recorded in future periods. Our strategic resource allocation is influenced by our commitment to enhancing our technology infrastructure, which supports our operational flexibility and market agility. The successful deployment of technology is integral to our business innovation and transformation efforts, which are essential for achieving our organizational goals and enhancing firm performance. We are committed to leveraging our IT capabilities to optimize our processes and improve our overall business value. The ongoing evolution of our IT architecture is aligned with our strategic management practices and is designed to enhance our operational effectiveness and responsiveness to external influences. Our focus on digital transformation is aimed at creating actionable investments that drive performance gains and competitive advantage in the marketplace.

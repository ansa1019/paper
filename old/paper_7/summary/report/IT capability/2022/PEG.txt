PSEG's business plan focuses on achieving growth by allocating capital primarily toward regulated investments in an effort to continue to improve the sustainability and predictability of our business. We are focused on investing to modernize our energy infrastructure, improve reliability and resilience, increase energy efficiency, and deliver cleaner energy to meet customer expectations and be well aligned with public policy objectives. Our investments have simplified our business mix to reflect a higher percentage of earnings contribution by PSE&G. We are required to file a distribution base rate case to recover capital expenditures associated with our programs, including advanced metering infrastructure and electric vehicle programs. PSEG Power seeks to produce low-cost electricity by efficiently operating our nuclear generation assets and mitigating volatility through contracting for a significant portion of their output. Our hedging practices help to mitigate a significant amount of the earnings volatility of the merchant nuclear power business. The increasing frequency, sophistication, and magnitude of cybersecurity attacks against us and our respective vendors and business partners who may have our sensitive information and/or access to our environment pose challenges to our operational efficiency and information security. We continue to evaluate and adapt our capital investment program to improve the reliability and resiliency of our system in an environment of increasing frequency and severity of weather events. Our climate strategy includes a commitment to net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2030, which involves significant investments in clean energy technologies and infrastructure. We are actively engaged in regulatory proceedings that could have a material impact on our business, results of operations, and cash flows. Our future success will depend on our ability to maintain strong operational and financial performance, capitalize on regulatory and legislative developments, and respond to the challenges posed by the current inflationary environment and associated volatility in financial markets. We continually assess a broad range of strategic options to maximize long-term shareholder value and address the interests of our multiple stakeholders, including investments in transmission and distribution facilities to enhance reliability and resiliency. Our strategic resource allocation decisions are influenced by the performance and prospects of our businesses, returns, sustainability, and predictability of future earnings streams. We recognize the importance of mobilizing and deploying IT-based resources in combination with leveraging the value of other resources and capabilities. The passage of the Inflation Reduction Act is expected to provide downside price protection for our nuclear generation fleet, which will support our operational flexibility and strategic alignment with public policy objectives. We are committed to delivering on our human capital management strategy to attract, develop, and retain a diverse, high-performing workforce, which is essential for achieving our organizational goals and enhancing our IT capabilities.

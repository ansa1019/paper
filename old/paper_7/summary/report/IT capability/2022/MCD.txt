The company is implementing a comprehensive, multi-year finance and technology transformation initiative to migrate its general ledger, financial close, and consolidation processes onto new financial systems, aimed at increasing efficiency and modernizing the tools and technology used in its key financial processes. This initiative is not in response to any identified deficiency or weakness in the company's internal control over financial reporting. The company has modified certain processes and procedures to enhance the quality of internal control over financial reporting as the phased implementation of the systems continues. Management believes that the company's internal control over financial reporting is effective, and there has been no change during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022, that has materially affected the company's internal control over financial reporting. The company also utilizes technology platforms to recover a portion of costs incurred for various services provided to franchisees, which are distinct from the franchise agreement. These technology platforms include software as a service solutions that were recognized over the applicable subscription period as the service was performed. The company’s capitalized software is stated at cost and amortized using the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of the software, which primarily ranges from 2 to 10 years. The company reviews capitalized software for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. The company’s internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. The company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. The company’s internal control over financial reporting includes policies and procedures that pertain to the maintenance of records that accurately reflect transactions and dispositions of the company's assets, provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements, and provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets. The company has also assessed the design and effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, using criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. The company’s internal control over financial reporting is subject to inherent limitations, including the possibility of human error and the circumvention or overriding of controls. The company’s management intends to continue monitoring and modifying the design and operating effectiveness of key control activities to align with the updated business processes and capabilities of the new financial systems. The company’s investment in technology resources and capabilities is critical for supporting its business strategies and enhancing operational efficiency, thereby contributing to the overall performance and competitive advantage in the market.

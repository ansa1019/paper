The organization of information technology capabilities has been evolving to encompass the coordination of a firm’s assets and internal processes, as well as their interfirm transactions and relationships. IT capability is defined as a firm's ability to acquire, deploy, combine, and reconfigure IT resources in support of business strategies and work processes. The focus on information management capability emphasizes the ability to provide data and information to users with appropriate levels of accuracy, timeliness, reliability, security, confidentiality, connectivity, and access, tailored to changing business needs and directions. Mobilizing and deploying IT-based resources, while leveraging the value of other resources and capabilities, is crucial for transforming a firm into a competitive force. The application of physical or intangible IT resources, such as technology, knowledge, practices, relationships, management skills, business process understanding, and human resources, further supports organizational goals. The firm’s financial performance is significantly influenced by varying conditions in the markets served, particularly the on-highway, construction, and general industrial markets. Economic downturns generally lead to reduced sales and potential price reductions, while geopolitical risks, currency fluctuations, political and economic uncertainty, and regulatory matters also affect operations. The company continues to invest in businesses in countries with higher risk levels, such as China, Brazil, India, Mexico, and regions in the Middle East and Africa, while its geographic diversity and broad product offerings help mitigate the impact of demand fluctuations. The acquisition of Meritor, Inc. has integrated new capabilities into the firm’s operations, enhancing its technology portfolio and market responsiveness. Supply chain disruptions have posed challenges, limiting the ability to meet end-user demand and impacting production capabilities. The firm’s management is actively working to minimize these impacts while monitoring the related factors affecting business operations. The firm’s strategic decisions regarding investments and resource allocation are critical for maintaining operational flexibility and achieving performance gains. The integration of innovation partnerships and strategic management practices supports the development of new products and services, aligning with market demands and enhancing competitive positioning. The firm’s ability to manage its technology infrastructure and governance contexts is essential for ensuring effective IT deployment and operational efficiency. The focus on digital transformation and the development of capabilities in data management, analytics, and information systems is vital for enhancing organizational effectiveness and achieving business value. The firm’s approach to managing its resources, including IT capabilities, is integral to its overall strategy and performance outcomes.

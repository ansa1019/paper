The pharmacy services segment provides a full range of pharmacy benefit management solutions, including plan design offerings and administration, formulary management, and retail pharmacy network management services. The company operates a group purchasing organization that negotiates pricing for the purchase of pharmaceuticals and rebates with pharmaceutical manufacturers on behalf of its participants.

The company has made incremental investments in business operations and technology resources to support growth.

The company believes its IT capabilities represent the application of physical or intangible IT resources such as technology, knowledge, practices, relationships, management skills, and business process understanding to further organizational goals. The company has also recorded office real estate optimization charges related to the planned reduction of corporate office real estate space in response to its new flexible work arrangement. The company continuously assesses its regulatory capital requirements, working capital needs, debt and leverage levels, and potential share repurchases, which are all part of its strategic resource allocation.

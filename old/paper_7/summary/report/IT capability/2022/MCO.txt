MA leverages its industry expertise across multiple risks to deliver integrated risk assessment solutions that enable business leaders to identify, measure, and manage the implications of interrelated risks and opportunities. The company continues to monitor macroeconomic uncertainties and geopolitical factors that impact its business, including the ongoing Russia/Ukraine conflict and the COVID-19 pandemic. Moody's evaluates its critical accounting estimates, which are particularly dependent on management's judgment about uncertain matters, and these estimates could materially affect the company's consolidated results of operations or financial condition. The company has performed goodwill impairment assessments and evaluated the recoverability of goodwill using a two-step impairment test approach. The fair value of reporting units is determined using significant estimates, including projections of future operating results and cash flows, which are based on internal budgets and strategic plans. Moody's allocates newly acquired goodwill to reporting units expected to benefit from the acquisition. The company recognizes that the estimation of fair value for investments in non-consolidated affiliates may involve significant judgment, and it regularly assesses its investments for indicators of impairment. The company has also made significant investments in technology infrastructure to enable automation, innovation, and efficiency, reflecting its commitment to enhancing its operational capabilities. The increase in operating and SG&A expenses is primarily due to growth in both compensation and non-compensation costs, driven by acquisitions and operational costs associated with recent acquisitions. The company's strategic initiatives support business growth and enhance technology infrastructure, which is critical for maintaining operational efficiency and competitive advantage. Moody's recognizes the importance of mobilizing and deploying IT-based resources in combination with leveraging the value of other resources and capabilities to transform the firm into a competitive force. The company's focus on information management capability emphasizes the ability to provide data and information to users with appropriate levels of accuracy, timeliness, reliability, security, confidentiality, connectivity, and access, tailored to changing business needs and directions. The firmâ€™s IT capabilities represent the application of physical or intangible IT resources such as technology, knowledge, practices, relationships, management skills, and human resources to further organizational goals. Moody's is committed to using its strong cash flow to create value for shareholders by investing in employees and growing the business through targeted organic initiatives and inorganic acquisitions aligned with strategic priorities.

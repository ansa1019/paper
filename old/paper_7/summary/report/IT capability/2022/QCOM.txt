Our business and operating segments develop and commercialize foundational technologies and products used in mobile devices and other wireless products, which are essential for enhancing our IT capabilities. We derive revenues principally from sales of integrated circuit products and licensing our intellectual property, including patents and other rights, which are critical components in supporting our IT architecture and operational efficiency. We are organized on the basis of products and services and have three reportable segments, with our QCT (Qualcomm CDMA Technologies) semiconductor business and QTL (Qualcomm Technology Licensing) licensing business being pivotal in leveraging technology resources to meet business needs. The increase in QCT revenues in fiscal 2022 was primarily due to higher average selling prices and a favorable mix toward higher-tier 5G products, which underscores the importance of our IT capabilities in driving competitive advantage and market responsiveness. Our research and development expenses, which increased in fiscal 2022, were driven by higher costs related to the development of wireless and integrated circuit technologies, including 5G and application processor technologies, highlighting our commitment to enhancing our IT capabilities and innovation partnerships. We expect continued commercial 5G network deployments and device launches, which will further enhance our IT deployment strategies and operational flexibility. The anticipated consumer demand for 3G/4G/5G multimode and 5G products and services is expected to ramp up globally, emphasizing the need for effective IT governance and resource allocation to sustain and grow our business long term. We believe it is crucial to remain a leader in 5G technology development, standardization, and intellectual property creation to maintain our competitive positioning. Furthermore, we continue to devote resources to working with and educating participants in the wireless industry about the benefits of our licensing programs, which are integral to our IT capabilities and overall business strategy alignment. The macroeconomic environment poses challenges that may negatively impact consumer demand for smartphones and other devices that incorporate our products and technologies, necessitating agile decision-making and strategic resource allocation to navigate these dynamics effectively. Our liquidity and capital resources are supported by existing cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities, which are essential for funding our IT investments and operational requirements. We expect to continue making strategic investments and acquisitions, which will further enhance our IT capabilities and organizational effectiveness. The ongoing evolution of our IT capabilities is critical for transforming our firm into a competitive force in the market, as it enables us to mobilize and deploy IT-based resources in combination with other strategic resources to achieve our organizational goals.

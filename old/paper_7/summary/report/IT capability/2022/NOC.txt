The company completed the sale of its IT and mission support services business for $3.4 billion in cash, which included the majority of the former IS&S division of defense systems and select cyber, intelligence, and mission support programs. The IT services divestiture had a significant impact on the company's financial performance, with operating income reflecting a decrease due to the absence of sales from this business in the year ended December 31, 2022. The divestiture resulted in a pre-tax gain of $2.0 billion in the prior year, which contributed to fluctuations in operating performance. The company continues to manage and assess its business based on performance metrics that include the effective deployment of IT resources, which are critical for supporting business strategies and enhancing operational efficiency. The operational performance is evaluated through changes in sales and operating margin rates, which are influenced by the company's ability to leverage its IT capabilities and resources in response to market dynamics and competitive pressures. The ongoing global economic environment, characterized by inflationary pressures and supply chain challenges, has necessitated a focus on operational flexibility and resource management to mitigate adverse impacts on performance. The company recognizes the importance of mobilizing and deploying IT-based resources to enhance its competitive advantage and support business transformation efforts. Additionally, the management emphasizes the need for strategic resource allocation to address evolving business needs and market opportunities. The company's IT capabilities are integral to its ability to provide timely and reliable information management, which is essential for decision-making and maintaining customer relationships. The divestiture of the IT services business has prompted a reevaluation of the company's technology portfolio and operational strategies, with an emphasis on enhancing organizational capabilities and integrating technology functionalities to improve overall performance. The company anticipates that changes in the global security environment and macroeconomic factors will continue to influence demand for its products and services, thereby impacting its IT investment decisions and operational strategies. The management's focus on enhancing IT governance and capabilities is aimed at ensuring that the company remains responsive to external influences and maintains its position as a competitive force in the defense industry. The strategic alignment of IT resources with organizational goals is viewed as essential for achieving long-term business value and operational excellence.

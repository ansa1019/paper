In 2022, we are focused on leveraging advantaged raw material selection, new approaches in the commercial space to be more dynamic amidst changing market conditions, and achieving technology improvements to advance our commercial performance. Our investments are directed towards high returning projects that we believe will enhance the competitiveness of our portfolio, including investments in sustainable fuels and technologies that lower our carbon intensity as the global energy mix evolves. We are committed to achieving operational excellence by reducing costs, improving efficiency, driving operational improvements, and being disciplined in capital allocation, which means optimizing our portfolio of investment opportunities to ensure efficient deployment of capital focusing on projects with the highest returns. Our approach to sustainability spans the environmental, social, and governance dimensions of our business, which includes innovating for the future by investing in renewables and emerging technologies, thereby embedding sustainability in decision-making and stakeholder engagement. The martinez renewable fuels project joint venture exemplifies our commitment to leveraging complementary core competencies, with MPC bringing experience in renewable diesel facility conversion and large capital project execution, while Neste contributes knowledge in sustainable feedstock sourcing and renewable liquid fuels production. The joint venture reflects both partners' commitment to obtain low carbon intensity feedstocks to achieve project objectives of providing fuels that meet the demand driven by the low carbon fuel standard. Our refining & marketing segment adjusted EBITDA is influenced by refining operating costs, which are primarily driven by energy costs, including purchased natural gas, and the level of maintenance costs. The profitability of our midstream segment relies on tariff rates and volumes shipped through pipelines, with profitability affected by prevailing commodity prices and the cost of third-party transportation services. We continue to evaluate our capital plan and make changes as conditions warrant, with a capital investment plan for 2023 totaling approximately $1.3 billion for capital projects and investments. Our capital spending includes growth capital for low carbon projects and traditional projects that are expected to improve the competitive position of our assets. We also focus on projects aimed at reducing future operating costs. Our corporate expenses have increased due to stock-based compensation and retroactive operating tax assessments, but we maintain a disciplined approach to capital allocation. The financial covenants in our credit agreements require maintaining a ratio of consolidated net debt to total capitalization, reflecting our commitment to maintaining an investment-grade credit profile. Our liquidity position is bolstered by cash and cash equivalents, as well as access to capital markets. The strategic management practices we employ to optimize our operational efficiency and enhance our IT capabilities are essential in navigating the complexities of the current business environment, ensuring we remain competitive and responsive to market dynamics.

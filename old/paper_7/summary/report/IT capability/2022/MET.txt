MetLife is one of the world's leading financial services companies, providing insurance, annuities, employee benefits, and asset management. The company’s IT capabilities have evolved to encompass the coordination of its assets and internal processes, as well as interfirm transactions and relationships. Financial strength and flexibility, along with technology modernization, are prerequisites for sustainable growth in the life insurance industry. Larger market participants have the capacity to invest in analytics, distribution, and information technology, leveraging the capabilities of new digital entrants. The competitive landscape is characterized by intense price competition and a focus on differentiation through product features and services. Insurers are increasingly seeking alternative sources of revenue, focusing on monetization of assets and fee-based services, which include providing value-added services alongside traditional products. The company’s investment portfolio is diversified and positioned to perform well in various economic scenarios, with a strong emphasis on managing risks associated with interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, credit spreads, and equity market levels. MetLife actively evaluates market risk hedging needs and strategies to ensure free cash flow and capital objectives are met under a range of market conditions. The company utilizes derivatives as an integral part of its management of the investment portfolio and insurance liabilities to hedge certain risks. The effectiveness of the company’s risk management strategies is critical, as unanticipated policyholder behavior or mortality, combined with adverse market events, can produce economic losses beyond the scope of the risk management techniques employed. The company’s operational flexibility is supported by its ability to generate strong cash flows and access to various funding sources, including commercial paper and credit facilities. MetLife’s liquidity management includes maintaining a substantial short-term liquidity position and managing liquid assets to meet current and future obligations. The company’s capital management process involves regular reviews of actual and projected capital levels, with the board of directors directly involved in the development and maintenance of the capital policy. MetLife’s risk management framework integrates climate risk and includes a comprehensive approach to managing financial and non-financial risks. The company’s asset/liability management (ALM) process balances quality, diversification, and investment return while ensuring that assets and liabilities are aligned on a cash flow and duration basis. The ALM committees oversee investment guidelines and limits, approving significant portfolio strategies. MetLife’s commitment to information security is reflected in its information security program, which aims to protect information and technology assets through various safeguards. The company’s IT governance emphasizes the importance of mobilizing and deploying IT-based resources in combination with leveraging the value of other resources and capabilities to enhance business strategies and work processes.

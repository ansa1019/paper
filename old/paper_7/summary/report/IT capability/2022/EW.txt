The medical technology industry is highly competitive and continues to evolve. Our success is measured both by the development of innovative products and the value we bring to our stakeholders. We are committed to developing new technologies and providing innovative patient care, and we are committed to defending our intellectual property in support of those developments. Despite the challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic, our dedicated field teams have found creative ways to support physicians, our engineers continued to advance innovation, and our colleagues worked diligently to keep our clinical trials on track. In 2022, we invested 17.6% of our net sales in research and development. We are dedicated to generating robust clinical, economic, and quality-of-life evidence increasingly expected by patients, clinicians, and payors in the current healthcare environment, with the goal of encouraging the adoption of innovative new medical therapies that demonstrate superior outcomes. The increase in net sales of TAVR products was driven by higher sales of the Edwards Sapien platform in 2022, primarily the Edwards Sapien 3 Ultra valve in the United States, Europe, and rest of world. The increase in gross profit as a percentage of net sales in 2022 compared to 2021 was driven primarily by a 3.6 percentage point increase from the impact of our foreign currency hedging program, which includes hedge contract gains and natural hedges. Selling, general, and administrative expenses increased in 2022 compared to 2021 due primarily to a resumption of in-person commercial activities following COVID-19 and higher field-based personnel-related costs. R&D expenses increased marginally in 2022 compared to 2021 due primarily to continued investments in our transcatheter innovations, including increased clinical trial activity. The determination of our provision for income taxes requires significant judgment, the use of estimates, and the interpretation and application of complex tax laws. We evaluate our tax positions and establish liabilities in accordance with the applicable accounting guidance on uncertainty in income taxes. We have purchased options to acquire and have agreed to provide promissory notes to various entities. These arrangements could result in additional cash outlays in the future should we decide to exercise the options or should the entities draw on the promissory notes. We continue to invest in our operations, with anticipated capital expenditures of approximately $300.0 million in 2023. Our sources of cash liquidity include cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, cash from operations, and amounts available under credit facilities. We believe that these sources are sufficient to fund the current and long-term requirements of working capital, capital expenditures, and other financial commitments. The medical technology industry is characterized by rapid technological advancements and the need for continuous innovation to maintain competitive advantage. Our operational flexibility and strategic resource allocation are crucial in navigating the evolving market dynamics and external influences affecting our business performance. The impacts of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on net sales are not necessarily indicative of the impact on net income due to the corresponding effect of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on international manufacturing and operating costs, and our hedging activities. The severity and duration of the impact of these conditions on our business cannot be predicted. We are committed to leveraging our IT capabilities to enhance our operational efficiency and support our business strategies, ensuring that we remain responsive to market demands and consumer needs.

Technology is the foundation of our company, and our strategy to maximize long-term free cash flow per share growth has three elements: a great business model focused on analog and embedded processing products built around four sustainable competitive advantages, discipline in allocating capital to the best opportunities, and efficiency, which means constantly striving for more output for every dollar spent. We will invest to strengthen our competitive advantages, be disciplined in capital allocation, and stay diligent in our pursuit of efficiencies. Our segments represent groups of similar products that are combined based on similar design and development requirements, product characteristics, manufacturing processes, and distribution channels, and how management allocates resources and measures results. Our strategic focus is on analog and embedded processing products, which allows us to generate strong cash flow from operations. We believe that our business model with the combined effect of our four competitive advantages sets us apart from our peers. We continue to monitor potential impacts on our operations due to the coronavirus pandemic, which has affected market conditions and business operations across industries worldwide. We expect demand for our products to continue to weaken into 2023, and during this time, we will manage our operating plan and expenses with a steady hand while focusing on long-term investments to strengthen our competitive advantages. Our cash flow from operations underscores the strength of our business model, and we invested significantly in R&D and capital expenditures to enhance our operational capabilities. We believe that our investments in technology and manufacturing capacity are essential for long-term growth and competitive positioning. The U.S. Chips and Science Act provides funding for manufacturing grants and research investments, which we expect to leverage for our strategic advantage. Our liquidity primarily stems from cash flow from operations and access to debt markets, which we utilize to fund our working capital needs and capital expenditures. We are committed to enhancing our IT capabilities to support business needs and leverage technology resources effectively. Our focus on operational efficiency and strategic resource allocation is critical to maintaining our competitive edge in the market. We recognize the importance of mobilizing and deploying IT-based resources in combination with leveraging the value of other resources and capabilities to further our organizational goals. Our ability to provide data and information to users with appropriate levels of accuracy, timeliness, reliability, security, and connectivity is essential for responding to changing business needs and directions. We continuously assess our technology infrastructure and capabilities to ensure alignment with our business strategy and market demands. Our management practices emphasize the integration of technology into our operational processes, which is vital for achieving performance excellence and sustaining our competitive advantages in a dynamic market environment.

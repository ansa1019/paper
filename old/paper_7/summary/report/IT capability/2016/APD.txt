Information technology (IT) capabilities have been evolving in scope to more comprehensively encompass the coordination of a firm’s assets and internal processes and their interfirm transactions and relationships. IT capability is a firm's ability to acquire, deploy, combine, and reconfigure IT resources in support and enhancement of business strategies and work processes. The company focuses on information management capability, which is the ability to provide data and information to users with appropriate levels of accuracy, timeliness, reliability, security, confidentiality, connectivity, and access, and to tailor these in response to changing business needs and directions. The notion of IT capability underscores the importance of mobilizing and deploying IT-based resources in combination with, and leveraging the value of, other resources and capabilities. IT capability, broadly defined as the IT function’s competence to effectively support business needs, has become a key in transforming a firm into a competitive force. A firm’s IT capabilities represent the application of physical or intangible IT resources such as technology, knowledge, practices, relationships, management skills, business process understanding, and human resources to further organizational goals. The company has made significant progress on its strategy by focusing on its core industrial gases business and has significantly improved profitability, which is measured by operating margin and adjusted EBITDA margin. The company is committed to exit the energy-from-waste business, allowing it to execute its strategy of focusing resources on its core industrial gases business. During the year, the company improved its focus on safety, delivered on cost reduction targets, and increased accountability by aligning pay with performance. These changes drove increased profitability as the company delivered operating margins and adjusted EBITDA margins that increased significantly from the prior year. The company expects to continue to drive earnings growth by bringing new industrial gas plant investments on-stream, making progress on the sale of equipment projects, and continuing to deliver on cost reduction actions. The company’s operational flexibility is enhanced through its strategic resource allocation and capability leverage, which are critical for maintaining competitive advantage in a dynamic market environment. The firm’s investment decisions are guided by the need to optimize operational efficiency and enhance performance metrics, which are essential for sustaining long-term growth. The company’s strategic management practices include evaluating opportunities for innovation partnerships and resource mobilization to enhance its capabilities and market responsiveness. The firm’s ability to manage its technology portfolio effectively and align its IT architecture with business strategies is crucial for achieving operational excellence and improving firm performance. The company continues to assess its IT governance and resource management practices to ensure alignment with organizational goals and to address challenges that may arise in the evolving business landscape.

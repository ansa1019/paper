The market for defense products, services, and solutions globally continues to be driven by complex and evolving security challenges, which are considered in the broader context of political and socioeconomic priorities. We manage and assess our business based on our performance on contracts and programs, recognizing sales from our portfolio of long-term contracts primarily using the cost-to-cost method of percentage of completion accounting. In evaluating our operating performance, we look primarily at changes in sales and operating income, where applicable, significant fluctuations in operating performance attributable to individual contracts or programs are described in our analysis. Operating costs and expenses primarily include labor, material, subcontractor, and overhead costs, which are generally allocated to contracts as incurred. We do not focus on individual cost groupings as much as we do on total contract cost, which is the key driver of our sales and operating income.

This MD&A is intended to provide investors with an understanding of our recent performance, financial condition, and prospects. We seek to manage our portfolio to balance growth, profit margin, and cash flow, invest in our brands, innovation, and growth initiatives, deliver sustainable cost reductions, and provide disciplined capital management to improve return on invested capital and return cash to shareholders. Our focus on generating cash flow and allocating capital to shareholders is evident, with cash provided by operations increasing significantly year-on-year. We completed our organization restructuring in order to improve organizational efficiency and offset the impact of stranded overhead costs resulting from the spin-off of our health care business. The results in 2016 included benefits from organic sales growth, cost savings, and a focus on innovation. We anticipate that our capital spending will support our strategic initiatives, including technology deployment and operational flexibility, which are critical for enhancing our competitive advantage. Our business environment is influenced by external factors such as foreign currency exchange rates, which have impacted our net sales and operating profit. The ongoing force program aims to achieve cost savings that will fund investments in innovations and growth initiatives. We expect to continue executing our global business plan strategies, focusing on targeted growth initiatives, innovation, and brand building. Our outlook includes expectations for organic sales growth driven by higher volumes and a similar impact from net selling prices and product mix. We also plan to achieve cost savings from our force program, which will enhance our operational efficiency and support our strategic resource allocation. The ability to mobilize and deploy IT-based resources in combination with leveraging the value of other resources and capabilities is essential for transforming our firm into a competitive force. Our IT capabilities represent the application of technology, knowledge, practices, and management skills to further our organizational goals. The integration of technology into our business processes is fundamental to our operational effectiveness and market responsiveness. We are committed to enhancing our information management capability, ensuring that we provide data and information to users with the appropriate levels of accuracy, timeliness, reliability, security, and access. Our strategic decisions are influenced by the need to adapt to changing market dynamics and consumer demands, which require agility and flexibility in our operations. The performance linkage between our strategic initiatives and financial outcomes underscores the importance of effective IT governance and resource management in achieving our business objectives. We recognize the challenges posed by regulatory uncertainties and market restructuring, which necessitate a proactive approach to managing our technology portfolio and investment choices. Our focus on innovation partnerships and strategic management practices will enable us to navigate the complexities of the business environment and drive sustainable growth.

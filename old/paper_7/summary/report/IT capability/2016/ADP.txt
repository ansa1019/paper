ADP is focused on driving product innovation, enhancing our distribution and service capabilities, and assisting our clients with their human capital management (HCM) needs in the face of ever-increasing regulatory complexity. Our investments in product innovation, service, and our sales force reflect our commitment to evolving our IT capabilities to support business strategies and work processes. The ability to implement new clients on our solutions and new services to existing clients has driven solid revenue growth. Our focus on product innovation and the high demand for additional HCM solutions, including products that assist businesses in complying with the Affordable Care Act (ACA), has contributed to strong new business bookings. We have seen a contribution to revenue growth from our ACA compliance solutions, as our upfront investments in selling and implementation of these products began to translate into recurring revenue. Our revenue retention metric continues to be a point of internal focus as we upgrade clients from legacy platforms to new modern cloud-based solutions, which enhances operational efficiency and client experience. Systems development and programming costs increased due to investments to develop, support, and maintain our products, which are critical for our operational flexibility and capability enhancement. The increase in selling, general, and administrative expenses was primarily related to selling expenses to support growth in new business bookings and the demand for HCM products. Our ability to adapt to the evolving needs of clients and the changing regulatory environment demonstrates our organizational agility and strategic alignment with market dynamics. We believe that our efforts during the fiscal year position us well for future growth, as we continue to innovate and offer new products to clients. Our financial condition remains solid, with cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities of approximately $3.2 billion, which supports our operational and investment activities. The introduction of long-term debt to our capital structure and anticipated share repurchases are intended to enhance total shareholder return over the longer term. We continue to manage our exposure to market risks through regular operating and financing activities, including the use of derivative financial instruments as risk management tools. Our investment strategy is structured to allow us to average our way through an interest rate cycle, ensuring we maintain sufficient liquidity to satisfy client funds obligations. We have established credit quality, maturity, and exposure limits for our investments, which are crucial for minimizing risks associated with our investment portfolio. The overall investment portfolio is comprised of corporate investments and client funds assets, with a focus on safety of principal, liquidity, and diversification. Our client funds investment strategy seeks to maximize interest income while minimizing volatility, which is essential for maintaining operational effectiveness and meeting client obligations. As we continue to enhance our IT capabilities, we remain committed to leveraging technology resources and management skills to further our organizational goals and improve business performance.

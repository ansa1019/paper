We are a leading provider of transparent and independent ratings, benchmarks, analytics and data to the capital and commodity markets worldwide. Our operations consist of three reportable segments: ratings, market and commodities intelligence, and S&P Dow Jones indices. Market and commodities intelligence's portfolio of capabilities are designed to help the financial community track performance, generate better investment returns, identify new trading and investment ideas, perform risk analysis, develop mitigation strategies and provide high-value information to the commodity and energy markets that enable its customers to make better informed trading and business decisions. We strive to deliver on our strategic priorities in the following four categories by engaging with the world around us, investing to meet customer needs in high growth areas, expanding in international markets, embracing operational excellence in all that we do, and accelerating digital transformation and stimulating innovation. Our technology capabilities include the S&P Capital IQ desktop, which provides data, analytics, and third-party research for global finance professionals, and our risk services, which sell ratings' credit ratings and related data, analytics, and research. We have repositioned S&P Global as a more focused company in the capital and commodity markets by exiting non-core assets and investing for growth in markets that have size and scale. The increase in operating profit was primarily due to the impact of revenue growth at market and commodities intelligence and indices, and cost containment efforts at ratings during 2015. Our business transformation initiatives are aimed at enhancing our technology infrastructure and operational efficiency, which are critical for maintaining competitive advantage in the rapidly evolving market landscape. Additionally, we have made significant investments in technology resources to enhance our analytical capabilities, which are essential for delivering actionable insights to our clients. The acquisition of SNL Financial has further strengthened our market intelligence capabilities, enabling us to provide integrated cross-asset analytics and desktop services. Our strategic management practices focus on leveraging our IT capabilities to support business needs and enhance performance metrics. We continue to seek to develop new products and deliver enhancements to existing content and analytical capabilities, while also expanding our presence in selected markets and geographies to accelerate international growth. The unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates reduced revenue by less than 1 percentage point, but our strategic resource allocation and investment decisions have positioned us well to respond to market dynamics and consumer demands. Our commitment to operational excellence and innovation is reflected in our ongoing efforts to optimize our processes and enhance our organizational capabilities. The integration of recent acquisitions is expected to further expand our analytical offerings and improve our market-based performance. We remain focused on aligning our technology deployment with our business strategy to ensure that we are well-equipped to navigate the challenges and opportunities presented by the evolving financial landscape.

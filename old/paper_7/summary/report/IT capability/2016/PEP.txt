Our management monitors a variety of key indicators to evaluate our business results and financial condition, which include growth in volume, net revenue, organic revenue, operating profit, earnings per share, retail sales, market share, safety, innovation, product and service quality, organizational health, brand equity, media viewership and engagement, employee diversity, net commodity inflation, productivity savings, net capital spending, free cash flow, and return on invested capital. We believe our performance is inextricably linked to the sustainability of the world in which we operate, and our commitment to performance with purpose enables us to meet or exceed financial goals. We continued to embrace automation across the company, leveraging new tools that we believe will deliver higher rates of production. We also focused on skills upgrading and job retraining, creating new opportunities for our workers. Our strategies are designed to address key challenges facing our company, including consumer demand for healthier products and uncertain macroeconomic conditions. We continue to shift our portfolio toward healthier products through both organic innovation and strategic mergers and acquisitions. We have increased our investment in research and development significantly, which is essential for enhancing our operational capabilities and aligning with market dynamics. Our success depends on the availability of key natural resources, and we believe that embracing environmentally responsible business practices will help sustain our business. We have saved over $600 million by improving our water and energy efficiency and promoting sustainable farming practices. Our performance with purpose strategy will enable us to continue delivering strong financial results while positioning our company for long-term sustainable growth. We regularly evaluate our business results and strategies, which encompasses financial discipline in our strategic and daily business decisions. We leverage an integrated risk management framework to identify, assess, prioritize, address, manage, monitor, and communicate risks across the company's operations. Our risk management office provides ongoing guidance, tools, and analytical support to facilitate communication between parties, including our board of directors. We are exposed to market risks arising from adverse changes in commodity prices, foreign exchange rates, and interest rates, which we manage through productivity initiatives and global purchasing programs. Our hedging strategies include the use of derivatives to manage risks associated with changes in commodity prices, interest rates, and foreign exchange rates. We do not use derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes. We are committed to providing timely, accurate, and understandable information to investors, which includes maintaining strong controls over financial reporting. Our internal control system is designed to provide reasonable assurance that transactions are executed as authorized and accurately recorded, safeguarding assets, and ensuring the reliability of financial statements. We engage in a variety of research and development activities to drive innovation globally, and our investment strategy includes the use of actively managed accounts, ensuring that funds are available to meet benefit obligations. Our overall investment policy is to prudently invest plan assets in a well-diversified portfolio of equity and high-quality debt securities to achieve long-term return expectations. We have established valuation allowances for deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.

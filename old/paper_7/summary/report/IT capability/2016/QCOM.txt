The transition of wireless networks and devices to 3G/4G continued around the world, with 3G/4G connections increasing to approximately 4.0 billion, representing approximately 54% of total mobile connections. The strategic realignment plan announced in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015 was designed to improve execution, enhance financial performance, and drive profitable growth. This included implementing a cost reduction plan across businesses, particularly in QCT, which is a leading developer and supplier of integrated circuits and system software for wireless communications. QCT's revenues comprised 65% of total consolidated revenues in fiscal 2016, and the segment's performance was impacted by a shift in share among customers within the premium tier, which reduced sales of integrated Snapdragon processors and skewed the product mix towards lower-margin modem chipsets. The QTL segment's revenues were primarily generated through licensing agreements, which included royalties based on sales by licensees of products incorporating Qualcomm's intellectual property. The company continues to invest significant resources toward advancements in 4G LTE and 5G technologies, as well as in targeted opportunities that leverage existing technical and business expertise to deploy new business models and enter new industry segments. The strategic investments made by Qualcomm are focused on opening new opportunities for technologies and supporting the design and introduction of new products and services for voice and data communications. Additionally, the company has been affected by industry dynamics, including concentration of device share among a few companies within the premium tier and intense competition, particularly in China. The firm’s IT capabilities represent the application of both physical and intangible IT resources, such as technology, knowledge, and management skills, to further organizational goals. The company is also investing in digital transformation initiatives, including products for the Internet of Things (IoT) and machine learning. The strategic management practices employed are aimed at enhancing operational efficiency and ensuring that the organization remains agile in response to market demands. The firm’s focus on innovation partnerships and technology integration is intended to create a competitive advantage and improve market responsiveness. The ongoing efforts in compliance and governance are expected to enhance reporting accuracy and reliability, while also addressing challenges related to unlicensed products and contractual obligations with licensees. The company anticipates that its investments in research and development will continue to support its capabilities in technology management and business process optimization, thereby contributing to overall firm performance and market-based performance outcomes.

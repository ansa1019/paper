In this management discussion and analysis, we emphasize our strategy to improve our business and strengthen our competitive position, which includes the coordination of a firmâ€™s assets and internal processes. Our focus on information management capability underscores the importance of mobilizing and deploying IT-based resources to support business strategies. We have made significant progress in transforming our firm into a competitive force, with net revenue for 2016 increasing due to higher sales in our computing and graphics segment, driven by demand for our GPU products. The improvement in operating performance was attributed to increased net revenue and a reduction in restructuring charges. Our operating expenses were managed closely, reflecting our commitment to operational efficiency and resource allocation. We executed our roadmap by delivering new products and technologies across our business segments, which is crucial for maintaining market agility and responding to competitive pressures. In 2016, we continued to enhance our balance sheet by reducing debt and extending maturities, which supports our operational flexibility and strategic resource allocation. Our joint ventures, particularly with thatic, are designed to support our expansion into the server product market in China, demonstrating our capability to leverage strategic resources and partnerships for growth. The licensing agreement with thatic reflects our ability to monetize intellectual property, contributing to our revenue streams. Additionally, the sixth amendment to our wafer supply agreement with Globalfoundries illustrates our commitment to technology collaboration and operational integration, providing us greater flexibility in sourcing foundry services. Our investments in research and development are aimed at enhancing our technology capabilities and supporting our business innovation efforts. The strategic decisions made in 2016, including the introduction of new products and the optimization of our technology portfolio, are aligned with our goal of improving firm performance and creating business value. The restructuring plans implemented have been focused on simplifying our business and aligning resources with our strategic priorities, which is essential for maintaining competitive positioning in a dynamic market environment. Our financial condition reflects our ability to manage operational challenges while pursuing actionable investments that enhance our IT capabilities and overall business performance. The emphasis on improving our information systems and technology infrastructure is critical for ensuring information accuracy, reliability, and security, which are vital for effective decision-making and operational success.

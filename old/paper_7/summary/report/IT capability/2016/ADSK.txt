The discussion in our MD&A reflects the effectiveness of our efforts to successfully manage transitions to new business models and markets, including our expectations regarding the continued transition of our business model and our ability to increase our subscription base. We believe our industry is undergoing a transition from the personal computer to cloud, mobile, and social computing, which necessitates an acceleration of our move to the cloud and mobile devices. Our product subscriptions represent a hybrid of desktop software and cloud-based functionality, providing a collaborative design workflow that enhances customer relationships and operational efficiency. The strategic shift towards cloud-based technologies and business models entails both technological and business model shifts, impacting our resource allocation and financial performance metrics. The transition has led us to discontinue selling new perpetual licenses for most individual software products, which has necessitated a reassessment of how we allocate resources and evaluate financial performance. Our strategy includes improving product functionality and expanding offerings through internal development and acquisitions, which are critical for leveraging our IT capabilities and enhancing our competitive advantage. We have established programs to support third-party development of complementary products, which facilitates the customization of solutions for specific uses and enhances our technology capabilities. Our significant global network of distributors, resellers, and third-party developers provides a broad reach into volume markets, which is essential for our operational flexibility and market responsiveness. The transition to a subscription model has resulted in a shift in revenue recognition, impacting our financial metrics and necessitating a focus on annualized recurring revenue (ARR) and growth of subscriptions as better indicators of business momentum. The performance linkage between our IT capabilities and business outcomes is evident as we navigate through economic volatility and geopolitical activities, particularly in emerging economies. We anticipate that our channel mix will continue to evolve as we scale our digitally transacted online business and shift towards direct-only business models. Our commitment to maintaining an open-architecture design of our software products supports innovation partnerships and enhances our ability to respond to changing business needs. As we progress through the business model transition, we expect to see stabilization in our performance metrics, which will reflect the successful integration of our IT capabilities with our strategic objectives. The challenges associated with this transition, including the need for effective IT governance and resource mobilization, are critical to our organizational transformation and overall business resilience. We continuously evaluate our strategic resource allocation to ensure alignment with our long-term goals and to enhance our operational effectiveness in a rapidly changing business environment.

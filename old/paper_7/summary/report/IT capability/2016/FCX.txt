Management has reviewed the development and selection of critical accounting estimates, which involve numerous uncertainties that could affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses. The preparation of these estimates requires that we make assumptions that we consider reasonable under the circumstances. In evaluating our long-lived mining assets for recoverability, we use estimates of pre-tax undiscounted future cash flows derived from current business plans, which are developed using near-term metal price forecasts reflective of the current price environment and management's projections for long-term average metal prices. Our estimates and models used to determine fair value are similar to what a market participant would use, and the determination of reserves involves uncertainties with respect to the ultimate geology of the ore bodies, including quantities, grades, and recovery rates. 

We have significant undeveloped reserves and resources in North America and a portfolio of long-term development projects, with future investments being undertaken based on the results of economic and technical feasibility studies and market conditions. In response to market conditions, we have taken actions to reduce operating and capital costs and adjusted production to reflect market dynamics. Our operations are subject to various national, state, and local environmental laws and regulations that govern the protection of the environment, and compliance with those laws requires significant expenditures. 

Our consolidated revenues can vary significantly as a result of fluctuations in the market prices of copper, gold, and molybdenum. We have also engaged in significant asset sale transactions to restore our balance sheet strength, generating gross proceeds from equity offerings and reducing total debt. The capital expenditures for our mining operations reflect investments in major projects and are influenced by market conditions. We continue to advance studies for future development of our copper resources, with the timing of these investments dependent on market conditions and regulatory contexts.

The operational flexibility of our mining operations is essential for maintaining competitive advantage, and we focus on optimizing our processes to enhance operational efficiency. Our strategic resource allocation is guided by the need to mobilize and deploy IT-based resources effectively, leveraging the value of other capabilities to support our business strategies. The integration of our operations and the management of our technology resources are critical for achieving our organizational goals and enhancing firm performance. 

We have begun suspending investments in underground development projects pending resolution of long-term mining rights, which underscores the importance of regulatory context in our operational decisions. The ability to adapt to changing market conditions and regulatory environments is vital for sustaining our competitive positioning and ensuring long-term value creation. Our organizational capabilities are continuously assessed to align with strategic management practices and to respond effectively to external influences in the business environment.

FIS is a global leader in financial services technology with a focus on retail and institutional banking, payments, asset and wealth management, risk and compliance, consulting, and outsourcing solutions. The company serves more than 20,000 clients in over 130 countries, emphasizing the importance of mobilizing and deploying IT-based resources in combination with leveraging the value of other resources and capabilities. The acquisition of Sungard broadened FIS's solution portfolio, enabling expansion into institutional and wholesale financial markets, which significantly enhanced its existing solutions and client base in wealth management and treasury. This integration is expected to yield substantial cost savings around administration and technology expenses, with a goal of achieving annual synergy run-rate savings exceeding $275 million by the end of 2017. FIS is actively migrating financial institutions to outsourced integrated technology solutions to improve profitability and address ongoing regulatory requirements. The company recognizes the shift in consumer preference from traditional branch banking to digital banking solutions, focusing on enabling clients to deliver a single integrated banking experience across various channels. This area is characterized by increased competition from global banks and disruptive technology innovators. FIS continues to innovate and invest in integrated solutions to meet market demand, particularly in the payments sector, where there is a growing need for faster and more convenient payment solutions. The company has invested in card management solutions to accommodate EMV integrated circuit cards, guiding clients through this technology transition. The rise of digital payments presents both opportunities and risks, as it is unclear which technologies will succeed in the evolving market. FIS's client relationships, payments infrastructure, and adapted solutions are positioned to maintain or grow existing payment volumes. The company is also focused on strategic investments in information security to protect clients and information systems, which includes capital expenditures on hardware, software, personnel, and consulting services. The ongoing focus on information security has led to the development of fraud, security, risk management, and compliance solutions, targeting growth opportunities in the financial services industry. The integration of acquired businesses, such as Sungard, has resulted in significant increases in processing and services revenues, driven by demand for output solutions, card processing volumes, and regulatory compliance solutions. The company’s operational flexibility and strategic resource allocation are crucial in navigating the competitive landscape and addressing the dynamic changes in market conditions. FIS's commitment to enhancing its IT capabilities and infrastructure is integral to its business strategy, aligning with organizational goals and market responsiveness. The firm’s ability to adapt to technological advancements and evolving consumer demands is essential for sustaining competitive advantage and achieving performance excellence in the financial services sector.

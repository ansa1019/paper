The company aims to manage risks associated with commodity price volatility by retaining sufficient cash and accessing capital markets as necessary. Occidental's strategy includes acquiring producing and non-producing leasehold acreage and related infrastructure, which leverages existing operational synergies. The oil and gas segment implements this strategy by focusing on cost-reduction efficiencies and improving new well productivity to reduce total spend per barrel. Enhanced oil recovery techniques are employed in mature fields, and the company emphasizes disciplined capital expenditures to focus on returns and maintain operational efficiency.

The midstream and marketing segment strives to optimize the use of its assets, including transportation and storage capacity, to generate returns and minimize costs while limiting credit risk exposure. Occidental evaluates opportunities across the value chain, utilizing its assets to provide services to other segments and third parties. The company believes that technology improvements and operational efficiencies can enhance productivity and reduce operating expenses, particularly in the Permian Basin, where significant investments have been made. The development program in this region is supported by data gathered from appraisal efforts and offset operators' drilling activities, which aid in reducing costs and improving well productivity. Occidental's operations are characterized by a focus on capital efficiency and the application of enhanced manufacturing principles, which are expected to yield performance gains. The company recognizes the importance of mobilizing and deploying IT-based resources in combination with leveraging the value of other resources and capabilities to support business strategies. Occidental's ability to add reserves depends on the success of improved recovery, extension, and discovery projects, which are influenced by reservoir characteristics, technology improvements, and market conditions.

The company’s management discussion indicates that information technology (IT) capabilities have been evolving in scope to more comprehensively encompass the coordination of a firm’s assets and internal processes and their interfirm transactions and relationships. IT capability is described as a firm's ability to acquire, deploy, combine, and reconfigure IT resources in support and enhancement of business strategies and work processes. The focus on information management capability highlights the ability to provide data and information to users with appropriate levels of accuracy, timeliness, reliability, security, confidentiality, connectivity, and access, tailored in response to changing business needs and directions. The importance of mobilizing and deploying IT-based resources in combination with other resources and capabilities is underscored, as IT capability has become key in transforming a firm into a competitive force. The application of physical or intangible IT resources, such as technology, knowledge, practices, relationships, management skills, business process understanding, and human resources, is essential to further organizational goals. 

The discussion of segment operating results reveals that operating expenses include information systems expense, which reflects the costs associated with IT infrastructure and support. The company evaluates the performance of its operating segments based on segment operating income, which is influenced by the effective deployment of IT capabilities. In the parks and resorts segment, infrastructure costs have increased due to the opening of new facilities and the associated IT expenses. The increase in operating labor and infrastructure costs is attributed to inflation and higher operations support costs, including IT initiatives. 

The media networks segment's operating expenses include technical support costs, which are critical for maintaining IT systems that support broadcasting and distribution of content. The company’s strategic resource allocation includes investments in technology infrastructure, which enhances operational efficiency and supports business innovation. The discussion of corporate and unallocated shared expenses notes that higher information technology costs at domestic parks and resorts were offset by lower marketing costs. 

The company’s liquidity and capital resources section indicates that cash provided by operating activities increased due to higher operating cash receipts driven by revenue growth across segments, supported by effective IT capabilities. The capital expenditures reflect investments in information technology infrastructure and equipment, which are essential for expanding and upgrading operational capabilities. The company expects its fiscal capital expenditures to increase due to investments in domestic parks and resorts, which will likely include IT enhancements. 

Overall, the integration of IT capabilities into various operational segments demonstrates the firm's commitment to leveraging technology as a strategic resource to enhance performance, improve operational efficiency, and support business transformation initiatives. The focus on IT governance and the management of technology resources is evident in the strategic decisions made to optimize performance and respond to market dynamics.

We are an independent oil and natural gas company focused on the acquisition, development, exploration, and exploitation of unconventional, onshore oil and natural gas reserves. Our activities are primarily directed at the horizontal development of formations in the Permian Basin. We intend to continue to develop our reserves and increase production through development drilling and exploitation and exploration activities on our multi-year inventory of identified potential drilling locations and through acquisitions that meet our strategic and financial objectives. The increase in production volumes was due to a combination of increased drilling activity and growth through acquisitions. Our production increased significantly during the year ended December 31, 2016, as we drilled multiple horizontal wells and participated in non-operated wells. We are focused on low-cost operations and best-in-class execution, which includes controlling oilfield service costs and seeking opportunities to optimize well costs. Our 2017 capital budget includes significant expenditures for horizontal drilling and infrastructure, which are essential for enhancing operational efficiency and achieving our strategic goals. We monitor and adjust our projected capital expenditures in response to various factors, including drilling success, commodity prices, and the availability of necessary resources. Our liquidity and capital resources are primarily derived from equity offerings, borrowings under our revolving credit facility, and cash flows from operations. We regularly consider which capital resources are available to meet our future financial obligations and planned capital expenditure activities. Our future ability to grow proved reserves and production will be highly dependent on the capital resources available to us. We are committed to leveraging technology and management capabilities to enhance our operational effectiveness and respond to market dynamics. Our operational flexibility and strategic resource allocation are critical in navigating the competitive landscape and ensuring that we can adapt to changing market conditions. We recognize the importance of mobilizing and deploying IT-based resources in combination with leveraging the value of other resources and capabilities to support our business strategies and enhance our performance. The integration of technology into our operations is essential for optimizing our business processes and improving our market responsiveness. Our focus on innovation and technology deployment will enable us to maintain a competitive advantage in the industry. We are also aware of the challenges posed by environmental factors and regulatory contexts, which necessitate a proactive approach to governance and compliance. As we continue to pursue our strategic objectives, we remain committed to enhancing our IT capabilities and ensuring that our technology infrastructure supports our operational needs and business transformation efforts. Our ability to effectively manage information and data will be crucial in driving performance gains and achieving our organizational goals.

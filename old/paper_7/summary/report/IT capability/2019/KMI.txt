As an energy infrastructure owner and operator, we examine a number of variables and factors on a routine basis to evaluate our current performance and our prospects for the future. Our general and administrative expenses and corporate charges include shared corporate services including accounting, information technology, human resources, and legal services. We believe that our capital structure will continue to allow us to achieve our business objectives, and we expect that our short-term liquidity needs will be met primarily through retained cash from operations or short-term borrowings. We utilize both internal staff and external experts to assist us in identifying environmental issues and estimating the costs and timing of remediation efforts, which underscores the importance of mobilizing and deploying IT-based resources in combination with leveraging the value of other resources and capabilities. Our management evaluates our performance primarily using the GAAP financial measures of segment EBDA, net income, and net income available to common stockholders, along with non-GAAP financial measures such as adjusted earnings and DCF. We routinely evaluate estimates, utilizing historical experience, consultation with experts, and other methods we consider reasonable in the particular circumstances. The profitability of our refined petroleum products pipeline transportation business is driven by the volume of refined petroleum products that we transport and the prices we receive for our services, which are influenced by market dynamics and consumer demands. Our service contracts may rely on various arrangements, which helps us manage the extent to which each party shares in the potential risks and benefits of changing commodity prices. The changes in our segment EBDA for our natural gas pipelines business segment are driven by factors such as increased earnings from expansion projects and higher sales margins, demonstrating the importance of operational flexibility and strategic resource allocation. We also engage in a hedging program that utilizes derivative contracts to mitigate our exposure to fluctuations in energy commodity prices, which reflects our approach to managing financial activities and investment opportunities. Our capital expenditures are classified as maintenance or expansion capital expenditures, impacting our DCF and reflecting our commitment to maintaining operational efficiency and pursuing growth. The classification of our capital expenditures is generally straightforward but can involve management judgment, highlighting the dynamic capabilities required to adapt to changing business needs. As of December 31, 2019, we had a significant amount of cash and cash equivalents, which we believe is adequate to manage our day-to-day cash requirements and anticipated obligations. Our strategic management practices include maintaining a sizable amount of excess borrowing capacity under our credit facility and generating strong cash flows from operations, which are essential for funding our operations and growth capital expenditures. We expect to continue to return value to our shareholders through dividends and share buy-back programs, reflecting our focus on business performance and market-based performance metrics.

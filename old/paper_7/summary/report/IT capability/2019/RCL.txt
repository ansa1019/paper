During the fourth quarter of 2019, we implemented Excalibur, our digital transformation platform, on most of the fleet, which is part of our ongoing efforts to enhance operational efficiency and support business innovation. Our management team is goal motivated, and we aim to establish clear, simple, and ambitious targets that will motivate our people and drive superior results, which aligns with our strategic resource allocation and operational flexibility. The addition of new vessels to the fleet, the consolidation of Silversea Cruises, and the launch of Perfect Day at CocoCay significantly contributed to our year-over-year revenue growth, demonstrating the importance of leveraging technology capabilities in enhancing customer relationships and operational processes. We have focused on finding efficiencies, implementing synergies, and reducing costs while remaining committed to strategic investments that boost revenue, reflecting our capability to mobilize and deploy IT-based resources effectively. Our operational and financial metrics are utilized to evaluate performance and financial condition, indicating a strong alignment with our business strategy and market responsiveness. The integration of new technologies and the focus on digital options thinking are essential for achieving our ambitious goals, including reducing our carbon footprint and improving guest satisfaction metrics. The challenges posed by the recent coronavirus outbreak have highlighted the need for agility in our operations and decision-making processes, as we assess the impact on bookings and overall financial performance. Our strategic management practices are geared towards enhancing our competitive advantage through the effective deployment of technology resources and capabilities, which are critical in navigating market dynamics and external influences. The focus on operational efficiency and the integration of digital technologies into our business processes are vital for maintaining our market positioning and achieving performance excellence. We continuously evaluate our technology portfolio and investment choices to ensure alignment with our organizational goals and the evolving business environment. The emphasis on information management capability underscores our commitment to providing accurate, timely, and reliable data to inform strategic decisions and enhance organizational effectiveness. Our ability to adapt to changing market conditions and consumer demands is supported by a robust IT architecture that facilitates connectivity and communication across our operations, ultimately driving value creation and improving firm performance.

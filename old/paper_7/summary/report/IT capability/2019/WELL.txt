Welltower Inc. is driving the transformation of health care infrastructure by investing with leading seniors housing operators, post-acute providers, and health systems to fund the real estate and infrastructure needed to scale innovative care delivery models and improve people's wellness and overall health care experience. The company’s capital programs, combined with comprehensive planning, development, and property management services, create a single-source solution for acquiring, planning, developing, managing, repositioning, and monetizing real estate assets. The firm aims to protect stockholder capital and enhance stockholder value by diversifying its investment portfolio across property types, relationships, and geographic locations. The company’s revenues are primarily derived from operating lease rentals, resident fees/services, and interest earned on outstanding loans receivable, which depend on the ability of obligors to make contractual payments and the profitability of operating properties. To mitigate risks associated with operating difficulties of obligors, the company employs an asset management process that includes reviewing financial statements, creditworthiness, property inspections, and compliance with covenants. The internal property management division monitors the outpatient medical portfolio through a comprehensive process that evaluates tenant relations, lease expirations, and market conditions. The firm’s investments generate cash from net operating income and principal payments on loans receivable, with permanent financing for future investments typically provided through public debt and equity securities. The company’s liquidity is deemed sufficient to fund its cash uses, which include dividend distributions, debt service payments, and real property investments. The firm continuously evaluates opportunities for future investments and aims to reinvest proceeds from investment dispositions. Key performance indicators used to evaluate the business include net income, funds from operations, and consolidated net operating income, which are essential for internal and external comparisons and resource allocations. The firm’s credit strength is measured through leverage and coverage ratios, which indicate its ability to service interest and fixed charges. The company’s strategic management practices emphasize the importance of effectively executing plans and responding to emerging economic trends to achieve financial objectives. The firm’s ability to maintain compliance with debt covenants and manage its capital structure is critical to its operational flexibility and overall performance. The company recognizes that its operational performance is influenced by market dynamics, regulatory contexts, and competitive positioning, which necessitate a focus on innovation and strategic resource allocation. The firm’s governance practices reflect a commitment to ethical business operations and enhancing stockholder value while meeting legal requirements. The company’s approach to investment decisions and resource management underscores the significance of leveraging IT capabilities to support business strategies and enhance operational efficiency, ultimately contributing to its competitive advantage in the health care real estate sector.

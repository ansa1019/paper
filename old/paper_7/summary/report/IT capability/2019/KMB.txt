In operating our business, we seek to grow our portfolio of brands through innovation, category development and commercial execution, leverage our cost and financial discipline to fund growth and improve margins, and allocate capital in value-creating ways. The improvements in net selling prices and product mix were driven by baby and child care. The comparison was positively impacted by organic sales growth and cost savings, partially offset by input cost inflation, unfavorable currency effects and higher advertising spending. Results benefited from organic sales growth, $260 of force cost savings and $165 of cost savings from the 2018 global restructuring program. The 2018 global restructuring program is expected to yield annual pre-tax savings of $500 to $550 by 2021. The effective tax rate of 21.7 percent in 2019 decreased compared to the effective tax rate of 26.0 percent in 2018. Our share of net income of equity companies was $123 in 2019 and $103 in 2018. The 2018 global restructuring program included incremental capital spending of approximately $600 to $700 by the end of 2020. We believe that our ability to generate cash from operations and our capacity to issue short-term and long-term debt are adequate to fund working capital, payments for our 2018 global restructuring program, capital spending, pension contributions, dividends and other needs for the foreseeable future. We are subject to risks and uncertainties, which can affect our business operations and financial results. The cash provided by operations was $2.7 billion in 2019 compared to $3.0 billion in 2018. The decrease was driven by increased working capital and tax payments, partially offset by higher earnings and lower pension contributions. We maintain a $2.0 billion revolving credit facility which expires in June 2023 and a $750 revolving credit facility which expires in June 2020. These facilities, currently unused, support our commercial paper program and would provide liquidity in the event our access to the commercial paper markets is unavailable for any reason. We repurchase shares of Kimberly-Clark common stock from time to time pursuant to publicly announced share repurchase programs. During 2019, we repurchased 6.2 million shares of our common stock at a cost of $800 through a broker in the open market. We are targeting full-year 2020 share repurchases between $700 and $900, subject to market conditions. Our products are sold under well-known brands such as Kleenex, Scott, Huggies, Pull-Ups, Kotex and Depend. We have three reportable business segments: personal care, consumer tissue and KCP. The net sales of $18.5 billion were even with the year-ago period. Organic sales increased 4 percent. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates reduced sales by 3 percent. In North America, organic sales increased 3 percent in both consumer products and in K-C Professional. Outside North America, organic sales rose 6 percent in D&E markets and 1 percent in developed markets. Operating profit and net income attributable to Kimberly-Clark were $2,991 and $2,157 in 2019, respectively. Diluted earnings per share were $6.24 in 2019 compared to $4.03 in 2018. The results in 2019 include net charges of $0.72 related to the 2018 global restructuring program and a net gain of $0.07 related to the sale of property associated with a former manufacturing facility that was closed as part of a past restructuring. The comparison was impacted by unfavorable currency effects, $145 of higher input costs, other manufacturing cost increases, increased advertising spending and higher selling, general and administrative costs.

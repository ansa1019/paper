During fiscal 2019, we achieved record net income of $1.617 billion, a 20.9% increase over the prior year, and sales growth of $642.7 million, a 5.7% increase over the prior year, driven by our initiatives aimed at improving our ability to meet customer demands and accelerate our commercial growth. Our business is impacted by various economic factors, including fuel costs and wage rates, which affect consumer spending and market dynamics. We believe fluctuations in gas prices impact our customers' level of disposable income, influencing their purchasing decisions. Our sales mix is significantly influenced by failure and maintenance-related categories, which represented approximately 85% of total sales, with regional weather patterns affecting demand. We anticipate that as the number of seven-year-old or older vehicles on the road increases, there will be a corresponding increase in demand for our products. We expect to increase investment in our business during fiscal 2020, focusing on new locations, supply chain infrastructure, enhancements to existing locations, and investments in technology. Our capital expenditures have decreased in recent years, but we continue to leverage our inventory purchases through extended payment terms from suppliers, which supports our operational flexibility and high accounts payable to inventory ratio. Our ability to effectively manage our technology resources and investments is crucial for maintaining competitive advantage and enhancing our operational efficiency. We have initiated strategic tests focused on increasing inventory availability, which has been supported by favorable vendor terms. Our investments in technology are expected to enhance our operational capabilities and improve our responsiveness to market changes. We maintain a strong focus on information management capability, ensuring the provision of accurate, timely, and reliable data to support decision-making processes. Our organizational capabilities are enhanced through the effective mobilization and deployment of IT resources, which are critical for transforming our business and achieving performance gains. We have made significant investments in our technology infrastructure to support our operational needs and improve customer relationships. Our strategic resource allocation is designed to optimize our performance outcomes and align with our long-term business strategy. We believe that our IT capabilities, including our ability to integrate technology into our operations, will play a vital role in driving future growth and maintaining our position as a leading retailer in the automotive parts industry. As we navigate regulatory changes and market uncertainties, our focus on enhancing our IT governance and capabilities will be essential for sustaining our competitive positioning and achieving business resilience.

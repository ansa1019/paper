We operate in two business segments: the upstream segment, which is engaged in the acquisition, development, exploration, and exploitation of unconventional, onshore oil and natural gas reserves, and the midstream operations segment, which focuses on ownership, operation, development, and acquisition of midstream infrastructure assets. Our upstream operations are primarily directed at the horizontal development of formations in the Midland and Delaware basins. We intend to continue to develop our reserves and increase production through development drilling and acquisitions that meet our strategic and financial objectives. Our midstream operations are supported by a network of gathering pipelines and metering facilities that service production from our assets. We have entered into multiple fee-based commercial agreements utilizing our infrastructure assets to provide essential services critical to our upstream operations. Our development program is focused entirely within the Permian basin, where we continue to focus on long-lateral multi-well pad development. We are operating multiple drilling rigs and intend to maintain operational flexibility in response to market conditions. Our capital budget for drilling, midstream, and infrastructure reflects our commitment to enhancing operational efficiency and supporting our strategic objectives. We regularly consider which capital resources are available to meet our future financial obligations and planned capital expenditure activities. Our cash flows are sensitive to market conditions, and we monitor commodity prices and overall market conditions to adjust our operational strategies accordingly. We have a stock repurchase program, which reflects our commitment to returning cash to stockholders while maintaining sufficient liquidity to fund our capital expenditure programs. We expect to drill and complete numerous gross horizontal wells in 2020, with a focus on low-cost operations and best-in-class execution. Our agreements with Rattler include substantial acreage dedications, and we utilize Rattler's infrastructure assets to enhance our operational capabilities. We are committed to improving our industry-leading cost structure and increasing environmental transparency. Our financial performance is influenced by fluctuations in commodity prices, which may impact our revenues and production capabilities. We utilize commodity derivative financial instruments to reduce our exposure to price fluctuations. Our liquidity and cash flow are supported by a combination of operating cash flows, borrowings under our revolving credit facility, and proceeds from public equity offerings. We continuously evaluate our capital expenditures in response to drilling activities, market conditions, and the availability of necessary resources. Our operational decisions are guided by the need to maintain compliance with financial covenants and to ensure the sustainability of our business model. The integration of our upstream and midstream operations is designed to enhance our overall operational effectiveness and to leverage our technological capabilities in support of our strategic goals.

During fiscal 2019, we reported strong financial results consistent with the continued execution of our long-term plans for our two strategic growth areas, digital media and digital experience, which are supported by our IT capabilities. Our digital media segment, which includes our subscription-based offering Creative Cloud, provides desktop tools, mobile apps, and cloud-based services that enable users to design, create, and publish rich content. Creative Cloud delivers value through deep, cross-product integration and cloud-enabled services, which enhance operational efficiency and facilitate collaboration across teams. Our digital experience segment offers comprehensive solutions that enable marketers to measure, personalize, and optimize marketing campaigns and digital experiences, thereby enhancing business performance. The integration of our digital media and digital experience capabilities allows us to provide an end-to-end workflow that supports customer relationships and improves market responsiveness.

We have made significant investments in research and development, which are critical for maintaining competitive advantage and ensuring timely development of new offerings. Our acquisitions of companies such as Marketo and Magento have further enhanced our technology resources and capabilities, enabling us to leverage strategic resources for improved organizational performance. The adoption of cloud services has transformed our business model, allowing for greater operational flexibility and the ability to respond rapidly to changing market dynamics.

The financial performance of our digital media and digital experience segments reflects the successful deployment of our IT capabilities, with total digital media annual recurring revenue (ARR) growing significantly due to increased user adoption and subscription revenue. Our digital experience revenue also increased, driven by subscription growth across our offerings, which underscores the importance of our technology functionalities in achieving business value. 

We recognize that our IT capabilities are essential for coordinating our assets and internal processes, facilitating interfirm transactions, and enhancing our overall competitive positioning. Our commitment to integrating cloud-based and on-premise features within our offerings exemplifies our focus on innovation and the deployment of IT resources to meet evolving business needs. The ability to provide data and information with appropriate levels of accuracy, timeliness, and security is a cornerstone of our information management capability, which supports our strategic decisions and enhances our operational effectiveness.

In summary, our IT capabilities, characterized by the mobilization and deployment of IT-based resources, have become a key driver of our transformation into a competitive force in the market. The integration of our digital media and digital experience solutions allows us to optimize marketing performance and create value for our customers, thereby reinforcing our organizational goals and enhancing our market agility.

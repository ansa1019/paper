Our IT capability has been evolving in scope to more comprehensively encompass the coordination of a firmâ€™s assets and internal processes and their interfirm transactions and relationships. The ability to acquire, deploy, combine, and reconfigure IT resources in support and enhancement of business strategies and work processes is critical. We focus on information management capability, which includes the ability to provide data and information to users with appropriate levels of accuracy, timeliness, reliability, security, confidentiality, connectivity, and access, and to tailor these in response to changing business needs and directions. Mobilizing and deploying IT-based resources in combination with leveraging the value of other resources and capabilities underscores the importance of IT capability. Our IT capabilities represent the application of physical or intangible IT resources such as technology, knowledge, practices, relationships, management skills, business process understanding, and human resources to further organizational goals. 

We continue to evaluate planned technology node transitions, capital spending, and re-use rates for NAND equipment, which reflects our commitment to advancing our IT infrastructure. Our investment in manufacturing technologies, facilities, and equipment is essential to support future growth, achieve operating efficiencies, and maintain product quality. The anticipated capital expenditures for property, plant, and equipment, focused on technology transitions and product enablement, highlight our strategic resource allocation decisions. We recognize that cash generated from operations is highly dependent on selling prices for our products, which can vary significantly from period to period, thus influencing our investment opportunities and operational flexibility.

The overall gross margin percentage has been affected by declines in average selling prices, which emphasizes the need for continuous improvement initiatives to reduce production costs. Our operational efficiency is further challenged by the underutilization of assets, which adversely impacts our gross margin. We anticipate the adverse impact of underutilization to increase, necessitating strategic management practices to optimize our resources and capabilities. 

We are also engaged in joint development agreements with partners, which enhance our technology capabilities and facilitate innovation partnerships. The ability to effectively support business needs through our IT capabilities has become a key factor in transforming our firm into a competitive force. Our ongoing assessments of market conditions and the need for strategic alignment with business strategies are critical to maintaining our competitive advantage. 

The integration of advanced technologies, including 3D NAND, reflects our commitment to innovation and operational excellence. We are continuously adapting our processes and technologies to meet evolving consumer demands and market dynamics, ensuring that we are well-positioned to respond to external influences and capitalize on emerging opportunities. Our focus on IT governance and resource mobilization is essential for achieving our organizational goals and enhancing our overall performance.

The ongoing development of our information technology capabilities is essential for maintaining our competitive advantage in the off-price retail sector. We have instituted "work from home" measures for many of our associates in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, which has disrupted our business operations and required us to adapt our IT systems to support remote work. Our financial condition and liquidity are closely monitored, particularly in light of the economic disruptions caused by the pandemic, which may necessitate further investments in technology to ensure operational flexibility and resilience. The ability to provide accurate, timely, and reliable information is critical for our decision-making processes, particularly during periods of uncertainty. Our strategic resource allocation includes investments in technology that facilitate improved business processes and enhance our overall organizational capabilities. We recognize the importance of information management in supporting our operational needs and enhancing our responsiveness to market dynamics. Our focus on technology deployment and integration is aimed at optimizing our operational efficiency and improving our performance metrics. The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the need for robust IT governance and effective management of our technology resources to navigate the challenges posed by external influences. As we continue to refine our business strategies, the alignment of our technology capabilities with our organizational goals remains a priority. The evolving nature of our IT capabilities underscores the necessity of mobilizing and deploying IT-based resources in conjunction with other strategic resources to drive business value and performance gains. Our ability to adapt to changing consumer demands and market conditions is supported by our investments in digital technologies and information systems, which enhance our operational agility and market responsiveness.

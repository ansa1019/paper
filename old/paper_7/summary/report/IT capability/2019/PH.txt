The company intends to meet its strategic objectives by successfully executing initiatives relating to engaged people, premier customer experience, profitable growth and financial performance, and by engineering innovative systems and products to provide superior customer value through improved service, efficiency and productivity. The company anticipates that cost savings realized from workforce reduction measures taken during 2019 will increase 2020 operating income by approximately two percent in both the diversified industrial North American and diversified industrial international operations. The company expects to continue to take actions necessary to structure appropriately the operations of the diversified industrial segment, which is expected to result in charges in 2020. The diversified industrial segment operations experienced changes in net sales, reflecting higher demand from distributors and end users in various markets, while operating margins increased primarily due to lower operating expenses resulting from prior-year business realignment and acquisition integration activities. The aerospace systems segment experienced higher sales due to increased volume in the commercial and military aftermarket businesses, with a favorable product mix resulting from higher aftermarket and OEM volume and profitability. The company’s ability to maintain and achieve anticipated benefits associated with announced realignment activities and strategic initiatives will be critical in navigating economic conditions within its markets. Increased cybersecurity threats and sophisticated computer crime pose challenges that the company must address to protect its operations and maintain customer trust. The company’s management capability in identifying acceptable strategic acquisition targets and effectively managing expanded operations from acquisitions will play a significant role in its future performance. The company’s investment choices, including the proposed acquisitions of Lord Corporation and Exotic Metals Forming Company, are expected to enhance its operational capabilities and market positioning. The company’s capital allocation initiatives, including share repurchases, are designed to maintain a strong financial position while pursuing growth opportunities. The company’s focus on innovation and technology management is essential for transforming its business processes and enhancing organizational effectiveness. The company’s strategic resource allocation and operational flexibility will be critical in responding to market dynamics and competitive actions. The company’s commitment to fostering a culture of empowerment through its values, inclusion and diversity, accountability and teamwork is expected to drive performance improvement and organizational agility. The company’s ability to implement successfully its capital allocation initiatives and manage costs related to insurance and employee benefits will impact its financial performance and operational efficiency. The company’s ongoing assessment of existing businesses and divestiture of those not considered a good long-term strategic fit will also influence its overall performance and strategic direction.

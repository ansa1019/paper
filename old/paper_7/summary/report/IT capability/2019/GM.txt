Management uses non-GAAP measures in its financial, investment, and operational decision-making processes, for internal reporting and as part of its forecasting and budgeting processes. These measures allow management and investors to view operating trends, perform analytical comparisons, and benchmark performance between periods and among geographic regions to understand operating performance without regard to items not considered a component of core operating performance. The strategic plan aims to transform GM into the world's most valued automotive company, which includes leading in technology and innovation, including electrification, autonomous vehicles, and data connectivity. The ability to deliver new products, services, and customer experiences in response to increased competition in the automotive industry is essential. The management team has adopted initiatives that anticipate redefining the future of personal mobility and advancing the vision of zero crashes, zero emissions, and zero congestion while strengthening the core business. The company faces continuing market, operating, and regulatory challenges due to weak economic conditions, competitive pressures, and evolving trade policy, necessitating strategic assessments of performance and the ability to achieve acceptable returns on invested capital. The transformation activities are expected to drive significant cost efficiencies and are part of a broader strategy to capitalize on future opportunities. The company continues to monitor and evaluate opportunities to strengthen its competitive position over the long term while maintaining a strong investment-grade balance sheet. The strategic decisions about the markets and products in which to invest and compete are critical for future growth. The ability to manage risks related to security breaches and disruptions to information technology systems is also highlighted as a significant concern. The company’s investment choices are influenced by the need to maintain operational flexibility and respond to market dynamics. The ongoing assessment of performance and the needs of the evolving business may require additional restructuring and rationalization actions. The company’s liquidity plans are subject to various risks and uncertainties, including those related to market conditions and operational performance. The strategic resource allocation is focused on reinvesting in the business at a target return on invested capital rate of 20% or greater, maintaining a strong balance sheet, and returning available cash to shareholders. The emphasis on technology capabilities and operational efficiency is critical for achieving business innovation and enhancing organizational performance. The company’s ability to leverage IT capabilities effectively supports business needs and enhances competitive advantage, which is essential in a rapidly changing market environment.

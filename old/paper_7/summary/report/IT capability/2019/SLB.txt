Schlumberger is continuing to scale-to-fit its organization and portfolio by repurposing or exiting underperforming business units, focusing on asset-light operations, and expanding its technology access business models. This strategic approach aims to promote margin expansion and improve returns in the North America land market. The company’s financial performance in 2019 was primarily driven by international markets, with full-year international revenue of $21.8 billion increasing 7% over 2018, reflecting increased activity from operators who continued to invest in longer-term resource development following a sustained period of underinvestment and declining production. In contrast, North American revenue fell sharply by 10% to $10.8 billion, largely due to land market weakness affecting the OneStim pressure pumping business, as customers reached their budget limits earlier in the year and remained highly disciplined on capital spending. Schlumberger's operational flexibility and strategic resource allocation are critical in navigating market dynamics, particularly as the company adapts to changes in consumer demands and competitive actions. The formation of the Sensia joint venture, which focuses on digital technologies and operational efficiencies, exemplifies Schlumberger's commitment to enhancing its IT capabilities to support business needs. The joint venture is expected to leverage technology functionalities and improve connectivity within the value chain, thereby fostering innovation partnerships and enhancing overall firm capabilities. Schlumberger's investment decisions are influenced by the need for operational efficiency and the management of technology resources, which are vital for maintaining competitive advantage in a rapidly evolving business environment. The company’s approach to information management capability emphasizes the provision of data and information to users with appropriate levels of accuracy, timeliness, reliability, and security, which are essential for informed decision-making. Schlumberger's focus on digital transformation and IT deployment is evident in its efforts to integrate advanced technologies into its operations, thereby enhancing organizational effectiveness and agility. The company's strategic management practices are designed to align its technology portfolio with business strategy, ensuring that IT investments contribute to performance gains and organizational goals. As Schlumberger navigates challenges such as regulatory uncertainty and environmental factors, its ability to mobilize and deploy IT-based resources in combination with other strategic resources will be crucial for sustaining long-term growth and enhancing business value. The emphasis on process optimization and the integration of IT systems into core business processes will further support Schlumberger's objectives of improving performance outcomes and maintaining market responsiveness.

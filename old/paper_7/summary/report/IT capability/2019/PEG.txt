PSEG's business consists of two reportable segments, focusing on operational excellence and disciplined investments to enhance reliability and resiliency of its transmission and distribution (T&D) systems. The company emphasizes the importance of mobilizing and deploying IT-based resources in combination with leveraging the value of other resources and capabilities. PSEG expects to invest between $11.5 billion to $15 billion over the five-year period ending December 31, 2024, driven by unapproved investment programs, including the Clean Energy Future (CEF) program and incremental reliability and resiliency investments. The CEF program includes significant investments in energy efficiency, electric vehicle infrastructure, energy storage, and smart meter installation, which are designed to align with public policy objectives and enhance operational performance. PSEG's strategy includes leveraging technology to improve system operation and address aging infrastructure while meeting environmental requirements. The company continues to invest in T&D infrastructure to maintain system integrity and grid reliability, which is critical for responding to market dynamics and regulatory changes. PSEG Power aims to improve performance and reduce costs to optimize cash flow generation from its fleet, enhancing its competitive position in light of low wholesale power and gas prices. The company’s operational flexibility allows it to capitalize on market opportunities, and its investments in efficient, clean, reliable generation assets are intended to support its strategic objectives. PSEG's financial strength is underpinned by a solid balance sheet and positive operating cash flow, which enables it to fund planned capital requirements and maintain investment-grade credit ratings. The emphasis on disciplined investment includes rigorous criteria for deploying capital in areas that complement existing business and provide reasonable risk-adjusted returns. The company actively engages with stakeholders on regulatory and legislative developments that impact its operations, advocating for policies that promote fair and efficient electricity markets. PSEG’s future success hinges on its ability to maintain strong operational and financial performance while navigating regulatory uncertainties and changing market conditions. The company continually assesses strategic options to maximize long-term stockholder value, including investments in capital improvements and participation in transmission projects. PSEG's commitment to enhancing its IT capabilities is evident in its focus on information management, ensuring that data and information are provided to users with appropriate levels of accuracy, timeliness, reliability, and security. The integration of technology into its operations is essential for achieving operational efficiency and supporting business transformation initiatives that align with organizational goals.

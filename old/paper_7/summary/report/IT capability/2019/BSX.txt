During the third quarter of 2019, we completed the acquisition of BTG plc, which included the integration of BTG's interventional medicine business into our peripheral interventions division. This acquisition is part of our strategic imperatives to drive global expansion and enhance our operational capabilities. We are committed to advancing medical technologies and investing in meaningful research and development projects across our businesses, which is essential for maintaining a pipeline of new products that contribute to profitable sales growth. Our endoscopy business develops and manufactures devices to diagnose and treat a broad range of gastrointestinal and pulmonary conditions with innovative, less invasive technologies. The operational net sales growth in our various segments reflects the effectiveness of our technology deployment and resource allocation strategies. We have increased our investment in infrastructure in emerging markets to maximize opportunities, which is indicative of our focus on market-based performance and operational flexibility. Our strategic management practices include leveraging technology capabilities and enhancing our internal processes to ensure efficient operations. The integration of BTG's technologies is expected to enhance our capabilities in treating peripheral arterial and venous diseases, as well as interventional oncology, thereby improving our competitive positioning in the market. We have established controls and procedures to escalate enterprise-level issues, including cybersecurity matters, to appropriate management levels, ensuring that we can manage potential risks effectively. Our commitment to information management capability is reflected in our ability to provide data and information to users with appropriate levels of accuracy, timeliness, reliability, security, and confidentiality. We believe that our IT capabilities, which encompass the coordination of our assets and internal processes, are crucial in transforming our firm into a competitive force. Our operational efficiency is further supported by our focus on process optimization and the strategic alignment of our technology infrastructure with our business strategies. The financial performance metrics indicate that our investments in IT resources and capabilities are yielding performance gains and enhancing our organizational effectiveness. We are continuously assessing our technology portfolio to ensure that we remain agile and responsive to market dynamics and consumer demands. The successful execution of our business strategies is contingent upon our ability to mobilize and deploy IT-based resources effectively, which is integral to our overall organizational transformation and value creation efforts.

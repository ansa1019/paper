The company has taken and continues to take robust actions to help ensure compliance with the terms of the order, which reflects its management capability in navigating complex regulatory environments. Our capabilities, particularly in space, missiles, missile defense, hypersonics, counter-hypersonics, low observable technology, and cyber, will allow us to continue to profitably grow our business in support of our customers' needs. The operating results of innovation systems subsequent to the merger date have been included in the company's consolidated financial results, indicating the importance of integrating IT capabilities into business strategies. We manage and assess our business based on our performance on contracts and programs, recognizing that changes in sales are generally described in terms of volume, while changes in margin rates are described in terms of performance and/or contract mix, highlighting the significance of operational efficiency and resource allocation. The discussion of results of operations focuses on our four segments, which reflect core capabilities, including technology deployment and innovation partnerships. The segment operating income increased, reflecting a full year of operating income from innovation systems, which underscores the strategic resource allocation and capability enhancement in our operations. Our financial measures, including non-GAAP financial measures, may be useful to investors and other users of our financial statements as supplemental measures in evaluating the company's underlying financial performance, presenting the company's operating results before the non-operational impact of pension and OPB actuarial gains and losses. The political environment, federal budget, and debt ceiling are expected to continue to be the subject of considerable debate, which could have significant impacts on defense spending broadly and the company's programs in particular, illustrating the external influences on our operational flexibility and market responsiveness. The company recognizes sales from our portfolio of long-term contracts as control is transferred to the customer, primarily over time on a cost-to-cost basis, which emphasizes the importance of information management capability in ensuring data accuracy and reliability. We assess our performance using certain financial measures that are not calculated in accordance with GAAP, which may not be defined and calculated by other companies in the same manner and should not be considered in isolation. The increase in sales reflects a full year of sales from innovation systems and higher sales at aerospace systems and mission systems, partially offset by lower sales at technology services, indicating the dynamic capabilities of our business segments. The company believes that its IT capabilities represent the application of physical or intangible IT resources such as technology, knowledge, practices, relationships, management skills, business process understanding, and human resources to further organizational goals, thereby enhancing overall firm performance. The assessment of our business performance is closely tied to our ability to leverage IT resources in support of business needs and strategic decisions, ensuring that we remain competitive in a rapidly evolving market environment.

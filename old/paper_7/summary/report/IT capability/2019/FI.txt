We are a leading global provider of financial services technology, providing account processing systems, electronic payments processing products and services, internet and mobile banking systems, and merchant transaction processing. Our operations are comprised of segments that include payments and financial institution services, which are essential for our clients to operate their businesses. The global payments landscape continues to evolve, with rapidly advancing technologies and a steady expansion of digital payments, e-commerce, and innovation in real-time payments infrastructure. Financial institutions are increasingly focused on modernizing their technology, utilizing data, and enhancing the customer experience to meet rising business and consumer expectations for convenience and security. This shift drives heightened interest in solutions that help financial institutions win and retain customers, generate incremental revenue, comply with regulations, and enhance operating efficiency. Our acquisition of First Data Corporation enhances our capabilities in providing technology solutions that support financial transactions and customer interactions, thereby transforming our service offerings and expanding our digital leadership. The integration of our products and services creates a compelling value proposition for our clients, providing new sources of revenue and opportunities to reduce costs. We anticipate that financial institutions will continue to invest significant capital and human resources to process transactions, manage information, maintain regulatory compliance, and offer innovative new services in this rapidly evolving and competitive environment. Our focus on long-term client relationships and recurring, transaction-oriented products and services has reduced the impact of consolidation in the financial services industry. We believe that economies of scale in developing and maintaining the infrastructure, technology, products, services, and networks necessary to be competitive are essential to justify investments in IT capabilities. The integration of payment solutions within software-as-a-service (SaaS) offerings has created numerous partnership opportunities, enabling us to leverage technology capabilities to enhance client relationships. Our strategic initiatives include enhancing operational effectiveness and differentiating our products and services through innovation. The ongoing transformation of our business processes is aimed at improving operational efficiency and aligning our technology infrastructure with evolving market demands. We expect to benefit from the trend of financial institutions moving from in-house technology to outsourced solutions, which will create revenue opportunities for us. As we continue to implement integration plans following our acquisition of First Data, we are focused on reducing costs and enhancing our overall technology capabilities to better serve our clients and adapt to market dynamics. The competitive landscape necessitates that we remain agile and responsive to changes in consumer demands and technological advancements, ensuring that our IT capabilities are aligned with our strategic goals and operational needs.

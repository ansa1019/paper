Our IT capability is critical in acquiring, deploying, combining, and reconfiguring IT resources to support and enhance our business strategies and work processes. We focus on our information management capability, which enables us to provide data and information to users with appropriate levels of accuracy, timeliness, reliability, security, confidentiality, connectivity, and access, while tailoring these in response to changing business needs and directions. The mobilization and deployment of IT-based resources, in conjunction with leveraging the value of other resources and capabilities, underscore the importance of our IT capability in transforming our firm into a competitive force. Our IT capabilities reflect the application of both physical and intangible IT resources, including technology, knowledge, practices, relationships, management skills, business process understanding, and human resources, to further our organizational goals. The introduction of our 7 nanometer product portfolio and the execution of our product roadmap in 2019, which included high-performance products for various market segments, demonstrate our commitment to innovation and operational efficiency.

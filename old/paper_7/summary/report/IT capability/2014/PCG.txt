The utility's ability to fund operations, finance capital expenditures, and make distributions is influenced by the levels of its operating cash flows and access to capital markets. The utility relies on equity contributions from PG&E Corporation and long-term senior unsecured debt issuances to maintain its capital structure, which consists of 52% equity and 48% debt and preferred stock. The utility's future equity needs will continue to be affected by costs that are not recoverable through rates, including costs related to natural gas matters, fines imposed in connection with pending investigations, and certain environmental remediation costs. The utility's operations are subject to extensive federal, state, and local laws and permits relating to the protection of the environment and the safety of personnel and the public. The utility's cash flows from operating activities are primarily driven by receipts from customers less payments of operating expenses. Future cash flow from operating activities will be affected by various factors, including the timing and outcome of ratemaking proceedings, the timing and amount of fines or penalties, and the timing and amount of pipeline-related costs incurred. The utility's investing activities primarily consist of construction of new and replacement facilities necessary to deliver safe and reliable electricity and natural gas services. The amount and timing of the utility's capital expenditures are affected by many factors such as regulatory approvals and the volume of new customer connections. The utility forecasts significant capital expenditures for the coming years, which are essential for maintaining and upgrading its infrastructure. The utility's financing activities are impacted by conditions in the capital markets and the maturity date of existing debt instruments. The utility's ability to access capital markets and the terms of future financings could be affected by the outcomes of various investigations and enforcement matters. The utility's information technology and operating systems, including advanced metering infrastructure and customer billing systems, must continue to function accurately while meeting regulatory requirements. The utility is also exposed to risks associated with cyber-attacks and must ensure that its security measures are sufficient to protect against unauthorized disclosures. The utility's financial condition and results of operations may be materially affected by the outcomes of investigations and enforcement actions related to its compliance with laws and regulations. The utility's ability to recover costs incurred in connection with third-party claims or litigation is also a significant factor in its financial performance. The utility's strategic management practices and governance contexts play a crucial role in navigating the regulatory landscape and maintaining operational efficiency. The ongoing need for investment in technology capabilities and infrastructure is essential for supporting the utility's business strategies and enhancing its competitive positioning in the market.

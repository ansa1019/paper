We are a diversified technology company that designs and develops software and engineered products and solutions for various niche end markets. Our acquisitions have represented both additions to existing businesses and new strategic platforms, emphasizing continuous improvement in operating performance. The application of critical accounting policies requires the use of estimates, assumptions, judgments, and interpretations that can affect reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses. Our management discusses areas requiring significant judgments with the audit committee, which reviews all financial disclosures in our annual filings. The preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles requires significant management capability and the mobilization of IT resources to enhance business strategies and work processes. Our IT capabilities support the coordination of assets and internal processes, facilitating interfirm transactions and relationships. The ability to provide data and information to users with appropriate levels of accuracy, timeliness, reliability, security, confidentiality, connectivity, and access is critical for responding to changing business needs. Our IT governance framework ensures that we effectively leverage technology resources to support operational efficiency and organizational effectiveness. We regularly evaluate our accounting estimates, particularly in areas such as accounts receivable collectibility and inventory valuation, which are influenced by economic conditions and business trends. The integration of technology capabilities into our business processes enhances our competitive advantage and market agility. We utilize the percentage-of-completion method for revenue recognition in long-term projects, which requires careful management of project costs and timelines. Our effective income tax rate is influenced by our operational decisions and the jurisdictions in which we operate, reflecting our strategic resource allocation. The fair value of our reporting units is assessed annually, requiring significant judgments related to forecasted operating results and economic projections. Our capital expenditures are expected to be between 1.0% and 1.5% of annual net sales, supporting our investment in technology infrastructure and business process optimization. We maintain compliance with debt covenants related to our credit facility, which limits our ability to incur new debt and make certain investments. Our organizational capabilities are enhanced through strategic management practices that focus on performance metrics and operational flexibility. The assessment of goodwill and intangible assets for impairment requires significant management judgment and is influenced by market conditions and operational performance. We expect our businesses to generate positive cash flows from operating activities, which will support our ongoing investment in IT capabilities and business transformation initiatives. The evaluation of our contractual cash obligations and commercial commitments reflects our commitment to managing financial resources effectively while pursuing growth opportunities.

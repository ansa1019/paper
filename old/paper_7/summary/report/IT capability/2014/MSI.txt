We are a leading global provider of mission-critical communication infrastructure, devices, accessories, software, and services. Our products and services help government, public safety, and commercial customers improve their operations through increased effectiveness, efficiency, and safety of their mobile workforces. We conduct our business globally and manage it by two segments: products and services. The products segment offers an extensive portfolio of infrastructure, devices, accessories, and software, primarily serving government, public safety, and first-responder agencies. The services segment provides a full set of service offerings for communication networks, including integration services, lifecycle support services, managed services, smart public safety solutions, and maintenance services. In 2014, we restructured our operations and financial profile to become a more focused, streamlined business, reducing operating expenses by more than $200 million compared to 2013. We shifted our offerings to align with technology trends, particularly as communication networks have become increasingly complex, software-centric, and data-driven. Our customers have shown interest in managed services, lifecycle support services, and smart public safety solutions, which help them manage, support, and upgrade their networks. We expect our overall revenue mix to continue to shift towards services over time. We have been proactively investing in next-generation public safety broadband solutions, believing that public safety LTE solutions are the next generation tool for our public safety first-responder customers. Our expertise in both public and private networks positions us uniquely to provide these LTE solutions. The services segment's backlog was $4.6 billion at December 31, 2014, reflecting demand for our software maintenance and hardware upgrade offerings. We expect to continue to see growing demand for our services as we help customers utilize features, applications, and data in new ways, including predictive policing and proactive support. Our investment in technology infrastructure is aimed at enhancing our operational efficiency and supporting our strategic resource allocation. We believe our IT capabilities, which encompass the coordination of our assets and internal processes, are crucial in transforming our firm into a competitive force. The integration of IT resources with our operational strategies enables us to leverage technology functionalities effectively, enhancing our ability to respond to market dynamics and customer needs. Our commitment to innovation and technology management is evident in our ongoing investments in R&D, which support our capability development and align with our business strategy. We continue to explore opportunities to transition our capital structure to reflect our ability to generate solid operating cash flow while prioritizing targeted investments in the business. We remain focused on optimizing our processes and enhancing our organizational capabilities to drive performance improvements and maintain our competitive positioning in the market.

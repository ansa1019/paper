In connection with the sale of our U.S. credit card receivables, we received cash of $5.7 billion during 2013, which included $2.7 billion in operating cash flow provided by continuing operations. Our segment operations are designed to enable guests to purchase products seamlessly in stores, online or through mobile devices, reflecting our focus on becoming a leading omnichannel retailer through investments in technology and supply chain. We expect approximately $2.1 billion of capital expenditures in 2015, which will support our technology investments and enhance our operational capabilities. Our capital expenditures related to information technology, distribution, and other areas were $1,306 million in 2014, reflecting our commitment to technology investments to support our omnichannel efforts and security enhancements. The decrease in 2014 capital expenditures was partially offset by technology investments, indicating a strategic resource allocation towards enhancing our IT capabilities. We recorded $191 million of pretax data breach-related expenses in 2014, which included an accrual for estimated probable losses for breach-related claims, emphasizing the importance of information security and management capabilities in our operations. Our effective income tax rate from continuing operations decreased to 33.0 percent in 2014, driven primarily by the net tax effect of our global sourcing operations and favorable resolution of various income tax matters. We monitor the percentage of sales that are paid for using our proprietary credit cards, as our internal analysis indicates that a meaningful portion of incremental purchases on these cards are also incremental sales for the company. The integration of digital channel sales, which grew by more than 30 percent in 2014, contributed significantly to our comparable sales growth, showcasing the impact of digital technologies on our market performance. Our SG&A expense rate was 19.9 percent in 2014, reflecting company-wide expense optimization efforts, partially offset by investments in technology and other initiatives. We believe that our exit from Canada will increase our after-tax cash flows beginning in 2015, as we continue to focus on enhancing our operational efficiency and market responsiveness. Our ability to access long-term debt and commercial paper markets has provided us with ample sources of liquidity, which is crucial for financing anticipated expansion and strategic initiatives. We believe that our sources of liquidity will continue to be adequate to maintain operations, fund obligations incurred as a result of our exit from Canada, and execute purchases under our share repurchase program. The recorded expenses include an accrual for the estimated probable loss related to claims that may be asserted against us, primarily under guarantees in certain leases, highlighting the need for effective risk management and strategic decision-making in our operations. Our investments in technology and supply chain are aimed at elevating our signature categories and improving customer value, which are essential for maintaining competitive advantage in a dynamic market environment.

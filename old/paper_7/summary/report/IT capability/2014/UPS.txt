The continued deployment of technology improvements, including several facility automation projects and the accelerated deployment of our on-road integrated optimization and navigation system, "ORION," should increase our network capacity and improve operational efficiency, flexibility, and reliability. We have continued to adjust our transportation network and utilize new or expanded operating facilities to improve time-in-transit for shipments in each region. We believe that these adjusted financial measures are important indicators of our recurring results of operations because they exclude items that may not be indicative of, or are unrelated to, our core operating results, and provide a better baseline for analyzing trends in our underlying businesses. Additionally, we have continued to undertake several initiatives to improve the flexibility and capacity in our delivery network, improve yield management, and increase operational efficiency and contain costs across all segments. We have continued to adjust our air and ground networks to better match higher volume levels, utilize technology to increase package sorting and delivery efficiency, and benefit from improved pick-up and delivery densities, particularly for our residential products. Our broad portfolio of product offerings and the flexibilities inherent in our transportation network have helped us adapt to changing trends. The increase in adjusted operating expenses was largely due to pick-up and delivery expenses and the costs associated with operating our linehaul network, which increased due to contractual wage increases, higher volume, and increased costs associated with outside contract and rail carriers. However, network cost increases were mitigated by reductions in average daily aircraft block hours as a result of ongoing modifications to our air network. We have made significant investments in technology resources, including information technology, to enhance our operational capabilities and improve our business processes. The anticipated benefits of these investments include improved operational efficiency and enhanced service levels, which are critical for maintaining competitive advantage in the market. Our investments in technology and infrastructure are expected to facilitate better resource allocation and enhance our ability to respond to market dynamics and consumer demands. The strategic alignment of our technology capabilities with our business objectives is essential for achieving operational excellence and driving performance improvements across our organization. Furthermore, we recognize the importance of leveraging our IT capabilities to support business needs and enhance our overall firm performance. The ongoing transformation of our IT architecture is designed to provide the necessary support for our evolving business strategies and operational requirements, ensuring that we remain agile and responsive to external influences and competitive actions in the marketplace.

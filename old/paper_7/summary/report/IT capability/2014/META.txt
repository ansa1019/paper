Management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations highlights that our IT capabilities have evolved to encompass the coordination of a firmâ€™s assets and internal processes as well as their interfirm transactions and relationships. The ability to acquire, deploy, combine, and reconfigure IT resources is crucial in supporting and enhancing business strategies and work processes. Our focus on information management capability emphasizes the provision of data and information to users with appropriate levels of accuracy, timeliness, reliability, security, confidentiality, connectivity, and access, tailored in response to changing business needs and directions. The mobilization and deployment of IT-based resources, in combination with leveraging the value of other resources and capabilities, underscore the importance of IT capability in transforming our firm into a competitive force. The application of physical or intangible IT resources, such as technology, knowledge, practices, relationships, management skills, and human resources, furthers our organizational goals. Trends in user metrics indicate that the growth in daily active users (DAUs) and monthly active users (MAUs) is driven by increased mobile usage, which affects our revenue and financial results by influencing the number of ads we are able to show and the value of our ads to marketers. The increase in mobile DAUs and MAUs reflects a shift in user engagement, which is critical for our advertising revenue growth. The operational expenses related to our data center and technical infrastructure, including the delivery and distribution of our products, are essential for maintaining our IT capabilities. Research and development expenses have significantly increased, reflecting our commitment to enhancing our technology capabilities and supporting our business innovation initiatives. Our marketing and sales expenses have also risen, driven by the need to support global sales, business development, and customer service functions, which are integral to our operational flexibility and market responsiveness. The strategic resource allocation towards technology infrastructure and the expansion of our data centers is necessary to support user growth and engagement, as well as the delivery of new products and services. We anticipate that our available funds, credit facilities, and cash flow from operations will be sufficient to meet our operational cash needs, which are influenced by our IT capabilities and investment decisions. The integration of our technology capabilities into our business processes is vital for achieving performance gains and maintaining competitive advantage in a rapidly evolving market landscape.

Visa is a global payments technology company that connects consumers, businesses, financial institutions, and governments to fast, secure, and reliable electronic payments. We facilitate global commerce through the transfer of value and information among financial institutions, merchants, consumers, businesses, and government entities. Our business performance reflects the impacts of overall economic conditions and consumer spending, with continued growth in underlying business drivers such as nominal payments volume and processed transactions. Investments in infrastructure, technology, and network processing are essential to support our global growth initiatives and enhance our competitive position. Operating expenses included continued investments in technology assets and infrastructure to support our digital solutions and core business initiatives. The increase in operating revenues mainly reflects continued growth in our underlying business drivers, including nominal payments volume and processed transactions. We believe that cash flow generated from operating activities will be more than sufficient to meet our ongoing operational needs, which are supported by our technology capabilities and infrastructure investments. Our financial institution clients rely on our technology resources for the delivery of Visa-branded payment products, and we continuously explore additional opportunities to enhance our competitive position by expanding the scope of payment solutions we provide. Our operating revenues are primarily generated from payments volume on Visa-branded cards and payment products for purchased goods and services, as well as the number of transactions processed on our network. We do not earn revenues from interest or fees paid by account holders on Visa-branded cards or payment products. Our acquiring clients are responsible for soliciting merchants and establishing fees. The growth in service revenues and data processing revenues is driven by increases in nominal payments volume and processed transactions. Our technology and processing network investments are crucial for supporting growth, and we expect to continue investing in technology assets to enhance our operational efficiency and organizational effectiveness. The effective management of our technology infrastructure and resources is vital for maintaining our competitive advantage in the market. We assess our liquidity position and potential sources of supplemental liquidity in view of our operating performance, current economic conditions, and other relevant circumstances. Our treasury policies provide guidelines for managing liquidity risk, ensuring timely completion of payments, and making planned capital investments in our business. We maintain a commercial paper program to support our working capital requirements and have entered into an unsecured revolving credit facility to enhance our liquidity. Our strategic resource allocation and investments in technology capabilities are designed to optimize our operational flexibility and market responsiveness. The ongoing transformation of our business processes and the integration of digital technologies are essential for aligning our operations with evolving market dynamics and consumer demands. We believe that our IT capabilities, which encompass the coordination of our assets and internal processes, will continue to play a critical role in driving our business performance and achieving our organizational goals.

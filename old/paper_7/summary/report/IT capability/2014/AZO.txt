We achieved strong performance in fiscal 2014, delivering record net income of $1.070 billion, a 5.2% increase over the prior year, and sales growth of $327.8 million, a 3.6% increase over the prior year. The increase in our commercial business is supported by our internal sales force and refined parts assortment. We continue to build our internal capabilities to respond to market dynamics and consumer demands. Our primary response to fluctuations in demand involves adjusting our advertising message, store staffing, and product quantities and assortment. We have closely studied our hub distribution model and store inventory levels, performing strategic tests to increase product availability and enhance operational efficiency. Our investments in information systems are planned to support these initiatives, reflecting our commitment to leveraging IT capabilities to enhance business performance. We reported a total auto parts sales increase of 3.1% for fiscal 2014, driven by domestic same-store sales growth. The improvement in gross margin was attributable to lower acquisition costs and lower shrink expense, partially offset by higher supply chain costs associated with current year inventory initiatives. Operating expenses increased primarily due to higher store payroll and planned information system investments. Our capital expenditures have increased as we focus on new-store development and enhancements to existing stores, which are integral to our strategy for operational flexibility and market agility. Our investments are expected to be directed primarily to our new-store development program, enhancements to existing stores and supply chain infrastructure. The ability to effectively support business needs through IT capability has become a key factor in transforming our firm into a competitive force. We believe that our IT investments will facilitate better decision-making speed and improve our information management capabilities. Our focus on technology resources and capabilities is essential for maintaining a competitive advantage in a challenging macro environment. We anticipate that our ability to mobilize and deploy IT-based resources will enhance our operational effectiveness and support our strategic resource allocation. Our financial activities reflect a commitment to investing in technology infrastructure that aligns with our organizational goals and enhances our capability to respond to market changes. We have also recognized the importance of maintaining information accuracy and reliability in our operations, which is critical for supporting customer relationships and enhancing business value. The strategic alignment of our IT systems with business processes is expected to contribute to performance gains and operational efficiency. We continue to evaluate our technology portfolio to ensure it meets our evolving business needs and supports our long-term objectives. Our management practices emphasize the integration of IT capabilities into our overall business strategy, ensuring that we remain responsive to external influences and competitive actions in the marketplace.

As part of our growth strategy, we invest in businesses in certain countries that carry high levels of risks such as China, Brazil, India, Mexico, Russia, and countries in the Middle East and Africa. Our financial performance depends, in large part, on varying conditions in the markets we serve, particularly the on-highway, construction, and general industrial markets. Demand in these markets tends to fluctuate in response to overall economic conditions. Our reportable operating segments consist of engine, distribution, components, and power generation, which are organized according to the products and markets each segment serves. The distribution segment includes wholly-owned and partially-owned distributorships engaged in wholesaling engines, generator sets, and service parts, as well as performing service and repair activities on our products and maintaining relationships with various OEMs throughout the world. Our operations are also affected by currency, political, economic, and regulatory matters, including the adoption and enforcement of environmental and emission standards in the countries we serve. We serve our customers through a network of approximately 600 company-owned and independent distributor locations and approximately 7,200 dealer locations in more than 190 countries and territories. Our financial performance is influenced by the ability to mobilize and deploy IT-based resources in combination with other resources and capabilities, which is essential in transforming a firm into a competitive force. The integration of technology resources and the effective management of information systems capability are critical for supporting business needs and enhancing operational efficiency. Our IT capabilities have evolved to encompass the coordination of a firmâ€™s assets and internal processes, as well as their interfirm transactions and relationships. The ability to provide data and information to users with appropriate levels of accuracy, timeliness, reliability, security, and access is vital for responding to changing business needs and directions. Furthermore, our strategic resource allocation and investment decisions are influenced by market dynamics and external influences that affect our operational flexibility and market agility. The consolidation of partially-owned North American distributors has improved our distribution segment revenues, highlighting the importance of leveraging technology capabilities to enhance business performance. Our investments in technology infrastructure and digital transformation initiatives are aimed at optimizing processes and improving performance outcomes. The ability to adapt to market restructuring and consumer demands through effective technology deployment and innovation partnerships is crucial for maintaining competitive advantage. The management of our technology portfolio and the alignment of IT governance with organizational goals are essential for maximizing business value and ensuring compliance with regulatory contexts.

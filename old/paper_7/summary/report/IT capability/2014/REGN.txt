We are a fully integrated biopharmaceutical company that discovers, invents, develops, manufactures, and commercializes medicines for the treatment of serious medical conditions. Our ability to continue to generate profits and positive cash flow from operations depends significantly on our continued success in commercializing our products, particularly eylea. The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are rapidly evolving and highly competitive, and new developments may render our products and technologies uncompetitive or obsolete. Our operating results may fluctuate based on net sales of marketed products, the scope and progress of research and development efforts, and the continuation of collaborations with partners such as sanofi and bayer healthcare. We expect to incur substantial expenses related to our research and development activities, a significant portion of which we expect to be reimbursed by our collaborators. Our research and development expenses increased significantly, reflecting our commitment to expanding our capabilities and addressing business needs. The planning, execution, and results of our clinical programs are significant factors that can affect our operating and financial results. We utilize external entities such as clinical research organizations to assist with the execution of our clinical studies, which is essential for maintaining operational efficiency and managing costs. Our collaborations with sanofi and bayer healthcare involve sharing development expenses and profits, which necessitates effective resource allocation and strategic management practices. The development of new medicines entails significant risk and expense, and our ability to successfully commercialize product candidates is contingent upon overcoming numerous hurdles, including regulatory approvals. We have 17 product candidates in clinical development, all of which were discovered in our research laboratories, underscoring our investment in innovation and technology capabilities. Our collaboration agreements require us to deliver various rights, services, and goods across the entire life cycle of a product or product candidate, which emphasizes the importance of information management capability and operational flexibility. The integration of technology resources is critical for enhancing our business strategies and work processes, particularly in the context of rapidly changing market dynamics and consumer demands. Our strategic resource allocation and management capabilities are vital in navigating the complexities of the biotechnology landscape, ensuring that we remain competitive and responsive to market opportunities. We maintain exclusive rights to eylea in the United States and are entitled to all profits from such sales, which reflects our commitment to leveraging our IT capabilities to support business innovation and transformation. Our financial performance is influenced by various factors, including the success of our research and development programs, the competitive landscape, and the regulatory environment, all of which require robust information technology governance and management practices. The evolving nature of our IT capabilities is essential for coordinating our assets and internal processes, as well as managing interfirm transactions and relationships effectively.

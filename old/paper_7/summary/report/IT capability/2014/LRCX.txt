The semiconductor capital equipment industry has been highly competitive and subject to business cycles characterized by rapid changes in demand. Demand for products increased steadily throughout fiscal year 2014 as semiconductor device manufacturers made capacity and technology investments. Technology inflections have led to an increase in the deposition, etch, and clean market size, contributing to increased revenue. The increase in gross margin as a percentage of revenue for fiscal year 2014 compared to fiscal year 2013 was due to higher business volumes as well as a more favorable product mix. Additionally, we continued to make significant research and development investments focused on leading-edge deposition, plasma etch, single-wafer clean, and other semiconductor manufacturing requirements. The increase in R&D expense during fiscal year 2014 was primarily due to a rise in salaries and benefits related to higher headcount and higher incentive and equity compensation. The increase in SG&A expense during fiscal year 2014 was due primarily to a net increase in salaries, benefits, and incentive compensation, as well as increases in marketing expenses and outside services. Our cash flows from operating activities were significantly influenced by net income and non-cash charges, highlighting the importance of operational efficiency in supporting our business strategies. The liquidity position, characterized by substantial cash balances, is critical for sustaining levels of investment in R&D and capital infrastructure, which are essential for maintaining competitive advantage. The evaluation of the realizability of deferred tax assets is dependent on future taxable income, underscoring the need for effective resource management and strategic decision-making. The integration of acquired entities, such as Novellus, has provided opportunities for revenue growth and cost synergies, enhancing our operational capabilities. The anticipated future revenue value from shipments to customers reflects our strategic alignment with market demands and technology advancements. Our organizational capabilities are further supported by effective management practices and the mobilization of IT-based resources, which are essential for transforming business processes and enhancing firm performance. The competitive landscape necessitates agility in responding to market dynamics, which is facilitated by our investments in technology infrastructure and innovation partnerships. The assessment of goodwill and intangible assets requires significant judgment, reflecting the inherent uncertainties in estimating future cash flows and market conditions. The ongoing evaluation of uncertain tax positions and the impact of regulatory changes on our financial performance highlight the complexities of our operational environment. Overall, our strategic resource allocation and investment decisions are critical for achieving long-term business value and maintaining market responsiveness in a rapidly evolving industry.

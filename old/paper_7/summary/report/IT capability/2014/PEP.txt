Our management monitors a variety of key indicators to evaluate our business results and financial condition, including innovation and organizational health. Digital technology continues to change the retail landscape and the way in which we interact with retailers, shoppers, and consumers. To help retailers navigate this changing landscape and to build relationships with consumers through emerging channels, we plan on increasing our e-commerce presence, developing tailored customer strategies, and utilizing the size and scale of our distribution system. We also intend to focus on productivity and lowering the cost base of the company over the long term by utilizing our global scale, eliminating duplication, deploying new technologies, and capitalizing on everyday opportunities to lower our cost base. Our multi-year productivity programs delivered over $1 billion in productivity savings in 2014 and are expected to extend annual savings of $1 billion from 2015 through 2019, focusing on increasing automation in our operations to reduce costs and increase capacity, expanding shared services, and restructuring our go-to-market systems to optimize our distribution network. We expect the demand for finite natural resources to continue to rise as the global population grows, prompting us to develop and deploy innovative ways to conserve and replenish water, reduce energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions, and promote sustainable agriculture. Our commitment to performance with purpose means providing a wide range of beverages, foods, and snacks while finding innovative ways to minimize our impact on the environment and reduce our operating costs. We engage in a variety of research and development activities to drive innovation globally, including the development of new ingredients and products, improvements in manufacturing processes, and efforts focused on identifying opportunities to transform and broaden our product portfolio. Our investment strategy includes the use of actively managed securities, and we regularly review our actual investment allocations to ensure they align with our long-term return expectations. We are exposed to market risks arising from adverse changes in commodity prices, foreign exchange rates, and interest rates, which we manage through productivity initiatives, global purchasing programs, and hedging. Our hedging strategies include the use of derivatives, which are classified as operating activities in the consolidated statement of cash flows and are designed to mitigate risks associated with commodity price fluctuations. The effectiveness of our hedging instruments is assessed regularly, and we do not use derivatives for trading or speculative purposes. Our IT capabilities have evolved to encompass the coordination of a firmâ€™s assets and internal processes, and we leverage technology resources to enhance business strategies and work processes. We focus on information management capability, ensuring that we provide data and information to users with appropriate levels of accuracy, timeliness, reliability, security, and access, tailoring these in response to changing business needs. Our IT governance framework supports our strategic resource allocation and capability leverage, enabling us to respond effectively to market dynamics and competitive actions.

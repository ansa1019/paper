Our primary ongoing cash requirements are for merchandise inventory purchases, payroll, rent, taxes, and capital expenditures in connection with new and existing stores, and investments in distribution centers, information systems, and buying and corporate offices. We continually evaluate opportunistic real estate acquisitions and opportunities for potential new store locations. Our capital expenditures include costs to build or expand distribution centers, open new stores and improve existing stores, and for various other expenditures related to our information technology systems, buying, and corporate offices. We are forecasting approximately $450 million in capital expenditures for fiscal year 2015 to fund costs for fixtures and leasehold improvements to open new Ross and dd's discounts stores, the upgrade or relocation of existing stores, investments in information technology systems, and for various other expenditures related to our stores, distribution centers, buying and corporate offices. We also evaluate our current store locations and determine store closures based on similar criteria. Our strategies and store expansion program contributed to sales gains in fiscal 2014, 2013, and 2012. We refer to our fiscal years ended January 31, 2015, February 1, 2014, and February 2, 2013 as fiscal 2014, fiscal 2013, and fiscal 2012, respectively. We cannot be sure that the gross profit margins realized in fiscal 2014, 2013, and 2012 will continue in future years. The largest component of selling, general and administrative expenses is payroll. The total number of employees, including both full and part-time, as of fiscal year end 2014, 2013, and 2012 was approximately 71,400, 66,300, and 57,500, respectively. We regularly review the age and condition of our merchandise and are able to maintain current merchandise inventory in our stores through replenishment processes and liquidation of slower-moving merchandise through clearance markdowns. Our capital expenditures over the last three years include significant investments in information systems. We opened 95, 88, and 82 new stores in fiscal 2014, 2013, and 2012, respectively. Our effective tax rate for fiscal 2014, 2013, and 2012 was approximately 38% in each year, which represents the applicable combined federal and state statutory rates reduced by the federal benefit of state taxes deductible on federal returns. We anticipate that our effective tax rate for fiscal 2015 will be between 37% and 38%. Our existing $600 million unsecured revolving credit facility expires in June 2017 and contains a $300 million sublimit for issuance of standby letters of credit. We expect to primarily fund capital expenditures with available cash and cash flows from operations. We had no purchases of investments in fiscal 2014 and purchases of $12.0 million and $5.4 million in fiscal 2013 and fiscal 2012, respectively. We had proceeds from investments of $12.0 million, $1.6 million, and $6.2 million in fiscal 2014, 2013, and 2012, respectively. Our primary sources of funds for our business activities are cash flows from operations and short-term trade credit. We regularly review the adequacy of credit available to us from all sources and expect to be able to maintain adequate trade credit, bank lines, and other credit sources to meet our capital and liquidity requirements, including lease payment obligations, in 2015. We cannot be sure that our strategies will result in a continuation of sales growth or in an increase in net earnings.

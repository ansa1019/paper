Visa is a global payments technology company that facilitates digital payments across a global network of consumers, merchants, financial institutions, businesses, strategic partners, and government entities through innovative technologies. Our advanced transaction processing network, Visanet, enables authorization, clearing, and settlement of payment transactions and allows us to provide our financial institution and merchant clients a wide range of products, platforms, and value-added services. We continue to evaluate the nature and extent of the impact of COVID-19 on our business, which has affected our revenues due to declines in volumes and transactions. Our total operating expenses for fiscal 2020 were driven by ongoing investments in support of our strategy for future growth, including higher personnel and depreciation and amortization expenses. We have been actively investing in technology assets and payments system infrastructure to support our digital solutions and core business initiatives. Our investment portfolio is designed to invest cash in securities that enable us to meet our working capital and liquidity needs, and we maintain a commercial paper program to support our working capital requirements and for other general corporate purposes. We have established policies and control procedures to ensure that estimates and assumptions regarding our operations and investments are appropriately governed and applied consistently. Our liquidity management includes assessing cash requirements for current operations, commitments, development activities, and capital expenditures, with a focus on providing adequate liquidity to cover operating expenditures and ensuring timely completion of payments settlement activities. We have entered into long-term incentive agreements with financial institution clients, merchants, and other business partners for various programs designed to increase revenue by growing payments volume, increasing Visa product acceptance, and driving innovation. The ongoing shift to electronic payments reflects our commitment to enhancing our technology capabilities and operational efficiency. Our strategic resource allocation and investment decisions are aimed at leveraging our technology resources to support business transformation and improve organizational performance. The competitive landscape necessitates that we continue to innovate and adapt our technology infrastructure to meet evolving market demands and consumer preferences. Our technology deployment strategies are integral to achieving operational flexibility and enhancing our business processes. We recognize the importance of mobilizing and deploying IT-based resources in combination with leveraging the value of other capabilities to transform Visa into a competitive force. Our focus on information management capability underscores our ability to provide data and information to users with appropriate levels of accuracy, timeliness, reliability, security, and access, tailored to respond to changing business needs and directions. We will continue to assess our liquidity position and potential sources of supplemental liquidity in light of our operating performance, current economic conditions, and other relevant circumstances, ensuring that we remain agile and responsive to market dynamics.

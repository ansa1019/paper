In fiscal 2020, we implemented operational protocols to comply with health and safety standards, which included leveraging technology to facilitate communication and operational efficiency. Our strategy focuses on enhancing long-term value to shareholders by leveraging our financial and competitive position in our core homebuilding business, which involves managing risk and maintaining financial flexibility to navigate changing economic conditions and make opportunistic strategic investments. We have made operational adjustments as a result of COVID-19; however, our strategy remains consistent and includes developing and retaining highly experienced and productive teams of personnel that are aligned and focused on continuous improvement in operational execution and financial performance. We are committed to managing our inventory of homes under construction relative to demand in each of our markets, including starting construction on unsold homes to capture new home demand and actively controlling the number of unsold, completed homes in inventory, which reflects our operational flexibility and responsiveness to market dynamics. Additionally, we believe our strong balance sheet and liquidity position provide us with the flexibility to operate effectively through changing economic conditions, which is critical for maintaining competitive advantage. Our financial services operations have also benefited from technology advances, which increased efficiencies and allowed us to better serve our homebuyers, as evidenced by a significant increase in the percentage of homes financed through our mortgage operations. We aim to optimize returns on our inventory investments and adjust to local market conditions and new home demand through strategic resource allocation and management capabilities. The increase in demand in the second half of the year was fueled by lower interest rates on mortgage loans and the limited supply of homes at affordable price points, which necessitated a focus on actionable investments and operational efficiency. Our homebuilding segment's inventories and land positions are managed relative to demand, and we continually evaluate our land and lot supply, which is crucial for maintaining our competitive positioning in the market. We also recognize the importance of mobilizing and deploying IT-based resources in combination with leveraging the value of other resources and capabilities to support our business strategies and enhance our operational effectiveness. The integration of technology into our operations is essential for improving our performance metrics and achieving our organizational goals, particularly in the context of evolving market conditions and consumer demands. As we navigate the uncertainties presented by the pandemic, our focus remains on maintaining operational efficiency, enhancing our IT capabilities, and ensuring that our strategic management practices align with our long-term objectives for growth and profitability.

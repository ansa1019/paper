The ongoing deployment of 5G technology is critical for meeting the demand for video and internet access, necessitating significant investment in infrastructure and technology capabilities.

The company is also transitioning its hardware-based network technology to more efficient software-based technology, which is expected to enhance operational flexibility and reduce costs. 

The Warnermedia segment has experienced revenue declines due to pandemic-related postponements of theatrical releases and production delays, but growth in international revenues and domestic HBO Max subscribers has partially offset these declines.

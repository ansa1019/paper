The company emphasizes operational performance while developing opportunities in both competitive and regulated businesses. PSEG continues to invest in transmission infrastructure to maintain and enhance system integrity and grid reliability, leveraging technology to improve the operation of the system. The planned capital spending for transmission in 2021-2023 is $2.5 billion, aimed at addressing an aging transmission infrastructure and meeting growing demand. PSEG's investments have altered its business mix to reflect a higher percentage of earnings contribution by PSE&G, which is focused on enhancing reliability and resiliency of its transmission and distribution system. The company expects to invest between $13 billion to $15 billion over the five-year period ending December 31, 2025, to modernize and improve reliability and clean energy investments. PSEG's strategic initiatives include disciplined investments in areas that complement its existing business and provide reasonable risk-adjusted returns. The ongoing coronavirus pandemic has led to a reduction in demand from commercial and industrial customers, partially offset by increases in residential demand, impacting cash inflow and accounts receivable aging. PSEG has implemented enhanced safety actions to protect employees and customers while ensuring reliable service. The company is exploring strategic alternatives for PSEG Power's non-nuclear generating fleet, which is expected to reduce overall business risk and earnings volatility. PSEG Power has sought operational excellence and cost management to optimize cash flow generation from its fleet in light of low wholesale power and gas prices. The companyâ€™s hedging practices help manage volatility in the merchant power business. PSEG's focus on operational excellence, financial strength, and disciplined investment has provided a base for executing strategic initiatives. The company continues to assess and optimize its business mix, including investments in clean energy and infrastructure modernization, to meet the growing needs and expectations of customers. PSEG's future success will depend on its ability to maintain strong operational and financial performance, capitalize on regulatory developments, and respond to environmental, social, and governance matters, which are integral to its long-term strategy. The company actively engages with stakeholders on significant regulatory and legislative developments that impact its business, advocating for policies that promote fair and efficient electricity markets. PSEG's investments in technology and infrastructure are designed to enhance operational efficiency, support business strategies, and align with sustainability goals, ultimately driving performance improvements and value creation.

The institutional advancement program is intended to enhance our institutional sales and service structure and allow the sales team to capture share and penetration while maximizing service effectiveness by leveraging our ongoing investments in digital technology. We have formally commenced a restructuring plan, accelerate 2020, to leverage technology and system investments and organizational changes, aiming to further simplify and automate processes and tasks, reduce complexity and management layers, consolidate facilities, and focus on key long-term growth areas by further leveraging technology and structural improvements. Our restructuring activities are associated with plans to enhance our efficiency, effectiveness, and sharpen the competitiveness of our businesses, which include significant actions involving employee-related severance charges, contract termination costs, and asset write-downs and disposals. We expect total program savings of approximately $50 million by the end of 2024 from the institutional plan. The costs are expected to be primarily cash expenditures for severance and facility closures, with actual costs varying depending on actions taken. Our restructuring plan has delivered $200 million of cumulative cost savings with estimated annual cost savings of $315 million by 2022. The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic has necessitated adjustments in our operational strategies, including reductions in capital expenditures and other ongoing cost initiatives, while we anticipate our 2021 results of operations to be generally comparable to 2019. We have taken steps to drive revenue growth through new products, programs, and markets, as well as to reduce costs. Our strategic resource allocation and management practices are designed to support our long-term growth and operational flexibility. We continue to evaluate our cash position in light of future developments, with a focus on maintaining strong cash flow to fund ongoing operations, acquisitions, investments, and return cash to shareholders. Our investments in technology and digital infrastructure are critical to enhancing our operational efficiency and effectiveness, enabling us to respond to market dynamics and competitive pressures. We believe that our ongoing investments in digital technology will enhance our capability to support business needs and transform our firm into a competitive force. The restructuring activities are expected to optimize our organizational capabilities and improve our market responsiveness. We have established various joint ventures to meet local ownership requirements and expand our ability to provide customers with a more fully integrated offering, which reflects our commitment to leveraging technology and strategic resources to enhance our competitive positioning. The integration of technology into our business processes is essential for driving performance gains and achieving operational excellence. Our focus on capability development and resource mobilization will enable us to adapt to changing market conditions and consumer demands, ensuring that we remain agile and responsive to external influences.

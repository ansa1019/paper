The pandemic caused by the novel strain of the coronavirus (COVID-19) has resulted in government authorities implementing numerous measures, impacting our workforce and operations, as well as those of our customers and respective vendors and suppliers. We have significant operations worldwide, and disruptions at some of our manufacturing operations and facilities have occurred. Our strategy and long-term contingency planning have positioned us well to weather the current uncertainty, emphasizing the importance of mobilizing and deploying IT-based resources in combination with leveraging the value of other resources and capabilities. We believe that a continued commitment to research and development is essential to maintain product leadership with our existing products and to provide innovative new product offerings, which are critical to our future growth. We expect to continue to make significant research and development investments in the future, which will support our business innovation efforts and enhance our operational efficiency. The degree to which COVID-19 impacts our business, financial condition, and results of operations will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain. Our cash and cash equivalents consist of highly liquid investments, and we believe that our existing sources of liquidity and cash expected to be generated from future operations will be sufficient to fund operations, capital expenditures, research and development efforts, and transaction costs associated with our proposed acquisition of Maxim Integrated Products, Inc. We monitor global macroeconomic conditions and continue to assess opportunities for improved operational effectiveness and efficiency, as well as better alignment of expenses with revenues. We have undertaken various restructuring actions to better align our global workforce with our long-term strategic plan. The adoption of new accounting pronouncements, such as ASU 2016-02 regarding leases, reflects our commitment to maintaining compliance and adapting our financial practices to enhance operational flexibility. Our effective management of information technology resources is crucial for supporting business needs and enhancing our capabilities in data management, which is vital for decision-making speed and information accuracy. The integration of technology capabilities into our operational processes is essential for achieving competitive advantage and improving our overall firm performance. We recognize the importance of aligning our business strategy with our technological investments to ensure market responsiveness and agility in our operations. Our ongoing commitment to innovation partnerships and strategic resource allocation will further enhance our organizational capabilities and support our long-term growth objectives. The strategic management of our technology infrastructure and the optimization of our business processes are key components in our efforts to create value and improve performance outcomes. As we navigate the challenges posed by the current business environment, our focus on IT capability development will remain a priority, enabling us to adapt to changing market dynamics and consumer demands effectively.

We operate in two operating segments: the upstream segment, which is engaged in the acquisition, development, exploration, and exploitation of unconventional, onshore oil and natural gas reserves, and the midstream operations segment, which is focused on ownership, operation, development, and acquisition of midstream infrastructure assets. Our activities are primarily directed at the horizontal development of formations in the Midland and Delaware basins. We intend to continue to develop our reserves and increase production through development drilling and exploitation activities on our multi-year inventory of identified potential drilling locations. In response to recent volatility in commodity prices, many producers have reduced their capital expenditure budgets, which may limit our access to capital or increase our cost of capital. Our business strategy includes a focus on low-cost operations and best-in-class execution, which is critical for maintaining operational efficiency and improving financial performance. We have implemented new and more efficient drilling and completion methodologies to control well costs and enhance capital efficiency. Our operational cash flow is sensitive to many variables, including the volatility of prices for oil and natural gas, which are influenced by regional and worldwide economic activity. The dynamic nature of these events affects our ability to navigate industry challenges and maintain production levels. We expect to focus development on our most productive areas, which will enhance our operational flexibility and market agility. We have entered into multiple fee-based commercial agreements with our subsidiary, Rattler, utilizing its infrastructure assets to provide essential services critical to our upstream operations. The completion of our pending merger with QEP Resources is expected to enhance our ability to generate free cash flow and realize significant annual synergies. Our capital expenditures are largely discretionary and can be adjusted based on market conditions, the success of our drilling activities, and other external influences. We continuously monitor and adjust our projected capital expenditures in response to changes in commodity prices, availability of financing, and overall market conditions. Our 2021 capital budget reflects a decrease from prior years, with a focus on drilling and completing horizontal wells while maintaining a disciplined approach to capital allocation. The integration of our IT capabilities is essential for supporting business needs and enhancing operational efficiency, enabling us to leverage technology resources effectively in our strategic decision-making processes. Our commitment to environmental responsibility and governance performance is underscored by our initiatives aimed at reducing greenhouse gas intensity and enhancing transparency. The ability to mobilize and deploy IT-based resources in combination with other capabilities is vital for transforming our firm into a competitive force in the market. We recognize that our IT governance and management practices play a crucial role in supporting our operational and strategic objectives, ensuring that we remain responsive to changing business needs and market dynamics.

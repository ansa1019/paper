We are a global leader in healthcare supply chain management solutions, retail pharmacy, community oncology and specialty care, and healthcare information solutions. We partner with life sciences companies, manufacturers, providers, pharmacies, governments, and other healthcare organizations to help provide the right medicines, medical products, and healthcare services to the right patients at the right time, safely, and cost-effectively. Our organizational structure includes corporate functions associated with administrative functions and projects, and the results of certain investments. We evaluate the performance of our operating segments on various measures, including revenues and operating profit before interest expense and income taxes. Our U.S. pharmaceutical segment continues to distribute branded, generic, specialty, biosimilar, and over-the-counter pharmaceutical drugs and other healthcare-related products, providing practice management, technology, clinical support, and business solutions to community-based oncology and other specialty practices. We support the U.S. government as a centralized distributor of COVID-19 vaccines and ancillary supplies needed to administer vaccines, utilizing our expertise and capabilities to manage the assembly and distribution of ancillary supply kits. We have implemented various responses to mitigate the impact of COVID-19 on our business operations, including telecommuting and work-from-home policies, which did not materially affect our internal control over financial reporting. Our technology resources and capabilities have evolved to encompass the coordination of our assets and internal processes, enhancing our operational flexibility and supporting our business strategies. The demand for COVID-19 tests and related products has contributed significantly to our revenues, particularly in our medical-surgical solutions segment. We continue to monitor the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on our supply chain and have established a critical care drug task force to secure additional products where available. Our investment decisions and strategic resource allocation are guided by the need to adapt to changing market conditions and consumer demands. The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the importance of our IT capabilities in managing operational efficiency and supporting business transformation efforts. We have made substantial investments in technology infrastructure to enhance our information management capabilities, ensuring the timely and accurate provision of data and information to users. Our organizational capabilities are aligned with our strategic goals, enabling us to respond effectively to market dynamics and external influences. The ongoing evaluation of our technology portfolio and the integration of digital solutions are critical to maintaining our competitive advantage in the healthcare industry. We are committed to leveraging our IT resources to optimize our business processes and enhance our overall performance. Our approach to governance and compliance reflects our dedication to maintaining high standards in information security and operational integrity. The challenges posed by the current regulatory context require us to remain agile and responsive to emerging opportunities and risks within the healthcare landscape.

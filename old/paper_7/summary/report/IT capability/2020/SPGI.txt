We are a leading provider of transparent and independent ratings, benchmarks, analytics, and data to the capital and commodity markets worldwide. Our operations consist of four reportable segments: S&P Global Ratings, S&P Global Market Intelligence, S&P Global Platts, and S&P Dow Jones Indices. Market Intelligence is a global provider of multi-asset-class data, research, and analytical capabilities, which integrate cross-asset analytics and desktop services. Our strategy focuses on delivering an exceptional, differentiated customer experience by enhancing foundational capabilities, evolving core businesses, and pursuing growth via adjacencies. We aim to improve end-user productivity and experience by providing employees with the tools and processes to better serve customers, while advancing our risk culture by maturing risk management and compliance processes and our cybersecurity posture. We are closely monitoring the impact of the outbreak of COVID-19 on all aspects of our business, and while it did not have a material adverse effect on our reported results for the year ended December 31, 2020, we are unable to predict the ultimate impact it may have on our business, future results of operations, financial position, or cash flows. Our technology-related expenses allocation methodology was changed to more accurately reflect each segment's respective usage. We have made significant investments in technology, including the acquisition of Kensho Technologies, which provides next-generation analytics, artificial intelligence, machine learning, and data visualization systems. Our technology investments are aimed at enhancing our capabilities in data management, analytics, and customer relationship management. The integration of technology into our operations is essential for maintaining competitive advantage and responding to market dynamics. Our revenue growth at Market Intelligence was driven by annualized contract value growth in desktop products, credit risk solutions, and data management solutions. The revenue increase at S&P Global Ratings was primarily driven by higher corporate bond ratings revenue. We are committed to advancing our shared data processes and technical capabilities, as well as utilizing innovation teams to enhance our service offerings. Our operational efficiency is supported by the deployment of technology resources that facilitate improved customer engagement and operational flexibility. We continue to focus on developing key product offerings in growth areas such as ESG and leveraging technology investments to enhance our service delivery. Our strategic priorities include funding organic opportunities, pursuing disciplined acquisitions, and enhancing our technology infrastructure to support our growth objectives. The competitive landscape necessitates a strong emphasis on innovation partnerships and strategic resource allocation to optimize performance outcomes and ensure market responsiveness. We believe that our IT capabilities, encompassing the coordination of our assets and internal processes, are critical to transforming our firm into a competitive force in the market.

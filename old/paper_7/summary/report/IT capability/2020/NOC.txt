On December 7, 2020, the company entered into a definitive agreement to sell its IT and mission support services business for $3.4 billion in cash, which comprised the majority of the information solutions and services division of defense systems, select cyber, intelligence and missions support programs, and the space technical services business unit of space systems. The assets and liabilities of the IT and mission support services business were classified as held for sale in the consolidated statement of financial position as of December 31, 2020. The company has taken robust actions to ensure compliance with regulatory requirements and has provided information in response to inquiries regarding compliance with orders related to its operations. The company has expanded IT and communication support to enhance employee productivity during the COVID-19 pandemic, requiring or enabling employees to work from home or remotely where practicable. The company has also adjusted workspaces and shift schedules to facilitate social distancing for employees who continue to work in facilities. The company has implemented health checks and visitor protocols, restricted travel, and provided additional benefits to employees, including those most at risk. The company has contributed financial and manufacturing resources to support critical national requirements, including personal protective equipment. The company's leadership and crisis management teams continue to monitor developments related to COVID-19 and its impact on employees, customers, suppliers, and communities. The company has experienced various increased costs to maintain operations due to actions taken to protect employee health and safety, illness, quarantines, and absenteeism, while also experiencing lower costs related to employee travel and some health benefits. The company's overall revenue and operating income were not significantly impacted by COVID-19, although the company and its stakeholders face challenges. The company recognizes that its capabilities, particularly in space, missiles, and mission systems, should help customers meet threats and allow for long-term profitable growth. The company manages and assesses its business based on performance on contracts and programs, focusing on total contract cost as the key driver of sales and operating income. The company evaluates operating performance primarily based on changes in sales and operating income, with significant fluctuations attributed to individual contracts or programs. The company has established a new business sector, Northrop Grumman Innovation Systems, following its acquisition of Orbital ATK, which has been integrated into its consolidated results of operations. The company has reorganized its sectors to better align its broad portfolio to serve customer needs, reflecting core capabilities in aeronautics systems, defense systems, mission systems, and space systems. The company assesses performance using certain financial measures that are not calculated in accordance with GAAP, which may be useful to investors in evaluating underlying financial performance. The company continues to monitor the impact of external factors, including geopolitical tensions and economic conditions, on its business operations and strategic resource allocation.

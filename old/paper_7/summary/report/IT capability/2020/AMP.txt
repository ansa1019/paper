The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic presents ongoing significant economic and societal disruption and market volatility, which has had and will continue to have ongoing impacts on our business and operating environment driven by a low interest rate environment, significant volatility in the equity markets, and the potential associated implications to client behavior. We continue to implement comprehensive strategies to navigate the operating environment spurred by the pandemic. We have begun a thoughtful phased reopening of our office locations while complying with applicable health agencies' guidelines and governmental orders. The pandemic strategy we have employed is flexible and scalable, recognizing this pandemic is widespread and occurs in multiple waves, affecting different communities at different times with varying levels of severity. The products and services we provide retail clients and, to a lesser extent, institutional clients, are the primary source of our revenues and net income. Revenues and net income are significantly affected by investment performance and the total value and composition of assets we manage and administer for our retail and institutional clients as well as the distribution fees we receive from other companies. Financial markets and macroeconomic conditions have had and will continue to have a significant impact on our operating and performance results. Accordingly, we expect to continue focusing on our key strategic objectives and obtaining operational and strategic leverage from our core capabilities. The success of these and other strategies may be affected by the factors discussed in item 1A of this annual report on Form 10-K - "Risk Factors" - and other factors as discussed herein. The management and financial advice fees relate primarily to fees earned from managing mutual funds, private funds, separate account and wrap account assets and institutional investments, as well as fees earned from providing financial advice, administrative services, and other custodial services. Management uses adjusted operating measures to evaluate our financial performance on a basis comparable to that used by some securities analysts and investors. The management of our information technology resources is critical to our ability to adapt to changing market conditions and client needs. We have made strategic decisions to expand the banking products and services we can provide directly to our clients, which includes the capabilities to offer FDIC insured deposits and a range of lending products. Our technology management practices are designed to enhance operational efficiency and support our business transformation efforts. The ability to leverage technology resources effectively is essential for maintaining competitive advantage and ensuring the reliability and security of our information systems. We have implemented measures to ensure that our IT infrastructure can support the evolving demands of our business environment, including the integration of digital technologies that facilitate communication and operational flexibility. The management of our IT capabilities is closely aligned with our strategic objectives, enabling us to respond effectively to market dynamics and enhance our organizational capabilities. Our focus on technology deployment and governance is integral to achieving our performance targets and driving business innovation. The ongoing evaluation of our technology portfolio and investment decisions will continue to shape our operational strategies and enhance our market responsiveness.

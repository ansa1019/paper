The discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations highlight the importance of leveraging our knowledge of the global investment process and our expertise in research, data, and technology to power better investment decisions. Our actionable solutions enable clients to understand and analyze key drivers of risk and return, enhancing their ability to build effective portfolios. We are committed to driving an integrated solutions-based approach, achieving service excellence, and delivering flexible, cutting-edge technology and platforms to meet our clients' dynamic and complex needs. Our growth strategy includes enhancing distribution and content-enabling technology, expanding solutions that empower client customization, and executing strategic relationships and acquisitions with complementary content and technology companies. The cost of revenues includes related information technology costs, such as data center, cloud, platform, and infrastructure costs, which are essential for maintaining our operational efficiency and supporting customer needs. Research and development expenses reflect our commitment to developing new or enhancing existing technology and service platforms for the delivery of our products and services. The increase in amortization of intangible assets is primarily driven by higher amortization of internally-developed capitalized software, indicating our ongoing investment in technology resources. Our operating metrics, including run rate and subscription sales, are critical for managing the business and reflect the effectiveness of our technology deployment in generating revenue. The retention rate is a key metric as subscription cancellations decrease our run rate and ultimately our operating revenues over time, emphasizing the need for effective information management and customer relationship strategies. We believe our liquidity, along with other financing alternatives, will provide the necessary capital to fund strategic partnerships and acquisitions that enhance our technology capabilities. The increase in cash flows from operating activities was primarily driven by higher cash collections from customers, which underscores the effectiveness of our operational processes and technology infrastructure in supporting our business model. Our contractual obligations include vendor obligations arising from market data contracts, which are integral to our information technology capabilities. The increase in run rate from asset-based fees reflects higher average assets under management in equity ETFs linked to our indexes, driven by market appreciation and net inflows, demonstrating the alignment of our technology capabilities with market dynamics. The overall increase in operating revenues and adjusted EBITDA indicates our ability to leverage technology and operational efficiencies to enhance firm performance and competitive positioning. The strategic management practices we employ, including the evaluation of investment opportunities and resource allocation, are designed to optimize our technology portfolio and enhance our organizational capabilities, ensuring we remain responsive to changing market conditions and client needs.

The company generates the majority of its lease income from retail, dining, entertainment, and other tenants, which includes fixed minimum lease consideration and variable lease consideration primarily based on tenants' sales. We seek growth in earnings, funds from operations, or FFO, and cash flows by enhancing the profitability and operation of our properties and investments. Our strategy includes attracting and retaining high-quality tenants and utilizing economies of scale to reduce operating expenses, as well as selectively acquiring or increasing our interests in high-quality real estate assets or portfolios of assets. We also focus on generating consumer traffic in our retail properties through marketing initiatives and strategic corporate alliances. The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic has led to significant changes in our operational environment, requiring adaptations such as tenants adding services like curbside pickup. We have implemented actions to reduce costs and increase liquidity, including significantly reducing non-essential corporate spending and property operating expenses. Our financing strategy relies primarily on long-term fixed-rate debt, and we derive most of our liquidity from positive net cash flow from operations and distributions of capital from unconsolidated entities. We routinely review and evaluate acquisition opportunities based on their ability to enhance our portfolio. Our international strategy includes partnering with established real estate companies and financing international investments with local currency to minimize foreign exchange risk. We employ a three-fold capital strategy to provide the capital necessary to fund growth, maintain sufficient flexibility to access capital, and manage our overall financial structure to preserve our investment-grade credit ratings. The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly impacted economic and market conditions, leading to changes in our ability to recognize revenue and potential asset impairment charges. We have suspended more than $1.0 billion of redevelopment and new development projects and will re-evaluate these projects over time. Our share of the costs of all new development, redevelopment, and expansion projects currently under construction is approximately $829 million. We expect to fund these capital projects with cash flows from operations and seek a stabilized return on invested capital in the range of 8-10% for all new development, expansion, and redevelopment projects. Our joint ventures typically fund their cash needs through secured non-recourse debt financings obtained by and in the name of the joint venture entity. We have also funded most of our foreign investments with local currency-denominated borrowings that act as a natural hedge against fluctuations in exchange rates. The company has recorded impairment charges related to certain properties and investments due to changes in operational performance and market conditions. We continuously monitor our business and transactions that may potentially impact our REIT status, ensuring compliance with financial covenants and other non-financial covenants. The company remains focused on leveraging its IT capabilities to support business strategies and enhance operational efficiency, ensuring that we can adapt to changing market dynamics and consumer demands.

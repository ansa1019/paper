During fiscal 2020, we invested in technology to enhance our operational capabilities and improve customer service. Our investments are expected to be directed primarily to new locations, supply chain infrastructure, enhancements to existing locations, and investments in technology. We believe that as the number of miles driven increases, consumers' vehicles are more likely to need service and maintenance, resulting in an increase in the need for automotive hard parts and maintenance items. The pandemic has accelerated our sales growth, which is reflected in our record net income and sales growth for the fiscal year. We have implemented new service options for customers, such as curbside pickup, which demonstrates our adaptability in response to changing consumer demands and market dynamics. Our ability to leverage technology resources and enhance our IT capabilities has been crucial in transforming our firm into a competitive force. We continue to focus on improving our information management capability to provide data and information to users with appropriate levels of accuracy, timeliness, reliability, security, confidentiality, connectivity, and access. The integration of digital technologies into our operations is essential for maintaining our market position and responding effectively to external influences. Our operational flexibility and investment decisions are guided by the need to align our technology infrastructure with our business strategies, ensuring that we can meet evolving customer needs and market conditions. We recognize that our IT capability, defined as the competence to effectively support business needs, is a key driver of our organizational performance and competitive advantage. Our strategic resource allocation includes investments in technology that enhance our operational efficiency and support our business transformation initiatives. The challenges posed by the pandemic have underscored the importance of our IT governance and the need for effective resource mobilization to navigate uncertainties in the business environment. Our focus on process optimization and technology deployment is aimed at improving our internal processes and enhancing our overall organizational effectiveness. We are committed to leveraging our IT systems and capabilities to drive performance gains and support our long-term growth objectives.

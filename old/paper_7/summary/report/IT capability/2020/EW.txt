The medical technology industry is highly competitive and continues to evolve, with success measured by the development of innovative products and the value brought to stakeholders. We are committed to developing new technologies and providing innovative patient care, which underscores the importance of mobilizing and deploying IT-based resources in combination with leveraging the value of other resources and capabilities. Our operations worldwide are managed across geographical regions, and we focus on the coordination of a firmâ€™s assets and internal processes to enhance business strategies. The global pandemic has adversely impacted nearly all aspects of our business, including the operations of our customers, suppliers, and business partners, highlighting the need for operational flexibility and effective resource allocation. We are proactively managing inventory and assessing alternative logistics options, which reflects our capability to respond to market dynamics and external influences. In 2020, we invested 17.3% of our net sales in research and development, emphasizing our commitment to innovation and the development of strategic resources. We experienced significant changes in procedure volumes due to the pandemic, which required us to adapt our operational strategies and maintain continuous access to life-saving technologies. The adoption of our products, particularly the transcatheter aortic valve replacement system, has been positively received, demonstrating our capability to meet consumer demands and respond to market agility. Our investments in transcatheter mitral and tricuspid therapies reflect our strategic resource allocation and commitment to enhancing firm capabilities. The ongoing development of our technologies is essential for maintaining competitive advantage and achieving superior outcomes in patient care. We have also faced challenges related to intellectual property litigation, which necessitates effective management practices and strategic decision-making. Our financial position as of December 31, 2020, indicates a commitment to leveraging technology capabilities to support business needs and enhance organizational performance. We continue to monitor the impact of regulatory changes and environmental factors on our operations, ensuring that our technology infrastructure aligns with our organizational goals. The integration of advanced monitoring systems and the development of new medical therapies are critical to our business transformation efforts. We remain dedicated to generating robust clinical, economic, and quality of life evidence, which is increasingly expected by patients, clinicians, and payors. Our strategic alignment with market needs and our focus on operational efficiency are vital for navigating the complexities of the healthcare environment. The ability to provide data and information with appropriate levels of accuracy, timeliness, reliability, and security is central to our information management capability. As we adapt to ongoing changes in the market, our emphasis on innovation partnerships and the development of actionable investments will continue to drive our success in the evolving medical technology landscape.

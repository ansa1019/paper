The life insurance industry remains highly competitive, with larger companies having the ability to invest in brand equity, product development, technology optimization, risk management, and innovation, which are fundamental for sustained profitable growth. Insurers are increasingly seeking alternative sources of revenue and focusing on monetization of assets, fee-based services, and opportunities to offer comprehensive solutions, including value-added services along with traditional products. Financial strength and flexibility, along with technology modernization, are prerequisites for sustainable growth in the life insurance industry.

The strategic management of technology resources is essential for optimizing risk-adjusted investment income and total return while ensuring that assets and liabilities are managed on a cash flow and duration basis. The firm’s IT governance framework supports the mobilization and deployment of IT-based resources, enhancing its capability to respond to market dynamics and consumer demands effectively.

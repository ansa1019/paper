Information technology capabilities have been evolving in scope to more comprehensively encompass the coordination of a firm’s assets and internal processes and their interfirm transactions and relationships. IT capability is a firm's ability to acquire, deploy, combine, and reconfigure IT resources in support and enhancement of business strategies and work processes. We focus on information management capability—that is, the ability to provide data and information to users with the appropriate levels of accuracy, timeliness, reliability, security, confidentiality, connectivity, and access and the ability to tailor these in response to changing business needs and directions. At its core, the notion of IT capability underscores the importance of mobilizing and deploying IT-based resources in combination with, and leveraging the value of, other resources and capabilities. IT capability, broadly defined as the IT function’s competence to effectively support business needs, has become a key in transforming a firm into a competitive force. A firm’s IT capabilities represent the application of physical or intangible IT resources such as technology, knowledge, practices, relationships, management skills, business process understanding, and human resources to further organizational goals. The discussion of our results of operations and liquidity and capital resources emphasizes the importance of maintaining operational flexibility and the ability to respond to market dynamics. We have successfully executed a debt offering to support significant opportunities to invest in high-return industrial gas projects, which reflects our strategic resource allocation and investment decisions. The ongoing growth of our dividend and the execution of projects in our backlog are aligned with our business strategy to create long-term shareholder value. Our commitment to advancing diversity and inclusion is also integral to our organizational capabilities. The impacts of COVID-19 have highlighted the need for effective information management and operational efficiency, as we continue to adapt to changing market conditions and consumer demands. Our focus on sustainability and innovative solutions is essential for addressing the challenges facing customers, communities, and the world. The strategic alignment of our technology infrastructure with business processes enhances our operational efficiency and supports our competitive positioning. We anticipate that our onsite business model will continue generating stable cash flow, which is critical for maintaining liquidity and capital resources. Our approach to capital expenditures includes evaluating acquisitions of small- and medium-sized industrial gas companies or assets, which is driven by demand for cleaner energy and emerging market growth. The integration of technology capabilities within our operational framework is vital for optimizing processes and achieving performance excellence. The ability to leverage strategic resources and maintain agility in decision-making is crucial for navigating the complexities of the current business environment. Our organizational effectiveness is supported by a robust IT governance framework that ensures compliance and enhances performance metrics. The ongoing evaluation of our technology portfolio and investment choices will enable us to capitalize on actionable opportunities and maintain our competitive advantage in the market.

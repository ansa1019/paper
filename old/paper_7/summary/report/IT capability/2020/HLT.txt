During the year ended December 31, 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic significantly impacted the global economy and strained the hospitality industry, affecting our operational capabilities and IT resources. Our management and franchise segment provides services, including hotel management and licensing of our brands and intellectual property, which are supported by our technology infrastructure, including reservation systems and information technology services. The ability to manage our owned and leased hotels relies on effective IT capabilities that enhance operational efficiency and support business strategies. We have taken several steps to help our business withstand the uncertain environment, including implementing strict cost management measures and optimizing our technology deployment to enhance customer relationships and operational flexibility. Our strategic objectives include the continued expansion of our global footprint and fee-based business, which requires the effective mobilization and deployment of IT-based resources in combination with other organizational capabilities. The management and franchise contracts with third-party hotel owners and franchisees are crucial for generating management and franchise fee revenues, and maintaining good relationships with these third parties is essential for leveraging our IT capabilities to support growth and innovation. The economic viability of new properties in our management and franchise development pipeline is evaluated based on various factors, including the technology functionalities that can be deployed to enhance operational performance. The COVID-19 pandemic has posed challenges to our strategy execution, including delays in openings and new development, which may affect our IT architecture and resource allocation decisions. We are committed to optimizing our customers' experience and the value of our hotels and brands through effective information management and operational processes. Our relationships with third-party owners and franchisees generate new incremental opportunities for property development, which can support our growth and enhance our competitive advantage in the market. As we continue to navigate the impacts of the pandemic, we expect to leverage our IT capabilities to improve decision-making speed and enhance our organizational effectiveness. Our cash management policy aims to maintain the availability of liquidity while minimizing operational costs, which includes managing our technology investments strategically. The integration of digital technologies into our operations is vital for achieving market agility and responsiveness to consumer demands, thereby enhancing our overall firm performance. The ability to provide accurate and timely information to users is critical for supporting our operational and strategic objectives, and we recognize the importance of IT governance in managing our technology resources effectively. The ongoing evaluation of our IT systems and capabilities will be essential in adapting to the evolving business environment and ensuring compliance with regulatory contexts.

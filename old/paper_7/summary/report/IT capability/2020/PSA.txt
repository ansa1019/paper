During a significant portion of 2020, the COVID pandemic has resulted in cessation, severe curtailment, or impairment of business activities in most sectors of the economy, impacting our self-storage operations. We initiated our touchless eRentalÂ® leasing platform and touchless mobile app to facilitate customer access to our properties, enhancing operational efficiency and customer relationships. Our corporate offices and call centers migrated to a "work from home" environment, which we believe has not resulted in significant negative impacts on our operations or decision-making. The pandemic has influenced our revenue growth, with a decrease in revenues from same-store facilities attributed to increased competition from newly developed facilities and restrictions on rate increases imposed by local governments. Our management's focus has been on maximizing cash flows from existing self-storage facilities while also pursuing growth through the acquisition and development of new facilities. We have embarked on a multi-year program to rebrand our properties, enhancing their competitive positioning relative to local competitors. This program includes upgrades to the configuration and layout of customer zones to improve the customer experience. We believe that our economies of scale in marketing and operations allow us to generate higher net operating income from newly acquired facilities. The analysis of our long-lived assets involves significant judgment and estimates of fair values, which could materially impact our net income. Our centralized management costs include information technology support, hardware, and software, which are essential for operational effectiveness. We expect to continue investing in technology infrastructure, including energy-saving technologies such as solar power and LED lights, which are anticipated to reduce operating costs. Our capital expenditures are expected to approximate $250 million in 2021, including investments in technology to enhance operational flexibility and efficiency. We are actively seeking to acquire additional self-storage facilities, and our ability to do so is influenced by market conditions and seller confidence. Our liquidity and capital resources are expected to be sufficient to meet ongoing requirements for principal payments on debt, maintenance capital expenditures, and distributions to shareholders. We anticipate continued revenue growth supported by increased customer demand and a robust pipeline of development projects. Future acquisition volume will depend on various factors, including economic conditions and the level of seller confidence. The strategic management of our resources and investments in technology capabilities are critical to maintaining our competitive advantage in the self-storage market.

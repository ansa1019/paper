Autodesk makes software for people who make things, empowering innovators to achieve new solutions to complex design challenges and make data-powered decisions for sustainable outcomes. Our strategy focuses on delivering innovative technology that provides valuable automation and insight into the design and make process. We equip users with tailored tools, services, and access for success, helping them harness the power of data to explore new ways of imagining, collaborating, and creating. We connect project steps and collaborators on a unified platform, enhancing operational efficiency and market agility. The transition from mainframes to personal computers transformed the industry, and we are now experiencing a shift from perpetual licenses and on-premises products to subscriptions and cloud-enabled technologies. Our subscription plans represent a hybrid of desktop software and cloud functionality, providing a collaborative design workflow for users. We believe customer adoption of these offerings will grow as industries leverage scalable computing power and flexibility. Our acquisitions, such as Spacemaker, utilize cloud-based AI and generative design to enhance early-stage design decisions, maximizing sustainability and returns on property investments. We continue to improve product functionality and expand offerings through internal development and acquisitions, which can increase the speed of delivering product functionality but may also present cost and integration challenges. Our strategy includes maintaining an open-architecture design of our software products to facilitate third-party development of complementary solutions, thereby enhancing our competitive advantage. We have established the Autodesk Forge Developer Program to support innovators in creating solutions that facilitate a connected ecosystem for design, manufacturing, and usage. Our extensive global network of distributors, resellers, and third-party developers provides a competitive advantage, allowing for rapid deployment and support of our solutions. We focus on catalyzing impact and innovation across industries, investing in our customers' access to learn and develop relevant skills for in-demand roles. Our investment in cloud products and a subscription business model positions us to navigate economic challenges effectively. We continually review strategic investments, assessing performance and functionality improvements while managing risks associated with acquisitions. Our operational flexibility and strategic resource allocation enable us to adapt to market dynamics and external influences, ensuring alignment with organizational goals and enhancing overall firm performance. We recognize the importance of mobilizing and deploying IT-based resources in conjunction with leveraging other capabilities to transform our business into a competitive force. Our commitment to innovation and technology deployment is central to our strategy, driving business transformation and improving performance outcomes.

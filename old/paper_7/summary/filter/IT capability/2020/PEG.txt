PSE&G's business plan focuses on achieving growth while controlling costs and managing the risks associated with regulatory changes, fluctuating commodity prices, and changes in customer demand. The ongoing coronavirus pandemic has not had a material impact on our results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2020. However, a prolonged outbreak could impact our operational performance and results of operations through decreased cost recovery. PSE&G continues to enhance the reliability and resiliency of its transmission and distribution (T&D) system, supporting public policy objectives by investing capital in T&D infrastructure and clean energy programs. The company expects to invest between $13 billion to $15 billion over the five-year period ending December 31, 2025, which is driven by certain unapproved investment programs, including extensions of existing programs. PSE&G's investments have altered its business mix to reflect a higher percentage of earnings contribution from PSE&G. The company emphasizes operational performance while developing opportunities in both competitive and regulated businesses, with flexibility in its generating fleet allowing it to take advantage of opportunities in a rapidly evolving market. PSEG Power has sought to achieve operational excellence and manage costs to optimize cash flow generation from its fleet in light of low wholesale power and gas prices, environmental considerations, and competitive market forces that reward efficiency and reliability. The strategic review of PSEG Power's non-nuclear generating assets is expected to reduce overall business risk and earnings volatility, improve PSEG's credit profile, and align with its climate strategy and sustainability efforts. PSEG's capital programs have not been materially impacted by the pandemic to date, although a prolonged outbreak could lead to delays in obtaining necessary permits and approvals. The company has implemented protocols to ensure safety and health at its generation facilities during planned outages. PSEG's financial strength is predicated on a solid balance sheet, positive operating cash flow, and reasonable risk-adjusted returns on increased investment. The greater emphasis on capital spending for projects at PSE&G relative to PSEG Power has yielded strong results, allowing the company to meet customer needs and address market conditions and investor expectations. PSEG continues to explore strategic alternatives for PSEG Power's non-nuclear generating fleet, which includes more than 6,750 megawatts of fossil generation. The company is focused on controlling costs while maintaining safety, reliability, and customer satisfaction. PSEG's future success will depend on its ability to maintain strong operational and financial performance, capitalize on regulatory and legislative developments, and respond to various challenges, including regulatory and political uncertainty and changes in demand and natural gas and electricity prices. Investments in T&D facilities to enhance reliability, resiliency, and modernization of the system are critical to meeting the growing needs and expectations of customers. PSEG's strategic options include investments in offshore wind and clean energy initiatives, which are expected to provide predictability and reasonable risk-adjusted returns.

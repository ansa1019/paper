The focus on information management capability highlights the ability to provide data and information to users with appropriate levels of accuracy, timeliness, reliability, security, confidentiality, connectivity, and access, tailoring these in response to changing business needs and directions. Mobilizing and deploying IT-based resources in combination with leveraging the value of other resources and capabilities underscores the importance of IT capability in transforming a firm into a competitive force.

The company has experienced changes in retention levels and premium volumes due to operational disruptions and financial distress among customers. The integration of digital technologies and strategic resource allocation is essential for maintaining operational flexibility and enhancing firm capabilities.

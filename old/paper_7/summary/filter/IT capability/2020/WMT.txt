Throughout our discussion, we operate in the highly competitive omni-channel retail industry, facing strong sales competition from various store formats and ecommerce businesses. We invest in technology and process improvements to increase productivity, manage inventory, and reduce costs. Our strategy includes improving customer-facing initiatives in stores and clubs and creating a seamless omni-channel experience for our customers, which necessitates significant capital allocation to ecommerce, technology, supply chain, and store remodels. We focus on the most productive growth opportunities, increasing comparable store and club sales, accelerating ecommerce sales growth, and expanding omni-channel initiatives. Our operational flexibility is enhanced by leveraging technology resources and capabilities, which are essential for transforming our business and maintaining competitive advantage. 

We measure operating discipline through expense leverage, defined as net sales growing at a faster rate than operating expenses. The increase in operating income reflects our capability to effectively support business needs through strategic resource allocation and management actions. Our ecommerce sales positively contributed to comparable sales, highlighting the importance of IT capabilities in responding to consumer demands and market dynamics. We have experienced strong net sales growth, driven by increased demand stemming from the COVID-19 pandemic, which accelerated ecommerce growth and necessitated a focus on operational efficiency and technology deployment.

Our financial performance metrics, including return on assets and return on investment, are indicative of our effective deployment of IT resources and capabilities. We continually assess our investment choices, particularly in technology and process automation, to enhance our operational efficiency and support long-term growth. The strategic decisions made in our technology portfolio reflect our commitment to leveraging IT capabilities for business transformation and value creation. 

We also recognize the impact of external influences, such as global health epidemics and competitive pressures, on our operational strategies and performance outcomes. Our approach to managing these challenges involves a focus on information management capability, ensuring that we provide data and information to users with appropriate levels of accuracy, timeliness, reliability, and security. This capability is crucial for aligning our business strategies with market-based performance and enhancing our organizational effectiveness.

In summary, our ongoing investments in technology and innovation are aimed at optimizing our processes and enhancing our customer relationships, which are vital for maintaining our competitive positioning in the retail industry. The integration of IT capabilities into our business processes enables us to respond effectively to market changes and consumer preferences, thereby reinforcing our commitment to operational excellence and strategic management practices.

The company has increased the utilization of virtual tools such as quickfoto claim® and virtual assist® to allow for a simple, fast, and safe claims handling process for customers and employees. The coronavirus pandemic has resulted in increased regulatory restrictions on profitability, rate actions, or claim practices, potentially outside the scope of current policies, and has also impacted the availability and performance of third-party vendors, including technology development. The company has experienced slower written premiums growth and declines in auto new issued applications due to lower car sales, while also expanding the availability of its pay-per-mile insurance product, milewise®. The pandemic has created significant uncertainty, and the company continues to closely monitor and proactively adapt to developments and changing conditions. The impacts of the pandemic include increased costs from providing free identity protection to consumers and decreased sales of identity protection products due to higher unemployment. The company has made substantial progress in building higher growth business models to increase personal property-liability market share under the Allstate brand, with consolidated policies in force reaching 175.9 million, a 20.5% increase from the prior year. Allstate protection underwriting income increased significantly due to lower auto non-catastrophe losses, increased premiums earned, and favorable catastrophe reserve reestimates.

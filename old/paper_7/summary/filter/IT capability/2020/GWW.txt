The company's major operational facilities and infrastructure remained operational during 2020 with limited disruptions, while adhering to strict safety and social-distancing protocols.

The company generated operating cash of $1.1 billion and used the cash generated to invest in the business and return excess capital to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases. Grainger's focus on liquidity as pandemic-related uncertainties continue into 2021 reflects its commitment to maintaining a strong financial position while adapting to changing market dynamics. The company's operational flexibility has allowed it to absorb the pandemic impact with minimal workforce reductions or furloughs, positioning Grainger for accelerated growth once post-pandemic recovery commences. The company is also aware of the potential disruptions caused by the pandemic, including increased vulnerability to cybersecurity incidents and the need to adapt controls and procedures required by remote working arrangements.

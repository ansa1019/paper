We enable our customers to develop electronic products, and our products and services are designed to give our customers a competitive edge in their development of integrated circuits (ICs), system on chips (SoCs), and increasingly sophisticated electronic devices and systems. Our offerings optimize performance, minimize power consumption, shorten the time to market, improve engineering productivity, and reduce design, development, and manufacturing costs. We group our products into categories related to major design activities, including digital IC design and signoff. The acquisitions of AWR and Integrand enhance our technology portfolio to address growing radio frequency design activity, driven by expanding use of 5G communications. These acquisitions support our intelligent system design strategy and reflect our commitment to expanding and enhancing our product portfolio in response to increasing technological requirements. Management uses performance indicators, including revenue and operating expenses, to manage our business effectively. The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted our operations, resulting in some volatility in delivery timing for our hardware and intellectual property (IP) products. Despite these challenges, we did not experience a material adverse impact on our results of operations during fiscal 2020. Our revenue in the United States and China increased during fiscal 2020, driven by demand for software and IP offerings. Our licensing arrangements allow customers the ability to remix among software products, and we estimate revenue allocation based on expected usage. The increase in revenue reflects our ability to adapt to market dynamics and customer needs. Our operating expenses include marketing, sales, research and development, and general and administrative expenses, which fluctuate based on changes in employee numbers, stock-based compensation, and other factors. We have initiated restructuring plans to align our resources with our business strategy, which may require further adjustments in the future. The allocation of purchase prices in business combinations requires significant estimates in determining the fair values of acquired assets and liabilities, particularly intangible assets and goodwill. We apply judgment in evaluating contracts with customers, which often include multiple performance obligations that impact revenue recognition. Our cash flows from operating activities are influenced by business levels and customer payment terms, and we expect to continue investing in technology and infrastructure to support our operational capabilities. We recognize the importance of mobilizing and deploying IT-based resources in combination with other capabilities to enhance our organizational goals and maintain competitive positioning in the market. The management of our IT resources and capabilities is critical to supporting our business needs and achieving operational efficiency, as well as ensuring compliance with regulatory requirements. Our strategic resource allocation and investment decisions are designed to leverage our technology capabilities and enhance our overall firm performance.

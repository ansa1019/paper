We operate in two operating segments: the upstream segment, which is engaged in the acquisition, development, exploration, and exploitation of unconventional, onshore oil and natural gas reserves, and the midstream operations segment, which focuses on ownership, operation, development, and acquisition of midstream infrastructure assets. Our upstream operations are primarily directed at the horizontal development of formations in the Permian Basin. We intend to continue to develop our reserves and increase production through development drilling and exploitation activities, targeting oil-weighted reserves. In our midstream operations, we have entered into multiple fee-based commercial agreements utilizing our infrastructure assets to provide essential services critical to our upstream operations. The COVID-19 pandemic and the collapse in commodity prices have adversely affected the demand for oil and natural gas, causing significant volatility in financial markets and impacting our capital expenditure budgets. We have implemented new and more efficient drilling and completions methodologies to control well costs and enhance operational flexibility. Our development program is focused entirely within the Permian Basin, where we continue to focus on long-lateral multi-well pad development. We expect to generate free cash flow used to pay dividends and pay down debt while maintaining our investment grade credit ratings. Our capital expenditures for drilling, midstream, and infrastructure are projected to be significantly lower than in previous years, reflecting our strategy to focus on capital efficiency and high-graded development. We continuously monitor commodity prices and overall market conditions, adjusting our rig cadence in response to changes. The ability to mobilize and deploy IT-based resources effectively supports our business needs and enhances our competitive positioning. We recognize the importance of information management capability, which includes providing data and information to users with appropriate levels of accuracy, timeliness, reliability, security, confidentiality, connectivity, and access. Our strategic resource allocation and investment decisions are influenced by market dynamics and the need for operational efficiency. The integration of technology capabilities within our operational framework is essential for optimizing processes and enhancing organizational effectiveness. We are committed to advancing our environmental, social responsibility, and governance performance, which includes setting targets for greenhouse gas emissions reduction. Our future ability to grow proved reserves and production will depend on the capital resources available to us, and we regularly assess our investment opportunities in light of market conditions and operational performance. The dynamic nature of the oil and gas industry necessitates a focus on innovation partnerships and strategic management practices to maintain competitiveness and achieve performance excellence. We are also aware of the regulatory context and environmental factors that may influence our operational strategies and investment choices. The effective management of our technology portfolio and the alignment of our business strategies with market needs are critical for sustaining long-term growth and enhancing firm capabilities.

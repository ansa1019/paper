In 2020, we faced significant effects from the COVID-19 pandemic, which impacted overall market conditions and customer demand. We took steps to drive revenue growth through new products, programs, and markets, as well as to reduce costs, including reductions in capital expenditures and ongoing cost initiatives. Our restructuring activities are associated with plans to enhance our efficiency, effectiveness, and sharpen the competitiveness of our businesses, including leveraging ongoing investments in digital technology. The institutional advancement program is intended to enhance our institutional sales and service structure, allowing the sales team to capture share and penetration while maximizing service effectiveness. We have also initiated a restructuring plan to leverage technology and system investments, aiming to further simplify and automate processes and tasks, reduce complexity, and focus on key long-term growth areas. Our strong balance sheet has allowed us continued access to capital at attractive rates, which supports our operational and financial health. We continue to generate strong cash flow from operations, enabling us to fund ongoing operations, acquisitions, and investments in our business. Our acquisitions and divestitures are targeted to complement our growth strategy, and we expect to continue making capital investments and acquisitions to support long-term growth. The impact of acquisitions and divestitures is reflected in our financial performance metrics, and we evaluate our performance using non-GAAP measures that provide greater transparency regarding our operating results. We recognize the importance of mobilizing and deploying IT-based resources in combination with leveraging the value of other resources and capabilities to transform our firm into a competitive force. Our IT capabilities represent the application of physical or intangible IT resources, including technology, knowledge, practices, relationships, management skills, and business process understanding, to further organizational goals. The COVID-19 pandemic has necessitated adaptations in our operational strategies, and we anticipate continued impacts on our business environment. Our commitment to maintaining strong cash flows and strategic resource allocation is critical for navigating the challenges posed by the pandemic and ensuring organizational effectiveness. The restructuring plans and digital technology investments are designed to enhance our operational flexibility and market responsiveness, ultimately contributing to our competitive positioning and firm performance. As we continue to adapt to the evolving market dynamics, our focus remains on leveraging our IT capabilities and strategic resources to drive business transformation and value creation.

We are a provider of marketplace infrastructure, data services, and technology solutions to a broad range of customers including financial institutions, corporations, and government entities. Our products provide customers with access to mission-critical workflow tools designed to increase asset class transparency and workflow efficiency. Our mortgage technology segment includes an end-to-end technology platform that offers customers comprehensive, digital workflow tools aimed at addressing inefficiencies in the U.S. residential mortgage market. The acquisition of Ellie Mae, a cloud-based technology solution provider for the mortgage finance industry, enhances our capabilities by enabling secure management of data exchange across the mortgage ecosystem, ensuring adherence to compliance requirements. Our mortgage technology revenues increased significantly, driven by the origination technology that automates the gathering, reviewing, and verifying of mortgage-related information, thus enhancing operational efficiency and supporting business needs. We continue to focus on our strategy to grow revenue streams and manage expenses to mitigate uncertainties and leverage proprietary data, clearing, markets, and technology solutions. The business environment is characterized by globalization, growing customer demand for workflow efficiency and automation, and increasing demand for data to inform risk management and investment decisions. We have diversified our business to reduce dependency on volatility in any one asset class, increasing non-transaction and clearing revenues from 34% in 2014 to 48% in 2020. Our fixed income and data services segment represents fixed income trading and clearing as well as subscription-based revenues related to data analytics offerings. The growth in our fixed income data and analytics products is driven by strong retention rates of existing customers and the addition of new customers. We have also seen an increase in demand for outsourced services by financial institutions, which aligns with our focus on enhancing technology capabilities and operational flexibility. Our technology and communication expenses, which include costs for running data centers and maintaining computer hardware and software, are driven by system capacity and functionality requirements. We expect to incur capital expenditures and software development costs to support the enhancement of our technology and business integration. Our future capital requirements will depend on growth rates across segments, strategic plans, and regulatory requirements. We continue to monitor market dynamics and external influences that may affect our operational capabilities and competitive positioning. The evolving regulatory landscape emphasizes the importance of transparent markets and access to data, which are critical to our product offerings. We are committed to leveraging our IT capabilities to transform our firm into a competitive force, enabling us to respond to market changes and enhance our organizational effectiveness.

During the year ended December 31, 2020, we took several steps to help our business withstand the uncertain time, which included implementing technology and information management capabilities to enhance operational efficiency and support business needs. Our management and franchise segment provides services, including hotel management and licensing of our brands and IP, which are supported by technology resources such as our reservation system and information technology services. We have also prioritized the safety and security of our guests and employees through the deployment of digital technologies, such as Hilton CleanStay and Hilton EventReady, which focus on cleanliness and customer service. The effectiveness of our management capabilities is critical as we navigate the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic, which has significantly impacted our operational performance and market dynamics. Our strategic objectives include the continued expansion of our global footprint and fee-based business, which relies on the coordination of IT capabilities with our operational processes to enhance our competitive advantage. The economic viability of new properties in our development pipeline is evaluated based on various factors, including the integration of technology functionalities to support operational flexibility and resource allocation. Our relationships with third-party owners and franchisees are essential for generating new incremental opportunities for property development, which can support our growth and enhance our overall business performance. The management of our owned and leased hotels is influenced by our ability to leverage IT capabilities for operational efficiency and to respond effectively to market demands. We recognize that consumer demand for our products and services is closely linked to the performance of the general economy, and our ability to sustain or increase rates charged to customers is affected by competition and the supply of hotel services. The COVID-19 pandemic has underscored the importance of our IT architecture and information systems capability in managing operational challenges and ensuring business continuity. Our investment in technology infrastructure is aimed at optimizing our business processes and enhancing our organizational capabilities, which are vital for maintaining our market positioning. As we continue to adapt to the evolving business environment, our focus remains on leveraging strategic resources and capabilities to drive performance gains and achieve our organizational goals. The integration of technology into our operations is a key component of our strategy to enhance customer relationships and improve overall business value. We are committed to utilizing our IT effectiveness to support decision-making processes and to facilitate communication across our organization, ensuring that we remain agile and responsive to external influences and market restructuring. The ongoing evaluation of our technology portfolio will guide our investment choices and support our long-term objectives for growth and transformation in the hospitality industry.

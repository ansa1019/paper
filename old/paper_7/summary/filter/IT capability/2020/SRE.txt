In 2018, we set out to simplify Sempra Energy's business model and sharpen our focus on our mission to be North America's premier energy infrastructure company. Our operational and financial results reflect our focus on executing this strategy. Sempra Texas Utilities experienced an increase in earnings primarily due to higher equity earnings from Oncor Holdings driven by increased revenues from rate updates to reflect increases in invested capital and customer growth. The increase in earnings was offset by unfavorable weather and increased operating costs and expenses attributable to invested capital. Sempra Mexico's operations are impacted by foreign currency translation rates, which can cause variances in comparative results of operations. The COVID-19 pandemic has materially impacted the economy, leading to actions by governments to address these effects, including measures to support customers affected by the pandemic. The California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) required energy companies to implement emergency customer protection measures, which include suspending service disconnections and offering flexible payment plans. These measures could result in a further reduction in payments received from customers and an increase in uncollectible accounts, potentially affecting cash flows and financial condition. Sempra Energy's businesses, identified as critical or essential services, have continued to operate throughout the pandemic, prioritizing the safety of employees and customers. We have activated business continuity plans and implemented precautionary measures, including remote work and increased facility sanitization. Our capital expenditures are primarily focused on transmission and distribution improvements, including investments in renewable energy projects, which are subject to regulatory approvals and economic conditions. We expect to make significant capital investments in the coming years, which will depend on factors such as the cost and availability of financing, regulatory approvals, and business opportunities. Sempra Energy's liquidity is supported by cash flows from operations, available credit facilities, and proceeds from asset sales. However, access to financing could become constrained due to changing economic conditions. Our ability to finance operations and maintain investment-grade credit ratings is critical, and we continuously monitor our capital structure and financing needs. The regulatory environment, including the CPUC's decisions and market dynamics, will influence our operational performance and liquidity. The ongoing assessment of our asset values and potential impairments is necessary, particularly in light of the economic uncertainties stemming from the pandemic. The integration of technology and data management capabilities is essential for supporting business strategies and enhancing operational efficiency. Our focus on leveraging IT capabilities to optimize processes and improve decision-making aligns with our strategic objectives. The evolving landscape of digital technologies and the need for effective information management underscore the importance of IT governance and resource allocation in achieving competitive advantage and sustaining firm performance.

Our ability to generate profits and to generate positive cash flow from operations over the next several years depends significantly on the continued success in commercializing our products, which requires effective coordination of our assets and internal processes. The scope and progress of our research and development efforts are critical, as they involve substantial expenses that necessitate careful resource allocation and management capability to enhance business strategies. The collaboration agreements we have in place require us to deliver various rights, services, and/or goods across the entire life cycle of a product or product candidate, emphasizing the importance of managing our IT resources effectively to support these efforts. Our financial results may fluctuate based on the timing of expenses and the continuation of collaborations, particularly with partners like Sanofi and Bayer, which highlights the need for robust IT governance and strategic resource allocation to navigate market dynamics. 

We expect to incur substantial costs related to the commercialization of our marketed products, which will require operational flexibility and effective IT investment to respond to changing business needs. The uncertainties associated with drug development, including regulatory approvals and market competition, necessitate a strong IT capability to manage information reliability and support decision-making processes. Our research and development expenses include significant investments in technology and personnel, which are essential for maintaining our competitive advantage and enhancing our organizational capabilities. 

The management of our collaboration agreements involves complex financial activities that require precise information management and data analytics to optimize performance outcomes. Additionally, our operational efficiency is supported by a technology infrastructure that facilitates communication and coordination across our internal processes and external relationships. The dynamic nature of our business environment, influenced by factors such as regulatory changes and market restructuring, necessitates a continuous evaluation of our IT capabilities to ensure alignment with our strategic goals. 

As we expand our manufacturing facilities and invest in research capabilities, the integration of IT systems will be crucial for enhancing our operational effectiveness and achieving performance gains. The reliance on big data and information processing capacity will play a significant role in our ability to innovate and respond to consumer demands. Our commitment to maintaining high standards of information security and confidentiality is essential for building trust with our collaborators and customers, further reinforcing our organizational resilience and agility in a competitive landscape. 

In summary, the evolution of our IT capabilities is integral to our business transformation efforts, enabling us to leverage technology resources effectively in support of our strategic objectives and operational needs.

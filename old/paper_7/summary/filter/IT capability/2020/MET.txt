The life insurance industry remains highly competitive, with product development focused on differentiation leading to more intense competition regarding product features and services. Larger companies have the capacity to invest in brand equity, product development, technology optimization, risk management, and innovation, which are fundamental for sustained profitable growth. Insurers are increasingly seeking alternative sources of revenue, focusing on the monetization of assets, fee-based services, and opportunities to offer comprehensive solutions that include providing value-added services along with traditional products. Financial strength and flexibility, along with technology modernization, are prerequisites for sustainable growth in the life insurance industry. The ability to adapt to changes in the competitive environment, especially due to the COVID-19 pandemic, is a significant differentiator for success in the life insurance and broader financial services industry. 

We have implemented risk management and business continuity plans, which have enabled us to maintain critical business processes, customer service levels, relationships with key vendors, financial reporting systems, internal controls over financial reporting, and disclosure controls and procedures. The COVID-19 pandemic has caused volatility in the global equity, credit, and real estate markets, impacting our investment portfolio. We believe our investment portfolio is highly diversified and well-positioned to withstand economic downturns, although we expect continued impacts from the pandemic and a sustained low interest rate environment. 

Our investment management strategy focuses on cash flow and duration to support current and future liabilities, utilizing disciplined asset/liability management strategies, including the use of derivatives. We actively evaluate market risk hedging needs and strategies to ensure our free cash flow and capital objectives are met under a range of market conditions. The economic capital model we have developed measures risk in the business and provides a basis upon which capital is deployed, aligning segment allocated equity with emerging standards and consistent risk principles. 

We continuously monitor and adjust our liquidity and capital plans in light of market conditions, as well as changing needs and opportunities. Our liquidity management includes maintaining a substantial short-term liquidity position and managing our level of liquid assets. We have established several senior management committees as part of our capital management process, which regularly review actual and projected capital levels and our annual capital plan. The capital policy sets forth minimum and target capital levels and governs the capital management process. 

We have various interest rate derivative positions to partially mitigate risks associated with a sustained low interest rate environment, which could adversely impact liabilities and earnings due to minimum credited rate guarantees present in most of our policyholder account balances. We utilize a combination of product design, hedging strategies, reinsurance, and other risk management actions to mitigate the risks related to guaranteed benefits. Our technology capabilities are essential in transforming our operations and supporting business strategies, enabling us to respond effectively to market dynamics and consumer demands.

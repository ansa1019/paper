Mastercard is a technology company in the global payments industry that connects consumers, financial institutions, merchants, governments, digital partners, businesses, and other organizations worldwide, enabling them to use electronic forms of payment instead of cash and checks. We make payments easier and more efficient by creating a wide range of payment solutions and services using our family of well-known brands. We are a multi-rail network that facilitates the switching of payment transactions and delivers related products and services. Our payment solutions ensure safety and security for the global payments system. The increase in transactions and dollar volume of activity on cards carrying our brands for both domestic and cross-border transactions and other payment-related products and services primarily drove our revenue growth. Our continued investment in strategic initiatives and higher operating costs reflects our commitment to enhancing our IT capabilities. The increase in personnel expenses was driven by a higher number of employees to support our continued investment in real-time account-based payments, digital services, data analytics, and geographic expansion. Data processing and telecommunications expenses increased due to capacity growth of our business, with acquisitions contributing to this growth. We believe that our existing cash, cash equivalents, and investment securities balances, along with our cash flow generating capabilities, are sufficient to satisfy our future operating cash needs and capital asset purchases. Our liquidity and access to capital could be negatively impacted by global credit market conditions. We manage foreign currency balance sheet remeasurement and cash flow risk through our foreign exchange risk management activities. The impact of foreign exchange activity has not been eliminated in our currency-neutral results and is recorded in general and administrative expenses. We are exposed to currency devaluation in certain countries, which could negatively impact our ability to manage risk and process cross-border transactions. We continue to operate and serve our Venezuelan issuers, acquirers, merchants, and account holders with our products and services despite the challenges posed by foreign exchange regulations. Our operational flexibility and strategic resource allocation are critical as we navigate these dynamics. The effective income tax rate for 2018 was lower than in 2017 primarily due to a lower enacted statutory tax rate in the U.S. and Belgium and a more favorable geographic mix of earnings. We believe that the presentation of non-GAAP financial measures facilitates an understanding of our operating performance and provides a meaningful comparison of our results between periods. We evaluate our ongoing operations in relation to historical results for internal planning and forecasting purposes. Our strategic management practices are designed to enhance our organizational capabilities and ensure alignment with our business strategy. The integration of digital technologies and the enhancement of our IT architecture are fundamental to our operational efficiency and overall firm performance. Our ability to leverage technology resources effectively is essential for maintaining competitive advantage and responding to market dynamics. We continue to invest in our technology portfolio to support business innovation and transformation, ensuring that we remain agile in a rapidly evolving business environment.

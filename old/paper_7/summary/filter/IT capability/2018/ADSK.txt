The discussion in our management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contains forward-looking statements regarding our business strategies, including expectations regarding product capability and acceptance. Autodesk has made a strategic decision to shift its business model from selling perpetual licenses and maintenance plans to selling subscriptions, which includes a hybrid of desktop software and cloud functionality, providing a collaborative design workflow for users. Our cloud offerings provide tools to streamline design, collaboration, building, manufacturing, and data management processes, which are essential for enhancing operational efficiency and aligning with business needs. We believe that customer adoption of these new offerings will continue to grow as customers take advantage of the scalable computing power and flexibility provided through these services. Additionally, we have strengthened our construction solutions through both organic and inorganic investments, which include acquisitions aimed at expanding our product portfolio and enhancing our technology capabilities. The broadened product portfolio will help us expand our presence with subcontractors and tradespeople, thereby improving our competitive positioning in the market. Our strategy includes improving product functionality and expanding offerings through internal development and acquisitions, which are critical for maintaining operational flexibility and enhancing firm capabilities. We have established the Autodesk Forge program to support innovators in building solutions that facilitate the development of a connected ecosystem for design and manufacturing, which underscores our commitment to leveraging technology resources and capabilities. Our extensive network of distributors, resellers, and third-party developers provides us with a broad reach into volume markets, enhancing our organizational effectiveness and market responsiveness. We continuously review our assumptions and estimates regarding product capabilities and market dynamics to ensure alignment with our strategic goals. The transition to a subscription model has involved significant changes in our revenue recognition practices, which are essential for maintaining compliance and ensuring accurate financial reporting. Our investments in technology infrastructure and digital transformation initiatives are designed to optimize our internal processes and improve our overall business performance. We recognize the importance of mobilizing and deploying IT-based resources in combination with other organizational capabilities to create business value and enhance our competitive advantage. The integration of technology into our business processes is critical for achieving operational efficiency and supporting our strategic management practices. We anticipate that our channel mix will continue to evolve as we scale our online business and adapt to changing market conditions. The successful execution of our strategy depends on our ability to leverage our technology capabilities, manage our resources effectively, and respond to external influences in a rapidly changing business environment.

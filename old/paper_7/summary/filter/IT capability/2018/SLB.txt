The following discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements, including, without limitation, statements relating to our plans, strategies, objectives, expectations, intentions and resources. Schlumberger's financial performance in 2018 was driven largely by North America, where revenue of $12.0 billion grew 26% year-over-year, despite the steep fall-off in activity during the fourth quarter of the year. This growth was driven by increased land activity that primarily benefited Schlumberger's OneStim business, where revenue grew 41%. Full-year 2018 international revenue of $20.4 billion was essentially flat compared with 2017. During the third quarter of 2018, international revenue grew faster than North America revenue for the first time since 2014, marking the beginning of a positive activity trend after three consecutive years of declining revenue. This was driven by the increased activity of national oil companies ("NOCs"), as they began to invest in longer-term resource development following a sustained period of deep underinvestment and declining production. Schlumberger expects solid, single-digit growth in the international markets, while in North America land, the increased cost of capital and focus on aligning investments closer to free cash flow has introduced more uncertainty to the outlook for both drilling and production activity. The combination of these factors, together with a large sell-off in the equity markets due to concerns around global growth and increasing U.S. interest rates, created a near-perfect storm to close out 2018. Schlumberger is seeing clear signs that exploration and production investments are starting to normalize and reflect a more sustainable financial stewardship of the global resource base. Future investments will likely be much closer to the level that can be covered by free cash flow. The dramatic fall in oil prices in the fourth quarter was largely driven by higher-than-expected U.S. shale production as a result of the surge in activity earlier in the year. Schlumberger's operational efficiency improvements and improved pricing were significant contributors to the financial performance, reflecting the importance of mobilizing and deploying IT-based resources in combination with leveraging the value of other resources and capabilities. The company has made substantial investments in technology capabilities to enhance its service offerings and operational flexibility. The deployment of additional hydraulic fracturing capacity, market share gains, and technology integration have been pivotal in driving revenue growth. Schlumberger's strategic resource allocation and management practices have focused on aligning investments with business needs and market dynamics, which are essential for maintaining competitive advantage in a rapidly changing environment. The company's ability to provide data and information to users with appropriate levels of accuracy, timeliness, reliability, security, and confidentiality is critical in supporting business strategies and enhancing operational effectiveness. Schlumberger's IT capabilities have evolved to encompass the coordination of the firm's assets and internal processes, which are vital for optimizing performance outcomes and supporting organizational goals. The emphasis on information management capability underscores the importance of leveraging technology resources to enhance business value and respond to shifting market demands.

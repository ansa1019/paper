EOG Resources, Inc. operates under a consistent business and operational strategy that focuses predominantly on maximizing the rate of return on investment of capital by controlling operating and capital costs and maximizing reserve recoveries. This strategy is intended to enhance the generation of cash flow and earnings from each unit of production on a cost-effective basis, allowing EOG to deliver long-term production growth while maintaining a strong balance sheet. EOG's efforts to identify plays with large reserve potential have proven successful, and the company continues to drill numerous wells in large acreage plays, contributing substantially to its crude oil and liquids-rich natural gas production. EOG emphasizes applying its horizontal drilling and completion expertise to unconventional crude oil and liquids-rich reservoirs, focusing on increasing drilling, completion, and operating efficiencies gained in prior years. The company evaluates potential crude oil and liquids-rich natural gas exploration and development prospects and seeks opportunities to add drilling inventory through leasehold acquisitions and tactical acquisitions. EOG's capital structure strategy includes maintaining a strong balance sheet with a consistently below-average debt-to-total capitalization ratio compared to its peer group. In 2018, EOG funded $6.6 billion in exploration and development and other property, plant, and equipment expenditures, primarily by utilizing net cash provided from its operating activities. The anticipated capital expenditures for 2019 are estimated to range from approximately $6.1 billion to $6.5 billion, focusing on U.S. crude oil drilling activities. EOG has significant flexibility regarding financing alternatives, including borrowings under its commercial paper program and other uncommitted credit facilities, which supports its operational needs. The company continues to believe it has one of the strongest prospect inventories in its history and will make acquisitions that bolster existing drilling programs or offer incremental exploration and production opportunities. EOG's operating revenues increased significantly in 2018, reflecting higher wellhead revenues driven by increased production and favorable pricing. The company recognizes the importance of mobilizing and deploying IT-based resources in combination with leveraging the value of other resources and capabilities to support business needs. EOG's operational efficiencies and strategic resource allocation are critical in transforming the firm into a competitive force, enhancing its ability to respond to market dynamics and consumer demands. The integration of technology capabilities into its operational framework is essential for optimizing performance and achieving business objectives, including maintaining operational flexibility and improving decision-making speed. EOG's approach to information management emphasizes providing accurate, timely, and reliable data to support strategic decisions and enhance overall organizational effectiveness. The company remains committed to continuous improvement in its operations, focusing on innovation and efficiency to navigate the complexities of the energy market and sustain its competitive positioning.

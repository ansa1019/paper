The da Vinci surgical systems enable surgeons to extend the benefits of minimally invasive surgery (MIS) by using computational, robotic, and imaging technologies, which represent a significant advancement in the coordination of a firmâ€™s assets and internal processes. Our technology is designed to provide surgeons with a range of articulation of the surgical instruments used in the surgical field, enhancing operational efficiency and transforming surgical practices. We focus on making our technology easy and safe to use, which aligns with the evolving IT capabilities that encompass the coordination of interfirm transactions and relationships. The da Vinci surgical systems include a surgeon's console, imaging electronics, and computational hardware and software, which collectively enhance the functionality and effectiveness of surgical procedures. We have commercialized multiple generations of da Vinci surgical systems, each designed to optimize performance and improve clinical outcomes, reflecting our commitment to innovation and technology deployment. Our integrated ecosystem aims to decrease variability in surgery by offering dependable, consistent functionality and user experiences, which is critical for meeting changing business needs and directions. The adoption of robotic-assisted surgery using the da Vinci surgical system has the potential to grow for those procedures that offer greater patient value than non-da Vinci alternatives, indicating a strategic alignment with market dynamics and consumer choice. We have invested significantly in research and development, focusing on advanced imaging and analytics, advanced instrumentation, and future generations of robotics, which are essential for enhancing our organizational capabilities and maintaining a competitive advantage in the market. Our revenue model includes placements of da Vinci surgical systems in sale or lease arrangements, generating recurring revenue from instruments, accessories, and service, which reflects our operational flexibility and resource allocation strategies. The growth of instrument and accessory revenue has been driven by continued procedure adoption, highlighting the importance of effective information management capability in providing data and information to users with appropriate levels of accuracy and timeliness. The installed base of da Vinci surgical systems has increased, supporting our service revenue growth, which is influenced by the larger installed base producing service revenue. We have also established a joint venture to research and develop robotic-assisted catheter-based medical devices, further expanding our technology portfolio and enhancing our strategic resources. Our commitment to compliance and regulatory activities ensures that we maintain the necessary clearances to market our products effectively, which is vital for sustaining our business performance and operational efficiency. The competitive landscape requires us to continuously adapt and innovate, leveraging our IT capabilities to respond to market restructuring and external influences while focusing on value creation and performance outcomes.

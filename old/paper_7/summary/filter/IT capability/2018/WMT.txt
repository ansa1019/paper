We invest in technology and process improvements to increase productivity, manage inventory and reduce costs. Our business is seasonal to a certain extent due to calendar events and national and religious holidays, as well as weather patterns. We made certain strategic portfolio decisions, including the acquisition of 81 percent of the outstanding shares of Flipkart Private Limited in August 2018, which has impacted fiscal 2019 net income. The retail industry operates in a highly competitive omni-channel retail environment, facing strong sales competition from various types of stores and ecommerce businesses. We are influenced by factors including competitive pressures, consumer preferences, and technological advancements. We define our financial framework as strategic capital allocation, focusing on the most productive growth opportunities, including ecommerce and technology investments. Our objective of prioritizing strong, efficient growth means we will focus on increasing comparable store and club sales, accelerating ecommerce sales growth, and expanding omni-channel initiatives. We measure operating discipline through expense leverage, which we define as net sales growing at a faster rate than operating expenses. For fiscal 2019, operating expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased, driven by strong sales performance and productivity improvements, although partially offset by additional investments in ecommerce and technology. We allocate more capital to ecommerce, technology, supply chain, and store remodels, aligning with our initiatives to improve customer propositions and create a seamless omni-channel experience. Our total capital expenditures increased slightly compared to the prior year, with significant allocations to ecommerce and technology. We believe our return on capital will improve over time as we execute our financial framework. We assess returns on assets using metrics such as return on assets and return on investment, which help evaluate how effectively we are deploying our assets. Our cash flows provided by operating activities have historically supplied us with a significant source of liquidity, allowing us to invest in activities that support long-term growth. We expect to add approximately 300 new stores in Walmart International and make strategic investments in technology and ecommerce capabilities. The increase in net cash used in investing activities for fiscal 2019 was primarily due to the payment for Flipkart. We operate with a working capital deficit due to our efficient use of cash in funding operations and consistent access to capital markets. Our investments in technology and process improvements are aimed at enhancing operational efficiency and supporting our strategic objectives. The decline in net cash provided by operating activities for fiscal 2019 was primarily due to timing of vendor payments, partially offset by lower tax payments. Our ecommerce sales positively contributed to comparable sales, indicating the importance of technology in enhancing customer experience and driving sales growth. The improvements in fiscal 2019 were partially offset by additional investments in ecommerce and technology, reflecting our commitment to leveraging IT capabilities to support business needs and enhance competitive positioning.

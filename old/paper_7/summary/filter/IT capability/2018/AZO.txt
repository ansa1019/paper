During fiscal 2018, we achieved record net income of $1.338 billion, a 4.4% increase over the prior year, and sales growth of $332.4 million, a 3.1% increase over the prior year, driven by our initiatives aimed at improving our ability to meet customer needs and accelerate commercial growth. We believe fluctuations in gas prices impact our customers' disposable income, which is a significant external influence on our business performance. Our business is somewhat seasonal, with sales typically higher in the spring and summer months, and our sales mix can be impacted by severe or unusual weather. We have experienced a close correlation between our net sales and the number of miles driven, indicating that operational flexibility and responsiveness to market dynamics are crucial for our performance. Our investments in technology are expected to enhance our supply chain infrastructure and existing locations, reflecting our commitment to operational efficiency and strategic resource allocation. We plan to continue leveraging our inventory purchases and negotiating extended payment terms from suppliers, which supports our high accounts payable to inventory ratio. Our ability to manage these relationships effectively is essential for maintaining our competitive advantage and ensuring the reliability of our information management systems. We have also initiated strategic tests focused on increasing inventory availability, which demonstrates our commitment to process optimization and innovation in response to consumer demands. Our capital expenditures decreased by approximately 6% compared to the prior year, and we anticipate increasing investments in technology to support our business transformation and enhance our operational capabilities. The effective management of our resources, including IT capabilities, is vital in supporting our business strategies and achieving our organizational goals. Our financial commitments reflect our ongoing investment in technology and infrastructure, which are critical for sustaining our competitive positioning in the market. As we continue to navigate regulatory changes and market pressures, our focus on enhancing our IT resources and capabilities will be integral to our long-term success and resilience in a dynamic business environment.

The management and franchise segment generates its revenue from management and franchise fees charged to third-party hotel owners and includes fees for managing owned and leased hotels, which involve the deployment of technology resources such as our reservation system, marketing, and information technology services. Our strategic objectives include the continued expansion of our global footprint and fee-based business, which relies on the ability to evaluate the economic viability of properties based on geographic location and the credit quality of third-party owners. The success of our management and franchise business depends on our ability to perform under contracts and maintain good relationships with third-party owners and franchisees, which can support our growth and enhance operational efficiency. The increase in management and franchise fees is attributed to the addition of new managed and franchised properties and increases in revenue per available room (RevPAR) at comparable hotels, which reflects our capability to leverage technology and operational resources effectively. Our relationships with third-party owners and franchisees also generate opportunities for property development, which can enhance our competitive positioning and market responsiveness. The effectiveness of our technology deployment, including internet and reservation systems, is critical for maintaining customer relationships and optimizing business processes. Our capital expenditures for technology initiatives, including software development, are aimed at enhancing our operational capabilities and supporting our business strategies.

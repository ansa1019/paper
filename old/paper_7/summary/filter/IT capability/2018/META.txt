In 2018, we continued to invest, based on our roadmap, in long-term technology initiatives, such as connectivity, artificial intelligence, and augmented and virtual reality, that we believe will further our mission to give people the power to build community and bring the world closer together. We anticipate that additional investments in expanding our data center capacity, network infrastructure, and office facilities will continue to drive significant year-over-year expense growth. The increase in operational expenses related to our data centers and technical infrastructure was a significant factor in the growth of our costs. We plan to continue to hire software engineers and other technical employees to support our research and development initiatives, reflecting our commitment to enhancing our IT capabilities. Our advertising revenue growth was driven by an increase in the number of ads delivered and the average price per ad, influenced by user engagement and the quality, relevance, and performance of those ads. The increase in user engagement was supported by our investments in technology and infrastructure, which enabled us to deliver more relevant and effective ads to marketers. Our capital expenditures were primarily directed towards investments in data centers, servers, network infrastructure, and office buildings, which are essential for supporting user growth and increased user engagement. The majority of our advertising revenue is generated from mobile devices, indicating the importance of our technological capabilities in capturing market opportunities. We also recognize that trends in user metrics, such as daily active users and monthly active users, directly affect our revenue and financial results by influencing the number of ads we are able to show and the value of our ads to marketers. Our ability to mobilize and deploy IT-based resources in combination with leveraging the value of other resources and capabilities has become crucial in transforming our firm into a competitive force. The strategic allocation of resources towards enhancing our IT infrastructure and capabilities is essential for maintaining our competitive advantage in a rapidly evolving digital landscape. As we continue to expand our technology portfolio, we expect to enhance our operational efficiency and organizational effectiveness, which are critical for meeting business needs and achieving our organizational goals. The integration of technology into our business processes is a key driver of our performance and will support our ongoing efforts to innovate and respond to market dynamics. Our IT governance structures will play a vital role in ensuring that our investments in technology align with our strategic objectives and enhance our overall business value. We are committed to leveraging our IT capabilities to optimize our operations, improve our performance metrics, and enhance our customer relationships, thereby creating a sustainable competitive advantage in the marketplace.

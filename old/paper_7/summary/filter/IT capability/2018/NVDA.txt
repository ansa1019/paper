The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with other cautionary statements and risks described elsewhere in this annual report on Form 10-K. Nvidia has evolved the GPU into a computer brain at the intersection of VR, HPC, and AI, reflecting the importance of mobilizing and deploying IT-based resources in combination with leveraging the value of other resources and capabilities. Our GPU product brands are aimed at specialized markets including GeForce for gamers and Quadro for designers, which demonstrates our focus on technology functionalities that support business needs. The datacenter revenue was led by strong sales of our Volta architecture-based products, indicating a strategic resource allocation towards high-performance computing and AI. We believe that customers across broad-based vertical markets became increasingly cautious due to economic uncertainty, impacting our market response and visibility. Our revenue growth in gaming, professional visualization, datacenter, and automotive reflects the application of IT capabilities to further organizational goals. The introduction of the Nvidia Drive autopilot level 2+ automated driving system and the Nvidia Jetson AGX Xavier module illustrates our commitment to transforming business processes and enhancing operational efficiency through digital technologies. Our research and development expenses increased significantly, driven by employee additions and infrastructure costs, which are critical for maintaining our competitive advantage and operational flexibility. The gross margin reflects our continued shift toward higher-value platforms, which supports our strategic alignment with market dynamics and consumer demands. As a fabless semiconductor company, we must make commitments to purchase inventory based on forecasts of future customer demand, which requires effective information management capabilities. Our investment in technology infrastructure and digital transformation initiatives is essential for achieving performance gains and operational efficiency. The increase in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities indicates our capability to mobilize resources effectively to support ongoing operations and strategic investments. Our focus on innovation partnerships and technology deployment is vital for maintaining market agility and responding to competitive actions. The overall net effect on our gross margin was impacted by inventory provisions, which are influenced by changes in market conditions and customer requirements. Our ability to provide data and information to users with appropriate levels of accuracy, timeliness, and reliability is crucial for enhancing customer relationships and supporting business value. The strategic decisions made in response to environmental factors and regulatory contexts are integral to our organizational transformation and performance outcomes. The introduction of new technologies and the development of advanced platforms underscore the importance of IT governance and capability enhancement in driving business innovation and value creation.

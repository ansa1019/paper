During fiscal 2018, we have leveraged our scale and relationships to control increases in land and construction costs, which underscores the importance of mobilizing and deploying IT-based resources in combination with other resources and capabilities. Our operating strategy focuses on leveraging our financial and competitive position to increase returns on inventory investments and generate strong profitability and cash flows while managing risk and maintaining financial flexibility to make opportunistic strategic investments. We believe our business is well positioned with a broad geographic footprint, diverse product offerings, and a strong balance sheet, which enhances our operational efficiency and supports our strategic resource allocation. Our acquisition of Forestar advances our strategy of increasing access to optioned land and lot positions, which is critical for enhancing operational efficiency and returns. The integration of technology resources into our operations is essential for optimizing the management of our inventory investments across our operating markets. We routinely enter into land/lot option contracts to purchase land or developed residential lots, which allows us to manage our inventory relative to demand in each of our markets. Our homebuilding segment's land and lot position and homes in inventory are managed to align with market demand, ensuring that we can respond effectively to changing consumer preferences and market conditions. The ability to provide data and information to users with appropriate levels of accuracy, timeliness, reliability, and security is crucial for supporting our business strategies and work processes. We continually evaluate our land and lot supply, and fluctuations in revenues and profitability from land sales occur based on how we manage our inventory levels in various markets. Our financial services operations, which include DHI Mortgage, are directly related to the number of homes closed by our homebuilding operations, emphasizing the interconnectedness of our business processes. The volume of loans originated by our mortgage operations is directly correlated with our home sales, highlighting the importance of effective information management and operational flexibility. We expect to maintain our ratio of homebuilding debt to total capital below 35%, which reflects our commitment to strategic resource allocation and operational efficiency. Our strategic initiatives include improving the efficiency of our land development, construction, sales, and other key operational activities, which are essential for enhancing our competitive advantage and overall firm performance. We recognize that our future results could be negatively affected by weakening economic conditions, decreased home affordability, or tightening of mortgage lending standards, which necessitates a proactive approach to managing our operational capabilities and strategic investments. The integration of IT capabilities into our operational framework is vital for ensuring that we can adapt to market dynamics and maintain our position as a competitive force in the homebuilding industry.

Digital Realty Trust, Inc. focuses on owning, acquiring, developing, and operating data centers, which are essential to meet the growing demand for hyper-scale and public cloud solutions. The company believes that the growth in data center demand and the technology-related real estate industry will continue to outpace the overall economy. A significant component of its internal growth is anticipated through the development of existing space held for development, acquisition of land for future development, and acquisition of new properties. The company targets high-quality, strategically located properties containing the physical and connectivity infrastructure that supports the applications and operations of data center and technology industry customers. Digital Realty Trust has developed detailed, standardized procedures for evaluating new real estate investments to ensure that they meet financial, technical, and other criteria. The company emphasizes the importance of mobilizing and deploying IT-based resources in combination with leveraging the value of other resources and capabilities to transform into a competitive force. The company’s IT capabilities represent the application of physical or intangible IT resources such as technology, knowledge, practices, relationships, management skills, business process understanding, and human resources to further organizational goals. The company has made significant investments in its data centers, which include fully redundant electrical supply systems, multiple power feeds, above-standard cooling systems, and extensive in-building communications cabling. As of December 31, 2018, the company operated 214 data centers, with approximately 34.5 million rentable square feet, including 3.4 million square feet of space under active development and 2.1 million square feet of space held for development. The company expects to incur significant capital expenditures for its development programs, which are anticipated to be funded through available cash and equity and debt capital. The ability to grow earnings depends in part on developing space and leasing development space at favorable rates. The company also recognizes that economic downturns or adverse developments in the corporate data center and broader technology industries could reduce demand for data center space. Digital Realty Trust's strategic management practices include maintaining a conservative capital structure and targeting a debt-to-adjusted EBITDA ratio at or less than 5.5x. The company actively manages and leases its assets to increase cash flow and may continue to build out its development portfolio when justified by anticipated demand and returns. The company’s ability to maintain or improve occupancy rates and lease currently available space is crucial for generating rental income. Digital Realty Trust is committed to maximizing sustainable long-term growth in earnings and funds from operations per share and unit, cash flow, and returns to stockholders through prudent capital allocation and diversifying product offerings. The company’s strategic decisions are influenced by market dynamics, competitive positioning, and the evolving landscape of digital technologies, which are integral to its operational efficiency and organizational effectiveness.

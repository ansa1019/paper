MetLife's enterprise strategy is founded on the principle of one metlife, where digital and simplified are the key enablers of its four strategic cornerstones: optimizing value and risk, driving operational excellence, enabling distribution channels through digitalization, and undertaking a targeted approach to find the right solutions for the right customers. This strategy enhances the company's ability to focus on the right markets, build clear differentiators, and continue to make the right investments to deliver shareholder value. The company recognizes that larger market participants tend to have the capacity to invest in analytics, distribution, and information technology, which are fundamental for sustained profitable growth. The life insurance industry remains highly competitive, with product development focused on differentiation leading to intense competition regarding product features and services. MetLife is well-positioned to compete in this environment, emphasizing financial strength, technology efficiency, and organizational agility as significant differentiators. The company employs disciplined asset/liability management strategies, including the use of interest rate derivatives, to mitigate risks associated with a sustained low interest rate environment. The management of investment portfolio and hedging market risks with derivatives is crucial, as the company utilizes various strategies to manage risks, including the use of derivatives to hedge certain risks, such as changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, credit spreads, and equity market levels. The company actively evaluates market risk hedging needs and strategies to ensure its free cash flow and capital objectives are met under a range of market conditions. The use of technology is integral to the company's operations, with a focus on optimizing business processes and enhancing operational efficiency. The company also emphasizes the importance of mobilizing and deploying IT-based resources in combination with leveraging the value of other resources and capabilities. The management believes that free cash flow is a key determinant of common stock dividends and common stock repurchases, which are influenced by the accuracy of assumptions about future economic and business conditions. MetLife's investment portfolio is heavily weighted toward fixed income investments, which are generally well-suited for matching the cash flow and duration of insurance liabilities. The company continues to monitor political and economic conditions that might contribute to global market volatility and impact its business operations, investment portfolio, and derivatives. The management's ongoing production and enhancement of the economic capital model ensures that it remains consistent with emerging industry practice standards. The company recognizes that its business and results of operations are materially affected by conditions in the global capital markets and the economy generally, and stressed conditions can have an adverse effect due to the sensitivity of its insurance liabilities and derivatives to changing market factors. The company is committed to maintaining a liquidity buffer and ensuring that it has access to ample liquidity to meet business requirements under current market conditions and reasonably possible stress scenarios.

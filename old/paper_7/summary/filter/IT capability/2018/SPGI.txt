We are a leading provider of transparent and independent ratings, benchmarks, analytics, and data to the capital and commodity markets worldwide. Our operations consist of four reportable segments: S&P Global Ratings, S&P Global Market Intelligence, S&P Global Platts, and S&P Dow Jones Indices. In 2018, we acquired Kensho Technologies Inc., a provider of next-generation analytics, artificial intelligence, machine learning, and data visualization systems, enhancing our technology capabilities and supporting our strategic priorities. Our strategy includes delivering a modern, digital, integrated platform and user experience that enhances customer value, transforming technology infrastructure to support growth, and developing an enterprise-wide data strategy leveraging machine learning and data science. We are focused on operational excellence, continuous innovation, and high-performance culture driven by best-in-class talent. The market intelligence segment is designed to help investment professionals and government agencies track performance, generate alpha, and understand competitive and industry dynamics. It includes a product suite that provides data, analytics, and third-party research for global finance professionals. The segment has seen revenue growth driven by annualized contract value growth in the market intelligence desktop and global risk services products. Our technology infrastructure is being enhanced to improve cost efficiency and mitigate cyber risk, while we adopt core management systems and tools across the company to improve prioritization and agility. The integration of recent acquisitions is aimed at expanding analytical capabilities and offerings, with a focus on leveraging strong content heritage to enhance the customer experience. We are committed to enhancing our risk, internal control, and compliance culture, which is crucial for maintaining operational efficiency and supporting business transformation. Our financial performance is closely linked to our ability to mobilize and deploy IT-based resources in combination with leveraging the value of other resources and capabilities. The competitive landscape necessitates continuous adaptation to market dynamics, and our investments in technology are aimed at maintaining our competitive advantage. The regulatory environment presents challenges that could impact our operations; however, we are actively engaged in compliance and governance to navigate these complexities. Our commitment to innovation partnerships and strategic resource allocation is essential for sustaining growth and improving organizational capabilities. We believe that our IT capabilities, including information management and data analytics, are critical in supporting business needs and enhancing decision-making processes. The focus on developing a robust technology portfolio and optimizing processes is integral to our strategy for achieving long-term revenue growth and operational excellence.

Visa is a global payments technology company that enables fast, secure, and reliable electronic payments across more than 200 countries and territories, facilitating global commerce through the transfer of value and information among a network of consumers, merchants, financial institutions, businesses, strategic partners, and government entities. Our advanced transaction processing network, Visanet, enables authorization, clearing, and settlement of payment transactions, allowing us to provide our financial institution and merchant clients a wide range of products, platforms, and value-added services. Our business performance reflects solid global consumer spending growth, supported by favorable economic conditions and tempered by volatility in some emerging markets. We recorded net operating revenues of $20.6 billion for fiscal 2018, an increase of 12% over the prior year, primarily reflecting continued growth in processed transactions and nominal payments volume. Total operating expenses for fiscal 2018 were $7.7 billion, driven by a higher litigation provision and continued investments to support our business growth. Our financial results are impacted by overall economic conditions and consumer spending, and our operating revenues are primarily generated from payments volume on Visa products for purchased goods and services, as well as the number of transactions processed on our network. Data processing revenues are earned for authorization, clearing, settlement, network access, and other maintenance and support services that facilitate transaction and information processing among our clients globally. Our capital expenditures increased during fiscal 2018 due to investments in technology, infrastructure, and growth initiatives, and we expect to continue investing in technology assets and payments system infrastructure to support our digital solutions and core business initiatives. We have established policies and control procedures to ensure that estimates and assumptions regarding our financial performance are appropriately governed and applied consistently. Our liquidity management involves evaluating cash requirements for current operations, commitments, development activities, and capital expenditures, with a focus on providing adequate liquidity to cover operating expenditures and ensuring timely completion of payments settlement activities. We maintain a commercial paper program to support our working capital requirements and for other general corporate purposes, and we have an unsecured revolving credit facility which provides additional liquidity. Our investment portfolio is designed to invest excess cash in securities that enable us to meet our working capital and liquidity needs, primarily consisting of debt securities issued by the U.S. Treasury or U.S. government-sponsored agencies. The transition tax resulting from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act requires us to include certain untaxed foreign earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries in our fiscal 2018 taxable income, which will be paid over a period of eight years. Our business is also affected by various legal and regulatory proceedings, and we are parties to litigation that may impact our liquidity needs. We continue to assess our liquidity position and potential sources of supplemental liquidity in view of our operating performance, current economic and capital market conditions, and other relevant circumstances.

Information technology capabilities have been evolving in scope to more comprehensively encompass the coordination of a firm’s assets and internal processes and their interfirm transactions and relationships. The ability to maintain a constructive regulatory environment, to maintain and grow sales and customers, and to effectively manage and secure timely recovery of costs are critical for the southern company system's electricity and natural gas businesses. These costs include those related to projected long-term demand growth, stringent environmental standards, reliability, and capital expenditures, including constructing new electric generating plants, expanding and improving electric transmission and distribution systems, and updating and expanding natural gas distribution systems. The traditional electric operating companies and natural gas distribution utilities have various regulatory mechanisms that operate to address cost recovery. Effectively operating pursuant to these regulatory mechanisms and appropriately balancing required costs and capital expenditures with customer prices will continue to challenge the southern company system for the foreseeable future. The financial success of the southern company system is directly tied to customer satisfaction, which includes outstanding service, high reliability, and competitive prices. Management uses customer satisfaction surveys and reliability indicators to evaluate results. The strategy is to create value through various transactions, including acquisitions, dispositions, and sales of partnership interests, development and construction of new generating facilities, and entry into power purchase agreements primarily with investor-owned utilities, independent power producers, municipalities, electric cooperatives, and other load-serving entities. Southern company gas is involved in several complementary businesses, including gas pipeline investments, wholesale gas services, and gas marketing services. The southern company system continues to focus on several key performance indicators, including customer satisfaction, plant availability, electric and natural gas system reliability, execution of major construction projects, and earnings per share. The ability to recover costs related to environmental laws and regulations is essential for maintaining operational flexibility and ensuring business value. The southern company system's commitment to environmental compliance and greenhouse gas strategies reflects its focus on sustainable practices. The company anticipates substantial expenditures associated with ash pond closure and groundwater monitoring under the coal combustion residuals rule, which are reflected in its asset retirement obligations. The ultimate impact of environmental laws and regulations will depend on various factors, including state adoption and implementation of requirements, the availability and cost of any deployed technology, and the outcome of pending and future legal challenges. The southern company system's ability to achieve its goals of reducing carbon emissions and transitioning to a lower greenhouse gas emitting economy will also depend on supportive national energy policies, low natural gas prices, and the development and advancement of relevant energy technologies. The southern company system's construction program is currently estimated to total approximately $8.0 billion for 2019, with significant investments planned for environmental compliance and infrastructure improvements.
Information technology capabilities have been evolving in scope to more comprehensively encompass the coordination of a firm’s assets and internal processes and their interfirm transactions and relationships. IT capability is a firm's ability to acquire, deploy, combine, and reconfigure IT resources in support and enhancement of business strategies and work processes. The notion of IT capability underscores the importance of mobilizing and deploying IT-based resources in combination with, and leveraging the value of, other resources and capabilities. A firm’s IT capabilities represent the application of physical or intangible IT resources such as technology, knowledge, practices, relationships, management skills, business process understanding, and human resources to further organizational goals. The regulatory treatment of certain impacts of the tax reform legislation remains subject to the discretion of the relevant regulatory bodies. Southern Company Gas' capital investments are currently estimated to total $1.6 billion for 2019, with various factors including changes in business conditions, environmental laws and regulations, and the cost and efficiency of construction labor affecting actual costs. Southern Company Gas has various mechanisms, such as weather normalization mechanisms and weather derivative instruments, that limit exposure to weather changes within typical ranges in its natural gas distribution utilities' service territories. The natural gas distribution utilities are subject to regulations and oversight by their respective state regulatory agencies, which set the rates utilities are permitted to charge customers based on allowable costs, including a reasonable return on equity. Southern Company Gas plans to finance future cash needs in excess of its operating cash flows primarily through external securities issuances, equity contributions from Southern Company, and borrowings from financial institutions. The ultimate impact of environmental laws and regulations will depend on various factors, including state adoption and implementation of requirements, the availability and cost of any deployed technology, and the outcome of pending and/or future legal challenges. Southern Company Gas' operations are regulated by state and federal environmental agencies through a variety of laws and regulations governing air, water, land, and protection of other natural resources. Southern Company Gas maintains a comprehensive environmental compliance strategy to assess upcoming requirements and compliance costs associated with these environmental laws and regulations. The ability to recover costs related to capital expenditures will depend upon regulatory approvals, prevailing market conditions, and other factors. Southern Company Gas has established credit policies to determine and monitor the creditworthiness of counterparties, as well as the quality of pledged collateral. The assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement requires judgment and may affect the valuation of fair value assets and liabilities and their placement within the fair value hierarchy. Changes in the derivatives' fair value are recognized concurrently in earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met. Southern Company Gas uses derivative instruments primarily to reduce the impact of changes in the price of natural gas and to hedge against warmer-than-normal weather and interest rates. The ultimate outcome of various matters, including regulatory and litigation-related issues, cannot be determined at this time, but could have a material impact on Southern Company Gas' financial statements.

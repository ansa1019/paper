Digital Realty Trust, Inc. focuses on owning, acquiring, developing, and operating data centers, believing that the growth in data center demand and the technology-related real estate industry will continue to outpace the overall economy. The company targets high-quality, strategically located properties that contain the physical and connectivity infrastructure supporting the applications and operations of data center and technology industry customers. As of December 31, 2017, the portfolio included 205 data centers, with approximately 32.1 million rentable square feet, including 2.7 million square feet of space under active development and 1.7 million square feet of space held for development. The company has developed detailed, standardized procedures for evaluating new real estate investments to ensure they meet financial, technical, and other criteria, which underscores the importance of mobilizing and deploying IT-based resources in combination with leveraging the value of other resources and capabilities. The ability to maintain or improve occupancy rates and lease currently available space is critical to generating rental income, which depends on various factors, including market rates for data center space and the demand for technology-related real estate. The company’s expertise in data center construction and operations enables it to lease space at a premium, particularly for its turn-key flex® product, which provides move-in-ready space for the placement of computer and network equipment. The company anticipates that its current and future internal growth will be significantly driven by the development of existing space held for development and the acquisition of new properties. The operational flexibility to build out development portfolios when justified by anticipated demand and returns is a key aspect of the company's strategy. The company also recognizes that changes in industry practices or technology may impact demand for physical data center space, as advancements in virtualization technology or more efficient computing devices could render existing facilities obsolete. Furthermore, the company is committed to maintaining a conservative capital structure, targeting a debt-to-adjusted EBITDA ratio at or less than 5.5x and ensuring that its financial activities align with its strategic objectives. The ability to effectively support business needs through IT capabilities has become essential in transforming the firm into a competitive force. The company’s operational efficiency and organizational effectiveness are enhanced by its focus on strategic resource allocation and the integration of technology capabilities into its business processes. The management of data centers requires significant capital investment, and the company expects to incur substantial capital expenditures for development programs, which are funded through available cash and equity and debt capital. The company’s financial performance is influenced by global market and economic conditions, which may affect its ability to access capital and meet liquidity requirements. The strategic alignment of its technology infrastructure with business objectives is crucial for sustaining growth and enhancing firm performance in the competitive landscape of the data center industry.

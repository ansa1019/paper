The discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations emphasize the importance of mobilizing and deploying IT-based resources in combination with leveraging the value of other resources and capabilities. Our operational and financial metrics assist us in managing our business, reflecting the impact of different global economic environments on our reporting units. The estimation of fair value utilizing discounted expected future cash flows includes numerous uncertainties which require significant judgment when making assumptions about expected revenues, operating costs, and the competitive environment. We continuously consider opportunities to enter into contracts for building additional ships, which may involve strategic alliances that could be financed through various means including cash flows from operations. Our business model allows for substantial cash flows from operations, which supports our ability to meet operational, investing, and financing needs. We have committed unsecured financing arrangements covering 80% of the cost of new ship orders, which are part of our strategy to enhance operational efficiency and market responsiveness. The increase in onboard revenue is attributable to higher spending per passenger, driven by our revenue-enhancing initiatives, including internet and telecommunication services, which reflect our focus on technology deployment and customer relationships. The significant deferred drydock costs consist of activities necessary to maintain the vessel's class certification, highlighting the coordination of internal processes and external relationships. Our liquidity position, bolstered by cash flows from operations and available credit facilities, is critical for funding our capital expenditures and debt repayments. We have a working capital deficit primarily due to advance passenger ticket receipts, which remain a current liability until the sailing date, demonstrating the integration of operational processes and financial activities. The introduction of new ships and upgrades to existing hardware through fleet modernization programs illustrates our commitment to business transformation and innovation. The qualitative assessment of our reporting units indicates that the estimated fair value exceeds carrying value, reflecting our operational capabilities and market positioning. Our strategic resource allocation decisions are informed by the need to maintain a competitive advantage and ensure operational flexibility in a dynamic market environment. The focus on enhancing our IT capabilities is evident in our efforts to improve information management and operational efficiency, which are essential for achieving our organizational goals and sustaining firm performance.

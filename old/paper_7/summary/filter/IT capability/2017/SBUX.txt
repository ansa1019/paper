During fiscal 2017, Starbucks demonstrated the strength of its global business model and the ability to make disciplined investments in its business and partners, which included increased partner and digital investments, particularly in the Americas segment. The company’s operational priorities include driving innovation in food and beverage, accelerating the power and momentum of its digital platform, and gaining share of at-home coffee. To achieve these priorities, Starbucks plans to undertake several initiatives, including the acquisition of full ownership of its joint venture in East China and converting its Taiwan and Singapore markets to fully licensed operations. The anticipated revenue growth is expected to be driven by comparable store sales and the opening of approximately 2,300 net new Starbucks stores globally, with additional growth related to strategic initiatives. Capital expenditures for fiscal 2018 are expected to be approximately $2.0 billion, primarily for investments in new and existing stores, the developing siren retail business, and supply chain and corporate facilities. The company aims to leverage existing capabilities and further build its business in support of its growth agenda, which may include strategic acquisitions. The investment portfolio comprises highly liquid available-for-sale securities, including corporate debt securities and government obligations, managed to fund operating needs and return cash to shareholders. Starbucks has increased its commercial paper program to $3 billion, allowing for unsecured commercial paper notes to be issued for working capital needs and capital expenditures. The company’s strategic actions, such as the pending sale of its Tazo brand and related assets, are intended to focus on businesses and products with the highest growth potential. The company expects strong operational performance combined with prudent leveraging of its balance sheet to return significant value to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. The overall margin expansion in the China/Asia Pacific segment was primarily due to the transition to China's new value-added tax structure and higher income from joint venture operations. Starbucks continues to monitor and limit market-based risks, including commodity price risk and foreign currency exchange risk, through various hedging transactions. The company evaluates its property, plant, and equipment for impairment based on future cash flows and fair value estimates, which require significant management judgment. The evaluation of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment is performed annually or more frequently if circumstances indicate potential impairment. Starbucks recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the differences between financial statement carrying amounts and tax bases, requiring significant management judgment regarding applicable statutes and their interpretation. The company’s ability to realize future cash flows and asset fair values is affected by factors such as strategic initiatives, changes in economic conditions, and operating performance.

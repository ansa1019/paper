AbbVie’s strategy has focused on delivering strong financial results, advancing and investing in its pipeline, and returning value to shareholders while ensuring a strong, sustainable growth business over the long term. The company intends to continue to advance its mission by growing revenues through diversifying revenue streams, driving late-stage pipeline assets to the market, and ensuring strong commercial execution of new product launches. AbbVie remains committed to driving continued expansion of operating margins and expects to achieve this objective through continued leverage from revenue growth, productivity initiatives in supply chain, and ongoing efficiency programs to optimize manufacturing, commercial infrastructure, administrative costs, and general corporate expenses. Research and innovation are the cornerstones of AbbVie’s business as a global biopharmaceutical company, and the long-term success depends to a great extent on its ability to discover and develop innovative pharmaceutical products and acquire or collaborate on compounds currently in development by other biotechnology or pharmaceutical companies. The company has approximately 29,000 employees and operates in one business segment—pharmaceutical products. AbbVie’s financial performance in 2017 included delivering worldwide net revenues of $28.2 billion, operating earnings of $9.6 billion, and diluted earnings per share of $3.30. The company generated cash flows from operations of $10.0 billion, which AbbVie utilized to enhance its pipeline through licensing and collaboration activities, pay cash dividends to stockholders, and repurchase shares in the open market. The company’s pipeline currently includes more than 60 compounds or indications in clinical development, with more than 30 in mid- and late-stage development. AbbVie’s investment in its growth brands and pipeline assets reflects its commitment to innovation and market responsiveness. The company’s ability to mobilize and deploy IT-based resources in combination with leveraging the value of other resources and capabilities underscores the importance of IT capability in transforming AbbVie into a competitive force. The firm’s IT capabilities represent the application of physical or intangible IT resources such as technology, knowledge, practices, relationships, management skills, and business process understanding to further organizational goals. AbbVie’s strategic objectives include expanding operating margins and returning cash to shareholders via dividends and share repurchases, which are supported by its commitment to operational efficiency and effective resource allocation. The company’s financial strategies and operational practices are designed to enhance its competitive positioning and ensure that it can respond effectively to market dynamics and consumer demands. Additionally, AbbVie’s focus on research and development emphasizes the importance of innovation partnerships and strategic management practices that align with its business strategy.

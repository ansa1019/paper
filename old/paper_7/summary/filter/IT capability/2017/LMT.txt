We are a global security and aerospace company engaged in the research, design, development, manufacture, integration, and sustainment of advanced technology systems, products, and services, including information technology and cybersecurity. A significant component of our strategy is to focus on program execution, improving the quality and predictability of the delivery of our products and services, and placing security capability quickly into the hands of our customers at affordable prices. We continue to invest in technologies to fulfill new mission requirements for our customers and invest in our people to ensure we have the technical skills necessary to succeed. Our investments and acquisitions have sought to align our businesses with critical national priorities and mission areas. We routinely evaluate targets and enter into agreements regarding possible acquisitions, divestitures, ventures, and equity investments to expand or complement our current portfolio and allow access to new customers or technologies. We divested our former information systems & global solutions business, which merged with Leidos Holdings, Inc., as part of a strategic shift that had a major effect on our operations and financial results. Our aeronautics business segment is engaged in the design, development, manufacture, integration, and sustainment of advanced military aircraft, including combat and air mobility aircraft, unmanned air vehicles, and related technologies. The F-35 program, a major focus, is expected to continue production for many years, driven by commitments from the U.S. government and international partners. Our business segments, including missiles and fire control, rotary and mission systems, and space, are characterized by complex technical requirements and long-term contracts, necessitating effective management of information technology capabilities to support operational efficiency and strategic resource allocation. We account for contracts primarily using the percentage-of-completion method, requiring significant estimates and assumptions regarding costs and sales. The management of these contracts involves assessing risks, estimating contract sales and costs, and making assumptions for schedule and technical issues. We have ongoing programs that involve the development of new satellite technology and advanced military systems, which require robust information management capabilities to ensure timely and accurate data provision to support decision-making processes. Our operational flexibility is enhanced by our ability to mobilize and deploy IT-based resources in combination with other capabilities, allowing us to respond effectively to market dynamics and customer needs. The integration of technology into our business processes is critical for maintaining competitive advantage and achieving performance gains. We continuously monitor and evaluate our technology infrastructure to ensure alignment with our strategic objectives and to facilitate innovation in our product offerings. Our commitment to investing in information technology is reflected in our capital expenditures, which include significant investments in enterprise IT infrastructure and the development of internal-use software. The evolving nature of our IT capabilities underscores the importance of leveraging technology resources to enhance business value and support organizational goals.

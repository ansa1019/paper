Management's discussion and analysis includes various forward-looking statements concerning trends or events potentially affecting our business. Our operations consist of three reportable operating segments: refining & marketing; speedway; and midstream. Each of these segments is organized and managed based upon the nature of the products and services they offer. The refining & marketing segment income from operations depends largely on our refining & marketing margin and refinery throughputs. The refining & marketing margin is the difference between the prices of refined products sold and the costs of crude oil and other charge and blendstocks refined, including the costs to transport these inputs to our refineries and the costs of products purchased for resale. Our midstream segment profitability is affected by prevailing commodity prices primarily as a result of processing or conditioning at our own or third-party processing plants, purchasing and selling or gathering and transporting volumes of natural gas at index-related prices and the cost of third-party transportation and fractionation services. The volume of crude oil that we transport is directly affected by the supply of, and refiner demand for, crude oil in the markets served directly by our crude oil pipelines. Key factors in this supply and demand balance are the production levels of crude oil by producers in various regions or fields, the availability and cost of alternative modes of transportation, the volumes of crude oil processed at refineries and refinery and transportation system maintenance levels. Our integrated midstream energy asset network links producers of natural gas and NGLs from some of the largest supply basins in the United States to domestic and international markets. The midstream segment's capital investment plan includes organic growth capital and maintenance capital, which supports the development of various crude oil and refined petroleum products infrastructure projects. We continuously evaluate our capital plan and make changes as conditions warrant. The speedway segment's capital forecast is focused on the construction of new store locations as well as remodeling and rebuilding existing locations, consistent with our commitment to aggressively grow the business and build upon its industry-leading position. Our strategic actions to enhance shareholder value include conducting a full and thorough review of our segments to ensure optimum value is being delivered to shareholders over the long term. We believe that maintaining our segments as integrated businesses provides the best opportunity for enhancing long-term shareholder value, including substantial integration synergies and the ability to return capital to shareholders. The results for the pipeline and storage assets were recast effective January 1, 2015, and the results for the terminal assets were recast effective April 1, 2016. Our operations are influenced by various external factors, including market conditions, regulatory changes, and the competitive landscape, which can impact our operational efficiency and strategic resource allocation. We believe that our IT capabilities, including our ability to manage information and data effectively, play a crucial role in supporting our business objectives and enhancing our competitive positioning in the market. The effective mobilization and deployment of IT resources, combined with other organizational capabilities, are essential for achieving our strategic goals and driving performance improvements across our segments.

The da Vinci surgical systems enable surgeons to extend the benefits of minimally invasive surgery (MIS) to many patients who would otherwise undergo more invasive surgery by using computational, robotic, and imaging technologies. Our technology is designed to provide surgeons with a range of motion of MIS instruments in the surgical field, facilitating operational efficiency and enhancing the surgical process. We focus on making our technology easy and safe to use, which reflects our commitment to transforming surgical practices and improving patient outcomes. The da Vinci surgical systems include advanced instrumentation and software that enhance surgical precision and effectiveness, thereby supporting business needs and driving competitive advantage in the healthcare market. 

Our business model generates revenue from the initial capital sales of da Vinci surgical systems, including systems under sales-type lease arrangements, and from the subsequent sales of instruments, accessories, and service. The growth of instrument and accessory revenue reflects continued procedure adoption, which is driven by the effectiveness of our technology in meeting the evolving demands of healthcare providers. The installed base of da Vinci surgical systems has grown significantly, indicating robust market acceptance and the strategic deployment of our technology resources.

Research and development expenses have increased to support a broader set of product development initiatives, including advanced imaging, analytics, and instrumentation, which are critical for maintaining our competitive positioning. We aim to leverage our IT capabilities to enhance operational flexibility and improve the overall performance of our surgical systems. The integration of technology into our business processes is fundamental to our strategy for achieving operational excellence and driving innovation.

The adoption of da Vinci procedures is influenced by the perceived patient value compared to alternative treatment options, which underscores the importance of our information management capability in providing accurate and timely data to stakeholders. Our ability to mobilize and deploy IT-based resources in conjunction with other organizational capabilities is essential for sustaining growth and enhancing firm performance. 

We continue to invest in our digital infrastructure and technology portfolio to ensure that our systems remain at the forefront of surgical innovation. The strategic alignment of our technology capabilities with market needs allows us to respond effectively to competitive actions and market dynamics. Our focus on improving information processing capacity and data management is integral to optimizing our operational processes and enhancing customer relationships. 

Overall, our commitment to advancing IT capabilities is reflected in our ongoing investments in research and development, which are designed to support the long-term growth of our business and the continued transformation of surgical practices worldwide.

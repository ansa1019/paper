Altria Group, Inc.'s management reviews certain financial results, including diluted EPS, on an adjusted basis, which excludes certain income and expense items. These adjusted financial measures provide useful additional insight into underlying business trends and results and are used for planning, forecasting, and evaluating business and financial performance, including allocating resources and evaluating results relative to employee compensation targets. Altria Group, Inc. anticipates that its 2018 full-year adjusted diluted EPS growth rate will be in the range of 15% to 19%, reflecting investments in focus areas for long-term growth, including innovative product development and launches, regulatory science, brand equity, retail fixtures, and future retail concepts. The consolidation of certain operating companies' manufacturing facilities is expected to streamline operations and achieve greater efficiencies, delivering approximately $50 million in annualized cost savings by the end of 2018. Altria Group, Inc. has implemented a productivity initiative designed to maintain its operating companies' leadership and cost competitiveness, which has delivered approximately $300 million in annualized productivity savings as of December 31, 2017. The management believes that the estimated fair values of each reporting unit and indefinite-lived intangible asset are reasonable, although actual performance could differ significantly from forecasted performance, potentially resulting in impairment charges in future periods. Altria Group, Inc. conducts an annual review of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for potential impairment, and the analysis incorporates assumptions used in the long-term financial forecast, which is essential for evaluating business and financial performance. The preparation of financial statements includes the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, contingent liabilities, and reported amounts of net revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Altria Group, Inc.'s businesses recognize revenues upon shipment of goods when title and risk of loss pass to customers, and payments received in advance of revenue recognition are deferred until revenue is recognized. The company also accounts for the cost of state settlement agreements and FDA user fees as components of cost of sales, with recorded charges related to these agreements reflecting variable factors such as volume, operating income, market share, and inflation. Altria Group, Inc. is subject to various legal proceedings and has recorded provisions in the consolidated financial statements for pending litigation when an unfavorable outcome is probable and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. The management has concluded that it is not probable that a loss has been incurred in any of the pending tobacco-related cases, and thus no amounts have been provided in the consolidated financial statements for unfavorable outcomes. The company’s management reviews long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be fully recoverable, and impairment losses are calculated based on fair value. Altria Group, Inc. recognizes the funded status of its defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans on the consolidated balance sheet, and any effect of modifications to actuarial assumptions is generally amortized over future periods. The company’s management believes that adjusted financial measures provide a more meaningful comparison of year-over-year results and insights into underlying business performance.

During the past three years of unprecedented market downturn, Schlumberger has proactively sought to strengthen its technology offering and presence in key markets around the world. The company has continued to evaluate the present and future return prospects for all of its product lines, as it seeks to maximize its long-term financial performance. Schlumberger's financial performance in 2017 was driven by land activity in North America, where revenue increased over 80% in line with the average rig count increase. The continued expansion of Schlumberger's hydraulic fracturing presence in North America resulted in additional fleet redeployments, which benefited the production group. Schlumberger has restructured all relevant parts of the company, in terms of both size and organizational structure, to maximize its market competitiveness and operational agility. The strong growth in demand is projected to continue in 2018, on the back of a robust global economy. Schlumberger's commitment to delivering market-leading products and services to its customers reflects its strategic resource allocation and operational flexibility. The company has taken the difficult decision to exit the marine and land seismic acquisition market and instead operate the WesternGeco product line as an asset-light business, built on its leading position within multiclient, data processing, and geophysical interpretation. Schlumberger's operational efficiency is underscored by its ability to mobilize and deploy IT-based resources in combination with, and leveraging the value of, other resources and capabilities. The company has identified the seismic acquisition business as the only product line that does not meet its return expectations going forward, indicating a focus on aligning its technology capabilities with market needs. Schlumberger's approach to capital expenditures, which were $2.1 billion in 2017, reflects its commitment to investing in technology resources that enhance its business strategies and work processes. The company believes that these investments are crucial for maintaining competitive advantage and responding to changing business environments. Schlumberger's effective tax rate has historically been sensitive to the geographic mix of earnings, which highlights the importance of strategic management practices in navigating regulatory contexts and market dynamics. The company has also emphasized the significance of information management capability, which involves providing data and information to users with the appropriate levels of accuracy, timeliness, reliability, security, confidentiality, connectivity, and access. Schlumberger's ability to adapt to customer priorities and buying habits demonstrates its organizational agility and responsiveness to market dynamics. The firmâ€™s IT capabilities represent the application of physical or intangible IT resources such as technology, knowledge, practices, relationships, management skills, business process understanding, and human resources to further organizational goals. As Schlumberger enters the first year of expected growth in all parts of its global operations since 2014, there is renewed excitement and enthusiasm throughout the organization, reflecting its strategic alignment with market opportunities and operational capabilities.

2017 was another record year for Intel and shows progress on the shift from being primarily a PC-centric company to a data-centric company. The strategic investments made in data-rich markets like memory, programmable solutions, and autonomous driving are starting to pay off and are becoming an increasingly larger portion of the business. The growth was primarily driven by strong performance across data-centric businesses, which collectively grew 16% year over year. The landscape of the client computing market is shifting, with new markets and devices, new consumer expectations, and new ways to connect to the cloud. Intel's strategy focuses on these growth opportunities by enhancing platforms and adjacent technologies to reinvigorate PC demand and provide new user experiences. The data center total addressable market is expected to surpass $70 billion, with significant opportunities in cloud, networking, and analytics/artificial intelligence. The Internet of Things (IoT) is transforming the way we live, connect, work, create, and conduct business, and creating, transferring, and harnessing the power of data represents one of the fastest growing segments within the semiconductor industry. Intel's vision for this market revolves around powering the evolution of the smart and connected world by providing distributed compute from the edge through the network to the cloud. The company offers end-to-end solutions with a wide spectrum of products, including Intel Atom to Intel Xeon processor-based computing, wireless connectivity, FPGAs, and software. The focus on operational efficiency and the integration of technology capabilities are key to meeting customer needs and driving performance gains. The company has made significant capital and R&D investments into its integrated manufacturing network, enabling more direct control over design, development, and manufacturing processes, which is critical for maintaining competitive advantage. The transition to next-generation technologies is also a priority, with advancements expected to offer significant improvements in performance, energy efficiency, and cost. The competitive landscape is characterized by rapid technological and market developments, and Intel faces competition from companies that sell goods and services to businesses for their internal and customer-facing processes. The company must continually improve the cost, performance, integration, and energy efficiency of its products, as well as expand its software capabilities to provide comprehensive computing solutions. The importance of leveraging IT capabilities to enhance business processes and support strategic resource allocation is underscored by the need for operational flexibility and market responsiveness. The ability to mobilize and deploy IT-based resources in combination with other capabilities is crucial for transforming the firm into a competitive force. The ongoing evolution of IT capabilities encompasses the coordination of assets and internal processes, which is essential for driving innovation and maintaining market agility.

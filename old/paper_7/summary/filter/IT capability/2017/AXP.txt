We are a global services company with four reportable operating segments: U.S. consumer services, international consumer and network services, global commercial services, and global merchant services. Our results reflect a strong finish to our two-year game plan as we successfully executed against our key priorities of accelerating revenue growth, optimizing our investments, and resetting our cost base. We continued to invest in new products and benefits, new card acquisitions, and expanding our merchant network, which are essential for enhancing our IT capabilities and supporting business needs. Our worldwide billed business increased, reflecting growth across diverse customer segments and geographies, which is indicative of our operational efficiency and market agility. We also saw strong performance from middle market and small business customers, while large and global commercial customers grew at a more modest pace. The increase in provisions for losses was primarily driven by strong loan growth and increases in net write-off rates, which are critical for maintaining our financial health and operational flexibility. Our marketing and promotion expenses increased year-over-year, reflecting the recent enhancements to rewards and the continued strong growth in our cobrand portfolio, which is a strategic resource for our business innovation efforts. We recognize the importance of mobilizing and deploying IT-based resources in combination with leveraging the value of other resources and capabilities to transform our firm into a competitive force. Our effective tax rate for 2017 reflects a substantial charge related to the tax act, which has implications for our investment decisions and overall financial performance. We aim to maintain a solid and flexible equity capital profile, which is integral to supporting future business growth and technology deployment. The relationship of the U.S. dollar to various foreign currencies has impacted our results, emphasizing the need for effective information management and operational efficiency. Our risk management governance includes oversight of our enterprise-wide risk management program, which is essential for addressing operational risks associated with technology and information systems. We have implemented an information security program designed to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information and information systems, which is critical in today's digital landscape. Our operational risk management framework is designed to ensure that we achieve business objectives while managing risks associated with inadequate or failed processes, people, or information systems. The integration of technology capabilities into our business processes is vital for enhancing our organizational effectiveness and achieving performance gains. We continue to analyze and interpret the impacts of regulatory changes and market dynamics on our business strategies, ensuring that our IT capabilities align with our strategic goals and enhance our competitive positioning in the marketplace.

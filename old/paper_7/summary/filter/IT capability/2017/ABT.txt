Abbott's revenues are derived primarily from the sale of a broad line of health care products, with sales in international markets comprising approximately 65 percent of consolidated net sales. The acquisition of Alere Inc. establishes Abbott as a leader in point of care testing, expanding Abbott's global diagnostics presence and providing access to new products, channels, and geographies. The acquisition of St. Jude Medical provides expanded opportunities for future growth and is an important part of the company's ongoing effort to develop a strong, diverse portfolio of devices, diagnostics, nutritionals, and branded generic pharmaceuticals. The combined business competes in nearly every area of the $30 billion cardiovascular device market and in neuromodulation, which treats chronic pain and movement disorders. In 2017, the acquisitions of St. Jude Medical and Alere contributed significantly to Abbott's total sales growth, reflecting the importance of strategic resource allocation and operational flexibility in response to market dynamics. The integration of these acquisitions aims to leverage economies of scale and reduce costs, enhancing Abbott's operational efficiency and effectiveness in the marketplace. Abbott's focus on developing differentiated technologies in higher growth markets underscores the company's commitment to innovation and business transformation. The operating results of Abbott's diagnostics business reflect continued market penetration and growth, driven by the adoption of Abbott's i-STAT handheld system and the international rollout of its Alinity systems, which are designed to increase efficiency by running more tests in less space, generating test results faster, and minimizing human errors while continuing to provide quality results. Research and development expenditures are expected to approximate 7.5 percent of total Abbott sales in 2018, emphasizing the company's commitment to enhancing its technology portfolio and capabilities. Abbott's strategic management practices include a focus on obtaining additional product approvals across numerous countries and increasing penetration in emerging markets, which aligns with the company's organizational goals and capabilities. The company's operational strategies are influenced by external factors, including regulatory contexts and competitive actions, which necessitate agile decision-making and resource management to optimize performance outcomes. Abbott's commitment to reducing its debt levels following recent acquisitions reflects a strategic approach to financial management and resource allocation, ensuring that the company remains well-positioned to respond to evolving business needs and market opportunities. The focus on integrating Alere and paying down debt, along with the introduction of new science-based products, illustrates Abbott's approach to enhancing its competitive advantage and market responsiveness. The emphasis on leveraging IT resources and capabilities is integral to supporting Abbott's business strategies and enhancing its overall performance in a rapidly changing healthcare landscape.

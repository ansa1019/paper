The information technology (IT) services experienced a decrease in revenue due to funding delays across several programs, including the Warfighter Information Network-Tactical (WIN-T) mobile communications network and Common Hardware Systems-4 (CHS-4) computing and communications equipment programs, caused by the seven-month fiscal year 2017 continuing resolutions (CR). Despite the lower revenue, operating earnings increased, and operating margin expanded 110 basis points, driven primarily by strong program performance and favorable contract mix across the portfolio. The information systems and technology group reported increased revenue in 2016, driven by higher volume across the C4ISR solutions business, including the WIN-T program and several programs in Canada and the United Kingdom. The group's operating margin increased 30 basis points in 2016, primarily due to improved operating performance. The 2018 outlook for the information systems and technology group anticipates revenue growth between 5 and 6% from 2017, with an operating margin around 11%. The focus on expanding operating earnings and the efficient conversion of earnings into cash emphasizes the importance of operational flexibility and agility to respond to changing circumstances in the business environment. The long-term outlook for the U.S. defense business is influenced by the relevance of programs to the U.S. military's funding priorities and the ability to evolve products to address a fast-changing threat environment. International demand for military equipment and information technologies presents opportunities for non-U.S. operations and exports from North American businesses, although risks exist due to changing budget priorities and overall spending pressures unique to each country. The emphasis on effective program execution and the flexibility to drive cost reduction reflects the strategic resource allocation necessary to maintain competitive advantage. The total backlog in the information systems and technology group, which consists of thousands of contracts, was $8.9 billion at the end of 2017, up 4.8% from the previous year. This amount does not include $14.9 billion of estimated potential contract value associated with anticipated share of indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity (IDIQ) contracts and unexercised options. The group received $305 of orders in 2017 for additional increment 2 equipment related to the WIN-T mobile communications network program. The strategic alignment of technology capabilities with business needs underscores the importance of IT governance and management skills in achieving organizational goals and enhancing performance. The ability to mobilize and deploy IT-based resources in combination with leveraging the value of other resources and capabilities is critical for transforming the firm into a competitive force. The operational efficiency of the IT function is essential for supporting business strategies and work processes, highlighting the significance of information management capability in providing data and information to users with appropriate levels of accuracy, timeliness, reliability, security, confidentiality, connectivity, and access.

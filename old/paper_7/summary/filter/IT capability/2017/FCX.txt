We are a leading international mining company with significant proven and probable reserves of copper, gold, and molybdenum. Our portfolio of assets includes the Grasberg minerals district in Indonesia, one of the world's largest copper and gold deposits, and significant mining operations in the Americas. We have taken actions to restore our balance sheet strength through a combination of asset sale transactions and capital market transactions. We believe that we have a high-quality portfolio of long-lived copper assets positioned to generate long-term value. We continue to manage costs and capital spending and expect to generate significant operating cash flows for further debt reduction. Our financial results vary as a result of fluctuations in market prices primarily for copper, gold, and molybdenum, as well as other factors. The key measures that management focuses on in operating our business are sales volumes, unit net cash costs, operating cash flow, and capital expenditures. Our consolidated operating cash flows vary with sales volumes, prices realized from copper, gold, and molybdenum sales, production costs, income taxes, and other working capital changes. We have significant mineral reserves, resources, and future development opportunities within our portfolio of mining assets. We have commenced a project to develop the Lone Star oxide ores near the Safford operation in eastern Arizona and are pursuing other opportunities to enhance net present values. Our estimated consolidated recoverable proven and probable mineral reserves are determined using various assumptions, including future commodity prices and demand, which are critical for our operational and investment decisions. We actively engage with Indonesian government officials to address regulatory changes that conflict with our contractual rights, aiming to provide long-term stability for our operations and investment plans. The negotiation and documentation of a special license and accompanying documentation for assurances on legal and fiscal terms are ongoing, with a mutual objective to complete negotiations during the first half of 2018. Our operations are subject to various national, state, and local environmental laws and regulations that govern the protection of the environment, requiring significant expenditures. The cost of complying with environmental laws is a fundamental and substantial cost of our business. We assess the carrying values of our long-lived mining assets when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the related carrying amounts may not be recoverable. Our estimates of recoverable proven and probable mineral reserves are prepared by our employees and are reviewed annually by independent experts. The timing and amount of estimated payments for environmental obligations could change due to changes in regulatory requirements and other factors affecting our operations. We recognize asset retirement obligations as liabilities when incurred, with initial measurement at fair value, and these obligations are accreted to full value over time through charges to cost of sales. Our capital expenditures are expected to approximate $2.1 billion in 2018, including significant investments in major mining projects. We continue to evaluate opportunities to reduce the capital intensity of our potential long-term development projects based on economic and technical feasibility studies.

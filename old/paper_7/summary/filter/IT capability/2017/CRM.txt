We are a leading provider of enterprise cloud computing solutions, with a focus on customer relationship management, or CRM. Our core mission is to empower our customers to connect with their customers in entirely new ways through cloud, mobile, social, Internet of Things (IoT), and artificial intelligence technologies. Our customer success platform provides the tools customers need to succeed in a digital world. Key elements of our strategy include expanding into new horizontal markets, extending go-to-market capabilities, and ensuring strong customer adoption. Our ability to maintain a balanced portfolio of products and customers, the performance and security of our service, and the successful integration of acquired businesses and technologies are critical to our objectives. We continue to invest in the expansion of our data center capacity, the hiring of additional personnel, and the development of our brands. We expect to continue to make investments and acquisitions in complementary businesses and technologies to expand our service offerings. We drive innovation organically and through acquisitions, focusing on analytics, e-commerce, artificial intelligence, IoT, and collaborative productivity tools. Our proprietary, scalable, and secure multi-tenant architecture enables us to provide all of our customers with a service based on a single version of our application, which enhances operational efficiency. Our research and development efforts focus on adding new features and services, integrating acquired technologies, and enhancing the functionality and security of our enterprise cloud computing services. We expect research and development expenses to increase as we invest in technology to support the development of new and improved technologies. Our marketing and sales expenses are our largest cost, and we plan to continue to invest in expanding our domestic and international selling and marketing activities. We believe that our investment in professional services facilitates the adoption of our service offerings, and we expect the cost of professional services to align with revenues from these services. We derive our revenues primarily from subscription fees and related professional services, with subscription and support revenues accounting for approximately 93 percent of our total revenues. The increase in subscription and support revenues is primarily driven by volume-driven increases from new business, including new customers and upgrades from existing customers. Our attrition rates have remained consistent, contributing to our ability to maintain growth in subscription and support revenues. We have increased our headcount to meet the higher demand for services, and we intend to continue investing in our enterprise cloud computing services and data center capacity. The cost of revenues includes expenses related to delivering our service and providing support, as well as costs associated with data center capacity and technology infrastructure. We expect to continue to invest in our infrastructure to scale operations and increase productivity, which will support our growth strategy and enhance our IT capabilities.

During fiscal 2017, we have focused on improving the efficiency of our land development, construction, sales, and other key operational activities, which underscores our commitment to leveraging technology capabilities to enhance operational efficiency and returns. Our operating strategy includes investing in land and land development while pursuing opportunistic acquisitions of homebuilding companies in desirable markets, which aligns with our goal of optimizing the return on our inventory investments. We continually evaluate our land and lot supply, and fluctuations in revenues and profitability from land sales occur based on how we manage our inventory levels in various markets. We manage our inventory of owned land and lots and homes under construction relative to demand in each of our markets, including starting construction on unsold homes to capture new home demand. Our significant debt and our ability to comply with related debt covenants, restrictions, and limitations are critical to our operational flexibility and strategic resource allocation. We believe that our existing cash resources, our revolving credit facility, and our ability to access the capital markets will provide sufficient liquidity to fund our working capital needs and debt obligations. We have also made significant progress in increasing our lots controlled under option purchase contracts, which enhances our strategic positioning in the market. The transaction with Forestar Group Inc. is expected to advance our strategy of increasing our access to high-quality optioned land and lot positions, thereby enhancing operational efficiency. Our alignment with Forestar allows us to identify land development opportunities to expand our platform, which is crucial for driving growth and operational execution necessary to increase future value potential. We remain focused on growing our revenues and profitability while managing our product offerings, pricing, sales pace, and inventory levels to optimize returns. Our mortgage operations are directly related to the number of homes closed by our homebuilding operations, reflecting our integrated approach to business processes and operational capabilities. We have also seen increased loan volumes due to improvements in loan sale execution in the secondary market and increased revenue from title operations, indicating a strong linkage between our operational performance and market-based performance metrics. The cyclical nature of the homebuilding industry and changes in economic conditions, including the availability of mortgage financing, can significantly impact our operational strategies and decision-making processes. Our ability to adapt to changing market conditions and consumer demands is essential for maintaining our competitive advantage and ensuring organizational effectiveness. We regularly assess our projected capital requirements to fund growth in our business, repay debt obligations, and support other general corporate and operational needs, which reflects our commitment to strategic management practices and resource mobilization. The integration of technology in our operations is pivotal for enhancing our information management capabilities, enabling us to provide data and information to users with appropriate levels of accuracy, timeliness, reliability, and security. Our operational strategies are designed to optimize the returns on our inventory investments while adapting to local market conditions, which is essential for sustaining our competitive positioning in the homebuilding industry.

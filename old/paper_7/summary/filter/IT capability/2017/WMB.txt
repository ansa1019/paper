We are an energy infrastructure company focused on connecting North America's significant hydrocarbon resource plays to growing markets for natural gas and NGLs. Our ongoing strategy is to safely and reliably operate large-scale, interstate natural gas transmission and midstream infrastructures where our assets can be fully utilized and drive low per-unit costs. We focus on consistently attracting new business by providing highly reliable service to our customers and investing in growing markets and areas of increasing natural gas demand. Our strategy is to provide large-scale energy infrastructure designed to maximize the opportunities created by the vast supply of natural gas and natural gas products that exists in the United States. We anticipate operating results will increase through organic business growth driven primarily by Transco expansion projects and continued growth in the northeast region. Our growth capital and investment expenditures in 2018 are expected to be approximately $2.7 billion, with significant funding needs including Transco expansions and other interstate pipeline growth projects, most of which are fully contracted with firm transportation agreements. We expect to benefit as continued growth in demand for low-cost natural gas is driven by increases in LNG exports, industrial demand, and power generation. Fee-based businesses are a significant component of our portfolio and serve to reduce the influence of commodity price fluctuations on our operating results and cash flows. We continue to maintain a strong commitment to safety, environmental stewardship, operational excellence, and customer satisfaction. Our business plan includes a continued focus on growing our fee-based businesses, executing growth projects, and accomplishing cost discipline initiatives to ensure operations support our strategy. We believe that accomplishing these goals will position us to deliver safe and reliable service to our customers and an attractive return to our shareholders. We have entered into agreements that enhance our operational flexibility and allow us to mobilize and deploy resources effectively. Our financial repositioning efforts, including the sale of certain assets and investments in growth projects, reflect our commitment to strategic resource allocation and operational efficiency. The regulatory landscape, including changes in tax reform, impacts our operational decisions and financial performance, necessitating adjustments in our rate-making processes and customer interactions. We continue to monitor market dynamics and external influences that affect our business environment, ensuring that we remain responsive to competitive actions and consumer demands. Our investments in technology and infrastructure capabilities are aligned with our strategic objectives, enhancing our ability to manage and optimize our operations effectively. We are committed to leveraging our IT capabilities to support business needs and enhance our competitive positioning in the market. As we navigate the complexities of the energy sector, our focus remains on fostering innovation and maintaining robust customer relationships, which are essential for driving long-term value creation and achieving our organizational goals.

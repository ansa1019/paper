Amgen's transformation and process improvement efforts are enabling the reallocation of resources to fund innovative pipeline and growth opportunities that deliver value to patients and stockholders. The company is committed to a more agile and efficient operating model, which reflects the importance of mobilizing and deploying IT-based resources in combination with leveraging the value of other resources and capabilities. The transformation includes a restructuring plan that is expected to result in significant pre-tax accounting charges, while also realizing substantial savings that have been reinvested in product launches and clinical programs. Amgen's strategy to execute in its therapeutic areas is multifaceted, focusing on strengthening its competitive position through integrated activities. The company continues to innovate with delivery systems to differentiate its products, such as developing the autotouchtm reusable auto-injector and the repatha® automated mini-doser, which enhance operational efficiency and customer value. Throughout 2017, Amgen has invested in next-generation biomanufacturing that builds on its expertise in human biology and protein manufacturing, which dramatically reduces the scale and costs of making biologics while maintaining a reliable supply of medicines. The company’s financial results reflect the impact of its strategic resource allocation and operational flexibility, which are critical for sustaining long-term growth and responding to market dynamics. Amgen's ability to discover, develop, and commercialize innovative products is essential for revenue growth and to offset losses from product exclusivity expirations. The company faces increasing pressure from competition, including biosimilars and generics, which necessitates ongoing investments in research and development to maintain its market position. The financial flexibility gained from the 2017 tax act allows Amgen to optimize its capital structure and deploy accumulated cash balances efficiently, including strategic transactions that expand its portfolio of products. The company’s commitment to enhancing its IT capabilities is evident in its focus on information management, which is crucial for providing data and information to users with appropriate levels of accuracy, timeliness, reliability, and security. Amgen's operational decisions are influenced by external factors such as regulatory scrutiny and rising healthcare costs, which pose challenges to its business model. The company’s ability to navigate these challenges while leveraging its IT resources and capabilities will be vital for achieving its organizational goals and maintaining competitive advantage in the biotechnology industry.

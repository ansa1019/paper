During the year ended December 31, 2014, we recorded charges to earnings primarily related to costs associated with our operations, reflecting our ongoing efforts to enhance operational efficiency and business transformation. We incurred costs due to a restructuring of our field and corporate operations to create a more efficient and competitive company, which included consolidating our field regions and reducing administrative staffing levels. Our management team remains focused on executing our strategy to deliver consistent earnings and free cash flow growth, and improve return on invested capital. We believe that presenting adjusted pre-tax income and adjusted net income provides an understanding of operational activities before the financial impact of certain items, which is critical for evaluating our ongoing performance. In 2015, we will continue to focus on managing controllable aspects of our business by investing in profitable growth opportunities and reducing costs. We are committed to an efficient capital structure and maintaining our investment grade credit ratings. Our guidance reflects the expected financial impact from the acquisition of Tervita, LLC, which is aimed at enhancing our service offerings and operational capabilities in the environmental solutions sector. We integrate our recycling operations with our collection operations, which allows us to optimize our value chain and enhance customer relationships. Our operational flexibility is supported by our investments in technology infrastructure and digital transformation initiatives, which are essential for responding to market dynamics and consumer demands. We continuously evaluate our technology resources and capabilities to ensure alignment with our strategic goals and market positioning. Our focus on information management capability enables us to provide data and information to users with appropriate levels of accuracy, timeliness, and reliability, which is vital for informed decision-making and operational effectiveness. The evolving scope of our IT capabilities underscores the importance of mobilizing and deploying IT-based resources in combination with leveraging the value of other organizational resources. We recognize the need for strategic resource allocation to enhance our competitive advantage and operational efficiency.

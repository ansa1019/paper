We are a global semiconductor company with facilities worldwide. Our strategy to transform our business aims to attain approximately 50% of our revenue from high-growth adjacent markets by the end of 2015, reflecting our focus on introducing a more diverse product portfolio. The annual increase in embedded, enterprise, and semi-custom segment net revenue was primarily due to higher semi-custom system-on-chip (SoC) sales, which underscores the importance of mobilizing and deploying IT-based resources in combination with leveraging the value of other resources and capabilities. We continued to experience strong demand for our semi-custom SoCs found in major gaming consoles, indicating our capability to respond to market dynamics and consumer choice. Our organizational structure was realigned to enhance operational efficiency, reflecting a focus on strategic resource allocation and management capability. The computing and graphics segment's results reflect ongoing challenges in a competitive consumer PC market, highlighting the need for operational flexibility and responsiveness to market conditions. The decrease in computing and graphics segment revenue was primarily due to lower desktop processor and chipset sales, which were affected by the declining PC market. The improvement in operating results for the enterprise, embedded, and semi-custom segment was primarily due to increased net revenue, which indicates effective resource deployment and management in response to market opportunities. Our research and development expenses decreased, reflecting a strategic focus on enhancing our technology capabilities while managing costs effectively. The restructuring plan implemented in 2014 aimed to improve operating efficiencies, which included a reduction of global headcount and alignment of our real estate footprint with our operational needs. We recorded a goodwill impairment charge, which reflects the challenges faced in maintaining competitive positioning and the need for continuous evaluation of our organizational capabilities. The transition of our supply chain management to include commitments to wafer purchases from GlobalFoundries illustrates our strategic management practices in ensuring operational continuity and efficiency. Our financial activities, including debt repurchases and the issuance of senior notes, were aimed at optimizing our capital structure to support ongoing investments in technology and innovation. The overall financial condition reflects our commitment to maintaining liquidity while navigating uncertain global economic conditions, which may impact our ability to access capital markets. As we continue to adapt to environmental factors and market restructuring, our focus remains on leveraging IT capabilities to enhance firm performance and drive business transformation.

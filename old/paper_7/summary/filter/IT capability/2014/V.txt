Visa is a global payments technology company that connects consumers, businesses, financial institutions, and governments to fast, secure, and reliable electronic payments. We facilitate global commerce through the transfer of value and information among these constituencies, which plays a key role in the migration from paper-based to electronic forms of payment. Our business performance reflects the impacts of economic conditions and consumer spending, and we continue to explore opportunities to enhance our competitive position by expanding the scope of payment solutions we provide. Our financial results indicate growth driven by nominal payments volume, processed transactions, and cross-border volume, with operating expenses including continued investments in infrastructure, technology, and network processing to support global growth initiatives. We recognize that our operating revenues are primarily generated from payments volume on Visa-branded cards and payment products, as well as the number of transactions processed on our network. Data processing revenues are earned for authorization, clearing, settlement, and other maintenance and support services that facilitate transaction and information processing globally. Our investments in technology assets and infrastructure are aimed at supporting digital solutions and core business initiatives, reflecting our commitment to enhancing operational efficiency and business innovation. The increase in operating expenses is attributed to ongoing investments in technology and processing network to support growth, as well as higher marketing expenses related to strategic initiatives. We maintain a focus on client incentives designed to build payments volume and increase Visa-branded card acceptance, which are accounted for as reductions to operating revenues. Our liquidity management involves evaluating cash requirements for operations and capital expenditures, while ensuring timely completion of payments and planned capital investments. We believe that cash flow generated from operations will be sufficient to meet ongoing operational needs. The assessment of fair value of our financial instruments includes significant estimates and judgments that impact our financial results, particularly in relation to our obligations under various legal and regulatory proceedings. Our strategic resource allocation is influenced by the need to optimize income earned by investing excess cash, and we continue to review our investment portfolio in light of evolving market conditions. The ongoing development of our technology capabilities is essential for maintaining competitive advantage and ensuring effective support for business needs, which underscores the importance of mobilizing and deploying IT-based resources in combination with leveraging the value of other organizational capabilities.

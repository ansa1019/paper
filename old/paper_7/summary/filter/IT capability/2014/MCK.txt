Management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations indicates that technology solutions revenues decreased in 2015 compared to 2014 primarily due to a decline in software products and services revenues, the planned elimination of a product line, and lower revenues from the workforce business within the international technology business. These decreases were partially offset by higher volume in transaction processing businesses. Additionally, operating expenses increased over the last two years primarily due to business acquisitions, including increases in acquisition-related expenses and higher intangible asset amortization, and higher compensation and benefit costs. The segment's operating profit margin increased in 2015 primarily due to lower operating expenses as a percentage of revenues, partially offset by a decline in gross profit margin. The company committed to a plan to sell its international technology and hospital automation businesses, which were classified as discontinued operations for all periods presented in the consolidated financial statements. The technology solutions segment recorded pre-tax charges totaling $57 million, primarily consisting of product alignment charges, integration-related expenses, and reduction-in-workforce severance charges. The company also recorded a pre-tax charge of $34 million as a catch-up of depreciation and amortization expense not recognized in 2014 when certain assets were classified as held-for-sale. The impairment charge in 2013 for a software product was due to a significant decrease in estimated revenues, which included a goodwill impairment to reduce the carrying value of goodwill within the applicable reporting unit.

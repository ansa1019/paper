As part of an enterprise-wide strategic initiative, we have committed to reinvesting up to $400 million in technology, platforms, and functionality to improve our current operations and develop new capabilities. We believe that the continued volatility of the financial markets and its impact on the capital position of many competitors have altered the competitive environment, highlighting financial strength as a significant differentiator from the perspective of some customers and distributors. Larger companies have the ability to invest in brand equity, product development, technology, and risk management, which are fundamental for sustained profitable growth in the life insurance industry. Our strategy includes leveraging our scale to improve the value we provide to customers and shareholders, which is essential for achieving operational efficiencies. We have also focused on disciplined underwriting and a disciplined approach to investing and asset/liability management through our enterprise risk and asset/liability management governance process. The sustained low interest rate environment has impacted our investment yields, and we have adjusted our interest credited rates on both new business and certain in-force business with rate resets that are contractually tied to external indices. Our investment portfolio is heavily weighted toward fixed income investments, with over 80% of our portfolio invested in fixed maturity securities and mortgage loans, which are generally well-suited for matching the cash flow and duration of insurance liabilities. We utilize derivatives as an integral part of our management of the investment portfolio to hedge certain risks, including changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, credit spreads, and equity market levels. The company is well-diversified across product, distribution, and geography, which partially mitigates risks associated with market volatility. Our ability to manage investment risk is supported by a robust investment risk management process, which includes fundamental credit analysis and diversification across industries and issuers. We also apply various asset-liability management strategies to mitigate interest rate risk, including maintaining an investment portfolio with diversified maturities that aligns with our estimated liability cash flow profile. The company continues to monitor and adjust its liquidity and capital plans in light of market conditions and changing needs, ensuring that we have access to ample liquidity to meet business requirements under current market conditions and reasonably possible stress scenarios. We have established several senior management committees as part of our capital management process, which regularly review actual and projected capital levels and our annual capital plan. Our capital management policy sets forth minimum and target capital levels and governs the capital management process. The company’s liquidity management includes maintaining a substantial short-term liquidity position and managing our level of liquid assets, which are critical for meeting our cash requirements. We have various alternatives available for managing liquidity needs, including cash flows from operations, sales of liquid assets, and access to global funding sources. The company’s diversified business mix and geographically diverse operations partially mitigate risks associated with market disruptions, and we continuously evaluate our risk management practices to ensure they remain effective in the face of changing market dynamics.

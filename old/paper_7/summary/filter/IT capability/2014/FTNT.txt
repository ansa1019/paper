In addition to historical information, this annual report contains forward-looking statements regarding our expectations concerning competition in our markets and the impact of continued investments in research and development to strengthen our technology leadership position. Our cyber security solutions are designed to provide broad, high-performance protection against dynamic security threats while simplifying the IT infrastructure of our end-customers worldwide. We derive a substantial majority of product sales from our Fortigate appliances, which are designed for various enterprise sizes and include extensive networking capability. Our network security platform also includes our Fortiguard security subscription services, which provide access to dynamic updates and are integral to our operational efficiency and customer relationships. We continue to focus on selling to large customers, such as enterprises and government organizations, which has resulted in increased sales from large enterprises and enterprise data center deployments. We believe that continued product innovation has strengthened our technology and resulted in market share gains, evidenced by our introduction of new enterprise security appliances. Our sales strategy is based on a distribution model, primarily selling our products and services directly to distributors who sell to resellers and service providers. We monitor key financial metrics to evaluate growth trends and assess operational efficiencies, which are critical to our business performance. Our operating expenses, including research and development, sales and marketing, and general and administrative expenses, reflect our commitment to expanding our capabilities and supporting our growth. The increase in research and development expense is primarily due to increased headcount to support the development of new products and enhancements of existing products, which are essential for maintaining our competitive advantage. Our sales and marketing expenses have increased significantly as we invest in marketing to capture market share, particularly in the enterprise market, which is critical for future growth. We recognize revenue from our Fortiguard security subscription and Forticare technical support services over the service performance period, which reflects our focus on customer value and service delivery. We expect our services revenue to remain at comparable levels or increase as our customers renew existing service contracts and we expand our customer base. Our effective tax rate has been impacted by various factors, including foreign income subject to different tax rates and research and development tax credits. We believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for at least the next 12 months, and our future capital requirements will depend on various factors, including our growth rate and the introduction of new products and services. We continue to assess our operational capabilities and market dynamics to ensure alignment with our strategic objectives and to enhance our organizational effectiveness.

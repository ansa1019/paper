UnitedHealth Group is a diversified health and well-being company that provides a broad spectrum of products and services through its platforms, UnitedHealthcare and Optum, which includes information and technology-enabled health services. The company recognizes that the health care market continues to change based on demographic shifts, new regulations, political forces, and both payer and patient expectations, necessitating the need for delivery system modernization and payment reform. This modernization is critical for improving overall care quality, enhancing the health of populations, and reducing costs, which aligns with the company's focus on leveraging technology resources and capabilities. The alignment of incentives between key constituents remains an important theme, as the company rewards care providers for delivering improvements in quality and cost-efficiency. As of December 31, 2014, UnitedHealth Group served nearly 3 million people through progressive arrangements, including full-risk, shared-risk, and bundled episode-of-care payment approaches, indicating a strategic resource allocation towards innovative care delivery models. The company is committed to investing in new clinical and administrative information and management systems, which it believes provide growth opportunities for its Optum business platform. The ongoing reductions to Medicare Advantage funding place continued importance on effective medical management and ongoing improvements in administrative efficiency, highlighting the necessity of IT governance and operational flexibility in navigating regulatory uncertainties. The company is also actively seeking to build market share by serving the needs of beneficiaries under Medicaid expansion, reflecting its adaptability to changing market dynamics. UnitedHealth Group's revenue growth during the year ended December 31, 2014, was driven by the number of individuals served in public and senior markets and growth across all of Optum's businesses, demonstrating the impact of strategic management practices and technology integration on performance outcomes. The companyâ€™s investments in technology management and infrastructure capability are expected to enhance operational efficiency and support its business strategies. The introduction of state health insurance exchanges and other significant market reforms has created new market dynamics that impact existing businesses, necessitating a focus on market agility and responsiveness to consumer demands. The company's strategic decisions are influenced by various factors, including regulatory requirements, competitive actions, and the need for effective information management. Overall, UnitedHealth Group's IT capabilities are evolving to encompass the coordination of its assets and internal processes, enhancing its ability to respond to external influences and optimize its value chain.

Our customer service network consists of centralized call centers and online capabilities. We believe that we are well positioned to take advantage of the fragmented equipment rental industry because we have more extensive resources and certain compelling competitive advantages. These include the ability to provide customers with a broader range of equipment and services, the ability to provide customers with equipment that is more consistently well-maintained and therefore more productive and reliable, and the ability to enhance the earning potential of our assets by transferring equipment among branches to satisfy customer needs. We have executed a strategy focused on improving the profitability of our core equipment rental business through revenue growth, margin expansion, and operational efficiencies, particularly focusing on customer segmentation and service differentiation. Our strategy calls for the further optimization of our customer mix and fleet mix to enhance our performance in serving our current customer base. We believe these efforts will lead to better service of our target accounts, primarily large construction and industrial customers. The implementation of "lean" management techniques, including kaizen processes focused on continuous improvement, has been a significant part of our operational strategy. We have trained over 2,100 employees on the lean kaizen process, aiming to improve invoice accuracy and service quality, reduce the cycle time associated with renting our equipment, and enhance the effectiveness and efficiency of our repair and maintenance operations. Our analyses are aligned with these objectives to identify trends in equipment categories and define action plans that can generate improved returns. We plan to continue investing in fleet to further position United Rentals as a single source provider of total jobsite solutions through our extensive product and service resources and technology offerings. Our financial flexibility and liquidity have improved significantly, allowing us to invest necessary capital in our business to take advantage of opportunities in the economic recovery. We have made a number of acquisitions, including National Pump, which has expanded our capabilities and market presence. Our revenues are derived from various sources, including equipment rentals and sales of rental equipment, and our strategy focuses on enhancing operational efficiency and profitability. We believe that our existing sources of cash will be sufficient to support our operations over the next 12 months, and we expect to fund our cash requirements through cash generated from operations and proceeds from the sale of rental equipment. Our management practices include evaluating segment performance based on equipment rentals gross profit, which reflects our focus on operational efficiency and strategic resource allocation. We have also recognized the importance of mobilizing and deploying IT-based resources in combination with other capabilities to support business needs and enhance firm performance. Our operational strategies are designed to respond to market dynamics and improve our competitive positioning in the equipment rental industry.

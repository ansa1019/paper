Management's discussion and analysis indicates that daily conduct of our business depends on our ability to maintain key information technology systems, including systems operated by third-party suppliers and to maintain security over our data. The global business services organization provides technology, processes, and standard data tools to enable the global business units and sales and market operations to better understand the business and serve consumers and customers. We are focused on strategies that we believe are right for the long-term health of the company, including investing in developing markets on the categories and countries with the largest size of prize and highest likelihood of winning. Innovation has always been a core strength, creating flexibility to fund growth efforts and deliver financial commitments. We have taken significant steps to accelerate productivity and savings across all elements of costs, including cost of goods sold, marketing expense, and non-manufacturing overhead. Our productivity and cost savings plan aims to reduce costs and better leverage scale in supply chain, research and development, marketing, and overheads, which is designed to accelerate cost reductions by streamlining management decision-making, manufacturing, and other work processes to fund the company's growth strategy. The company expects to incur in excess of $4.5 billion in before-tax restructuring costs over a five-year period as part of this plan. The results of operations indicate that our ability to innovate and execute in product development and operations will determine the extent to which we can grow existing net sales and volume profitably, especially with respect to the product categories and geographic markets we have chosen to focus on. Our success is dependent on effective sales, advertising, and marketing programs in a fast-paced and rapidly changing environment, which necessitates the mobilization and deployment of IT-based resources in combination with leveraging the value of other resources and capabilities. The company discusses expectations regarding future performance and events, which are inherently uncertain and subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially. The ability to achieve business plans relies on continued demand for our brands and products, which is influenced by competitive activity in the markets where we operate. We must manage competitive factors, including pricing, promotional incentives, trade terms, and product initiatives, while maintaining mutually beneficial relationships with key customers. The company’s organizational structure is comprised of global business units, global operations, global business services, and corporate functions, which collectively support the execution of our business strategies and operational efficiencies. The ongoing business model involves a certain level of acquisition, divestiture, and joint venture activities, which must be managed effectively to deliver against base business objectives. The company’s financial condition continues to be of high quality, as evidenced by the ability to generate substantial cash from operations and access capital markets at competitive rates, which supports ongoing investments in IT capabilities and infrastructure.

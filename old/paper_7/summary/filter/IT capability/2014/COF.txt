Management monitors a variety of key indicators to evaluate our business results and financial condition, focusing on changes from year to year in certain key measures used by management to evaluate performance, such as profitability, growth, and credit quality metrics. Our strategies and actions are designed to deliver and sustain strong returns and capital generation through the acquisition and retention of franchise-enhancing customer relationships across our businesses. We believe that franchise-enhancing customer relationships create and sustain significant long-term value through low risk-adjusted credit costs, long and loyal customer relationships, and a gradual build in loan balances and revenues over time. We intend to grow these customer relationships by continuing to invest in scalable infrastructure and operating platforms, so that we can meet the heightened risk management expectations facing all banks and deliver a "brand-defining" customer experience that builds and sustains a valuable, long-term customer franchise. We continue to deliver risk-adjusted returns while investing to improve profitability and remain focused on creating value and sustained performance. Our business segments delivered strong underlying performance and grew our loan portfolios, with total loans held for investment increasing significantly due to growth in our credit card and commercial loan portfolios, as well as strong auto loan originations. Our operational flexibility is enhanced by our ability to mobilize and deploy IT-based resources in combination with leveraging the value of other resources and capabilities. We have established a governance framework that supports our risk management practices, ensuring that our IT capabilities align with our business strategies and operational goals. Our IT architecture is designed to support business needs and facilitate the transformation of our internal processes and interfirm transactions. We continuously evaluate our technology portfolio to ensure that it meets the evolving demands of the market and enhances our competitive advantage. The integration of digital technologies into our operations has been critical in optimizing our business processes and improving operational efficiency. We recognize the importance of information management capability, which enables us to provide data and information to users with the appropriate levels of accuracy, timeliness, reliability, security, and access. Our IT governance framework ensures that our technology investments are aligned with our strategic objectives, supporting our efforts to enhance customer relationships and improve overall firm performance. We are committed to leveraging big data and analytics to drive performance gains and enhance our market responsiveness. Our investment decisions are guided by a focus on actionable investments that create business value and support our long-term strategic goals. As we navigate market dynamics and external influences, we remain agile in our approach, adapting our strategies to meet the changing needs of our customers and the competitive landscape.

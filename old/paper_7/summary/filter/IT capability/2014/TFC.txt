BB&T's business has become more dynamic and complex in recent years, prompting management to evaluate and adjust the company's business strategy in the context of the current operating environment. This includes consideration of the challenges most relevant to performance, such as intense competition within the financial services industry and the cost and risk associated with regulatory reform and IT projects. The company has generated strong operating results despite challenges related to low interest rates and increased regulatory costs. Management focuses on diversifying revenue sources to reduce reliance on traditional spread-based interest income, emphasizing the importance of information management capability to provide data and information to users with appropriate levels of accuracy, timeliness, reliability, security, confidentiality, connectivity, and access. The ongoing implementation of an ERP system and commercial loan systems reflects BB&T's commitment to enhancing its IT capabilities and operational efficiency. The company recognizes that its IT capabilities, including the effective support of business needs and the mobilization of IT-based resources, are key to transforming into a competitive force. BB&T's risk management framework establishes an environment that enables superior performance relative to peers, ensuring that the company is viewed among the safest of banks and can act on opportunities. The management of market risk, particularly interest rate risk, is essential to achieving strategic financial objectives, with a focus on minimizing adverse effects from changes in market risk factors. BB&T's asset/liability management process is designed to achieve stable net interest income and assure liquidity by coordinating volumes, maturities, and repricing opportunities of earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. The company actively manages market risk associated with its portfolios and utilizes derivatives to mitigate economic risks related to securities and funding sources. BB&T's commitment to maintaining a strong liquidity position is evident in its strategies to attract deposits and manage funding sources effectively. The organization emphasizes the importance of maintaining sufficient capital to absorb losses and instill confidence among depositors and other funding sources. BB&T's internal capital guidelines ensure that capital levels remain above regulatory standards, allowing for continued growth and the ability to respond to changing market conditions. The company also monitors its liquidity position against stressed cash outflows and maintains a significant buffer to meet projected contractual cash outflows. The integration of risk appetite into the overall risk management framework helps ensure that BB&T does not exceed its risk tolerance through lending and other risk-taking functions. The focus on building strong, profitable client relationships is supported by a consistent company-wide credit culture and in-depth local market knowledge, which are critical to the success of BB&T's lending function. The company's strategic initiatives and investments in technology resources are aimed at enhancing operational flexibility and improving overall performance metrics, thereby aligning with its long-term financial goals and objectives.

The company remains focused on delivering sustainable growth and shareholder value while making appropriate investments for the future. Our strategy focuses on four specific areas within healthcare and life sciences, providing tools and technologies to the research community that facilitate the understanding of the cell, cellular diagnostics, and cell therapy. We continue to invest in research and development, geographic expansion, and new product promotions to drive further revenue and profit growth. Our ability to sustain long-term growth will depend on our ability to expand our core business, develop innovative new products, and continue to improve operating efficiency and organizational effectiveness. We face challenges including increased competition and healthcare reform initiatives, which could impact our business. The economic environment for the healthcare industry has stabilized, but pricing pressures continue for some of our products. Our financial position remains strong, with cash flows from operating activities totaling $1.75 billion in 2014. We evaluate our results of operations on both a reported and a foreign currency-neutral basis, which excludes the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. We do not enter into derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes. Our ongoing upgrade of our enterprise resource planning system is critical, as any delays or deficiencies in completing the implementation could adversely affect our business. We assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes in various legal proceedings and establish accruals to the extent probable future losses are estimable. Our research and development expenses reflect ongoing investment in new products and platforms within the medical segment. We have significant net pension and other postretirement and postemployment benefit costs that are measured using actuarial valuations. The company’s growth is dependent on government funding for healthcare systems, particularly in emerging markets. We are particularly focused on certain countries whose economic and healthcare sectors are growing rapidly. Our strategic objectives include improving operating effectiveness and balance sheet productivity, driving an efficient capital structure, and ensuring access to the debt market for strategic opportunities. We continue to pursue growth opportunities in emerging markets, which include regions such as Eastern Europe, the Middle East, Africa, Latin America, and Asia Pacific. Our financial reporting and business discussion reflect a realigned structure to better complement our customer-focused solutions strategy. We also consider trends related to key financial data, including gross profit margin, selling and administrative expenses, investment in research and development, return on invested capital, and cash flows. The company’s IT capabilities represent the application of physical or intangible IT resources such as technology, knowledge, practices, relationships, management skills, and business process understanding to further organizational goals. We believe that our ability to generate cash flow from operations, issue debt, and attract long-term capital on acceptable terms could be adversely affected by a material decline in the demand for our products or other significantly unfavorable changes in conditions.

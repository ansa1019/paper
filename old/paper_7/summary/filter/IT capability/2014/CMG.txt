Chipotle operates fresh Mexican food restaurants, emphasizing a non-traditional fast-food experience by using high-quality ingredients and classic cooking methods. The company focuses on a people culture that empowers top-performing employees, which is essential for developing future leaders. As of December 31, 2014, Chipotle had 1,783 restaurants in operation, with significant contributions to sales growth from new restaurant openings and comparable restaurant sales increases driven by customer visits and average check increases. The company has faced challenges in maintaining its supply chain standards, particularly regarding the sourcing of responsibly raised meats, which has impacted its ability to serve certain menu items. In 2014, food costs increased as a percentage of revenue due to inflationary pressures, partially offset by menu price increases. Chipotle's liquidity and capital resources are primarily allocated for new restaurant construction and general corporate needs, with a cash and short-term investment balance of $758.1 million expected to support business growth. The company has not required significant working capital due to its operational model, which minimizes receivables and inventories. Capital expenditures for 2014 were $252.6 million, with expectations of $235 million for 2015, primarily for new restaurant construction. The company enters into various purchase obligations related to ingredients, construction, and marketing initiatives, and is obligated under non-cancelable leases for its restaurants. Inflation has affected several operational areas, including food and labor costs, and while labor costs are expected to increase slightly in 2015 due to regulatory changes, the company has managed to maintain a relatively stable cost structure through menu pricing strategies. The discussion of management's analysis highlights the importance of IT capabilities in supporting business strategies and operational efficiency, emphasizing the need for effective resource allocation and management skills to navigate market dynamics and competitive pressures. Chipotle's commitment to high-quality ingredients and sustainable practices reflects its strategic alignment with consumer demands and operational goals, showcasing the integration of IT resources in enhancing organizational capabilities and driving performance outcomes. The companyâ€™s focus on innovation and maintaining a competitive advantage in the fast-casual dining sector underscores the significance of leveraging technology and information management to respond to evolving business needs and market conditions.

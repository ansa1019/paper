EOG Resources, Inc. operates under a consistent business and operational strategy that focuses predominantly on maximizing the rate of return on investment of capital by controlling operating and capital costs and maximizing reserve recoveries. This strategy is intended to enhance the generation of cash flow and earnings from each unit of production on a cost-effective basis, allowing EOG to deliver long-term production growth while maintaining a strong balance sheet. EOG emphasizes the drilling of internally generated prospects to find and develop low-cost reserves, maintaining the lowest possible operating cost structure consistent with prudent and safe operations. The company continues to evaluate certain potential crude oil and liquids-rich natural gas exploration and development prospects, applying its horizontal drilling and completion expertise to unconventional crude oil and liquids-rich reservoirs. EOG's efforts to identify plays with large reserve potential have proven successful, contributing substantially to its crude oil and liquids-rich natural gas production. The company has placed significant emphasis on increasing drilling and completion efficiencies and testing methods to improve the recovery factor of oil-in-place. EOG's capital structure strategy includes maintaining a strong balance sheet with a consistently below-average debt-to-total capitalization ratio compared to its peer group, which was 25% at December 31, 2014. The company funded its capital program primarily by utilizing cash provided by operating activities, proceeds from asset sales, and cash provided by borrowings. EOG plans to continue focusing a substantial portion of its exploration and development expenditures in its major producing areas in the United States, particularly on crude oil drilling activity. The anticipated capital expenditures for 2015 are structured to maintain EOG's strategy of capital discipline by funding exploration, development, and exploitation activities primarily from available internally generated cash flows. EOG has significant flexibility with respect to financing alternatives, including borrowings under its commercial paper program and other uncommitted credit facilities. The company continues to evaluate other select crude oil and natural gas opportunities outside the United States and Canada, primarily by pursuing exploitation opportunities in countries where indigenous crude oil and natural gas reserves have been identified. EOG's operational efficiency is supported by its ability to mobilize and deploy IT-based resources in combination with leveraging the value of other resources and capabilities. The firm’s IT capabilities represent the application of physical or intangible IT resources such as technology, knowledge, practices, relationships, management skills, and business process understanding to further organizational goals. EOG's management continues to believe it has one of the strongest prospect inventories in its history, which is critical for maintaining competitive advantage in the evolving market dynamics of the oil and gas industry. The company’s strategic resource allocation and operational flexibility are essential for responding to market changes and ensuring business resilience in a volatile environment.

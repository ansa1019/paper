In fiscal 2014, we continued to invest significant resources toward advancements in 3G, 3G/4G multimode, and 4G LTE technologies, audio and video codecs, wireless baseband chips, and our converged computing/communications (Snapdragon) chips, which are integral to our IT capabilities. We are also investing across a broad spectrum of opportunities that leverage our existing technical and business expertise to deploy new business models and enter into new industry segments, such as products designed for implementation of small cells and addressing the challenge of meeting the increased demand for data. Our strategic investments are focused on opening new or expanding opportunities for our technologies and supporting the design and introduction of new products and services for voice and data communications. The acquisition of CSR plc is expected to complement our current offerings by adding products, channels, and customers in the growth categories of the Internet of Everything and automotive infotainment, thereby enhancing our technology capabilities. We believe that our existing cash and liquidity sources are sufficient to meet our business needs and do not expect that we will need to repatriate funds held by foreign entities, which are primarily indefinitely reinvested. Our QCT segment's revenues, which are driven by the sales of integrated circuit products, represent a significant portion of our total consolidated revenues, reflecting our strong position in the market. The increase in equipment and services revenues was primarily due to higher MSM and accompanying RF and PM unit shipments, indicating our operational efficiency and market responsiveness. Our research and development expenditures were $5.5 billion in fiscal 2014, underscoring our commitment to enhancing our IT capabilities and supporting business innovation. We expect to continue to incur capital expenditures to support our business, including research and development activities, which are essential for maintaining our competitive advantage. The challenges we face in China, including compliance issues with certain licensees and ongoing investigations, may impact our business practices and revenue recognition, highlighting the importance of effective IT governance and management capability. We are also aware of the need for strategic resource allocation to navigate these challenges and leverage our IT capabilities for improved performance outcomes. Our focus on information management capability, including the ability to provide data and information to users with appropriate levels of accuracy, timeliness, reliability, security, and confidentiality, is critical in responding to changing business needs and directions. The integration of our technology resources and capabilities is essential for transforming our firm into a competitive force and enhancing our organizational effectiveness. Our QTL segment revenues were impacted by units that we believe are being underreported by certain licensees, which emphasizes the need for robust data management and monitoring systems to ensure compliance and optimize revenue streams. Overall, our strategic management practices and investments in IT capabilities are aimed at fostering innovation, improving operational flexibility, and enhancing our overall business performance in a dynamic market environment.

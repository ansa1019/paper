During fiscal 2014, we continued to implement strategies that will accelerate awareness, consideration, and purchase of subscriptions to our creative cloud offering, which underscores the importance of mobilizing and deploying IT-based resources in combination with leveraging the value of other resources and capabilities. The transition to a subscription-based model has transformed our business model, driving our revenue to be more recurring and predictable, as revenue is recognized ratably. Our digital media segment, which includes creative cloud, is a market leader, and we expect this transformation to drive higher long-term revenue growth through an expansion of our customer base. The adoption of creative cloud has resulted in a significant increase in paid subscriptions and annualized recurring revenue, demonstrating the progress we have made with the transformation of our business to a more predictable revenue model. In our digital marketing segment, we have seen strong adoption of our Adobe Marketing Cloud solutions, which address the expanding needs of marketers. The acquisition of Neolane has enhanced our capabilities in cross-channel campaign management, and we have experienced increased customer adoption of term-based licensing, resulting in larger customer engagements and more predictable revenue. Our investments in research and development are critical to remain competitive in the marketplace and are directly related to the timely development of new and enhanced products. We believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to meet our working capital and operating resource expenditure requirements for the next twelve months. The increase in deferred revenue is primarily due to increased subscription and enterprise term license agreement activity, which reflects our focus on operational flexibility and resource deployment to meet business needs. We also recognize the importance of technology integration and organizational capabilities in driving performance improvement and operational efficiency. Our strategic resource allocation and investment decisions are guided by our commitment to enhancing our IT capabilities, which have been evolving in scope to encompass the coordination of our assets and internal processes. The ability to provide data and information to users with appropriate levels of accuracy, timeliness, reliability, security, and access is central to our information management capability. We continue to evaluate our assumptions, judgments, and estimates in relation to our critical accounting policies, which have the greatest potential impact on our consolidated financial statements. Our focus on enhancing our IT architecture and governance practices supports our strategic management objectives and positions us to respond effectively to market dynamics and competitive actions. The integration of our technology resources and capabilities is essential for achieving our organizational goals and maintaining our competitive advantage in the digital landscape.

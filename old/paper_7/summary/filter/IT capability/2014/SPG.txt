The company generates the majority of its revenues from leases with retail tenants and invests in real estate properties to maximize total financial return, which includes both operating cash flows and capital appreciation. We seek growth in earnings, funds from operations, or FFO, and cash flows by enhancing the profitability and operation of our properties and investments. This growth is accomplished through attracting and retaining high-quality tenants, utilizing economies of scale to reduce operating expenses, and selectively acquiring or increasing interests in high-quality real estate assets. We also generate consumer traffic in our retail properties through marketing initiatives and strategic corporate alliances. Our focus on high-quality real estate across the retail real estate spectrum drives our investment decisions, which are influenced by market dynamics and competitive positioning. We routinely review and evaluate acquisition opportunities based on their ability to enhance our portfolio, which reflects our commitment to operational efficiency and strategic resource allocation. Our international strategy includes partnering with established real estate companies and financing international investments with local currency to minimize foreign exchange risk. We employ a three-fold capital strategy: providing the capital necessary to fund growth, maintaining sufficient flexibility to access capital in many forms, and managing our overall financial structure to preserve our investment-grade credit ratings. We consider FFO, net operating income, and comparable property NOI to be key measures of operating performance. Our internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP. We assess the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting regularly, ensuring that our transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements and that our assets are safeguarded against unauthorized acquisition or use. Our business model and status as a REIT require us to regularly access the debt markets to raise funds for acquisition, development, and redevelopment activity, as well as to refinance maturing debt. We expect to generate positive cash flow from operations, which is principally derived from rents paid by our retail tenants. A significant deterioration in projected cash flows could lead us to increase reliance on available funds from our credit facilities or seek additional sources of financing. Our financing strategy relies primarily on long-term fixed-rate debt, and we derive liquidity from positive net cash flow from operations and distributions of capital from unconsolidated entities. We have historically had access to public equity and long and short-term unsecured debt markets, which supports our operational flexibility and strategic management practices. Our investments in joint ventures are common in the real estate industry, and we may elect to fund cash needs of a joint venture through equity contributions or advances. We routinely incur costs related to construction for significant redevelopment and expansion projects at our properties, which reflects our commitment to enhancing the profitability and market share of existing assets. Our estimated stabilized return on invested capital typically ranges between 8-12% for all of our new development, expansion, and redevelopment projects, indicating a strategic alignment with our organizational goals and performance metrics.

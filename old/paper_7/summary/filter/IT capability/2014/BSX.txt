The management of Boston Scientific Corporation is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, which is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. The company has assessed its internal control over financial reporting as effective as of December 31, 2014. This assessment utilized the criteria established by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in its internal control-integrated framework. The company recognizes that internal control over financial reporting includes policies and procedures that pertain to the maintenance of records, ensuring transactions are recorded as necessary, and providing reasonable assurance regarding the prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets. The company monitors the dynamics of the economy, the healthcare industry, and the markets in which it competes, assessing opportunities for improved operational effectiveness and efficiency while preserving the ability to invest in research and development projects and other programs deemed important for growth. The healthcare industry is subject to potential fundamental changes due to political, economic, and regulatory influences, which could substantially affect the company's results of operations. The company believes that these changes are causing the marketplace to emphasize the delivery of treatments that can reduce costs, improve efficiencies, and increase patient access. The resources necessary to demonstrate value to customers, patients, payors, and other stakeholders may be significant and take longer to gain widespread adoption. The company has undertaken various restructuring initiatives to enhance growth potential and position itself for long-term success. It is committed to advancing medical technologies and investing in meaningful research and development projects to maintain a healthy pipeline of new products contributing to profitable sales growth. The company has also recognized the importance of mobilizing and deploying IT-based resources in combination with leveraging the value of other resources and capabilities. The firm’s IT capabilities are critical in transforming the organization into a competitive force, supporting business needs, and enabling operational flexibility. The company has made significant investments in infrastructure to maximize opportunities in emerging markets, which have shown strong growth potential based on economic conditions and healthcare sectors. The management's use of non-GAAP financial measures, including adjusted net income and revenue growth rates that exclude the impact of sales from divested businesses and changes in foreign currency exchange rates, provides greater transparency into the information used for financial and operational decision-making. The company believes that presenting these non-GAAP financial measures assists investors in understanding its operating performance and the methodology used to evaluate and measure such performance. The company’s strategic imperatives include driving global expansion and strengthening relationships to grow net sales and market share, particularly in emerging markets, while also focusing on innovation partnerships and technology management to enhance its competitive positioning in the healthcare industry.

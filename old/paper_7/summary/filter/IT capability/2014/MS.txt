Morgan Stanley's management believes that effective risk management is vital to the success of the company's business activities, which includes the establishment of an enterprise risk management framework to integrate the diverse roles of risk management into a holistic structure and facilitate the incorporation of risk assessment into decision-making processes across the company. The company's operational risk department oversees compliance with the company's risk limits and independently reviews material market, credit, and operational risks. The company's operational risk management framework is continually evolving to account for changes in the company and respond to the changing regulatory and business environment, which includes the implementation of operational risk data and assessment systems to monitor and analyze internal and external operational risk events. The company has established policies, procedures, and technologies to protect its information assets against unauthorized disclosure, modification, or misuse, which cover a broad range of areas including application entitlements, data protection, incident response, and remote access. The company's technology and data division plays a critical role in managing operational risk, particularly in relation to cybersecurity and supplier management. The company also utilizes various risk mitigation strategies, including diversification of risk exposures and hedging, to manage its trading positions. The company's credit risk management department establishes company-wide practices to evaluate, monitor, and control credit risk exposure at the transaction, obligor, and portfolio levels, ensuring that credit exposure is actively monitored and managed. The evaluation of counterparties and borrowers includes an assessment of the probability that an obligor will default on its financial obligations and any losses that may occur when an obligor defaults. The company conducts periodic stress testing that seeks to measure the impact on the company's credit and market exposures of shocks stemming from negative economic or political scenarios. The company's technology infrastructure supports its risk management processes, enabling it to respond to market dynamics and external influences effectively. The company has implemented a formal culture, values, and conduct program to enhance its risk management culture, which is essential for managing operational risks associated with its business activities. The company's operational risk department works with the divisions and control groups to ensure a transparent, consistent, and comprehensive framework for managing operational risk. The company monitors its credit risk exposure to individual industries and conducts scenario analysis to assess the impact of stresses on exposures, profit and loss, and the company's capital position. The company's risk management philosophy emphasizes the pursuit of risk-adjusted returns through prudent risk-taking that protects the company's capital base and franchise. The company's operational risk framework includes disaster recovery plans and an information security program that coordinates the management of information security risks and satisfies regulatory requirements. The company's commitment to continuous improvement in its risk management practices reflects its recognition of the importance of integrating technology capabilities into its operational processes to enhance overall firm performance and resilience in a dynamic business environment.

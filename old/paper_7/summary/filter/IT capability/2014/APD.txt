Information technology (IT) capabilities have been evolving in scope to more comprehensively encompass the coordination of a firm’s assets and internal processes and their interfirm transactions and relationships. IT capability is a firm's ability to acquire, deploy, combine, and reconfigure IT resources in support and enhancement of business strategies and work processes. We focus on information management capability—that is, the ability to provide data and information to users with the appropriate levels of accuracy, timeliness, reliability, security, confidentiality, connectivity, and access and the ability to tailor these in response to changing business needs and directions. The notion of IT capability underscores the importance of mobilizing and deploying IT-based resources in combination with, and leveraging the value of, other resources and capabilities. IT capability, broadly defined as the IT function’s competence to effectively support business needs, has become a key in transforming a firm into a competitive force. A firm’s IT capabilities represent the application of physical or intangible IT resources such as technology, knowledge, practices, relationships, management skills, business process understanding, and human resources to further organizational goals. The company reorganized into new business segments effective as of 1 October 2014, which should enable it to reduce costs and more effectively manage and utilize existing assets. The focus on cash flow and the introduction of adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP metric, in the fourth quarter reflects an increased emphasis on operational efficiency and performance metrics. The company’s strategic management practices include actions to improve cash flow and drive earnings growth, which are critical to improved results as global economic growth is expected to be modest. The operational flexibility gained through these strategic decisions is essential for maintaining competitive advantage in a dynamic market environment. The firm’s investments in technology infrastructure and digital transformation initiatives are aimed at enhancing business innovation and operational efficiency. The organization’s ability to adapt to market dynamics and consumer demands is facilitated by its IT resources, which support business process management and organizational agility. The management's focus on actionable investments and resource allocation is designed to optimize performance outcomes and enhance firm capabilities. The integration of IT systems into the value chain is crucial for improving information processing capacity and ensuring timely access to information, which in turn supports decision-making speed and accuracy. The company’s approach to IT governance and resource management is aligned with its strategic objectives, enabling it to respond effectively to external influences and regulatory contexts. As the firm navigates environmental turbulence and competitive actions, its commitment to leveraging IT capabilities will play a significant role in sustaining business resilience and achieving performance excellence. The emphasis on technology deployment and innovation partnerships further illustrates the organization’s strategic alignment with market-based performance and operational efficiency goals.

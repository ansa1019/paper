Digital Realty Trust, Inc. focuses on technology-related real estate, believing that the growth in corporate datacenter adoption will continue to surpass overall economic growth. The company targets high-quality, strategically located properties that contain applications critical to the operations of corporate enterprise datacenter and technology industry tenants. Most properties feature extensive in-building communications cabling, high-level security systems, and redundant electrical supply systems, which enhance operational efficiency and support business needs. The firm has developed standardized procedures for evaluating new real estate investments, ensuring they meet financial and technical criteria, which is essential for resource allocation and investment decisions. As of December 31, 2014, the company owned 131 properties with approximately 24.6 million rentable square feet, including significant space under active development, which is expected to be income-producing upon completion. The demand for datacenter space is driven by the need for operational flexibility and the ability to adapt to changing market dynamics. The company’s development activities are susceptible to economic downturns, which could impact corporate IT spending and demand for datacenter space. Digital Realty Trust has invested in building out additional inventory in major markets, anticipating that demand will exceed supply, particularly in regions like Dallas and Northern Virginia. The firm’s ability to grow earnings depends on developing and leasing space at favorable rates, which requires significant capital investment. The company recognizes that changes in technology and industry practices could affect the demand for physical datacenter space, necessitating ongoing innovation and process optimization. Digital Realty Trust also engages in joint ventures to enhance its operational capabilities and leverage strategic resources. The firm’s financial performance is influenced by its ability to manage and lease assets effectively, which is critical for maximizing returns on invested capital. The company’s strategic resource allocation is designed to support its growth objectives while maintaining operational efficiency and market responsiveness. The firm’s capital expenditures for development programs are expected to be substantial, reflecting its commitment to expanding its technology infrastructure. Overall, Digital Realty Trust’s operational strategies are closely aligned with its objectives of enhancing firm performance and creating business value through effective IT capability and resource management.

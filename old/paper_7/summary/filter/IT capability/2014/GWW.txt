Grainger plans to continue to make investments in its supply chain, information systems, ecommerce, sales force, and inventory management services, which are expected to accelerate market share growth and increase Grainger's size and scale. Operating expenses increased primarily due to growth-related spending on ecommerce, new sales representatives, supply chain, and inventory management solutions. Grainger has made significant capital investments to build new distribution centers and invested in technology infrastructure, vending machines for the KeepStock program, and normal recurring replacement of equipment. In 2015, Grainger expects to fund capital spending from operating cash, with projected spending including continued investments in supply chain, technology infrastructure, and ecommerce. Grainger's working capital consists of current assets and current liabilities, with an increase attributed to higher receivable balances driven by sales volume and extended terms given to customers. The company believes that its strong working capital position, cash flows from operations, and borrowing capacity will allow it to fund operations, including growth initiatives and capital expenditures. Grainger's operating results have included the results of each business acquired since the respective acquisition dates, and it has completed several acquisitions throughout recent years. The company has also invested in a new ecommerce platform and technology infrastructure to support its operations. The ability to achieve sales growth through increased prices is subject to inflation and competitive conditions. Grainger's investments in technology and infrastructure are aimed at improving productivity and maintaining working capital turnover. The company has recorded a goodwill impairment charge for one reporting unit, indicating the sensitivity of its financial performance to changes in market conditions and operational strategies. Grainger's management believes that the integration of its technology capabilities with its operational processes is crucial for enhancing its competitive position and achieving business objectives. The firmâ€™s IT capabilities represent the application of physical or intangible IT resources such as technology, knowledge, practices, relationships, management skills, and business process understanding to further organizational goals. The company emphasizes the importance of mobilizing and deploying IT-based resources in combination with leveraging the value of other resources and capabilities to transform into a competitive force. Grainger's strategic resource allocation and investments in information systems are designed to enhance its operational efficiency and support its business strategy alignment. The firm recognizes that effective information management capability is essential for providing data and information to users with appropriate levels of accuracy, timeliness, reliability, security, and access, tailored to changing business needs and directions. Overall, Grainger's focus on technology deployment and investment in IT infrastructure is integral to its operational flexibility and market responsiveness, enabling it to adapt to evolving business environments and consumer demands.

The following discussion and analysis of our consolidated financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the "forward-looking statements," our consolidated financial statements and notes that follow and the "risk factors" included in our annual report on form 10-K. We operate our business in the broader context of the macroeconomic forces around us, including the competitive environment, client and customer activities and preferences, and the various regulatory and legislative developments. The success of our strategies may be affected by the factors discussed in item 1A of this annual report on form 10-K - "risk factors" - and other factors as discussed herein. We expect to continue focusing on our key strategic objectives and obtaining operational and strategic leverage from our core capabilities. Management believes that adjusted operating measures, which exclude net realized investment gains or losses, best reflect the underlying performance of our core operations and facilitate a more meaningful trend analysis. The management and financial advice fees we earn relate primarily to fees earned from managing mutual funds, private funds, separate account and wrap account assets and institutional investments, as well as fees earned from providing financial advice, administrative services, and other custodial services. We have been operating in a historically low interest rate environment but have recently experienced a substantial increase in rates with uncertainty about where rates will go in the future. The favorable impact of the trend in rising interest rates on the investment portfolio yield, including from investment portfolio repositioning in our insurance business, along with higher balances in bank and certificate products, has been significant. Our ability to manage our investment portfolio effectively is critical in the current economic environment, as it directly impacts our financial performance and operational efficiency. We utilize extensive experience studies and analysis to monitor changes and trends in policyholder behavior, which informs our management decisions and assumptions regarding market risk benefits. The ability to analyze differences in experience provides us an effective approach in detecting changes in policyholder behavior. We have been focusing on optimizing our business mix and shifting towards lower-risk offerings, which is expected to enhance our organizational capabilities and market responsiveness. Our strategic decisions are influenced by the need to leverage technology resources and capabilities to support business needs and enhance operational flexibility. The integration of technology into our processes is essential for maintaining competitive advantage and ensuring effective information management. Our organizational transformation efforts are aimed at improving our operational efficiency and aligning our business strategies with market dynamics. The management of our technology infrastructure and the deployment of IT capabilities are critical to achieving our long-term growth strategy and enhancing our customer relationships. The changes in fair value of market risk benefits and the establishment of reserves for future policy benefits are influenced by our ability to accurately project customer behavior and market conditions. The ongoing evaluation of our technology portfolio and investment choices will be crucial in navigating the complexities of the financial services landscape and achieving sustainable performance gains.

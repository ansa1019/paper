Axon's product suite includes cloud-hosted digital evidence management, productivity and real-time operations software, which are designed to drive better outcomes and customer experiences. Our financial strategy focuses on building highly recurring, highly profitable businesses, with products that are generally cloud-connected. We develop, manufacture, and sell fully integrated hardware and cloud-based software solutions that enable law enforcement to capture, securely store, manage, share, and analyze video and other digital evidence. Our software offerings support productivity and real-time operations, driving the majority of the increase in Axon evidence and cloud services revenue. The increase in the aggregate number of users and average revenue per user, driven primarily by software add-ons, reflects the operational flexibility and responsiveness to changing business needs. We continue to see strong adoption of our next-generation product, Taser 10, which began shipping in the first quarter of 2023, indicating our capability to innovate and transform our offerings. The increase in Axon fleet systems revenue was primarily driven by higher unit sales, showcasing our ability to leverage technology functionalities to enhance firm performance. Our strategy includes continuing to shift an increasing amount of our business to a subscription model, which better matches the municipal budgeting process of our customers and allows for multiple product offerings to be bundled into existing subscriptions. This strategic alignment with customer needs enhances our market agility and operational efficiency. We anticipate an increase in stock-based compensation expense, reflecting our commitment to mobilizing and deploying IT-based resources in combination with leveraging the value of other resources and capabilities. Our internal cloud costs related to software product development have increased, indicating our ongoing investment in technology resources to support business innovation. The increase in research and development expenses, particularly within the software and sensors segment, reflects our focus on capability development and process optimization to meet evolving market demands. We recognize the importance of information management capability, ensuring that we provide data and information to users with appropriate levels of accuracy, timeliness, reliability, security, and access. The increase in deferred revenue primarily attributable to increased subscription invoicing for software and sensors hardware and services indicates our strategic resource allocation towards enhancing customer relationships and value creation. Our operational activities are supported by a robust technology infrastructure that facilitates communication and coordination across internal processes and interfirm transactions. The anticipated increase in cash flows from operations and available cash and cash equivalents underlines our capacity for resource management and investment opportunities, which are critical for sustaining our competitive advantage in a dynamic business environment.

The company operates as a leading global provider of data center, colocation, and interconnection solutions, emphasizing the importance of mobilizing and deploying IT-based resources in combination with leveraging the value of other resources and capabilities. A significant component of the company's internal growth is anticipated through the development of existing space held for development and the acquisition of new properties, targeting high-quality, strategically located properties that contain the physical and connectivity infrastructure supporting the applications and operations of data center and technology industry customers. Digital Realty Trust has developed detailed, standardized procedures for evaluating new real estate investments to ensure they meet financial, technical, and other criteria. The company aims to accomplish its objectives by achieving superior risk-adjusted returns, prudently allocating capital, diversifying product offerings, and driving revenue growth and operating efficiencies. The ability to generate and grow revenue depends on maintaining or improving occupancy rates, with strong demand observed in key metropolitan areas for data center space. The company expects average aggregate rental rates on renewed data center leases for 2024 expirations to be positive compared to current rates. The operational flexibility of the company is enhanced through its ability to manage and lease assets aggressively, thereby increasing cash flow. Digital Realty Trust's properties are equipped with fully redundant electrical supply systems, multiple power feeds, above-standard cooling systems, extensive in-building communications cabling, and high-level security systems, which collectively contribute to operational efficiency and support customer relationships. The company continues to see opportunities for investment in development projects, with expectations of incurring significant improvement costs to build out and develop additional capacity based on customer demand. The global revolving credit facilities provide for borrowings in a variety of currencies and can be increased, demonstrating the company’s commitment to sustainable business practices. The company’s liquidity requirements primarily consist of development costs, distributions to its parent, and potentially acquisitions, with a focus on maintaining a conservative capital structure. Digital Realty Trust's strategic resource allocation and operational decisions are influenced by market dynamics and the competitive landscape, ensuring that the firm remains agile and responsive to changing business needs. The company’s investments in technology and infrastructure are crucial for enhancing its capabilities and supporting business transformation, ultimately driving performance gains and creating value within the digital economy.

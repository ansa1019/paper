Citi's expenses increased 10% versus the prior year, driven by increased investments in other risk and controls and technology, elevated business-as-usual severance costs, and additional transformation and business-led investments.

Citi's operating expenses included significant investments in technology and other risk and controls, reflecting a focus on enhancing operational efficiency and supporting business needs. The organization continues to prioritize investments in technology as part of its transformation initiatives, which aim to strengthen risk and controls while improving value to customers, clients, and shareholders. Citi's CEO has made the strengthening of the risk and control environment a strategic priority, establishing a chief operating officer organization to centralize program management. The transformation oversight committee formed by Citi's boards of directors provides oversight of management's remediation efforts under consent orders, indicating a commitment to enhancing IT capabilities and governance contexts. The firm’s IT capabilities represent the application of physical or intangible IT resources such as technology, knowledge, practices, relationships, management skills, and business process understanding to further organizational goals.

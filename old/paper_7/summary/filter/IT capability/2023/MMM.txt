3M continues to make investments in the implementation of new business systems and solutions, including enterprise resource planning, with these investments impacting cost of sales, SG&A, and R&D. The company is impacted by certain special items such as costs for significant litigation and the sales and income associated with manufactured PFAS products. 3M's costs for significant litigation totaled approximately $15.2 billion pre-tax, which included pre-tax charges related to the PWS settlement and the CAE settlement. The company refers to various "adjusted" amounts or measures on an "adjusted basis," which exclude special items, and these non-GAAP measures are further described and reconciled to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. 3M manages its operations in four operating business segments and continues to make progress on the health care business spin-off, which is expected to create two world-class public companies well positioned to pursue their respective growth plans and tailor capital allocation strategies. The company believes that understanding ongoing operations and analyzing ongoing operating trends is useful to investors and management. 3M's organizational capabilities are further enhanced through strategic resource allocation and investments aimed at growth, productivity, and sustainability. The company continues to invest in a range of R&D activities from application development, product and manufacturing support, product development, and technology development aimed at disruptive innovations. 3M's hedging approach is designed to mitigate a portion of foreign currency risk and reduce volatility, ultimately allowing time for its businesses to respond to changes in the marketplace. The completion of the spin-off will enable the creation of two companies that can leverage their respective IT capabilities to enhance competitive advantage and operational efficiency. 3M's effective tax rates for 2023, 2022, and 2021 reflect the impact of various strategic decisions and adjustments related to special items, which are essential for understanding the company's financial performance. The companyâ€™s focus on digital transformation and IT deployment is integral to its strategy for enhancing business processes and achieving operational flexibility. 3M's investments in technology management and infrastructure capability are designed to support its organizational goals and improve performance outcomes. The company continues to face challenges related to market dynamics, including inflationary pressures and geopolitical impacts, which necessitate agile responses and effective resource management. 3M's commitment to innovation partnerships and strategic management practices underscores its focus on leveraging IT capabilities to drive business transformation and create long-term value for shareholders. The ongoing evaluation of its technology portfolio and the integration of digital options thinking into its business strategies are critical for maintaining market responsiveness and achieving performance excellence.

Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. is a fully integrated biotechnology company that invents, develops, manufactures, and commercializes medicines for people with serious diseases. Our ability to generate profits and positive cash flow from operations depends significantly on the continued success in commercializing Eylea and Dupixent, as well as whether we are successful in commercializing Eylea HD. We expect to incur substantial expenses related to our research and development activities, which are expected to expand and require additional resources. Our financial results may fluctuate based on various factors, including the scope and progress of our research and development efforts and the continuation of our collaborations. Collaborative arrangements have been established to research, develop, manufacture, and commercialize products, requiring us to deliver various rights, services, and goods across the product lifecycle. The variability in the scope of activities and the length of time necessary to develop a drug product may lead to revisions in our estimates, potentially resulting in material changes to amounts recognized. We recognize revenue from product sales at a point in time when our customer is deemed to have obtained control of the product, which generally occurs upon receipt or acceptance by our customer. The amount of revenue recognized may vary due to rebates, chargebacks, and discounts provided under governmental and other programs. Our research and development expenses include costs paid to third parties for clinical and product development activities, as well as costs related to preclinical research activities and clinical trials. The lengthy process of seeking FDA and other applicable approvals requires substantial resources, and any failure to obtain or delays in obtaining regulatory approvals could materially adversely affect our business. We anticipate continuing to incur significant commercialization costs for our marketed products, which will depend on market potential, collaboration agreements, and regulatory approvals. The amount required to fund operations will depend on various factors, including the potential regulatory approval and commercialization of our product candidates and the timing thereof. We believe that our existing capital resources, borrowing availability under the 2022 credit facility, and funds generated by anticipated product sales will enable us to meet our anticipated operating needs for the foreseeable future. Our financial condition is influenced by the performance of our collaborations, including the sharing of profits and reimbursement obligations with collaborators such as Bayer and Sanofi. The increase in our share of profits in connection with commercialization during the year was driven by higher profits associated with Dupixent sales. We also recognize stock-based compensation expense related to equity awards granted under our long-term incentive plans, which involves estimates that may materially affect the fair value of awards granted. As of December 31, 2023, we had significant contingent reimbursement obligations to our collaborators, which will impact our share of profits from sales under these collaborations.

Cintas helps more than one million businesses of all types and sizes, primarily in the U.S., as well as Canada and Latin America, get ready to open their doors with confidence every day by providing a wide range of products and services that enhance customers' image and help keep their facilities and employees clean, safe, and looking their best. The company’s strategy is to achieve revenue growth for all products and services by increasing penetration at existing customers and broadening the customer base to include market segments not historically served. Cintas has a highly talented and diverse team of service professionals visiting customers regularly, which enables the development of close personal relationships. The combination of the distribution system and strong customer relationships provides a platform from which additional products and services are launched. Cintas evaluates operating segment performance based on revenue and operating income, regularly reviewing its operating segments for reporting purposes based on information its chief operating decision maker regularly reviews for resource allocation and performance assessment. The company’s effective management of operational efficiency and resource allocation has led to significant revenue growth, with fiscal 2023 total revenue reaching $8.8 billion, an increase of 12.2% over the prior fiscal year, driven by increased sales volume and new business growth resulting from an increase in the number and productivity of sales representatives. The company has invested in material costs to support increased revenue growth, and the cost of uniform rental and facility services as a percent of revenue improved due to efficiencies in labor and improved leverage of fixed costs. Cintas' liquidity and capital resources are supported by cash flows provided by operating activities, which have historically supplied a significant source of liquidity for operations and expansion activities. The company expects cash flows from operating activities to remain sufficient to provide adequate levels of liquidity, with access to $2.0 billion of debt capacity from its revolving credit facility. Cintas' strategic objectives include acquisitions, repurchases of common stock, and dividends, which are dependent on economic outlook and liquidity. The company’s capital expenditures increased significantly to support continued market penetration and revenue growth, reflecting a commitment to enhancing operational capabilities. Cintas has demonstrated resilience in managing inflationary pressures through pricing and efficiency initiatives, ensuring that these factors have not materially impacted its consolidated financial condition or results of operations. The management's focus on operational flexibility and strategic resource allocation has positioned the company to adapt to changing market dynamics and consumer demands effectively. Cintas has maintained compliance with all debt covenants, ensuring continued access to commercial paper and long-term debt markets, which are critical for meeting material cash obligations and supporting business strategies. The company’s strategic management practices, including monitoring financial and non-financial disclosures, ensure that it remains well-positioned to leverage its IT capabilities and resources to support business needs and enhance overall organizational performance.

As part of our growth strategy, we invest in businesses in certain countries that carry higher levels of risks such as China, Brazil, India, Mexico, and countries in the Middle East and Africa. Our financial performance depends, in large part, on varying conditions in the markets we serve, particularly the on-highway, construction, and general industrial markets. Demand in these markets tends to fluctuate in response to overall economic conditions. Our operations are also affected by geopolitical risks, currency fluctuations, political and economic uncertainty, public health crises, and regulatory matters, including adoption and enforcement of environmental and emission standards. We have long-standing relationships with many of the leading manufacturers in the markets we serve, which enhances our ability to leverage technology resources and capabilities effectively. We reorganized the businesses within our components segment to carve out the electronics business into the newly formed software and electronics business, which emphasizes our focus on technology functionalities and innovation partnerships. Our components segment now consists of businesses that include software and electronics, which develop, supply, and remanufacture control units, specialty sensors, power electronics, actuators, and software for various applications. The investment in new product lines and targeted capacity expansions reflects our commitment to business innovation and operational efficiency. We continue to serve all our markets as they adopt electrification and alternative power technologies, meeting the needs of our OEM partners and end customers. Our reportable operating segments consist of components, engine, distribution, power systems, and accelera, organized according to the products and markets each segment serves. We believe EBITDA is a useful measure of our operating performance as it assists investors and debt holders in comparing our performance on a consistent basis. The increase in gross margin was mainly due to favorable pricing and higher volumes, including sales of axles and brakes from the Meritor acquisition, which illustrates our capability to enhance performance through strategic resource allocation. We expect demand within our power systems business to remain strong, including the power generation, mining, and marine markets, which indicates our market agility and responsiveness to external influences. Our financial condition and liquidity remain strong, enabling us to have ready access to credit and the capital markets. We assess our liquidity in terms of our ability to generate adequate cash to fund our operating, investing, and financing activities, which is crucial for maintaining operational flexibility. Our strategic management practices include evaluating the recoverability of our deferred tax assets and making adjustments based on historical experience and changes in business conditions. The ongoing development of our technologies and processes is essential for maintaining competitive advantage and achieving performance excellence in a rapidly evolving business environment.

In 2023, we continued to generate cash flow from operations, allowing us to fund our ongoing operations, investments in our business, acquisitions, debt repayments, pension obligations, and return cash to our shareholders through share repurchases and dividend payments. Our strong pricing offset continued delivered product cost increases, and our team generated double-digit sales growth in institutional & specialty, high single-digit sales growth in industrial, and other segments while healthcare and life sciences generated good sales growth. The institutional advancement program is intended to enhance our institutional sales and service structure and allow the sales team to capture share and penetration while maximizing service effectiveness by leveraging our ongoing investments in digital technology. The combined program charges are expected to be primarily cash expenditures related to severance and asset disposals, and we expect that these restructuring charges will be completed by the end of 2024. Our restructuring activities have been included as a component of cost of sales, special (gains) and charges, and other (income) expense on the consolidated statements of income. We recorded restructuring charges primarily related to severance, disposals of equipment, and office closures. The a2020 plan was initiated to leverage technology and system investments and organizational changes, with goals to further simplify and automate processes and tasks, reduce complexity and management layers, consolidate facilities, and focus on key long-term growth areas by further leveraging technology and structural improvements. Our acquisitions and divestitures are discussed further, with strategic business acquisitions targeted to complement our growth strategy and support long-term growth. We have made significant investments in technology and digital infrastructure to enhance operational efficiency and support business innovation. Our cash flow from operating activities was $2.4 billion in 2023, reflecting strong performance and operational flexibility. We continue to evaluate our cash position in light of future developments, and as of December 31, 2023, we had a $2.0 billion multi-year credit facility, which supports our U.S. and euro commercial paper programs. Our net debt to EBITDA ratio is an important indicator of the operational and financial health of our organization. We have recorded liabilities related to pending litigation, environmental claims, and other contingencies when a loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated. Our business and operations are subject to extensive environmental laws and regulations, and we believe the ultimate outcome of litigation and environmental contingencies will not have a significant impact on our consolidated financial position. Our strategic management practices include ongoing assessments of our technology capabilities and investments in digital transformation to enhance our competitive positioning and market responsiveness. The impacts of acquisitions and divestitures are reflected in our non-GAAP financial measures, which exclude the results of acquired businesses from the first twelve months post-acquisition and the results of divested businesses from the twelve months prior to divestiture. We recognize the importance of mobilizing and deploying IT-based resources in combination with leveraging the value of other resources and capabilities to support business strategies and work processes. Our IT capabilities have become a key in transforming the firm into a competitive force, emphasizing the coordination of a firmâ€™s assets and internal processes.

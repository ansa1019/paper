The company recorded sales of $162 million and pre-tax profit of $20 million for this business during the year ended December 31, 2021. Our operations are influenced by global events, including the demand for defense products and services, which are impacted by the evolving global security environment and macroeconomic factors. We continue to explore opportunities and risks associated with these dynamics, which highlight the need for a robust defense capability. The ongoing conflicts and heightened global tensions underscore the importance of our capabilities in space, C4ISR, missile defense, and advanced weapons systems, which are essential for supporting our customers' defense needs. Our strategic resource allocation is influenced by the uncertain political and regulatory environment, which affects defense budgets and spending priorities. The macroeconomic environment, characterized by inflationary pressures and supply chain disruptions, continues to impact our operational flexibility and resource management. We are committed to enhancing our workforce through hiring and development efforts to address these challenges. Our approach to performance assessment focuses on managing and evaluating our business based on performance on contracts and programs, recognizing that fluctuations in sales and operating income are driven by changes in contract costs and performance. The complexity of our operations necessitates a robust information management capability to ensure data accuracy, reliability, and timeliness, which are critical for decision-making and operational efficiency. We leverage our IT capabilities to support business needs and enhance our competitive advantage in the market. The integration of technology into our business processes is vital for maintaining operational effectiveness and achieving performance excellence. Our focus on strategic management practices and technology deployment enables us to respond effectively to market dynamics and customer demands. The evolving nature of our IT capabilities underscores the importance of mobilizing and deploying IT-based resources in conjunction with other organizational capabilities to drive business transformation and create value. The challenges presented by the current economic and political landscape require us to remain agile and responsive, ensuring that our strategic decisions align with our organizational goals and market opportunities.

The company has focused on enhancing the strategic management of its catastrophe exposure, adding experts in data science, meteorology, and structural engineering to its catastrophe management organization. This expertise has been incorporated into the company's product development, risk selection, pricing, capital allocation, and claim response. The company utilizes various analyses and methods, including proprietary and third-party modeling processes, to make underwriting and reinsurance decisions designed to manage its exposure to catastrophic events. The company actively monitors and evaluates changes in third-party models and, when necessary, calibrates the catastrophe risk model estimates delivered via its proprietary modeling processes. The company has established dedicated teams for each catastrophe peril, with the goal of developing industry-leading scientific and underwriting expertise. The company’s investment strategy focuses on maintaining a high-quality investment portfolio and a relatively short average effective duration, which is essential for meeting policyholder obligations and optimizing investment returns. The company employs a thoughtful investment philosophy that focuses on appropriate risk-adjusted returns, ensuring that a significant majority of funds available for investment are deployed in a diversified portfolio of high-quality, liquid investments. The company closely monitors the duration of its fixed maturity investments, and investment purchases and sales are executed with the objective of having adequate funds available to satisfy the company's insurance and debt obligations. The company's liquidity requirements are met primarily by funds generated from premiums, fees, income received on investments, and investment maturities, which are critical for covering fluctuations in projected liability cash flows. The company’s management believes that the combination of operating company liquidity, holding company liquidity, its investment portfolio, and its capital resources are sufficient to meet its contractual obligations. The company has also established a holding company liquidity target equal to its estimated annual pre-tax interest expense and common shareholder dividends. The company’s effective tax rate reflects the impact of tax-exempt investment income on the calculation of the company's income tax provision. The company’s results of operations may be impacted by various factors, including economic conditions, supply chain disruptions, and changes in regulatory environments. The company has seen an increase in cash received for premiums, which reflects business growth, including the impact of positive renewal premium changes. The company’s investment portfolio is managed to support its insurance operations, and the primary goals of the company's asset-liability management process are to satisfy insurance liabilities and maintain sufficient liquidity. The company’s approach to managing its investment portfolio is influenced by the performance of global financial markets, which can impact the market value of the company's investment portfolio. The company’s overall view of the current underlying environment is essentially unchanged from recent periods, and there remains a high degree of uncertainty with respect to future exposure to claims. The company continues to study the implications of emerging issues, including changing climate conditions, to consider potential changes to its modeling and the use of such modeling, as well as to help determine the need for new underwriting strategies, coverage modifications, or new products.

Occidental's operations, financial condition, cash flows, and levels of expenditures are highly dependent on oil prices and, to a lesser extent, natural gas liquids and natural gas prices. Occidental aims to maximize shareholder returns through a combination of enhancing its asset base with new investments in its cash-generative energy and chemical businesses as well as emerging low-carbon businesses. The company focuses on maximizing operational efficiencies by investing in high-return upstream assets to generate long-term free cash flow that will provide stability throughout the commodity cycle. Occidental's operational priorities include maximizing efficiencies to deliver lower breakeven costs and generate excess free cash flow, which positions the company for full-cycle success. 

The company conducts its operations with a priority on health, safety, and environmental sustainability, and seeks to meet its sustainability and environmental goals through the development and commercialization of technologies that lower greenhouse gas emissions from industrial processes. Occidental's operational flexibility to achieve low development and operating costs is essential for maximizing the full-cycle value of its assets. The company also emphasizes the importance of mobilizing and deploying IT-based resources in combination with leveraging the value of other resources and capabilities. 

In its oil and gas segment, Occidental focuses on long-term value creation and leadership in sustainability, health, safety, and the environment. The segment benefits from scale, technical expertise, and commercial collaboration, which allow for quick market delivery of additional production and the extension of older fields at lower costs. The company's advanced subsurface characterization ability and proven execution capabilities further enhance its operational effectiveness. 

Occidental's midstream and marketing segment strives to maximize value by optimizing the use of its gathering, processing, transportation, storage, and terminal commitments. This segment evaluates opportunities across the value chain and leverages its assets to provide services to Occidental's subsidiaries and third parties. The marketing business aggregates, markets, and stores Occidental and third-party volumes, with performance affected primarily by commodity price changes and margins in oil and gas transportation and storage programs. 

Additionally, Occidental's commitment to innovation is evident in its low-carbon ventures, which capitalize on the company's extensive experience in utilizing carbon dioxide in the development of carbon capture, utilization, and storage projects. The company is actively pursuing multiple pathways to fund these projects, including project financing and long-term carbon removal agreements. 

Overall, Occidental's strategic resource allocation, operational efficiencies, and commitment to sustainability and innovation position it to navigate market dynamics and enhance its competitive advantage in the evolving energy landscape.

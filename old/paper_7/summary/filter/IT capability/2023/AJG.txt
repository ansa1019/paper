We believe that one of our major strengths is our ability to deliver comprehensively structured insurance and risk management services to our clients. Our brokers, agents, and administrators act as intermediaries between underwriting enterprises and our clients, and we do not assume net underwriting risks. We have expanded our international operations through both acquisitions and organic growth, which emphasizes our operational flexibility and capability to respond to market dynamics. The primary source of revenues for our brokerage services is commissions from underwriting enterprises, based on a percentage of premiums paid by our clients, or fees received from clients based on an agreed level of service usually in lieu of commissions. We recognize approximately 80% of our commission and fee revenues on the effective date of the underlying insurance contract. Our operational efficiency is enhanced by investments made in IT and software development projects, which are crucial for supporting our business strategies and work processes. We have historically viewed organic revenue growth as an important indicator when assessing and evaluating the performance of our brokerage and risk management segments. The integration of technology into our operations has allowed us to improve our service delivery and client engagement, thus enhancing our competitive advantage. The increase in operating expenses in 2023 compared to 2022 was primarily due to expenses associated with the acquisitions completed in the twelve-month period, as well as additional investments in technology. We believe that our history of strong new business generation and enhanced value-added services for our carrier partners should result in further organic growth opportunities around the world. We have made significant investments in clean energy operations capable of producing refined coal, which we believe qualified for tax credits under IRC section 45, generating positive cash flow by reducing the amount of federal income taxes we pay. Our cash flows from operations are primarily derived from our earnings from operations, as adjusted for our non-cash expenses, which include depreciation, amortization, and stock-based compensation expenses. We anticipate that our cash flows from operations and borrowings under our credit agreement will provide us with adequate resources to meet our liquidity needs in the foreseeable future. The effective management of our IT resources is essential for our operational capabilities and strategic resource allocation, allowing us to leverage technology functionalities to optimize our business processes. Our investment decisions are guided by a focus on enhancing our IT architecture and capabilities, which are critical for maintaining our market responsiveness and achieving performance gains. We recognize the importance of mobilizing and deploying IT-based resources in combination with leveraging the value of other resources and capabilities to further our organizational goals. The integration of technology into our operations has positioned us to better navigate market restructuring and respond to competitive actions, thereby enhancing our overall firm performance.

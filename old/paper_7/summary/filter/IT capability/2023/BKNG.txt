We focus on relentless innovation to grow our business by providing a best-in-class user experience with intuitive, easy-to-use online platforms that aim to exceed the expectations of online consumers. Our long-term strategy to create an ideal traveler experience involves offering our customers relevant options and connections at the times and in the language they want them, making trips booked with us seamless, easy, and valuable. This connected trip vision aims to offer a differentiated and personalized online travel planning, booking, payment, and in-trip experience for each trip, enhanced by a robust loyalty program that provides value to travelers and partners across all trips. As part of our strategy to provide more payment options to consumers and travel service providers, we increasingly process transactions on a merchant basis, which allows us to facilitate payments for services provided. This approach increases our ability to offer secure and flexible transaction terms to consumers, such as the form and timing of payment. We believe that expanding these types of service offerings will benefit consumers and travel service providers, as well as our gross bookings, room night, and earnings growth rates. However, this results in additional expenses for personnel, payment processing, chargebacks, and other expenses related to these transactions. Information technology expenses consist primarily of software license and system maintenance fees, cloud computing costs, and outsourced data center costs, which increased due to higher cloud computing costs and outsourced data center costs, as well as increased software license and system maintenance fees. Our investments in technology and personnel are intended to improve long-term operating results, even if those expenditures create pressure on operating margins. The competition for technology talent in our industry is intense, leading to increased personnel expenses to attract and retain key talent. We continue to invest in technology to enhance our operational efficiency and support our business strategies. Our marketing expenses, which are substantially variable in nature, increased year-over-year to help drive additional gross bookings and revenues, reflecting our reliance on marketing channels to generate traffic to our websites. The mix of our gross bookings generated on a merchant basis increased significantly, indicating a shift in our business model that aligns with our strategic focus on enhancing IT capabilities. Our ongoing efforts to improve the efficiency of our marketing spend have resulted in higher performance marketing returns on investment, which are critical for maintaining competitive advantage in a dynamic market environment. We recognize that our ability to leverage IT capabilities effectively is essential for transforming our firm into a competitive force and achieving our organizational goals. The strategic allocation of resources towards technology integration and innovation partnerships is vital for enhancing our operational flexibility and responsiveness to market demands. As we navigate regulatory contexts and market dynamics, our commitment to IT capability development remains a cornerstone of our business strategy, ensuring that we can adapt to changing consumer preferences and technological advancements.

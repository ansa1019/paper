AT&T's business strategies reflect integrated product offerings that cut across product lines and utilize shared assets. The company emphasizes the importance of mobilizing and deploying IT-based resources in combination with leveraging the value of other resources and capabilities. The transformation efforts undertaken by AT&T include the abandonment of non-deployed wireless equipment associated with plans to collaborate with Ericsson to deploy commercial scale open radio access network (Open RAN), which aligns with federal goals to build a more robust ecosystem of network infrastructure providers. The network transformation is expected to result in additional cash charges in 2024. AT&T's operational efficiency is enhanced through continued investments in fiber and network upgrades, with expectations of increased depreciation expenses due to these strategic initiatives. The company anticipates revenue growth in wireless and broadband businesses as customers demand instant connectivity and higher speeds made possible by wireless network enhancements through 5G deployment and fiber network expansion. The strategic focus on efficiency is led by cost transformation initiatives, which are expected to pressure expense trends in 2024. AT&T plans to use its strong fiber and wireless assets, broad distribution, and integrated product offers to strengthen its overall market position. The company is also transforming its operations to be more efficient and effective, which includes restructuring businesses, sunsetting legacy networks, and improving customer service through digital transformation. The software benefits of 5G technology are expected to result in a more efficient use of capital and lower network-related expenses in the coming years. AT&T's operational flexibility is demonstrated through its ability to manage subscriber churn effectively, which is critical for maximizing revenue growth and maintaining margins. The company continues to drive efficiencies through automation, reductions in customer support expenses, and proactive rationalization of low-profit margin products. The integration of wireless and fiber services is a key focus, as AT&T aims to expand its wireless network capabilities and provide broadband offerings that allow customers to integrate their home or business fixed services with mobile services. The company recognizes the importance of regulatory compliance, particularly in relation to data protection and telecommunications regulations, which impact its operational strategies. AT&T's investment in technology infrastructure and capabilities is designed to enhance organizational effectiveness and support business transformation, ultimately contributing to improved firm performance and competitive advantage. The expected growth areas for AT&T include wireless and IP-based fiber broadband services, with a commitment to continue expanding its fiber deployment and enhancing service offerings to meet evolving customer demands.

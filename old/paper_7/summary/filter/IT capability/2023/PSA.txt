During 2023, we have implemented various initiatives to manage the adverse impacts of inflationary pressures on our cost of operations, including enhancements in operational processes and investments in technology to reduce payroll hours. We have also undertaken a multi-year property of tomorrow program to enhance the competitive position of certain of our facilities relative to local competitors, which includes upgrades to the configuration and layout of the offices and other customer zones to improve the customer experience. Investments in technology are aimed at achieving economies of scale from recent acquisitions, with centralized management costs allocated over a broader number of self-storage facilities. Our centralized management costs, which include information technology support and software development, decreased in 2023 due to these economies of scale. We have spent approximately $160 million on enhancements to our properties in 2023, which are expected to improve customer satisfaction and reduce operating costs. Additionally, we have embarked on a solar program to install solar panels on over 1,000 of our self-storage facilities, which is part of our strategy to enhance operational efficiency and reduce utility usage. Our investments in technology and operational improvements are intended to support our business strategy and enhance our market agility. The increase in marketing expense by 44.5% in 2023 reflects our commitment to utilizing technology and online advertising to attract new tenants, which is critical for maintaining competitive advantage in the self-storage market. We believe that our development and redevelopment activities generate favorable risk-adjusted returns over the long run, and our ability to leverage IT resources and capabilities is essential for optimizing our business processes and enhancing firm performance. We have also recognized the importance of mobilizing and deploying IT-based resources in combination with leveraging the value of other resources and capabilities to transform our firm into a competitive force. Our focus on information management capability ensures that we provide data and information to users with appropriate levels of accuracy, timeliness, reliability, and security, which are crucial for decision-making and operational flexibility. The strategic alignment of our technology capabilities with our business needs is vital for achieving performance gains and enhancing organizational effectiveness. We continue to evaluate our technology portfolio and make actionable investments that align with our organizational goals and market dynamics, ensuring that we remain responsive to external influences and competitive actions in the self-storage industry.

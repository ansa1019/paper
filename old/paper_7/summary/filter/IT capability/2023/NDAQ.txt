The organizational structure aligns our businesses with foundational shifts driving the evolution of the global financial system. Following the acquisition of Adenda, we refined the divisional structure into capital access platforms, financial technology, and market services reportable segments. Our capital access platforms segment has seen revenue increases, driven largely by higher international demand and annual listing fee growth. The financial technology segment has also benefited from increased demand related to new sales to existing clients and new customer acquisitions. The strong performance of our surveillance offerings has been a key driver of revenue growth, reflecting our capability to leverage technology resources effectively. The increase in capital markets technology revenues was primarily due to demand for colocation and connectivity services, highlighting the importance of operational flexibility and IT investment in supporting business needs. Our strategic initiatives and completed acquisitions have resulted in expenses that would not have otherwise been incurred, reflecting our ongoing commitment to enhancing our IT capabilities. The increase in compensation and benefits expense was driven by increased headcount, which is essential for supporting our technology deployment and operational efficiency. We have pursued various strategic initiatives to optimize our efficiencies as a combined organization, which includes the integration of technology platforms to advance our strategic opportunities as a technology and analytics provider. The restructuring program initiated in 2023 aims to realize the full potential of our new corporate structure, emphasizing the importance of IT governance and management capability in achieving business transformation. We expect to achieve significant net expense synergies following the closing of the Adenda acquisition, which will enhance our operational effectiveness and performance outcomes. Our investment choices reflect a strategic resource allocation that supports long-term growth, with a focus on balancing acquisitions and internal investments. The ongoing review of our real estate and facility capacity requirements has led to impairment charges, indicating a need for process optimization and resource management in line with our evolving business environment. Our liquidity and capital resources remain healthy, allowing us to invest in activities that support our long-term operational goals. The integration of our technology capabilities is critical to maintaining competitive advantage and responding to market dynamics, ensuring that we can effectively manage external influences and capitalize on emerging opportunities. The performance linkage between our IT capabilities and overall firm performance underscores the necessity of strategic alignment in our business processes, facilitating innovation and enhancing customer relationships.

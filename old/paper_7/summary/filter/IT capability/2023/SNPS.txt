The management's discussion and analysis highlights that our growth strategy is based on maintaining and building on our leadership in our design automation products, expanding and proliferating our design IP offerings, and continuing to expand our product portfolio and total addressable market. Our customers trust that our technologies will enable them to meet new requirements for energy efficiency, reliability, mobility, security, and more. The current macroeconomic environment could lead some of our customers to postpone their decision-making, decrease their spending, and/or delay their payments to us, which may affect our software integrity segment as customers apply elevated levels of scrutiny to purchasing decisions due to their own budget uncertainty. Our management is considering a full range of strategic opportunities for our software integrity segment, which underscores the importance of mobilizing and deploying IT-based resources in combination with leveraging the value of other resources and capabilities. We have consistently grown our revenue since 2005, despite periods of global economic uncertainty, due to our solid execution, leading technologies, and strong customer relationships. The revenue we recognize in a particular period generally results from selling efforts in prior periods rather than the current period, indicating that our IT capabilities support long-term business strategies. Our organizational structure was realigned to evaluate the results of our design IP business separately, allowing our chief operating decision maker to assess performance against key growth strategies and allocate resources effectively. The software integrity segment includes a broad portfolio of products and services that intelligently address software risks across the customer's portfolio and at all stages of the application lifecycle, demonstrating our commitment to enhancing IT capabilities. Our offerings enable customers to manage open-source license compliance and detect, prioritize, and remediate security vulnerabilities and defects, which are critical for maintaining operational efficiency and organizational effectiveness. The increase in research and development expenses reflects our commitment to expanding and enhancing our product portfolio, which is essential for maintaining competitive advantage in the market. We anticipate additional changes to U.S. export regulations in the future, which could impact our ability to compete in international markets and requires ongoing monitoring of geopolitical pressures. Our principal sources of liquidity are funds generated from our business operations, and we believe that our existing cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments will be sufficient to satisfy our cash requirements and capital return program over the next 12 months. The backlog of contracted but unsatisfied performance obligations indicates a strong demand for our IT resources and capabilities, which are essential for supporting business needs and driving performance gains. The strategic decisions made by our management reflect an understanding of the importance of IT governance and resource allocation in achieving organizational goals and enhancing firm capabilities.

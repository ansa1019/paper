During the year ended December 31, 2023, we expect to incur approximately $130.0 million in capital expenditures related to investments in existing restaurants including remodeling and similar improvements, new equipment and hardware, technology to optimize efficiencies. Our total capital expenditures for 2023 were $560.7 million, with a significant portion allocated to technology investments aimed at enhancing operations and guest experiences. We have made $33.0 million in investments through our Cultivate Next Fund, which is focused on early-stage investments into strategically aligned companies that further our mission to cultivate a better world. The majority of our purchase obligations relate to food, beverage and packaging, capital projects, information technology, marketing initiatives and corporate sponsorships, and other miscellaneous items. We expect to utilize cash flow from operations to invest in, maintain, and refurbish our existing restaurants, and for general corporate purposes, which includes investments in technology to boost innovation. Our operations do not require significant receivables, nor do they require significant inventories, due in part to our use of various fresh ingredients, and we generally have the right to pay for the purchase of food, beverages, and supplies sometime after the receipt of those items. We anticipate that at least 80% of our new restaurants will include a Chipotlane, which reflects our strategy to enhance operational efficiency and customer experience through technology integration. We expect to open approximately 285-315 new restaurants in 2024, which assumes that developer, permit, inspection, and utility delays do not worsen. Our digital sales represented 37.4% of total food and beverage revenue, indicating a significant reliance on digital technologies to drive sales. We believe these metrics are useful to investors because management uses these metrics to assess the growth of our business and the effectiveness of our marketing and operational strategies. Our cash flows are expected to be sufficient to meet ongoing capital expenditures, working capital requirements, and other cash needs for the foreseeable future, assuming no significant declines in comparable restaurant sales. We have not required significant working capital because customers generally pay using cash or credit and debit cards. The effective income tax rate increased 0.3% for the year ended December 31, 2023, primarily due to a decrease in excess tax benefits from equity vesting and exercises. Seasonal factors cause our profitability to fluctuate from quarter to quarter, and our quarterly results are also affected by other factors such as the amount and timing of non-cash stock-based compensation expense, litigation, settlement costs, and the timing of marketing or promotional expenses. We recognize compensation expense for equity awards over the requisite service period based on the award's fair value, which is influenced by our stock price volatility and expected life of the award. Our estimates of future revenues and expenses are highly subjective judgments based on internal projections and knowledge of our operations, historical performance, and trends in sales and restaurant operating costs. We expect to continue to leverage technology resources to enhance our operational capabilities and drive competitive advantage in the market.

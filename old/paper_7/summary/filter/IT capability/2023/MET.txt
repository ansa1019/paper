The life insurance industry remains highly competitive, with larger companies having the ability to invest in brand equity, product development, technology optimization, risk management, and innovation, which are fundamental for sustained profitable growth. Insurers are focused on their core businesses, specifically in markets where they can achieve scale, and are increasingly seeking alternative sources of revenue, including monetization of assets and fee-based services. Financial strength and flexibility, along with technology modernization, are prerequisites for sustainable growth in the life insurance industry. The ability to adapt to changes in the competitive environment due to global market volatility, changing interest rates, and uncertain economic conditions is a significant differentiator for success. The company’s investment portfolio is heavily weighted toward fixed income investments, which are well suited for matching the cash flow and duration of insurance liabilities. The management of the investment portfolio is guided by disciplined asset/liability management principles, focusing on cash flow and duration to support current and future liabilities. The company actively manages its assets using a liability-driven approach that balances quality, diversification, asset/liability matching, liquidity, concentration, and investment return. The goals of the investment process include optimizing risk-adjusted investment income and total return while ensuring that assets and liabilities are reasonably aligned on a cash flow and duration basis. The asset/liability management process is a shared responsibility among various departments, with oversight provided by senior management committees. The company’s economic capital model accounts for the unique risks inherent in its business and aligns segment allocated equity with emerging standards and consistent risk principles. The adoption of new accounting standards has resulted in changes to the economic capital model, which is periodically reviewed to ensure consistency with industry practices. The company monitors its mortgage loan investments and evaluates credit loss and impairments based on various factors, including economic conditions and borrower creditworthiness. The evaluation processes and methodologies used to determine credit loss are subject to inherent uncertainties and may change as new information becomes available. The company also focuses on managing operational and compliance risks, including risks related to cybersecurity, which are critical to maintaining organizational effectiveness and performance metrics. The integration of technology into business processes is essential for enhancing operational efficiency and supporting strategic resource allocation. The company’s ability to leverage technology resources effectively is crucial for meeting business needs and achieving competitive advantage in a rapidly evolving market landscape.

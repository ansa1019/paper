Our management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations highlights that we manage our operations through two geographic operating segments, offering a diversified product portfolio to capitalize on local and regional trends and customer needs. We believe our investments in the industry's largest sales organization, including our extensive network of technical and veterinary operations specialists, enhance our operational efficiency and support our core growth strategies. Our research and development efforts enable us to deliver innovative products, focusing on product lifecycle innovation, which leverages existing animal health products by adding new species or claims, achieving approvals in new markets, or creating new combinations and reformulations. The importance of quality and safety concerns to our customers contributes to brand loyalty, which underscores the necessity of maintaining high standards in our manufacturing processes. Our operational efficiency program, launched in 2015, aims to reduce complexity in our product portfolios and optimize resource allocation, which includes reducing resources associated with non-customer facing activities. We are also focusing on improving operational and cost efficiencies, which increases the likelihood of achieving our core growth strategies and enhancing long-term value for our shareholders. The animal health industry is competitive, and we face competition in various regions, necessitating continuous innovation and adaptation to market dynamics. Our management team is committed to enhancing the health of animals and bringing solutions to our customers, which requires a robust IT capability to support business needs and operational flexibility. We have entered into agreements with Pfizer for transitional services, including business technology and other support functions, which are critical in maintaining our operational effectiveness post-separation. Our financial activities are influenced by global economic conditions, and we continuously monitor our liquidity position to ensure we can meet future funding requirements. The operational revenue growth we experienced was driven by increased demand across our product lines, particularly in livestock and companion animal sectors, which reflects our ability to respond to market needs effectively. Our strategic resource allocation and investment decisions are guided by the need to enhance our IT infrastructure and capabilities, which are essential for supporting our business processes and achieving competitive advantage. The challenges we face, including regulatory changes and market fluctuations, necessitate a strong focus on IT governance and resource mobilization to ensure we can adapt to evolving business environments. Our commitment to operational efficiency and strategic management practices is designed to optimize our performance and enhance our organizational capabilities, thereby supporting our long-term growth objectives.

We regularly evaluate the appropriateness of our reportable segments, particularly in light of organizational changes, merger and acquisition activity, and changing laws and regulations. Our results of operations depend in large part on our ability to accurately predict and effectively manage health care costs through effective contracting with providers of care to our members and our medical management and health and wellness programs. We believe our pricing strategy, based on predictive modeling, proprietary research, and data-driven processes, as well as our overall investments for health care reform, have positioned us to benefit from the potential growth opportunities available in fully-insured commercial products as a result of health care reform. We continue to analyze and refine our estimates of the ultimate impact of health care reform on our business, cash flows, financial condition, and results of operations. Health care reform presents us with new growth opportunities, but also introduces new risks, regulatory challenges, and uncertainties, and required changes in the way products are designed, underwritten, priced, distributed, and administered. We have continued to implement security enhancements since a sophisticated external cyber attack that gained unauthorized access to certain of our information technology systems and obtained personal information related to many individuals and employees. We expect to finance the cash portion of the acquisition through available cash on hand and the issuance of new debt. Our growth strategy is designed to enable us to take advantage of additional economies of scale as well as providing us access to new and evolving technologies and products. The combined company will reflect a pro forma equity ownership comprised of approximately 67% Anthem shareholders and approximately 33% Cigna shareholders. Our operating revenue consists of premiums, administrative fees, and other revenue, which are influenced by our ability to manage health care costs effectively. The potential effect of escalating health care costs, any changes in our ability to negotiate competitive rates with our providers, and any regulatory or market-driven restrictions on our ability to obtain adequate premium rates to offset overall inflation in health care costs may impose further risks to our ability to profitably underwrite our business. We utilize technology to support our operations and enhance our service delivery, which is critical in maintaining our competitive positioning in the market. Our technology infrastructure is integral to our operational efficiency and effectiveness in managing customer relationships and health care delivery. We believe that our investments in technology capabilities will enhance our ability to respond to market dynamics and improve our overall firm performance. The integration of our IT systems and processes is essential for achieving operational flexibility and optimizing our resource allocation. We aim to leverage our IT capabilities to enhance our business processes and improve our market responsiveness. Our strategic management practices include continuous evaluation of our technology portfolio to ensure alignment with our organizational goals and market demands. We recognize the importance of IT governance in managing our technology resources and ensuring compliance with regulatory requirements. As we navigate the complexities of the health care landscape, our ability to effectively deploy IT resources will be critical in achieving our strategic objectives and enhancing our competitive advantage.

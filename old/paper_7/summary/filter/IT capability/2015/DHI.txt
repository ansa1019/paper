During fiscal 2015, we significantly increased our land, lot, and home inventories across our markets, while maintaining a strong balance sheet and liquidity position, which supports our operational flexibility and strategic resource allocation. Our position as the largest and most geographically diverse homebuilder in the United States provides a strong platform for us to compete for new home sales, leveraging our financial and competitive position to increase the returns on our inventory investments and generate strong profitability and cash flows. We are focused on managing our product offerings, pricing, sales pace, and inventory levels to optimize the return on our inventory investments, which reflects our capability to adapt to changing market dynamics and consumer demands. Our operating strategy includes modifying product offerings and sales incentives as necessary in each of our markets to meet consumer demand, aligning with finished lot supply and construction activity. We continually evaluate our land and lot supply, and fluctuations in revenues and profitability from land sales can occur based on how we manage our inventory levels in various markets. Our business strategy is designed to optimize the returns on our inventory investments and cash flows, which requires effective management of our operational activities and investments in technology resources. We expect our revenues and profitability to increase during fiscal 2016, although at a lower growth rate than we experienced in fiscal 2015, as we manage our land and lot inventories relative to local new home demand. The increases in sales order value were primarily due to increases in volume as we have expanded our operations and increased our market share in many of our markets over the past year, demonstrating our capability to leverage strategic resources effectively. We believe our business is well positioned for the future because of our broad geographic operating base and product offerings, our inventory of finished lots, land, and homes, and our strong balance sheet and liquidity. Our operating strategy has produced positive results in recent years, although we cannot provide assurances that the initiatives will continue to be successful, highlighting the importance of strategic management practices and adaptability in response to market conditions. We have used our liquidity and balance sheet flexibility to provide the capital to increase our investments in housing and land inventory, expand our product offerings, and opportunistically pursue business acquisitions, which underscores our commitment to enhancing our IT capabilities in support of business strategies. The ability to mobilize and deploy IT-based resources in combination with leveraging the value of other resources and capabilities is critical in transforming our firm into a competitive force. Our IT governance and management capabilities are essential in ensuring that we can respond effectively to external influences and maintain operational efficiency, which is vital for sustaining our competitive advantage in the evolving housing market.

Cigna's strategy is to "go deep", "go global" and "go individual" with a differentiated set of medical, dental, disability, life and accident insurance and related products and services offered by its subsidiaries. The company emphasizes the importance of mobilizing and deploying IT-based resources in combination with leveraging the value of other resources and capabilities. Cigna's IT capabilities represent the application of physical or intangible IT resources such as technology, knowledge, practices, relationships, management skills, business process understanding, and human resources to further organizational goals. The firm’s IT capabilities have been evolving to encompass the coordination of a firm’s assets and internal processes and their interfirm transactions and relationships. Cigna utilizes adjusted income from operations as its principal financial measure of operating performance because management believes it best reflects the underlying results of business operations and permits analysis of trends in underlying revenue, expenses, and profitability. The company’s investment decisions are guided by regulatory requirements and rating agency capital guidelines, determining the amount of capital resources that are maintained to support growth and maintain or improve the financial strength ratings of subsidiaries. Cigna prioritizes its use of capital resources to provide the capital necessary to support growth, consider acquisitions that are strategically and economically advantageous, and return capital to investors through share repurchase. The availability of capital resources will be impacted by equity and credit market conditions, which may reduce the ability to issue debt or equity securities. The company also monitors developments related to risk corridor programs and the effects of changes in government funding for Medicare programs, which could materially reduce revenues and profitability. Cigna's operational flexibility is reflected in its ability to adapt to changes in market dynamics, including health care reform regulations and the impact of the health insurance industry tax. The firm’s medical customer base increased due to growth in targeted market segments and strategic investments in business initiatives. The company’s performance metrics, including loss ratios and expense ratios, are influenced by strategic business investments and operational efficiencies. The firm’s approach to technology integration and management is critical for maintaining competitive positioning and enhancing organizational capabilities. Cigna’s investments in technology infrastructure and digital transformation initiatives are aimed at improving operational efficiency and supporting business innovation. The company recognizes the significance of information management capability, which includes the ability to provide data and information to users with appropriate levels of accuracy, timeliness, reliability, security, confidentiality, connectivity, and access, tailored to changing business needs and directions. Cigna is committed to leveraging its IT resources to enhance business performance and respond effectively to external influences and competitive actions in the market.

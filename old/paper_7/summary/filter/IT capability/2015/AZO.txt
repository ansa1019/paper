During fiscal 2015, we achieved strong performance, delivering record net income and sales growth, which were influenced by various macroeconomic factors affecting our consumer base and industry. Our business strategy is impacted by the need to adjust our advertising message, store staffing, and product assortment in response to fluctuations in demand. We have closely studied our hub distribution model and store inventory levels, performing strategic tests on increased frequency of delivery to our stores and expanding parts assortments. Our investments are expected to be directed primarily to new locations, supply chain infrastructure, enhancements to existing locations, and investments in technology. The increase in capital expenditures during this time was primarily attributable to the number and types of locations opened, increased investment in our existing locations, and the acquisition of Interamerican Motor Corporation (IMC). We have initiated a variety of strategic tests focused on increasing inventory availability, which increased our inventory per location. Our ability to leverage our inventory purchases may be limited by our vendors' capacity to factor their receivables from us. We plan to continue leveraging our inventory purchases, supported by extended payment terms negotiated with many of our vendors. Our cash flows from operations are favorable due to growth in net income and the timing of income tax deductions, which allows us to support a majority of our capital expenditures, working capital requirements, and stock repurchases through internally generated funds and available borrowing capacity. Our technology investments are aimed at enhancing operational efficiency and supporting our business processes, which are critical for maintaining competitive advantage in the automotive parts market. We believe that as the number of miles driven increases, consumers' vehicles are more likely to need service and maintenance, resulting in an increase in demand for automotive hard parts and maintenance items. Our strategic initiatives, including the integration of technology into our operations, are designed to optimize our supply chain management and improve our market responsiveness. We expect to continue to invest in our technology infrastructure to enhance our information management capabilities, which are essential for meeting business needs and supporting our organizational goals. The performance linkage between our technology investments and operational outcomes is a key focus area, as we aim to create value through improved efficiency and effectiveness in our business processes. Our management practices emphasize the importance of aligning our technology capabilities with our strategic objectives to ensure that we remain agile and responsive to market dynamics. The integration of digital technologies into our operations is expected to facilitate better decision-making and enhance our overall organizational performance. As we continue to navigate the complexities of the automotive parts industry, our commitment to leveraging IT capabilities will be crucial in transforming our business and achieving sustainable growth.

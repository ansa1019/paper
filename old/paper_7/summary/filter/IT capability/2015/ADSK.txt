Autodesk's strategy is to lead the industries it serves to cloud-based technologies and business models, which entails both a technological shift and a business model shift. The company is undergoing a business model transition in which it will discontinue selling new perpetual licenses in favor of subscriptions and flexible license arrangements. This transition is expected to provide customers with more flexibility in how they gain access to and pay for products, ultimately increasing long-term revenue growth rates by enhancing total subscriptions and customer value over time. The company has accelerated its move to the cloud and mobile devices, offering more flexible licensing options that include cloud-based offerings like Autodesk BIM 360, PLM 360, Fusion 360, and AutoCAD 360 Pro, which provide tools to streamline design, collaboration, and data management processes. Autodesk's ability to bring advanced technology to mainstream markets and the breadth and depth of its product portfolio are considered key competitive advantages, allowing customers to address a wide variety of problems across different industries. The company's software architecture supports extensibility and integration with other products, which enhances its technology capabilities. The transition to cloud services is also expected to improve operational efficiency and enable better resource allocation, as the company aims to connect all participants in the design and manufacturing processes. The increase in IT costs allocated to various departments, including research and development, is indicative of the company's commitment to enhancing its IT capabilities to support business needs and improve product functionality. Furthermore, the company recognizes that conducting business in emerging economies presents significant challenges, including economic volatility and local competition, which its design technology can help address. The restructuring plan initiated in February 2016 aims to reduce headcount and consolidate facilities to streamline operations and reallocate resources in alignment with the company's strategic goals. This restructuring is expected to incur additional costs in the short term but is intended to enhance the company's operational flexibility and market responsiveness in the long run. Autodesk's commitment to improving its IT infrastructure and capabilities is reflected in its ongoing investments in technology and the integration of its product offerings to better serve its customers and adapt to changing market dynamics. The company's focus on digital transformation and the adoption of cloud-based solutions is anticipated to enhance its competitive positioning and drive future business performance.

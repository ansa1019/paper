Dominion's strategy is to continue focusing on its regulated businesses while maintaining upside potential in well-positioned nonregulated businesses. The goals of this strategy are to provide EPS growth, a growing dividend, and to maintain a stable credit profile. Dominion expects 80% to 90% of earnings from its primary operating segments to come from regulated and long-term contracted businesses. The company anticipates growth in weather-normalized electric utility sales and construction and operation of growth projects in electric utility operations. Additionally, Dominion expects to focus on meeting new and developing environmental requirements, including by making investments in utility solar generation, particularly in Virginia. Changes in technology, particularly with respect to new, developing, or alternative sources of generation and smart grid technologies, are also highlighted as significant factors. The impact of operational hazards, including adverse developments with respect to pipeline and plant safety or integrity, equipment loss, malfunction or failure, operator error, and other catastrophic events, is acknowledged as a risk that could affect performance. The company's operational flexibility is supported by its ability to mobilize and deploy IT-based resources in combination with leveraging the value of other resources and capabilities. Dominion's IT capabilities are essential in transforming the firm into a competitive force, as they represent the application of technology, knowledge, practices, and management skills to further organizational goals. The company recognizes that its IT governance and resource management are critical in achieving operational efficiency and enhancing business value. Furthermore, the firm’s ability to provide data and information to users with appropriate levels of accuracy, timeliness, reliability, security, confidentiality, connectivity, and access is emphasized as a key component of its information management capability. The strategic resource allocation decisions made by Dominion are influenced by the need to adapt to changing business needs and directions, which underscores the importance of IT capability in supporting business strategies and work processes. Additionally, the company’s investment decisions are shaped by the need to enhance its capabilities in data management and analytics, which are vital for maintaining competitive advantage in the market. The evolving nature of IT capabilities within Dominion reflects a broader trend in the industry towards integrating digital technologies into operational processes to optimize performance and respond effectively to market dynamics. The firm’s commitment to innovation partnerships and strategic management practices further illustrates its focus on leveraging technology to enhance organizational effectiveness and agility in a rapidly changing business environment.

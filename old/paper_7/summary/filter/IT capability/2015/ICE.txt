Our business environments directly affect our results of operations, influenced by factors including market volatility, legislative and regulatory changes, competition, demand for our data services, system reliability, and our ability to offer new products. The business environment has been characterized by increasing competition among global markets for trading volumes and listings, globalization of exchanges, and market participants' demand for speed, capacity, and reliability, which necessitates ongoing investment in technology. The acquisition of interactive data and trayport enhances our technology capabilities, allowing us to provide new technology and software-related services to our customers, thereby supporting our strategy to grow revenue streams. We have diversified our business to reduce dependency on volatility and trading activity, increasing our non-transaction and clearing revenues significantly. Our data services fee revenues increased due to the addition of new users, expanded product offerings, and the integration of acquired companies, which reflects our commitment to leveraging technology resources to meet evolving business needs. The integration of technology platforms from acquisitions contributes to operational efficiency and enhances our ability to deliver data and analytics, which are critical for market participants' investing, risk management, and capital raising activities. Our technology infrastructure supports the timely, reliable, and secure transmission of data, which is essential for maintaining competitive advantage in the market. We recognize that changes in technology in the financial services industry impact our operational strategies and necessitate continuous adaptation to maintain market responsiveness. The implementation of new regulations may also affect our operational capabilities and require significant resource allocation to ensure compliance. We are focused on enhancing our IT governance and management capabilities to effectively mobilize and deploy IT-based resources in conjunction with other strategic resources. Our investments in technology and data management systems are aimed at optimizing business processes and improving organizational effectiveness, which are vital for achieving performance excellence. The growth in our technology capabilities, particularly through acquisitions, positions us to better respond to market dynamics and consumer demands, facilitating our transformation into a more competitive force in the financial markets. Our strategic management practices emphasize the importance of aligning technology investments with organizational goals, ensuring that we remain agile and capable of navigating the complexities of the evolving business environment.

The discussion should be read in conjunction with the other sections of this annual report, including the consolidated financial statements and related notes, and the discussion of risks and cautionary factors that may affect future results. We manage our business in four segments, and our portfolio comprises both international and local brands. Our net revenues and operating income are affected by various factors, including the volume of products we sell and changes in currency exchange rates. Our marketing, administration, and research costs include the costs of marketing and selling our products and costs incurred to develop new products. The most significant components of our marketing, administration, and research costs are marketing and sales expenses and general and administrative expenses. As a holding company, our principal sources of funds are from the receipt of dividends and repayment of debt from our subsidiaries. Our principal wholly owned and majority-owned subsidiaries currently are not limited by long-term debt or other agreements in their ability to pay cash dividends or to make other distributions with respect to their common stock. The changes in our reported diluted earnings per share for the year ended December 31, 2015, were influenced by various operational factors, including asset impairment and exit costs related to organizational restructuring. The unfavorable currency impact during 2015 results from the strengthening of the U.S. dollar, which has affected our profitability across our primary revenue markets. Our segments experienced higher pricing, partially offset by higher marketing, administration, and research costs, as well as unfavorable volume/mix and higher manufacturing costs. We estimate 2016 international cigarette volume to decline by approximately 2.0%-2.5%. The factors described represent continuing risks to our forecast. We believe it is appropriate to disclose adjusted diluted EPS as it represents core earnings, improves comparability, and helps investors analyze business performance and trends. This guidance excludes the impact of future acquisitions, unanticipated asset impairment and exit cost charges, future changes in currency exchange rates, and any unusual events. The discussion and analysis of critical accounting estimates are essential for understanding our financial condition and results of operations. Our organizational capabilities and management skills are integral to our operational efficiency and effectiveness in the market. The ability to mobilize and deploy IT-based resources, combined with leveraging the value of other resources and capabilities, is crucial for transforming our firm into a competitive force. The application of IT capabilities supports our business strategies and work processes, enhancing our operational flexibility and responsiveness to market dynamics. Our focus on information management capability ensures that we provide data and information to users with appropriate levels of accuracy, timeliness, reliability, security, confidentiality, connectivity, and access, tailored to changing business needs and directions.

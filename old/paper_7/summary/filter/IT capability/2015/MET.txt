The life insurance industry remains highly competitive, with larger companies having the ability to invest in brand equity, product development, technology, and risk management, which are fundamental for sustained profitable growth. The product development and product life cycles have shortened in many segments, leading to more intense competition regarding product features. Sufficient scale, financial strength, and financial flexibility are becoming prerequisites for sustainable growth in the life insurance industry. The company believes it is well positioned to compete in this environment. The company's business and results of operations are materially affected by conditions in the global capital markets and the economy generally. Stressed conditions, volatility, and disruptions in global capital markets can adversely affect the company, in part because it has a large investment portfolio and its insurance liabilities are sensitive to changing market factors. The company continues to evaluate its segment performance and allocated resources and may adjust related measurements in the future to better reflect segment profitability. The management of the investment portfolio is conducted using disciplined asset/liability management principles, focusing on cash flow and duration to support current and future liabilities. The company applies various asset/liability management strategies, including the use of derivatives, primarily interest rate swaps, to mitigate the risk associated with a sustained low interest rate environment. The company has engaged in certain reinsurance agreements covering some of its variable annuity business. The company’s IT capabilities have evolved to encompass the coordination of its assets and internal processes, as well as interfirm transactions and relationships. The company emphasizes the importance of mobilizing and deploying IT-based resources in combination with leveraging the value of other resources and capabilities. The ability to provide data and information to users with appropriate levels of accuracy, timeliness, reliability, security, confidentiality, connectivity, and access is critical. The company believes that its IT capabilities represent the application of physical or intangible IT resources, such as technology, knowledge, practices, relationships, management skills, and business process understanding, to further organizational goals. The company’s strategic initiatives and technology management practices are designed to enhance operational efficiency and support business innovation. The management of investment risks is conducted through a risk control framework, which includes policies, procedures, and limits. The company utilizes various strategies to manage risks, including the use of derivatives to hedge certain risks, such as changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, credit spreads, and equity market levels. The company’s investment portfolio is heavily weighted toward fixed income investments, and it continuously monitors and adjusts its liquidity and capital plans in light of market conditions. The company’s liquidity is provided by a variety of global funding sources, including funding agreements, credit facilities, and commercial paper, which enhance its funding flexibility and lower the cost of funds. The company’s capital management process includes regular reviews of actual and projected capital levels and its annual capital plan, ensuring alignment with emerging standards and consistent risk principles.

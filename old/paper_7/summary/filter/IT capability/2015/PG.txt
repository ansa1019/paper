The global business services (GBS) organization is responsible for providing technology, processes, and standard data tools to enable the global business units (GBUs) and selling and market operations (SMOs) to better understand the business and better serve consumers and customers. GBS aims to provide world-class solutions at a low cost and with minimal capital investment. The company has undertaken an effort to focus and strengthen its business portfolio to compete in categories and brands that are structurally attractive and that play to Procter & Gamble's strengths, enabling resource allocation to leading brands marketed in the right set of countries, channels, and customers. Innovation is emphasized as a core capability, with a focus on improving category, brand, and market business models to better serve consumers and customers. The company is also committed to improving execution and operating discipline, which are viewed as core capabilities and competitive advantages. The productivity and cost savings plan initiated in 2012 aims to reduce costs and better leverage scale in supply chain, research and development, marketing, and overheads, with the expectation of incurring restructuring costs over a six-year period. The company believes that its financial condition is of high quality, as evidenced by its ability to generate substantial cash from operations and maintain access to capital markets at competitive rates. Operating cash flow is the primary source of cash to fund operating needs and capital expenditures, with excess operating cash used for shareholder dividends and other discretionary uses such as share repurchases and acquisitions. The company has a strong focus on improving cash flow and operational efficiency, which is reflected in its adjusted free cash flow productivity metrics. The management uses certain market share and market consumption estimates to evaluate performance relative to competition, despite limitations on the availability and comparability of share and consumption information. The organizational structure includes global business units that are responsible for developing overall brand strategy, new product upgrades, innovations, and marketing plans, while the SMOs are tasked with executing go-to-market plans at the local level. The company has also implemented measures to manage commodity fluctuations, pricing actions, and cost savings projects to mitigate risks associated with changes in costs and foreign exchange impacts. The strategic focus is on delivering total shareholder return in the top one-third of the peer group, with a balanced measure requiring strong performance across sales growth, profit margin expansion, and efficient asset utilization. The companyâ€™s ongoing efforts to streamline management decision-making and work processes are expected to enhance operational flexibility and support business transformation initiatives.

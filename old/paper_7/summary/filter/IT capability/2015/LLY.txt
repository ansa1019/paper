The acquisition of Novartis Animal Health has provided Elanco with a greater commercial presence in the companion animal and swine markets, expanded Elanco's presence in equine and vaccines areas, and created an entry into the aquaculture market. The combined organization has increased our animal health product portfolio, expanded our global commercial presence, and augmented our animal health manufacturing and research and development. Our long-term success depends to a great extent on our ability to continue to discover and develop innovative pharmaceutical products and acquire or collaborate on molecules currently in development by other biotechnology or pharmaceutical companies. We manage research and development spending across our portfolio of molecules, and a delay in, or termination of, any one project will not necessarily cause a significant change in our total research and development spending. We recognized acquired in-process research and development charges of $535.0 million in 2015 resulting from various collaboration agreements, primarily with Pfizer, as well as the consideration paid to acquire the worldwide rights to Locemia's intranasal glucagon. The challenges inherent in pharmaceutical research and development and the introduction of new products include a high rate of failure, with the process to bring a drug from the discovery phase to regulatory approval taking over a decade and costing more than $1 billion. We cannot reliably estimate the nature, timing, completion dates, and costs of the efforts necessary to complete the development of our research and development projects, nor can we reliably estimate the future potential revenue that will be generated from a successful research and development project. The integration of technology resources and capabilities into our operational framework is critical for enhancing our business strategies and achieving operational efficiency. The strategic management of our technology portfolio is essential for maintaining competitive advantage in a rapidly evolving market. Our ability to leverage IT capabilities effectively in support of business needs has become a key factor in transforming our firm into a competitive force. We focus on information management capability, which includes the ability to provide data and information to users with appropriate levels of accuracy, timeliness, reliability, security, confidentiality, connectivity, and access, and the ability to tailor these in response to changing business needs and directions. The loss of patent exclusivity for key products has resulted in significant revenue declines, highlighting the importance of strategic resource allocation and market responsiveness in our business operations. The evolving landscape of healthcare regulations and pricing pressures necessitates agility in our operational and strategic decisions to ensure continued market positioning and performance outcomes. The integration of digital technologies into our processes is vital for enhancing our innovation capabilities and improving our overall organizational effectiveness. The management of external relationships and collaborations is also critical for navigating the complexities of the pharmaceutical industry and maximizing our investment opportunities. Our focus on business process management and operational flexibility enables us to respond effectively to market dynamics and consumer demands, ensuring that we remain competitive in an increasingly challenging environment.

The company remains focused on delivering sustainable growth and shareholder value while making appropriate investments for the future. BD management operates the business consistent with core strategies to improve operating effectiveness and balance sheet productivity. Our strategy emphasizes providing tools and technologies to the research community, which facilitate the understanding of cellular diagnostics and cell therapy. We continue to invest in research and development, geographic expansion, and new product promotions to drive further revenue and profit growth. Our ability to sustain long-term growth depends on factors including the expansion of our core business, development of innovative new products, and improvement of operational efficiency and organizational effectiveness, including the integration of CareFusion. The integration of CareFusion is expected to enhance our operational capabilities and drive efficiencies across our business segments. We evaluate our results of operations on both a reported and a foreign currency-neutral basis, which excludes the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. The company faces foreign currency exposure from fluctuating exchange rates on payables and receivables relating to transactions denominated in currencies other than our functional currency. We hedge substantially all such exposures, primarily through the use of forward contracts. The effective management of our financial instruments is crucial for mitigating risks associated with foreign currency exchange and interest rates. We also assess the outcomes of our strategies by reviewing quarterly forecast data, monthly actual results, segment sales, and other similar information. The company’s financial position remains strong, with cash flows from operating activities totaling $1.73 billion. Our strategic objectives include optimizing the cost of capital based on market conditions and ensuring access to the debt market for strategic opportunities. The acquisition of CareFusion has positioned us as a global leader in medication management and patient safety solutions, which is integral to our business transformation efforts. We continue to pursue growth opportunities in emerging markets, particularly in countries with rapidly growing economic and healthcare sectors. The operational activities of CareFusion are expected to enhance our capabilities in delivering innovative solutions to healthcare institutions and life science researchers. The ongoing strength of the U.S. dollar has resulted in an unfavorable foreign currency translation impact on our revenue growth. We regularly review the amount of cash and short-term investments held outside the United States and currently intend to use such amounts to fund our international operations and growth initiatives. The company’s ability to penetrate emerging markets depends on local economic and political conditions, as well as our capacity to form strategic business alliances and enhance infrastructure. We are committed to leveraging our IT capabilities to support business needs, enhance operational efficiency, and drive competitive advantage in the marketplace. The effective integration of technology resources and management skills is essential for achieving our organizational goals and sustaining our competitive positioning in the industry.

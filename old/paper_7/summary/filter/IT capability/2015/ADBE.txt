During fiscal 2015, we integrated Fotolia into our digital media reportable segment, enhancing our technology resources and capabilities. Our acquisition of Neolane, a leader in cross-channel campaign management technology, exemplifies our strategy to leverage technology functionalities to support business needs and enhance competitive advantage. The transition to a subscription-based model through Creative Cloud has transformed our business model, allowing us to increase operational efficiency and market agility while delivering value through more frequent product updates and enhanced connectivity for users. We recognize that our IT capabilities, which include the ability to deploy and combine IT resources effectively, are critical in supporting our business strategies and enhancing organizational performance. Our focus on information management capability ensures that we provide data and information with appropriate levels of accuracy, timeliness, reliability, and security, which are essential for decision-making processes. The growth in our digital media segment, driven by the adoption of Creative Cloud, reflects the importance of aligning our technology portfolio with market dynamics and consumer demands. We continue to invest in research and development to maintain our competitive positioning and to ensure that our technology infrastructure supports the evolving needs of our customers. The increase in annualized recurring revenue (ARR) in our digital media segment demonstrates the successful integration of our IT capabilities into our business model, enhancing our ability to respond to market changes and customer preferences. Our digital marketing segment, which includes Adobe Marketing Cloud, has also shown significant growth, indicating the effectiveness of our strategic resource allocation in technology deployment. We recognize that the ability to mobilize and leverage IT-based resources in combination with other organizational capabilities is key to achieving performance gains and sustaining competitive advantage. The challenges associated with managing our IT governance and ensuring compliance with regulatory contexts are ongoing, but we believe that our investments in IT capabilities will continue to drive business transformation and improve overall firm performance. Our strategic decisions regarding acquisitions and technology investments are aimed at enhancing our operational flexibility and responsiveness to market opportunities. The integration of acquired companies and their technologies into our existing operations is a critical aspect of our strategy to optimize processes and enhance our value chain. We remain committed to developing our IT capabilities to support our long-term business objectives and to create actionable investments that align with our organizational goals.

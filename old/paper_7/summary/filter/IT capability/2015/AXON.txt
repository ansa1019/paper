Our axon platform is the market leading solution for wearable cameras with a robust software system for storing, managing, and sharing the related video data. We have created relationships with over 20,000 public safety agencies around the world. One key insight is that law enforcement agencies around the world are significantly "behind the curve" when it comes to technology. Many agencies still rely largely on paper-based reporting systems and have limited access to modern mobile smartphone technology. Internet-enabled platforms that connect end users direct to technology providers have dramatically changed industry after industry. These internet-enabled businesses offer accelerated speed of technology innovation, reduced cost of implementation and distribution to the end customer, and network effects enabling easy collaboration and information sharing. We are building out our axon platform with body cameras and video management, which are driving rapid growth and market penetration today. However, the real opportunity is to leverage this connected platform to enable a broad suite of mobile, wearable, and data management capabilities to bring modern information technology capabilities to every law enforcement officer. With our axon platform, and the evidence.com service, we have built the first and largest cloud-hosted platform in the public safety space. We will leverage this platform to roll out additional capabilities, both hardware and software, to empower the heroic men and women of public safety to be more efficient, more effective, and have access to the best information available. There is a deep synergy across our product and service offerings and strategies. For example, the public scrutiny around the usage of taser devices provides a compelling reason to deploy body cameras, which require massive amounts of storage and video management capability best achieved through a cloud-hosted system such as our evidence.com service. Our strategy is to create a dominant market position in domestic law enforcement and internationally over time. In the axon segment, our focus is on increasing bookings and brand awareness for evidence.com and axon cameras. We expect additional efforts will encompass tech summits, sponsorships, tradeshows, interaction with trade associations, and other promotional activities. We experienced increasing volumes of trial programs in 2015 and believe these trial programs are a great way for our customers to see the powerful capabilities, benefits, and compelling value proposition of our technology. We anticipate further increases in these trial programs in 2016, ultimately leading to increased sales. As market acceptance grows, we anticipate fewer and/or shorter trial programs will be necessary to capture sales. Additionally, our focus is on maintaining incremental sales channels by continuing to develop purchasing programs that position the company to own municipality budget lines and become the ongoing technology provider for our customers in order to drive sales growth and allow our customers to keep up with the latest technology while minimizing large upfront purchases. We remain committed to developing our presence in federal government and military markets. We intend to continue to place emphasis on supporting our military customers through our team of professionals with extensive military, homeland defense, and law enforcement experience. The primary focus of this team is to support military use for our existing hardware as well as increase technology development through contracted support. Technological innovation is the foundation for our long-term growth, and we intend to maintain our commitment to the research and development of our technology for both new and existing products that further our mission.

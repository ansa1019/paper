The information from the 2015 annual report set forth in exhibit 13 hereto under "results of operations," "business segments," "financial position, capital resources and liquidity," "critical accounting policies," "other items" and "safe harbor statement" is hereby incorporated by reference. Management believes that the following non-GAAP financial measures provide investors and analysts useful insight into the company's financial position and operating performance. Management closely monitors operating profit and operating profit margin of each business to evaluate past performance and actions required to improve profitability. All these measures are utilized by management to evaluate performance. Free cash flow is an indicator of the company's cash generating capabilities after considering investments in capital assets which are necessary to maintain and enhance existing operations. Management believes that free cash flow is useful to both management and investors as a measure of the company's ability to generate cash. The determination of operating cash flow adds back noncash depreciation expense to earnings and thereby does not reflect a charge for necessary capital expenditures. Management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations reflects the importance of mobilizing and deploying resources in combination with leveraging the value of other capabilities. The operational performance metrics and financial measures presented are indicative of the firm's ability to respond to changing business needs and directions, highlighting the significance of effective resource allocation and management capability in achieving competitive advantage. The focus on underlying sales and operating profit margins underscores the necessity of aligning business processes with strategic objectives to enhance organizational performance. The integration of non-GAAP measures serves to clarify the impact of operational decisions on financial outcomes, emphasizing the role of information management capability in providing timely and reliable data for informed decision-making. The company's strategic resource allocation and investment choices are critical in navigating market dynamics and ensuring operational efficiency, which are essential for sustaining competitive positioning in an evolving business environment.

Our management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations emphasizes the importance of enhancing operational and cost efficiencies, which increases the likelihood of achieving core growth strategies and enhancing long-term value for shareholders. We believe our investments in the industry's largest sales organization, including our extensive network of technical and veterinary operations specialists, contribute to enduring and valued relationships with our customers. Our research and development efforts enable us to deliver innovative products to address unmet needs and evolve our product lines to remain relevant for our customers. The operational efficiency program launched in 2015 focuses on reducing complexity in product portfolios and optimizing resource allocation, which is essential for improving operational efficiency and achieving strategic goals. We are also continuing to optimize our resource allocation and efficiency by reducing resources associated with non-customer facing activities and operating more efficiently as a result of less internal complexity and more standardization of processes. Our management team is committed to improving operational and cost efficiencies, which is critical in a competitive landscape where we face competition from both established market participants and new entrants. The animal health industry is competitive, and we utilize various methods of competition, including new product development, quality, price, service, and promotion to veterinary professionals, pet owners, and livestock producers. We believe our manufacturing and supply chain provides us with a global platform for continued expansion, including in emerging markets, and that our quality and reliability differentiate us from our competitors. Our operational revenue growth is defined as revenue growth excluding the impact of foreign exchange, indicating our ability to respond to market dynamics effectively. We also recognize the importance of IT resources and capabilities in supporting business needs, enhancing operational efficiency, and driving innovation. The integration of systems and processes during acquisitions is a significant focus, as these efforts are essential for maintaining competitive advantage and operational flexibility. Our strategic resource allocation and management practices are designed to leverage IT capabilities to support business strategies and enhance overall firm performance. The ability to provide data and information to users with appropriate levels of accuracy, timeliness, reliability, security, and access is a critical component of our information management capability. We are committed to mobilizing and deploying IT-based resources in combination with leveraging the value of other resources and capabilities to transform our firm into a competitive force. The operational efficiency initiatives we have undertaken are expected to yield performance gains and improve our market-based performance, aligning with our organizational goals and enhancing our overall business value.

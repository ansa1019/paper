The management's discussion and analysis highlights that we must continue to invest in manufacturing technologies, facilities and equipment, and R&D to develop new product and process technologies, support future growth, achieve operating efficiencies, and maintain product quality. The increases in gigabit sales volumes for 2016 were primarily attributable to higher manufacturing output due to improvements in product and process technologies. Our overall gross margin percentage declined primarily due to declines in average selling prices as a result of continued weakness in the PC sector, partially offset by increases in gigabits sold. The revisions of estimated useful lives of equipment in our DRAM wafer fabrication facilities reflect the need for operational flexibility and efficiency in resource deployment. We are continuously evaluating alternatives for efficiently funding capital expenditures and ongoing operations, which is crucial for maintaining competitive advantage in the market. Our cash generated from operations is highly dependent on selling prices for our products, which can vary significantly from period to period, indicating the importance of market responsiveness and agility. The restructuring plan initiated in response to the current business environment aims to accelerate focus on key priorities, which is essential for enhancing operational efficiency and achieving performance improvement. We recognize that our equity in net income (loss) of equity method investees has been impacted by declines in average selling prices and costs associated with transitioning to the next technology node, emphasizing the need for effective IT governance and management capability in navigating market dynamics. The need for strategic resource allocation is underscored by our commitment to invest approximately $4.8 billion to $5.2 billion in property, plant, and equipment in 2017, which reflects our focus on enhancing our technology portfolio and capabilities. Our research and development expenses reflect increased spending on controllers, firmware, and engineering to support system-level products, which is critical for maintaining our competitive positioning and driving business innovation. The importance of information management capability is evident as we strive to provide data and information to users with appropriate levels of accuracy, timeliness, reliability, and security, tailored in response to changing business needs. Our operational results indicate that the application of physical or intangible IT resources such as technology, knowledge, practices, and management skills is vital for furthering organizational goals and enhancing firm performance. The strategic decisions we make regarding investments and resource management are influenced by the need to leverage our IT capabilities effectively to support business strategies and work processes. The challenges we face in the current business environment necessitate a focus on innovation partnerships and technology integration to optimize our processes and enhance our organizational effectiveness. The dynamics of the semiconductor memory industry require us to remain vigilant in our approach to managing operational efficiency and aligning our business strategies with market demands.

Management monitors a variety of key indicators to evaluate our business results and financial condition, focusing on changes from year to year in certain key measures used by management to evaluate performance, such as profitability, growth, and credit quality metrics. Higher operating and marketing expenses associated with loan growth, as well as continued investments in technology and infrastructure, reflect our commitment to enhancing our IT capabilities. We expect that our near-term annual efficiency ratio will be in the 52%s, plus or minus a reasonable margin of volatility, driven by growth and digital productivity gains. Our actions have created a well-positioned balance sheet with strong capital and liquidity, which supports our technology deployment and operational flexibility. We believe we are positioned to deliver attractive growth and returns, as well as significant capital distribution, subject to regulatory approval. The provision for credit losses increased by $1.9 billion in 2016 compared to 2015, primarily driven by higher charge-offs and a larger allowance build in our credit card loan portfolio due to growth and portfolio seasoning. Our credit card business generated net income from continuing operations of $2.2 billion, reflecting the impact of our technology investments on operational efficiency and market responsiveness. We continue to monitor our portfolio and take steps to collect or work out distressed loans, which underscores our management capability in leveraging IT resources for enhanced decision-making and risk management. The increase in our credit card loan portfolio and the continued run-off of the acquired home loan portfolio demonstrate our strategic resource allocation towards high-performing assets. Our liquidity reserves increased significantly, driven by our investment securities portfolio, which is a testament to our effective resource management and operational efficiency. We have established representation and warranty reserves for losses associated with mortgage loans, which reflects our commitment to compliance and effective governance in our financial activities. Our risk management framework is designed to ensure that we can withstand significant funding degradation through idiosyncratic, systematic, and combined liquidity stress scenarios, highlighting our operational resilience and strategic alignment with market dynamics. The chief risk officer, in conjunction with the consumer and commercial chief credit officers, is responsible for establishing credit risk policies and procedures, including monitoring credit exposure and performance of our lending-related transactions. We utilize various allocation methodologies to assign certain balance sheet assets, deposits, and other liabilities directly or indirectly attributable to each business segment, which enhances our organizational integration and effectiveness. Our technology management practices are continuously assessed to ensure alignment with industry standards and regulatory requirements, thereby facilitating our business transformation and enhancing our competitive positioning in the market.

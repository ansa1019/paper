The company's organizational structure is based upon two principal business segments, bd medical and bd life sciences, which are engaged in the development, manufacture, and sale of a broad range of medical supplies and devices. The strategic objectives focus on delivering sustainable growth and shareholder value while making appropriate investments for the future, including improving operating effectiveness and driving an efficient capital structure. The company continues to invest in research and development, geographic expansion, and new product promotions to drive further revenue and profit growth. In assessing outcomes of these strategies, management reviews financial data, including investment in research and development, return on invested capital, and cash flows. The acquisition of CareFusion has been significant, with its operating results included in the consolidated results, impacting revenue growth. The medical segment's revenue growth was driven by international sales of safety-engineered products and self-injection systems, while the life sciences segment saw growth from automated platforms and research instrument sales. The company is focused on improving operational efficiency and organizational effectiveness, which is essential for sustaining long-term growth. The financial position remains strong, with cash flows from operating activities totaling $2.559 billion. The company faces currency exposure from translating worldwide operations to the U.S. dollar, which impacts revenue growth. The evaluation of results on a foreign currency-neutral basis helps improve understanding of operating results. Research and development expenses reflect increased investment in new products and platforms, which are critical for maintaining competitive advantage. The integration of CareFusion has involved significant costs related to transaction, integration, and restructuring efforts, including impairments of capitalized internal-use software assets due to IT function transformation efforts. The ability to sustain long-term growth is dependent on expanding core business, developing innovative products, and improving operational efficiency. The company also faces challenges from competitive factors, including pricing pressures and the need for continuous technological innovation. Security breaches of information technology systems could impair business operations and compromise sensitive information.

The ongoing evaluation of market dynamics and external influences is crucial for maintaining agility and responsiveness in the healthcare sector.

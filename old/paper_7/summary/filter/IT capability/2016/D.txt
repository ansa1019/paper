The goals of this strategy are to provide EPS growth, a growing dividend, and to maintain a stable credit profile. Dominion expects 80% to 90% of earnings from its primary operating segments to come from regulated and long-term contracted businesses. The company anticipates that its operations provide a stable source of cash flow to contribute to planned levels of capital expenditures and maintain or grow the dividend on common shares. Additionally, dominion expects to focus on meeting new and developing environmental requirements, including making investments in utility-scale solar generation, particularly in Virginia. The company recognizes that changes in technology, particularly with respect to new, developing, or alternative sources of generation and smart grid technologies, are critical to its operational effectiveness and competitive positioning. Furthermore, Dominion's operations are subject to risks and uncertainties that may negatively impact the timing or amounts of operating cash flows. The company has identified the importance of mobilizing and deploying IT-based resources in combination with leveraging the value of other resources and capabilities. This mobilization is essential for transforming the firm into a competitive force and enhancing its operational efficiency. Dominion's IT capabilities encompass the coordination of its assets and internal processes, which are vital for supporting business needs and enhancing business strategies. The firm’s IT capabilities are also linked to its ability to provide data and information to users with appropriate levels of accuracy, timeliness, reliability, security, confidentiality, connectivity, and access, tailored to respond to changing business needs and directions. The company acknowledges that its IT governance and management skills play a significant role in resource allocation and investment decisions, which are critical for maintaining competitive advantage and market agility. Additionally, the firm is focused on the integration of technology into its operational processes, which is necessary for optimizing performance and achieving strategic objectives. The impact of operational hazards, including adverse developments with respect to pipeline and plant safety or integrity, equipment loss, malfunction or failure, operator error, and other catastrophic events, is also considered a challenge that could affect the firm’s performance. In summary, Dominion's approach to IT capability emphasizes the need for effective resource mobilization, strategic alignment with business objectives, and the integration of technology to enhance operational efficiency and competitive positioning in the market.

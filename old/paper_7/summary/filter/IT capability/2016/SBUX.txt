Our fiscal 2016 results reflected the strength of our global business model and our ability to make disciplined investments in our business and partners. We expect to continue investing in our partners and digital platforms, which provide enhanced wages and benefits and focus on mobile and loyalty programs. These investments are anticipated to increase by approximately $250 million versus an increase of approximately $160 million in fiscal 2016, further demonstrating the importance of and value creation from these efforts. Our management team continues to align our leadership with our evolving businesses, including the development of our global roastery and Starbucks ReserveÂ® branded stores. We plan to expand our footprint by opening new stores and enhancing the mix and types of stores in our portfolio, which will be coupled with continued customer attachment through our morning and lunch dayparts. We also expect consolidated revenue growth to be approximately 8% in fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016. Revenue growth is expected to be driven by comparable store sales in the mid-single digits and the opening of approximately 2,100 net new stores globally. Our investments in digital platforms are critical to our operational efficiency and strategic resource allocation, enhancing our ability to respond to market dynamics and consumer demands. The expansion of our store portfolio and the shift towards more licensed stores are part of our strategy to optimize our business processes and improve overall firm performance. Our capital expenditures for fiscal 2017 are expected to be approximately $1.6 billion, primarily for new stores and store renovations, as well as for other investments to support our ongoing growth initiatives. We believe that future cash flows generated from operations and existing cash and investments will be sufficient to finance capital requirements for our core businesses. Our strategic management practices include leveraging technology resources to enhance operational flexibility and improve decision-making speed. Investments in digital engagement and technology infrastructure are essential for maintaining competitive advantage and ensuring market responsiveness. We actively manage our cash and investments to internally fund operating needs, make acquisitions, and return cash to shareholders, which reflects our commitment to resource management and organizational effectiveness. The combination of these strategic initiatives and investments in technology capabilities supports our long-term growth agenda and enhances our ability to create business value through improved customer relationships and operational efficiencies. Our focus on digital transformation and IT deployment will enable us to adapt to changing business needs and directions, reinforcing our position as a competitive force in the market.

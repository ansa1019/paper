The company’s financial performance in 2016 included delivering diluted earnings per share of $3.63, reflecting the impact of operational efficiency and strategic resource allocation. AbbVie generated cash flows from operations of $7.0 billion, which were utilized to enhance its pipeline through licensing and collaboration activities, pay cash dividends, and repurchase shares in the open market. The company’s long-term success depends on its ability to continue to discover and develop innovative pharmaceutical products and acquire or collaborate on compounds currently in development by other biotechnology or pharmaceutical companies.

UnitedHealth Group leverages core competencies in advanced, enabling technology; health care data; information and intelligence; and clinical care management and coordination to help meet the demands of the health system. These competencies are strategically aligned within its two business platforms: health benefits operating under UnitedHealthcare and health services operating under Optum. The company recognizes that the health care market continues to change based on demographic shifts, new regulations, political forces, and both payer and patient expectations. Health plans and care providers are increasingly called upon to work together to close gaps in care and improve overall care quality, improve the health of populations, and reduce costs. The company is focused on leveraging data and analytics to provide necessary information to close gaps in care and improve overall health outcomes for patients. The delivery system and payment modernization trend is creating needs for health management services that can coordinate care around the primary care physician and for investments in new clinical and administrative information and management systems, which provide growth opportunities for the Optum business platform. The company continues to advocate for actuarially sound rates that are commensurate with medical cost trends, maintaining a prudent, market-sustainable posture for both new business and existing relationships. The commercial risk market remains highly competitive, and broad-based competition is expected to continue as the industry adapts to individual and employer needs amid reform changes. The company’s ability to effectively support business needs through IT capabilities has become key in transforming it into a competitive force. The integration of technology resources and management skills is essential for enhancing operational efficiency and supporting business strategies. The company’s IT capabilities represent the application of physical or intangible IT resources such as technology, knowledge, practices, relationships, and human resources to further organizational goals. As of December 31, 2016, the company served more than 15 million people through aligned contractual arrangements, including full-risk, shared-risk, and bundled episode-of-care payment approaches. The contracts with value-based elements total nearly $53 billion in annual spending, reflecting the importance of technology deployment in managing costs and improving care quality. The ongoing pressure on Medicare Advantage funding underscores the importance of effective medical management and improvements in administrative efficiency, which are supported by the company's IT governance and strategic resource allocation. The company’s financial condition and capital resources are managed in the context of its overall business strategy, with a focus on maintaining liquidity and financial flexibility to support its operational and investment needs. The ability to mobilize and deploy IT-based resources in combination with other capabilities is critical for achieving competitive advantage and enhancing firm performance in a rapidly evolving health care environment.

Our ability to acquire and retain branded customers is important to our business in the generation of revenues and we believe our un-carrier strategy, along with ongoing network improvements, has been successful in attracting and retaining customers as evidenced by continued branded customer growth and improved branded postpaid phone and branded prepaid customer churn. The introduction of our un-carrier strategy in 2013 aimed to eliminate customer pain points from the unnecessary complexity of the wireless communication industry. We have continued our efforts with the launch of additional initiatives of our un-carrier strategy, which include various service offerings designed to enhance customer experience and satisfaction. The growth in service revenues is primarily due to strong customer response to our un-carrier initiatives and the success of our MetroPCS brand, alongside continued growth in new markets. Our strategic investments to support our growing customer base include higher employee-related costs, commissions driven by an increase in branded customer additions, and promotional costs. We have also seen an increase in lease revenues resulting from the launch of our Jump! On Demand program, which has contributed to a decrease in losses on equipment. Our focus on operational efficiency and strategic resource allocation has enabled us to maintain a competitive advantage in the market. The successful execution of our business strategy has resulted in significant increases in adjusted EBITDA, driven by higher service revenues and gains on disposal of spectrum licenses. We utilize adjusted EBITDA as a benchmark to evaluate our operating performance in comparison to our competitors, as it reflects our ongoing operating performance and trends by excluding certain nonrecurring expenses. In 2016, we recorded a substantial increase in total revenues, primarily driven by growth in service and equipment revenues. The MVNO transaction shifted branded postpaid revenues to wholesale revenues, but did not materially impact total revenues. Our financial condition and results of operations are significantly influenced by our ability to effectively manage our technology resources and infrastructure, which are critical in supporting our business processes and enhancing customer relationships. We are committed to investing in our technology portfolio and infrastructure capability to ensure operational flexibility and responsiveness to market dynamics. Our management practices emphasize the importance of leveraging IT capabilities to support business needs and enhance performance outcomes. The integration of digital technologies into our operations has been a key factor in our ability to adapt to changing consumer demands and market conditions. We continuously assess our technology alignment and deployment strategies to optimize performance and drive value creation across our organization. The strategic management of our IT resources is essential in navigating the complexities of the telecommunications industry and achieving our organizational goals. Our ongoing focus on innovation and process optimization positions us to capitalize on emerging opportunities in the market while effectively managing risks associated with regulatory uncertainty and competitive pressures.

During 2016, the company faced opportunities and challenges, including rapid technological development, particularly with respect to computing, mobile connectivity, communications, and digitization in most of its served markets. The company is making significant investments, organically and through acquisitions, to address the rapid pace of technological change in its served markets and to globalize its manufacturing, research and development, and customer-facing resources in order to be responsive to the company's customers throughout the world and improve the efficiency of the company's operations. The company operates in a highly competitive business environment, and its long-term growth and profitability will depend on its ability to expand its business in high-growth geographies and market segments, identify, consummate, and integrate appropriate acquisitions, and develop innovative and differentiated new products and services with higher gross profit margins. The acquisition of Cepheid provides additional sales and earnings growth opportunities for the segment by expanding geographic and product line diversity, including new product and service offerings in the areas of molecular diagnostics. The company expects to realize significant synergies through the application of the Danaher Business System as Cepheid is integrated into the company. The company’s capital expenditures are made primarily for increasing capacity, replacing equipment, supporting new product development, and improving information technology systems. The increase in capital spending in 2016 is due to increased investments in machinery and equipment, including operating assets at newly acquired businesses such as Pall. The company’s ability to generate cash to fund its operating, investing, and financing activities is supported by substantial cash flows from operating activities, which increased due to higher net earnings and included higher noncash charges for depreciation, amortization, and stock compensation. The company’s investments in sales growth initiatives and the effectiveness of its sales force are critical to its operational efficiency and overall business performance. The company’s strategic resource allocation includes the use of available cash and internally generated funds to meet cash requirements, including acquisitions and capital expenditures. The company’s operations are affected by worldwide, regional, and industry-specific economic and political factors, and its individual businesses monitor key competitors and customers to gauge relative performance and future outlook. The company’s strategic management practices focus on leveraging IT capabilities to enhance business processes and improve operational flexibility. The integration of acquired businesses is expected to enhance the company's operational efficiency and support its long-term strategic goals. The company’s investments in technology resources and capabilities are aimed at improving information management and ensuring the reliability and accuracy of data provided to users. The company's approach to managing its technology portfolio emphasizes the importance of aligning IT capabilities with business strategies to drive performance gains and competitive advantage. The company recognizes the need for continuous improvement in its technology infrastructure to support evolving business needs and market dynamics.

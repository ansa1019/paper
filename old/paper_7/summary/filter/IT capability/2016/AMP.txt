Ameriprise Financial is a diversified financial services company with a history of providing financial solutions, and we offer a broad range of products and services designed to achieve the financial objectives of individual and institutional clients. The success of our strategies may be affected by various factors, including the business and regulatory environment, which remains subject to elevated uncertainty and change. Our operating segments are aligned with the financial solutions we offer to address our clients' needs, and revenues and net income are significantly affected by investment performance and the total value and composition of assets we manage and administer. Financial markets and macroeconomic conditions have had and will continue to have a significant impact on our operating and performance results. The depth and breadth of our individual client relationships are critical in determining these factors. Management uses certain non-GAAP measures to evaluate our financial performance, which facilitates a more meaningful trend analysis. The management and financial advice fees we earn relate primarily to fees from managing mutual funds and providing financial advice, and these fees are influenced by market dynamics and client asset values. Our investment performance is closely tied to the effectiveness of our IT capabilities, which have evolved to encompass the coordination of our assets and internal processes, as well as interfirm transactions and relationships. We focus on information management capability, which includes providing data and information to users with appropriate levels of accuracy, timeliness, reliability, security, confidentiality, connectivity, and access. The ability to mobilize and deploy IT-based resources in combination with leveraging the value of other resources and capabilities is essential in transforming our firm into a competitive force. Our IT capabilities represent the application of technology, knowledge, practices, management skills, and human resources to further organizational goals. The ongoing low interest rate environment has negatively impacted our operating earnings, and we have updated our market-related inputs and implemented model changes to enhance our valuation processes. Our review of life insurance and annuity valuation assumptions is an integral part of our operational strategy, reflecting our commitment to maintaining effective IT governance and resource management. We continue to monitor and optimize our processes to ensure operational efficiency and effectiveness, which are critical to achieving our strategic objectives. The establishment of reserves is an estimation process that utilizes various methods, assumptions, and data elements, and we regularly review these assumptions to ensure they align with our operational capabilities and market conditions. Our ability to respond to market dynamics and consumer demands is influenced by our IT infrastructure and the strategic alignment of our technology capabilities with our business strategies. The integration of technology into our operations supports our goals of enhancing performance, improving decision-making speed, and optimizing resource allocation. Overall, our IT capabilities play a vital role in enabling us to navigate the complexities of the financial services landscape and drive business transformation.

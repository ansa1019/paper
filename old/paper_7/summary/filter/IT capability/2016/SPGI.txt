We have repositioned S&P Global as a more focused company in the capital and commodity markets by exiting non-core assets and investing for growth in markets that have size and scale. Our operations consist of three reportable segments: ratings, market and commodities intelligence, and S&P Dow Jones indices. Market and commodities intelligence is a global provider of multi-asset-class data, research, and analytical capabilities, which integrate cross-asset analytics and desktop services and deliver their customers in the commodity and energy markets access to high-value information, data, analytic services, and pricing and quality benchmarks. The acquisition of SNL Financial LC, a global provider of news, data, and analytical tools, enhances our capabilities in delivering information through a suite of web, mobile, and direct data feed platforms that help clients make decisions, improve efficiency, and manage risk. Additionally, the acquisition of PIRA Energy Group and Rigdata strengthens our energy analytical capabilities. We strive to deliver on our strategic priorities in the following four categories: delivering strong financial performance and long-term value to our shareholders, engaging with the world around us, investing to meet customer needs in high-growth areas, and embracing operational excellence in all that we do. We are accelerating digital transformation and stimulating innovation, enhancing leadership and accountability. Our technology-related impairment charge of $24 million reflects the challenges we face in aligning our IT capabilities with business needs and operational efficiency. The successful completion of our growth and performance plan is aligned with our strategic resource allocation, focusing on enhancing our technology infrastructure and capabilities. The financial services industry is subject to the potential for increased regulation, which could impact our operational flexibility and market responsiveness. We continuously evaluate our technology portfolio to ensure that we are leveraging our IT resources effectively to support business innovation and transformation. Our investments in IT capabilities are designed to enhance our ability to provide timely, accurate, and reliable information to our clients, thereby creating business value and competitive advantage. The integration of recent acquisitions aims to expand our analytical offerings and improve our market agility. We recognize the importance of mobilizing and deploying IT-based resources in combination with leveraging the value of other resources and capabilities to achieve our organizational goals. Our focus on operational efficiency and process optimization is critical in responding to market dynamics and consumer demands. The ongoing development of our IT capabilities is essential for maintaining our competitive positioning and enhancing our overall firm performance. We are committed to ensuring that our technology management practices align with our strategic objectives, fostering an environment conducive to innovation and organizational learning.

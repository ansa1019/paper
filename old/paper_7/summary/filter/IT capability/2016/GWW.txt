Grainger plans to continue to make investments in its supply chain, ecommerce capabilities, information systems, sales force productivity tools, and inventory management services. These investments will support the company's revenue growth objectives of continuing to grow its share of business with large, complex customers, creating a unique value proposition to further penetrate the medium customer segment, and further leveraging its ecommerce capabilities to serve smaller customers. The company implemented the U.S. ERP system in February 2016, which negatively impacted sales as employees transitioned to operating with the new system. Grainger invested in technology infrastructure, including the ecommerce platform, sustaining capital investments in branches and distribution centers, and other technology infrastructure. In 2016, Grainger continued to invest in the North America distribution network, as well as the distribution network in other segments, and sales productivity initiatives. Grainger expects to fund 2017 capital spending primarily from operating cash, with projected spending including continued investments in the supply chain, ecommerce, and inventory management solutions. The company’s net sales in the U.S. business were positively correlated with business investment, business inventory, exports, and industrial production, indicating the importance of IT capabilities in supporting business needs and enhancing operational efficiency. Grainger's ecommerce sales for the U.S. business were $3,275 million in 2015, representing a 41% increase of total sales, driven by an increase in sales via EDI and electronic purchasing platforms. If the company included KeepStock®, the electronic inventory management offering, total ecommerce and KeepStock® sales would represent 51% of total sales. The company’s ability to provide data and information to users with appropriate levels of accuracy, timeliness, reliability, security, confidentiality, connectivity, and access is crucial in responding to changing business needs and directions. Grainger's operational flexibility and strategic resource allocation are essential for leveraging IT capabilities to transform the firm into a competitive force. The integration of technology capabilities into business processes is vital for enhancing organizational effectiveness and achieving performance gains. Grainger's investments in IT resources and capabilities are aligned with its strategic objectives to optimize business processes and improve customer relationships. The company’s focus on continuous improvement initiatives aims to reduce its cost base while ensuring that it continues to deliver an effortless customer experience. The implementation of new technologies and business strategies is critical for maintaining competitive advantage and responding to market dynamics. Grainger’s management recognizes the significance of mobilizing and deploying IT-based resources in combination with other organizational capabilities to achieve business value and enhance firm performance. The company's commitment to investing in technology infrastructure and information systems reflects its understanding of the role of IT capability in driving operational efficiency and supporting strategic management practices.

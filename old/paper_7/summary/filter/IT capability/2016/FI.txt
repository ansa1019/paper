We are a leading global provider of financial services technology, offering account processing systems, electronic payments processing products and services, internet and mobile banking systems, and related services. Our operations are comprised of the payments segment and the financial institution services segment, which provide essential services necessary for our clients to operate their businesses. We continue to implement strategic initiatives to provide integrated technology and services solutions that enable best-in-class results for our clients, including enhancing client relationships with a focus on digital and payment solutions. The financial industry is rapidly evolving, with institutions regularly introducing new payment, deposit, lending, investment, and risk management products. This evolution has increased the data and transaction processing needs of financial institutions, leading them to invest in technology to manage information, maintain regulatory compliance, and offer innovative services. We expect financial institutions to continue transitioning from in-house technology to outsourced solutions to remain competitive amidst these changes. Our strategic initiatives emphasize operational effectiveness and innovation, which are critical in a challenging operating environment characterized by regulatory scrutiny and cybersecurity concerns. We believe that economies of scale in developing and maintaining the infrastructure, technology, products, services, and networks necessary to be competitive are essential. The integration of our products and services creates a compelling value proposition for our clients, enhancing their operational efficiency and ability to respond to market dynamics. Our revenue is primarily generated from recurring account- and transaction-based fees, reflecting our focus on long-term client relationships and the non-discretionary nature of our services. The market for our products continues to grow as financial institutions seek solutions that help them win and retain customers, generate revenue, and comply with regulations. Our sizable and diverse client base positions us well to capitalize on these trends. We also recognize that the consolidation of financial institutions can impact our financial results, particularly through early contract termination fees. However, our diversified revenue stream mitigates the effects of such consolidation. We continually evaluate our accounting policies and estimates, which require judgment and assumptions that affect our financial condition. Our strategic acquisitions enhance our technology capabilities and expand our service offerings, further supporting our clients' needs. The operational effectiveness initiatives we have implemented have improved our overall cost structure and contributed to our revenue growth. Our focus on innovation and integration enables us to deliver differentiated value for our clients, positioning us as a competitive force in the financial services technology sector.

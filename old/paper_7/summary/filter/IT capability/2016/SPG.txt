We focus on high-quality real estate across the retail real estate spectrum. We seek growth in earnings, funds from operations, or FFO, and cash flows by enhancing the profitability and operation of our properties and investments. Our international strategy includes partnering with established real estate companies and financing international investments with local currency to minimize foreign exchange risk. We routinely review and evaluate acquisition opportunities based on their ability to enhance our portfolio. We employ a three-fold capital strategy: provide the capital necessary to fund growth, maintain sufficient flexibility to access capital in many forms, both public and private, and manage our overall financial structure in a fashion that preserves our investment grade credit ratings. We consider FFO, net operating income, or NOI, and comparable property NOI to be key measures of operating performance that are not specifically defined by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, or GAAP. We use these measures internally to evaluate the operating performance of our portfolio and provide a basis for comparison with other real estate companies. Our financing strategy relies primarily on long-term fixed-rate debt. We derive most of our liquidity from positive net cash flow from operations and distributions of capital from unconsolidated entities. We expect to generate positive cash flow from operations in 2017, and we consider these projected cash flows in our sources and uses of cash. Our business model and Simon's status as a REIT require us to regularly access the debt markets to raise funds for acquisition, development, and redevelopment activity, and to refinance maturing debt. We also expect to be able to generate or obtain capital for nonrecurring capital expenditures, such as acquisitions, major building redevelopments and expansions, as well as for scheduled principal maturities on outstanding indebtedness, from excess cash generated from operating performance and working capital reserves, borrowings on our credit facilities and commercial paper program, additional secured or unsecured debt financing, or additional equity raised in the public or private markets. We have a significant focus on enhancing the profitability and operational efficiency of our properties through strategic resource allocation and investment decisions. Our operational capital expenditures and investments in unconsolidated entities are essential for maintaining and improving our portfolio's performance. We continuously assess our operational capabilities and market responsiveness to ensure that we align with evolving business needs and external influences. Our ability to leverage technology resources and management skills plays a critical role in our strategic decisions, enabling us to optimize our business processes and enhance our competitive positioning. We are committed to maintaining our status as a REIT, which requires careful monitoring of our business and transactions that may potentially impact our compliance with applicable regulations. Our strategic management practices are designed to adapt to market dynamics and ensure that we effectively mobilize and deploy our resources to achieve our organizational goals. We recognize the importance of information management and the need for reliable data to support our decision-making processes, which is integral to our operational effectiveness and overall firm performance.

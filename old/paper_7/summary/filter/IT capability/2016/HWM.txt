Arconic's management has intensified its focus on capital efficiency, with an owner's mindset, enabling the company to improve its operating performance through cost reductions, margin enhancement, and profitable revenue generation. Management's review of 2016 indicates that net productivity improvements across all operations exceeded cost headwinds and an unfavorable product mix, contributing to higher after-tax operating income in each segment. The company aims to achieve stable to improved operating margins through net productivity savings in 2017, including from procurement and overhead programs, while continuing to focus on improving operating performance. Arconic's operations consist of three worldwide reportable segments: global rolled products, engineered products and solutions, and transportation and construction solutions, with segment performance evaluated based on after-tax operating income. The engineered products and solutions segment, which includes products used primarily in aerospace, commercial transportation, and power generation, experienced a 7% improvement in third-party sales in 2016 compared to 2015, driven by higher demand from the aerospace end market and acquisitions. The transportation and construction solutions segment, producing products for nonresidential building and construction and commercial transportation, is expected to see continued growth driven by demand for innovative products, although it faced a decrease in sales in 2016 compared to 2015 primarily due to lower demand from the North American commercial transportation end market. The company has established specific goals for 2017, including improving adjusted EBITDA margin and generating cash from operations that exceeds capital expenditures. Arconic's strategic decisions are influenced by various external factors, including governmental policies, laws, and regulations, which affect the results of operations in different countries. The focus on liquidity and cash flows is paramount, with management committed to maintaining a solid financial position while navigating market dynamics and competitive pressures. The company recognizes the importance of mobilizing and deploying IT-based resources in combination with leveraging the value of other resources and capabilities, which is critical in transforming Arconic into a competitive force. The management's approach to cash management emphasizes operational flexibility and strategic resource allocation to enhance business value and performance outcomes. The integration of technology capabilities is essential for Arconic to respond effectively to market changes and consumer demands, ensuring that the organization remains agile and capable of adapting to evolving business environments. The emphasis on information management capability underlines the necessity of providing accurate, timely, and reliable data to support decision-making processes and enhance overall organizational effectiveness.

We are a diversified technology company that designs and develops software and engineered products for various niche end markets, emphasizing continuous improvement in operating performance and acquiring high value-added software and services capable of achieving growth and maintaining high margins. We compete in many niche markets and believe we are the market leader or a competitive alternative in most of these markets. Our management discusses significant judgments regarding accounting estimates with the audit committee, which reviews all financial disclosures in our annual filings. The preparation of financial statements requires estimates and assumptions that can affect reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses. Our effective income tax rate was impacted by a non-recurring item related to a UK tax rate change. We account for goodwill in a purchase business combination as the excess purchase price over the fair value of net identifiable assets acquired and test it for impairment annually. The qualitative assessment considers macroeconomic conditions, industry trends, financial performance, and specific future outlooks for reporting units. We also assess trade names with indefinite useful lives for impairment, using the relief-from-royalty method to determine fair value. The assumptions that affect fair value calculations include projected revenue growth rates and discount rates. Our most significant identifiable intangible assets recognized from acquisitions are customer relationships, evaluated using the excess earnings method based on estimated future cash flows. We evaluate for impairment when indicators are present, comparing estimated future cash flows to the asset's carrying amount. Our capital expenditures and capitalized software expenditures have been consistent, and we expect them to be between 1.0% and 1.5% of annual net revenues. Our order backlog increased significantly, driven primarily by organic growth. We maintain an active acquisition program, with future acquisitions dependent on various factors, including market conditions. Our businesses are expected to generate positive cash flows, allowing for the reduction of outstanding debt. The integration of recently acquired reporting units typically decreases the risk of impairment over time. We have established a three-year unsecured credit facility, which allows for additional term loans or revolving credit commitments. We were in compliance with all debt covenants related to our credit facility throughout the years ended December 31, 2021, and 2020. The assessment of fair value for impairment purposes requires significant judgments, and changes in estimates or assumptions could produce different results. Our focus on asset-light business models is demonstrated by our consistent negative net working capital. The growth in cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to higher net income and the non-recurrence of cash taxes paid on the disposal of Gatan. We anticipate that our businesses will generate positive cash flows from operating activities, which will permit the reduction of outstanding debt in accordance with the repayment schedule.

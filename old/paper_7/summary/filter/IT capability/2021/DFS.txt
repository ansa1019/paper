The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements. Discover Financial Services ("DFS") is a digital banking and payment services company that provides digital banking products and services and payment services through its subsidiaries. Our business activities are funded primarily through consumer deposits, securitization of loan receivables, and the issuance of unsecured debt. The COVID-19 pandemic has had a widespread impact on the economy, leading to changes in consumer payment behaviors and an increased reliance on digital technologies. We have managed the risk of COVID-19 by allowing non-essential employees to work from home, which has not significantly impacted our operations or service levels. However, this shift has increased our dependence on third-party service providers. As the U.S. economy recovers, we expect to continue making investments for profitable long-term growth, which includes enhancing our IT capabilities to support business strategies and work processes. Our digital banking segment reported significant income growth, driven by lower funding costs and increased sales volume, reflecting our operational efficiency and strategic resource allocation. The provision for credit losses decreased, primarily due to improvements in the macroeconomic forecast and stable credit performance, indicating effective management of our IT resources in assessing credit risks. We continue to evaluate our technology infrastructure and capabilities to ensure alignment with business needs and market demands. The regulatory environment, including the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, has necessitated adjustments in our operational strategies and IT governance. We have implemented measures to enhance data security and privacy, responding to evolving regulatory standards. Our liquidity management framework ensures we maintain sufficient liquidity to support business operations and respond to market changes. The integration of digital banking and payment services has positioned us to leverage technology for competitive advantage, enhancing customer relationships and operational flexibility. Our focus on digital transformation and IT deployment reflects our commitment to improving organizational capabilities and performance outcomes. We recognize the importance of mobilizing IT-based resources in conjunction with other organizational resources to achieve strategic objectives and drive business innovation. The ongoing assessment of our IT capabilities and investment in technology resources will be critical as we navigate market dynamics and consumer demands in a post-pandemic environment.

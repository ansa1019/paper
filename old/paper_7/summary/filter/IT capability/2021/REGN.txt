Our ability to generate profits and to generate positive cash flow from operations over the next several years depends significantly on the continued success in commercializing our products, which requires effective coordination of our assets and internal processes. We expect to continue to incur substantial expenses related to our research and development activities, which necessitate the mobilization and deployment of IT-based resources in combination with other capabilities. The scope and progress of our research and development efforts are critical, as they influence our operational flexibility and the effectiveness of our IT governance. The financial results may fluctuate from quarter to quarter and will depend on various factors, including the timing of certain expenses and the continuation of our collaborations, which underscores the importance of leveraging technology resources to enhance our business strategies and work processes. We recognize that uncertainties associated with drug development, including changes in the competitive landscape affecting our product candidates, require agile decision-making and strategic resource allocation. Our collaboration agreements necessitate the delivery of various rights and services across the entire lifecycle of a product, which emphasizes the need for robust IT capabilities to support these processes. The preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts, highlighting the importance of information reliability and accuracy in our internal processes. We periodically reassess our estimates based on new information, which reflects our commitment to maintaining operational efficiency and strategic alignment with our organizational goals. Additionally, our financial condition is influenced by our ability to manage and optimize our resources, including our investments in technology infrastructure and digital capabilities. The ongoing expansion of our manufacturing facilities and research capabilities is expected to require significant capital expenditures, which will be informed by our strategic decisions regarding resource deployment and operational investments. Our financial covenants and compliance with regulatory requirements further illustrate the interconnectedness of our operational strategies and IT capabilities. We anticipate that our existing capital resources and collaboration agreements will enable us to meet our anticipated operating needs, but we must remain vigilant in adapting to market dynamics and external influences that could impact our business performance. The integration of IT systems and the enhancement of our organizational capabilities are essential for achieving our long-term objectives and maintaining a competitive advantage in the biotechnology sector.

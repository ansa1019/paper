The following discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations of Nasdaq should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included in this Form 10-K. We manage, operate, and provide our products and services in four business segments: market technology, investment intelligence, corporate platforms, and market services. The acquisition of Verafin in February 2021 has contributed to our anti-financial crime technology revenues, which increased primarily due to continued growth in surveillance solutions. Our marketplace infrastructure technology revenues decreased primarily due to lower professional services revenues reflecting capacity constraints imposed by pandemic-related logistical challenges. We have pursued various strategic initiatives and completed acquisitions and divestitures in recent years, which have resulted in expenses that would not have otherwise been incurred. We have initiated the transition of certain technology platforms to advance our strategic opportunities as a technology and analytics provider. Our investment choices are influenced by our capital deployment strategy, balancing acquisitions, internal investments, debt repayments, and shareholder return activity. We have implemented policies and procedures to measure, manage, monitor, and report risk exposures, which are reviewed regularly by management and the board of directors. Our technology management practices are aimed at ensuring operational efficiency and enhancing our capabilities to support business needs. The increase in compensation and benefits expense in 2021 was primarily driven by higher performance-linked compensation expense and our continued investment to drive growth. We recognize revenues from long-term contracts with customers to develop customized technology solutions, license software, and provide support and other services, which involves multiple performance obligations. The management of our technology infrastructure is critical to our operational flexibility and market responsiveness. We evaluate our equity method investments for other-than-temporary declines in value by considering various factors, including the earnings capacity of the investment and the fair value of the investment compared to its carrying amount. Our strategic resource allocation decisions are influenced by changes in regulatory and working capital requirements. We are exposed to credit risk from third parties, including customers and counterparties, and we limit our exposure by evaluating the counterparties with which we make investments and execute agreements. The performance metrics we utilize include annualized revenue derived from subscription contracts, which is a key performance indicator to assess the health and trajectory of our recurring business. We have also recorded an impairment charge related to a finite-lived intangible asset for customer relationships associated with the wind down of a previous acquisition. Our organizational capabilities are enhanced through the integration of technology resources and management skills, which are essential for achieving our strategic objectives. The ongoing evaluation of our technology portfolio and the effectiveness of our IT systems are crucial for maintaining competitive advantage and ensuring alignment with our business strategy.

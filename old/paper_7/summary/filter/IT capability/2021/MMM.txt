3M is continuing the ongoing deployment of an enterprise resource planning (ERP) system on a worldwide basis, with these investments impacting cost of sales, SG&A, and R&D. The company believes that discussion of results adjusted for special items is meaningful to investors as it provides a useful analysis of ongoing underlying operating trends. 3M's operating income margins decreased 1.5 percentage points year-on-year for the year ending December 31, 2021, with various COVID-19 implications contributing in part to these results. The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on 3M's consolidated results of operations was primarily driven by factors related to changes in demand for products and disruption in global supply chains. 3M continued prioritization of investments in growth and sustainability, which includes R&D aimed at disruptive innovation programs with the potential to create entirely new markets and disrupt existing markets. The company is impacted by the global pandemic and related effects associated with COVID-19, which have increased the demand for 3M products in some areas while decreasing demand in others. 3M's total sales increased 9.9% for the full year 2021 when compared to 2020, reflecting broad-based organic growth across business segments and all geographies despite global supply challenges. The company experienced strong sales in personal safety and other areas such as home improvement, general cleaning, semiconductor, data center, and biopharma filtration, while also facing weaknesses in several end markets. The ongoing challenges related to COVID-19 have magnified raw materials and logistics costs, further impacting operational efficiency. 3M's strategic resource allocation includes investments in technology capabilities and management skills to enhance organizational effectiveness and support business needs. The firm’s IT capabilities represent the application of physical or intangible IT resources such as technology, knowledge, practices, relationships, and human resources to further organizational goals. The company’s focus on information management capability underscores the importance of mobilizing and deploying IT-based resources in combination with leveraging the value of other resources and capabilities. 3M's management discussion emphasizes the need for operational flexibility and strategic alignment to respond to market dynamics and competitive actions. The firm aims to optimize its processes and enhance performance metrics through the integration of technology infrastructure and digital transformation initiatives. 3M's commitment to innovation partnerships and strategic management practices is evident in its ongoing efforts to enhance its IT effectiveness and operational capabilities. The company’s ability to provide data and information to users with appropriate levels of accuracy, timeliness, reliability, security, and access is critical in navigating the evolving business environment and addressing consumer demands.

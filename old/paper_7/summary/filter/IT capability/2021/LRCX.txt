Throughout the 2021 fiscal year, we experienced an increase in wafer fabrication equipment spending by semiconductor manufacturers, driven by robust secular demand for semiconductors in various markets including high-performance computing, personal computers, and 5G networks. Our core technical competency is integrating hardware, process, materials, software, and process control, enabling results on the wafer. We believe we are in a strong position with our leadership and competency in deposition, etch, and clean to facilitate significant innovations in semiconductor device manufacturing. Our customer support business group focuses on delivering solutions that meet our customers' technical requirements and productivity needs during the equipment lifecycle. We aim to increase our strategic relevance with our customers by contributing more to their continued success. Our focus on research and development includes several ongoing programs related to sustaining engineering, product and process development, and concept and feasibility, which create opportunities for sustainable differentiation. We effectively leverage cycles of learning from our broad installed base and maintain a collaborative focus with ecosystem partners. The increase in operating expenses during fiscal year 2021 was driven by higher employee-related costs due to increased headcount and outsourcing services, reflecting our commitment to enhancing operational capabilities. We continued to make significant R&D investments focused on leading-edge deposition, etch, clean, and other semiconductor manufacturing processes, which are critical for maintaining competitive advantage in a rapidly evolving market. The anticipated cash flows from operations, combined with our current levels of cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments, are expected to support our anticipated levels of operations, investments, and capital expenditures. However, uncertainty in the global economy and the semiconductor industry could impact customer demand for our products and our ability to manage commercial relationships. We recognize the importance of mobilizing and deploying IT-based resources in combination with leveraging the value of other resources and capabilities to support business strategies. Our IT capabilities, broadly defined, represent the application of physical or intangible IT resources such as technology, knowledge, practices, and management skills to further organizational goals. The ongoing challenges in the semiconductor industry, including the need for increasingly powerful and cost-efficient semiconductors, underscore the necessity of effective IT governance and resource allocation. Our strategic resource allocation and investment decisions are designed to enhance our operational efficiency and market responsiveness, ensuring that we remain competitive in a dynamic business environment. We are committed to continuous improvement in our processes and capabilities, which are essential for achieving performance excellence and sustaining growth in the semiconductor market.

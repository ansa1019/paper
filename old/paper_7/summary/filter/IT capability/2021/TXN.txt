Technology is the foundation of our company, and we make our investments with an eye towards long-term strengthening and leveraging of competitive advantages. Our strategy to maximize free cash flow per share growth includes discipline in allocating capital to the best opportunities, which spans how we select R&D projects, develop new capabilities, and invest in new manufacturing capacity. Our focus on analog and embedded processing allows us to generate strong cash flow from operations, underscoring the strength of our business model. We believe that our business model, combined with our competitive advantages, sets us apart from our peers and will continue to do so. We remain cautious about how the economy might behave for the next few years and continue to monitor potential impacts on our operations. Our strategic focus is on analog and embedded processing products sold into six end markets, with additional emphasis on designing and selling products into the industrial and automotive markets, which we believe represent the best growth opportunities. Our gross margin reflects the quality of our product portfolio and the efficiency of our manufacturing strategy. We expect our capital expenditures to be higher than historical levels as we continue to invest to strengthen our competitive advantage in manufacturing and technology as part of our long-term capacity planning. We believe we have the necessary financial resources and operating plans to fund our working capital needs, capital expenditures, dividend and debt-related payments, and other business requirements for at least the next 12 months. Our results indicate that we are effectively managing our resources to enhance operational efficiency and maintain a strong market position. We recognize potential liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues based on estimates of the ultimate resolution of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes will be due. Our judgment regarding future recoverability of our deferred tax assets may change due to various factors, including changes in U.S. or international tax laws and changes in market conditions. We consider our accounting policies to be important for portraying our financial condition and that require a higher degree of judgment. We strive for more output for every dollar spent, which reflects our commitment to operational efficiency and resource management. Our approach to capital allocation and investment decisions is designed to enhance our competitive positioning and ensure that we are well-prepared to respond to market dynamics. The combination of our strategic management practices and our focus on technology capabilities enables us to maintain a competitive advantage in the semiconductor industry. We believe that our investments in technology infrastructure and our ability to adapt to changing market conditions will continue to drive our performance and support our long-term business objectives.

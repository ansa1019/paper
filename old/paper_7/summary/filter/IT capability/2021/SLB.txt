Throughout 2021, Schlumberger continued to strengthen its core portfolio, enhanced its sustainability leadership, successfully advanced its digital journey, and expanded its new energy portfolio. The sequential revenue increase was led by growth in Europe/CIS/Africa largely due to strong offshore activity in Africa, complemented by project startups and activity gains in the Middle East & Asia and sustained activity growth in Latin America. Digital & Integration fourth-quarter revenue increased 10% sequentially, propelled by accelerated digital sales internationally, particularly in Europe/CIS/Africa and Middle East & Asia, and increased exploration data licensing sales in North America offshore and the Permian. Financial performance in 2021 was driven by global oil and gas activity growth in the second half of the year as investment spending experienced double-digit growth year-on-year. Schlumberger's revenue in the second half of 2021 grew 12% compared to the same period of 2020, and increased 18% when adjusted for the effects of the divestitures. Digital & Integration full-year 2021 revenue increased 7% year-on-year, primarily driven by robust APS project revenue from higher production and improved oil prices. The growth in 2021 was driven by strong global oil and gas activity in the second half of the year, and the company is well prepared to fully seize this growth ahead. Schlumberger expects this to result in a material step up in industry capital spending with double-digit growth in both the international and North American markets. The company's focus on expanding margins, minimizing earnings volatility, and focusing on less capital-intensive businesses reflects a strategic resource allocation approach that leverages IT capabilities to enhance operational efficiency and support business needs. The digital sales growth, particularly in the digital & integration segment, indicates a significant shift towards technology functionalities that enhance the firm's competitive positioning and market responsiveness.

The digital journey and enhanced technology portfolio align with the new industry imperatives, demonstrating the firm's commitment to innovation and operational flexibility. The integration of digital technologies into the business model not only supports current operational processes but also positions the firm to respond effectively to market dynamics and consumer demands, thereby enhancing overall firm performance and value creation. The strategic alignment of technology and business processes facilitates improved decision-making speed and information reliability, essential for navigating the complexities of the oil and gas industry. Schlumberger's ongoing investments in digital infrastructure and technology management are indicative of a robust IT governance framework that supports organizational transformation and agility in a rapidly evolving business environment.

The pandemic caused by the novel strain of the coronavirus (COVID-19) has impacted our workforce and operations, as well as those of our customers and vendors, leading to modifications in our business practices, including changes in employee work locations and restrictions on travel. We believe that a continued commitment to research and development is essential to maintain product leadership with our existing products and to provide innovative new product offerings, which are critical to our future growth. The acquisition of Maxim Integrated Products, Inc. has significantly contributed to our revenue increase and operational capabilities, enhancing our ability to respond to market demands and integrate innovative technologies. We expect capital expenditures for fiscal 2023 to be between 6% and 8% of revenue, which is above our historical levels primarily due to our plans to continue to expand internal manufacturing capacity. Our cash management practices involve reviewing available funds held by our foreign subsidiaries and the cost-effectiveness of accessing those funds in the United States, which is essential for maintaining liquidity and supporting operational flexibility. We recognize revenue upon transfer of control of promised products or services to customers, which reflects our expectations about the consideration we will be entitled to receive, and we employ various methodologies to determine the net realizable value of inventory, which is impacted by our need to support forecasted sales demand and variations in actual demand. Our strategic resource allocation includes investments in technology and infrastructure to enhance operational efficiency and support business innovation. The integration of acquired entities is aimed at leveraging synergies and improving our overall capabilities, which is crucial for maintaining a competitive advantage in the semiconductor industry. We continuously evaluate our performance metrics to ensure alignment with our organizational goals and to adapt to changing market dynamics. The effective management of our technology resources and capabilities is vital for optimizing our processes and enhancing our business performance. We are committed to leveraging our IT capabilities to support and enhance our business strategies, ensuring that we can effectively mobilize and deploy IT-based resources in combination with other organizational resources. The ability to provide timely and reliable information to users is a key aspect of our information management capability, which underpins our operational effectiveness and decision-making processes. Our ongoing investments in digital transformation and IT deployment are designed to enhance our connectivity and responsiveness to market changes, thereby driving value creation and improving our competitive positioning.

In December 2021, we acquired Purolite for total consideration of $3.7 billion in cash, net of cash acquired. Purolite is a leading and fast-growing global provider of high-end ion exchange resins for the separation and purification of solutions for pharmaceutical and industrial applications. The acquisition of Purolite represents a strategic investment aimed at enhancing our capabilities in the life sciences sector, which is critical for our business transformation and competitive positioning. Our team generated double-digit sales growth in the institutional & specialty, industrial, and other segments while healthcare & life sciences segment sales were stable. The reported operating income remained stable at $1.6 billion in 2022, compared to $1.6 billion in 2021, reflecting the effective deployment of our resources and management capabilities in response to market dynamics. We continue to generate strong cash flow from operations, allowing us to fund our ongoing operations, investments in our business, acquisitions, debt repayments, and return cash to our shareholders through share repurchases and dividend payments. Our strong balance sheet has allowed us continued access to capital at attractive rates, which supports our strategic resource allocation and investment decisions. We have adopted various accounting policies to prepare the consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP, requiring us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Our critical accounting estimates include revenue recognition, which is measured as the amount of consideration expected to be received in exchange for transferring goods or providing services. We recognize revenue from product and sold equipment when obligations under the terms of a contract with the customer are satisfied, which generally occurs with the transfer of the product or delivery of the equipment. Our restructuring activities, particularly the Europe program, target significant annualized pre-tax savings, enhancing our operational efficiency and aligning with our strategic management practices. The institutional advancement program is intended to enhance our institutional sales and service structure, allowing the sales team to capture share and penetration while maximizing service effectiveness by leveraging our ongoing investments in digital technology. We have recorded restructuring charges related to these initiatives, which are expected to result in substantial cost savings. Our acquisitions and divestitures are discussed further, highlighting the strategic importance of these actions in enhancing our operational capabilities and market responsiveness. The impact of acquisitions and divestitures is reflected in our financial performance metrics, which are crucial for assessing our organizational effectiveness and strategic alignment. We remain committed to maintaining strong credit ratings, supported by our current credit ratings from major agencies, which facilitate our access to capital and support our long-term growth strategy. Our liquidity and capital resources are carefully managed to ensure we can meet our cash requirements for ongoing operations and strategic investments, including potential business acquisitions.

Our management's discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements about business outlook, which are based on management's expectations and assumptions. We focus on information management capabilityâ€”that is, the ability to provide data and information to users with the appropriate levels of accuracy, timeliness, reliability, security, confidentiality, connectivity, and access, and the ability to tailor these in response to changing business needs and directions. Our ability to complete projects and recover the carrying value of assets could be impacted by future events. We have built a reputation for our innovative culture, operational excellence, and commitment to safety and the environment, which are critical in transforming a firm into a competitive force. Our passionate, talented, and committed employees are driven by our higher purpose to create innovative solutions that benefit the environment, enhance sustainability, and address the challenges facing customers, communities, and the world. Our gases, equipment, and applications expertise enable our customers to improve their sustainability performance by increasing productivity, producing better quality products, reducing energy use, and lowering emissions. We also develop, engineer, build, own, and operate some of the world's largest industrial gas and carbon-capture projects, supplying clean hydrogen that will support global transportation, industrial markets, and the broader energy transition away from fossil fuels. Our on-site business model, which has contractual protection from energy cost fluctuations, continues to provide stable cash flow. We expect several new projects to contribute to our results, including the second phase of the jigpc's gasification and power project. Sustainability is our growth strategy, and we have the financial capacity to support our zero- and low-carbon hydrogen projects. We believe there will be additional opportunities for clean hydrogen and carbon capture technologies, further supported by the U.S. Inflation Reduction Act of 2022. Our capital expenditures for fiscal year 2022 totaled $4,650.0 million, primarily driven by our initial investment in the jigpc joint venture. We expect capital expenditures for fiscal year 2023 to be approximately $5 to $5.5 billion, and we anticipate these expenditures to be funded principally with our current cash balance, cash generated from continuing operations, and financing activities as needed. Our strategic resource allocation focuses on investments in large industrial gas projects driven by demand for more energy, cleaner energy, and emerging market growth. We continue to evaluate the impact of regulatory contexts and market dynamics on our business directions and investment choices. Our operational flexibility allows us to adapt to market responses and external influences, ensuring that we maintain a competitive advantage. The performance metrics we utilize reflect our commitment to operational efficiency and organizational effectiveness, which are essential for achieving our strategic goals and enhancing our firm capabilities.

BD's management team aligns our operating model and investments with key strategic pillars through continuous focus on improving our ability to serve customers and enhance customer experiences through the digitalization of internal processes and go-to-market approaches. We continue to invest in research and development, strategic tuck-in acquisitions, geographic expansion, and new product programs to drive further revenue and profit growth. Our ability to sustain long-term growth will depend on our ability to expand our core business, develop innovative new products, and continue to improve operating efficiency and organizational effectiveness. We are primarily focused on certain countries whose healthcare systems are expanding, and we continue to pursue growth opportunities in emerging markets. The pandemic has escalated challenges that existed for global healthcare systems prior to the pandemic, including budget constraints and staffing shortages, which may affect the prioritization of healthcare services and impact the demand for certain products. We are mitigating inflationary pressures through strategic procurement initiatives and continuous improvement programs in our manufacturing and distribution facilities. Our financial position remains strong, with cash flows from continuing operating activities totaling $2.471 billion in 2022. We evaluate our results of operations on both a reported and a foreign currency-neutral basis, which helps improve investors' ability to understand our operating results and evaluate our performance. Our investments in capital expenditures are focused on projects that enhance our cost structure and manufacturing capabilities, as well as support our BD 2025 strategy for growth and simplification. We believe that our available cash and cash equivalents, our ability to generate operating cash flow, and access to borrowings from our financing facilities provide us with sufficient liquidity to satisfy our foreseeable operating needs. We have been enhancing our technology management and digital infrastructure to support operational flexibility and improve our organizational capabilities. Our strategic investments are aimed at advancing our quality culture and core quality management system to ensure we are a best-in-class, proactive quality-driven organization. We face challenges related to the availability of skilled labor, global energy sources, raw materials, and electronic components, which have increased lead times for some of our product offerings. The digital transformation initiatives we are undertaking are designed to enhance our operational efficiency and support our strategic resource allocation. We are also focused on leveraging our IT capabilities to improve information management and enhance our competitive positioning in the market. The integration of technology into our business processes is critical for driving innovation and achieving performance gains. Our commitment to research and development reflects our strategy to invest in new products and platforms, which is essential for maintaining our market agility and responsiveness to consumer demands. The ongoing assessment of our organizational effectiveness and the alignment of our business strategy with market dynamics will be crucial for our future success.

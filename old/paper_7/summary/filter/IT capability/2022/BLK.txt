BlackRock continues to invest in technology services offerings, which enhance the ability to manage portfolios and risk, effectively serve clients and operate efficiently. Anticipated industry consolidation and regulatory requirements should continue to drive demand for holistic and flexible technology solutions. BlackRock leverages its world-class risk management, analytics and technology capabilities, including the Aladdin platform, on behalf of clients. Clients increasingly want to tailor how they use Aladdin to meet their specific needs, and BlackRock is providing them with choice and flexibility. BlackRock is creating connectivity with ecosystem providers and third-party technology solutions, which include asset servicers, cloud providers, digital asset platforms, trading systems and others, who can work with clients in their Aladdin environments to provide a more customized and seamless end-to-end experience. BlackRock is also investing to scale Aladdin for its next leg of growth through the substantially complete migration of Aladdin from BlackRock-hosted data centers to the cloud. This is expected to bring enhanced capabilities to BlackRock and its Aladdin clients, accelerating innovation and supporting greater computing scale and flexibility for clients. Through this migration as well as BlackRock's strategic partnership with Snowflake, an industry-leader in cloud-enabled data technology, the company is building Aladdin Data Cloud, a next-generation solution that brings Aladdin and non-Aladdin data together, so clients can nimbly access and use data across their organization unlocking their full potential for collaboration, creativity, and innovation. BlackRock's long-term strategy remains to keep alpha at the heart of BlackRock; accelerate growth in ETFs, illiquid alternatives, and technology; deliver whole portfolio solutions and become the global leader in sustainable investing. BlackRock's diversified platform, in terms of style, product, client and geography, enables it to generate more stable cash flows through market cycles, positioning BlackRock to invest for the long-term by striking an appropriate balance between investing for future growth and prudent discretionary expense management. BlackRock's strategy continues to be guided by the company's clients' needs and focus on the long-term, which the company believes better enables it to deliver durable returns for shareholders and create value for all of its stakeholders. The diversity of BlackRock's platform facilitates the generation of organic growth in various market environments, and as client preferences evolve. As the asset management landscape shifts globally from individual product selection to a whole-portfolio approach, BlackRock's strategy is focused on creating outcome-oriented client solutions for both retail investors and institutions. This includes having a diverse platform of alpha-seeking active, index and alternative products, as well as enhanced distribution and portfolio construction technology offerings. Digital wealth tools are an important component of BlackRock's retail strategy, as BlackRock scales and customizes model portfolios, extends Aladdin Wealth and digital wealth partnerships globally, and helps advisors build better portfolios through portfolio construction and risk management, powered by Aladdin. BlackRock's investment management revenue is primarily comprised of fees earned as a percentage of AUM and, in some cases, performance fees, which are normally expressed as a percentage of fund returns to the client. BlackRock believes its strategy aligns with expected future client demand for attractive yields in fixed income, outsourcing solutions, ETFs, private markets and Aladdin technology, which it expects will continue to shape growth opportunities going forward.

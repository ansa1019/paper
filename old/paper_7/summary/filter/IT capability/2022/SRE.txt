Our 2022 operational and financial results reflect our mission to be North America's premier energy infrastructure company. We invested $5.7 billion in capital expenditures and investments, which are essential for enhancing our IT capabilities and supporting business strategies. The ability to acquire, deploy, combine, and reconfigure IT resources is crucial for transforming our firm into a competitive force. Our IT capabilities represent the application of technology, knowledge, practices, and management skills to further organizational goals. We focus on information management capability, which includes providing data and information to users with appropriate levels of accuracy, timeliness, reliability, security, confidentiality, connectivity, and access. This capability is vital for adapting to changing business needs and directions. 

The regulatory framework under which SDG&E and SoCalGas operate permits the recovery of costs incurred in providing services, which is influenced by our IT architecture and governance. Our ability to effectively manage and allocate resources, including IT resources, is critical for maintaining operational efficiency and supporting strategic decisions. The increase in earnings was primarily due to higher equity earnings from Oncor Holdings, driven by higher revenues from rate updates reflecting increases in invested capital and customer growth, which are supported by our IT systems. 

Furthermore, our investment choices and capital expenditures are aligned with our strategic resource allocation to enhance operational flexibility and market responsiveness. We continuously assess our technology portfolio to ensure that our IT capabilities support our business processes and innovation partnerships. The development of our projects, including the Cameron LNG Phase 2 project, is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, including securing financing and obtaining necessary permits, which are all influenced by our IT effectiveness and strategic management practices. 

The ability to manage information processing capacity and ensure information security is paramount in our operations, particularly in the context of regulatory uncertainty and environmental factors. Our organizational capabilities are enhanced through effective data management and resource mobilization, which are essential for achieving performance gains and maintaining a competitive advantage. As we navigate market dynamics and external influences, our IT capabilities play a critical role in supporting our business transformation and achieving our organizational goals. 

In summary, our focus on enhancing IT capabilities is integral to our operational strategy, enabling us to leverage technology resources effectively, respond to market demands, and drive business innovation. The interplay between our IT architecture and business processes is crucial for optimizing performance and ensuring compliance with regulatory requirements.

In addition to historical information, this annual report contains forward-looking statements regarding expectations concerning supply chain constraints, global chip shortages, and other factors affecting manufacturing capacity and inventory management. Our cybersecurity solutions provide broad visibility and segmentation of the digital attack surface through an integrated cybersecurity platform, which features automated protection, detection, and response, along with consolidated visibility across both Fortinet-developed solutions and a broad ecosystem of third-party technologies. Our cybersecurity platform portfolio leverages a common operating system designed to integrate Fortinet solutions with third-party solutions, enabling automated detection and response across the attack surface. The convergence of security and networking is a key driver of long-term growth and operating leverage, as we grow our solution sales through channel partners to businesses, service providers, and government organizations. Our ability to hire qualified sales, support, and engineering employees is critical to executing these sales and managing the complexity of providing solutions to various segments. Our product revenue growth was primarily due to strong demand for the wide range of operating system capabilities embedded in our core platform products, which further supports our business transformation into a competitive force. The integration of networking functionality and security capabilities into the FortiOS operating system enables centralized management, visibility, automation, and intelligence sharing, simplifying operations and enhancing operational efficiency. Our research and development expenses are focused on software development and the ongoing enhancement of our existing products, with a significant portion of our engineers dedicated to these efforts. We continue to invest in our research and development organization to support the development of new products. The growth of our customer base and the expansion of our service offerings are critical to our service revenue growth, which has accelerated over the past three years. Our deferred revenue balance, which represents unrecognized service revenue, is a significant portion of future revenue and cash flow. The operational flexibility provided by our technology infrastructure allows us to respond to changing market dynamics and customer needs effectively. We have observed the impact of macroeconomic developments and the COVID-19 pandemic on our operational and financial performance, which underscores the importance of our IT capabilities in navigating these challenges. Our ability to manage working capital effectively has resulted in significant cash flows from operating activities, driven by the recognition of revenue from our growing deferred revenue balance related to security subscriptions and technical support services. The strategic resource allocation to enhance our technology capabilities is essential for maintaining competitive advantage and driving performance gains. We expect to continue to increase our data center and operational capacity to support growth and the introduction of new services. Our investment policy aims to preserve capital while generating returns, ensuring that we have sufficient liquidity to meet our operational and capital expenditure requirements.

We continue to focus on the following strategic priorities: operating excellence, growth, returns, and high-performing organization. Our commitment to operating excellence guides everything we do, emphasizing continuous improvement in safety, environmental stewardship, reliability, and cost efficiency. We employ rigorous training and audit programs to drive ongoing improvement in both personal and process safety. Our multi-year business transformation initiative is focused on identifying and implementing opportunities to improve our cost structure enterprise-wide, with a goal of achieving a sustainable run-rate cost reduction of at least $800 million and a sustaining capital reduction of at least $200 million per year by the end of 2023. A disciplined capital allocation process ensures we invest in projects expected to generate competitive returns, particularly in high-return growth opportunities in the midstream and chemicals segments, as well as renewable fuels projects to advance a lower-carbon future. Our strategy includes budgeted capital expenditures and investments, with a significant portion directed towards enhancing our integrated natural gas liquids value chain from wellhead to market. We also plan to enhance refining returns by focusing on low-capital, higher-return projects that increase asset reliability, improve market capture, and reduce costs. Our commitment to digital transformation and information technology projects is reflected in our corporate capital budget, which includes significant allocations for these initiatives. We strive to attract, develop, and retain individuals with the knowledge and skills to implement our business strategy, promoting an inclusive workplace that enables our diverse workforce to innovate and create value. The midstream segment includes our transportation and NGL businesses, which are supported by technology capabilities that enhance operational efficiency and market responsiveness. Our investments in technology infrastructure and digital options thinking are critical for maintaining competitive advantage and operational flexibility in a rapidly evolving business environment. We recognize that the level and quality of output from our refineries impact our cash flows, and we actively manage operations to optimize efficiency and performance. Our worldwide refining crude oil capacity utilization was 90% in 2022, driven by improved demand for refined petroleum products. The chemicals segment, which consists of our equity investment in CP Chem, also relies on effective technology deployment to enhance production capabilities and market positioning. We are committed to reducing our environmental footprint through innovative practices and technology integration, which is essential for compliance with evolving regulations and market expectations. Our strategic management practices are designed to leverage IT capabilities in support of business needs and organizational goals, ensuring alignment with our overall business strategy. The ongoing evaluation of our technology portfolio and investment choices will enable us to respond effectively to market dynamics and consumer demands, ultimately enhancing our organizational performance and value creation.

We are focused on maintaining high cash margins and a low-cost structure to drive an increasing return on capital and operational excellence, and to mitigate inflationary pressures through improvements and efficiencies in our drilling and completion programs. Our capital budget for 2023 is $2.50 billion to $2.70 billion, which includes significant investments in drilling and infrastructure to enhance operational efficiency and support our business strategies. We utilize our free cash flow to meet our quarterly return of capital commitment and for debt repayment rather than expanding our drilling program, reflecting our strategic resource allocation in response to market dynamics. The increase in production for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to the same period in 2021, resulted primarily from recognizing a full year of production associated with production from the Guidon acquisition and the QEP merger, which underscores the importance of integrating technology capabilities and operational processes in achieving firm performance. We are committed to leveraging our IT resources and capabilities to enhance our information management, ensuring data accuracy and reliability in our operational decision-making. Our focus on operational flexibility and market agility allows us to respond effectively to changing business needs and external influences, including commodity price volatility and economic conditions. We are also committed to environmental responsibility initiatives, which include implementing continuous emission monitoring systems to cover a significant portion of our operated oil production, thereby enhancing our operational capabilities and aligning with regulatory expectations. Our strategic management practices involve evaluating our capital expenditures and operational strategies to optimize performance outcomes and drive business transformation. We recognize that our ability to grow proved reserves and production will be highly dependent on the capital resources available to us, which necessitates a careful assessment of our investment choices and resource management. The integration of technology infrastructure and capabilities into our operational framework is essential for enhancing our competitive positioning and achieving sustainable business value. We are actively monitoring commodity prices and overall market conditions, allowing us to adjust our capital expenditure budget and operational strategies in response to fluctuations in the business environment. Our commitment to innovation partnerships and strategic resource allocation reflects our understanding of the importance of aligning our technology deployment with our organizational goals and market-based performance. The successful execution of our business strategies will be contingent upon our ability to mobilize and deploy IT-based resources effectively, ensuring that we maintain our competitive advantage in the evolving energy sector.

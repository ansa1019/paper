As part of our name change to Elevance Health, we announced that over the next several years we will organize our brand portfolio into core go-to-market brands, which includes integrating our healthcare-related services and capabilities. We are evaluating and making changes to how we manage our business, which includes a review of the products in each of our operating segments. This restructuring aligns strategies and allocates resources effectively. We expect to take advantage of additional economies of scale and provide access to new and evolving technologies and products. Our growth strategy is designed to enable us to expand through organic growth, strategic acquisitions, and efficient use of capital in both existing and new markets. We believe geographic and product diversity reduces our exposure to local or regional regulatory, economic, and competitive pressures and provides us with increased opportunities for growth. We utilize our subsidiary CarelonRx to market and offer pharmacy benefits management services, which is expected to improve our ability to integrate pharmacy benefits within our medical and specialty platform. Our results of operations depend significantly on our ability to accurately predict and effectively manage healthcare costs through effective contracting with providers, product pricing, medical management, and health and wellness programs. We continue to monitor the COVID-19 pandemic and its impacts on our medical cost trends, which could influence our operational flexibility and decision-making speed. The ongoing cost and volume of covered services related to the pandemic may have an adverse effect on our future claim costs. Our comprehensive PBM services portfolio includes features such as formulary management, pharmacy networks, and member services, which enhance our operational efficiency and customer relationships. We have implemented enterprise-wide initiatives to optimize our business, including process automation and a reduction in our office space footprint, which are steps toward becoming a more agile organization. We are committed to leveraging technology capabilities to support our business needs and enhance our competitive positioning. Our investment strategy is designed to ensure compliance with regulatory requirements while preserving our asset base, which is crucial for maintaining operational effectiveness. We believe that funds from future operating cash flows, cash and investments, and funds available under our credit facilities will be sufficient for future operations and commitments, including capital acquisitions and other strategic transactions. We regularly review the appropriate use of capital, including acquisitions and dividends to shareholders, to ensure alignment with our organizational goals. Our financial condition and liquidity position are strong, supported by consolidated cash and investments, which are essential for meeting our obligations and maintaining flexibility in resource allocation. We are committed to monitoring emerging experience to better understand the implications for our reserves and operational strategies.

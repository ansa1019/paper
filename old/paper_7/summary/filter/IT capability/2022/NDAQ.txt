In September 2022, we announced a new organizational structure which aligns our businesses more closely with the foundational shifts that are driving the evolution of the global financial system. This new corporate structure includes three business segments: market platforms, capital access platforms, and anti-financial crime. The increase in demand for fraud detection and anti-money laundering solutions and strong performance by our surveillance business in new sales to existing clients and new customer acquisitions highlights the importance of mobilizing and deploying IT-based resources. Our capital access platforms segment has shown growth driven by analytics and corporate solutions revenues, with a focus on higher adoption of our investor relations intelligence products and new ESG solutions. The increase in proprietary data revenues driven by higher international demand indicates the strategic resource allocation towards technology capabilities that enhance business performance. The successful completion of long-term contracts in 2021 and the unfavorable impact of changes in foreign exchange rates in 2022 demonstrate the challenges of managing technology deployment in a dynamic market environment. Our investment in cloud initiatives and higher software costs reflect the operational flexibility needed to support business innovation and transformation. The integration of technology functionalities across our segments is crucial for optimizing processes and enhancing organizational effectiveness. We have pursued various strategic initiatives and completed acquisitions and divestitures, which have resulted in expenses that would not have otherwise been incurred, emphasizing the need for effective IT governance and management skills. The increase in annual listing fees and proprietary market data subscriptions within our data & listing services business illustrates the capability leverage achieved through strategic investments in technology resources. Our focus on customer relationships and the ability to tailor services in response to changing business needs is essential for maintaining competitive advantage. The organizational change and the reassignment of goodwill based on relative fair value of each reporting unit reflect our commitment to aligning our technology portfolio with market dynamics and performance outcomes. The emphasis on data management and the ability to provide information with appropriate levels of accuracy, timeliness, and reliability are integral to our operational processes and overall firm capabilities. The increase in demand for connectivity services within our marketplace technology business further underscores the role of IT capabilities in facilitating communication and enhancing business resilience. As we continue to adapt to environmental factors and market restructuring, our strategic alignment with digital transformation initiatives will be critical for sustaining long-term growth and performance excellence.

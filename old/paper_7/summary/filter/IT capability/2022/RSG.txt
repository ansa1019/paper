In 2023, we will focus on advancing technology to improve productivity and increase customer retention. We expect to incur restructuring charges of approximately $20 million, primarily related to the redesign of our customer billing and asset management software systems. Additionally, we incurred $77.3 million of acquisition integration and deal costs in connection with the acquisition of US Ecology, which included costs to integrate the business, including stock compensation expense for unvested awards at closing as well as severance and change-in-control payments. We have also incurred additional costs related to the integration of certain software systems as well as rebranding the business. Our customer billing and asset management software systems are undergoing redesign to enhance operational efficiency and support business transformation. We believe that presenting adjusted pre-tax income, adjusted tax impact, adjusted net income, and adjusted diluted earnings per share provides an understanding of operational activities before the financial impact of certain items, reflecting our ongoing performance separate from items that have a disproportionate effect on our results. The integration of technology resources and capabilities is essential for leveraging business value and achieving competitive advantage in the market. Our strategic resource allocation includes investments in technology functionalities that align with our business needs and directions. The acquisition of US Ecology is part of our growth strategy, which focuses on acquiring solid waste, recycling, and environmental services companies that complement our existing business platform. We expect to invest at least $500 million in acquisitions in 2023, further enhancing our operational capabilities. Our financial results indicate that revenue increased due to acquisition-related growth and operational improvements driven by technology deployment and process optimization. We are engaged in ongoing efforts to enhance our information management capability, which is crucial for providing data and information to users with appropriate levels of accuracy, timeliness, reliability, and security. The ability to mobilize and deploy IT-based resources in combination with leveraging the value of other resources and capabilities is fundamental to our strategic management practices. We recognize the importance of IT governance and the challenges associated with managing technology resources effectively. Our operational flexibility and market agility are supported by our investment in digital technologies and infrastructure capability, which facilitate better decision-making and responsiveness to market dynamics. The integration of technology into our operations is expected to drive performance gains and enhance our organizational effectiveness, ultimately contributing to improved firm performance and competitive positioning in the environmental services industry.

The medical technology industry is highly competitive and continues to evolve. Our success is measured both by the development of innovative products and the value we bring to our stakeholders. We are committed to developing new technologies and providing innovative patient care, and we are committed to defending our intellectual property in support of those developments. Despite the challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic, our dedicated field teams have found creative ways to support physicians, our engineers continued to advance innovation, and our colleagues worked diligently to keep our clinical trials on track. In 2022, we invested 17.6% of our net sales in research and development. We received United States Food and Drug Administration ("FDA") approval for the Mitris Resilia valve, a tissue valve replacement specifically designed for the heart's mitral position, and we received CE mark approval for the Pascal Precision transcatheter valve repair system for patients suffering from mitral and tricuspid regurgitation. We are dedicated to generating robust clinical, economic, and quality-of-life evidence increasingly expected by patients, clinicians, and payors in the current healthcare environment, with the goal of encouraging the adoption of innovative new medical therapies that demonstrate superior outcomes. The COVID-19 pandemic has adversely impacted, and may further adversely impact, nearly all aspects of our business and markets, including our workforce and the operations of our customers, suppliers, and business partners. Our priority has been to maintain access for patients to our life-saving technologies while providing continuous front-line support to our clinician partners and protecting the well-being of our employees. Our manufacturing operations have continued to respond to impacts related to COVID-19, and we have been able to supply our technologies around the world. Across the organization, we are proactively managing inventory, assessing alternative logistics options, and closely monitoring the supply of components to address potential supply constraints. The severity and duration of the impact of these conditions on our business cannot be predicted. The medical technology industry is characterized by rapid technological advancements and evolving market dynamics, necessitating continuous investment in IT capabilities to enhance operational efficiency and support business innovation. Our IT capabilities are integral to our ability to coordinate our assets and internal processes, facilitating effective management of interfirm transactions and relationships. We recognize the importance of mobilizing and deploying IT-based resources in combination with leveraging the value of other resources and capabilities to transform our firm into a competitive force. Our IT governance structures are designed to align technology investments with strategic business objectives, ensuring that we can respond effectively to changing market conditions and consumer demands. We are committed to enhancing our information management capabilities to provide timely and reliable data to support decision-making processes across the organization. Our focus on technology deployment and infrastructure capability is essential for maintaining operational flexibility and achieving our organizational goals. As we navigate the challenges presented by the current business environment, we remain dedicated to leveraging our IT capabilities to drive performance gains, enhance customer relationships, and support our long-term strategic objectives.

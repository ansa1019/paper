We continue to make strategic investments to support our durable operating and financial model that further differentiates Target and is designed to drive sustainable sales and profit growth. In support of our enterprise strategy, we expanded our supply chain capacity and digital fulfillment capabilities, including adding one new distribution center and six new sortation centers to support our growth and commitment to fast delivery times, while helping our teams work more efficiently and managing our shipping costs. We fulfilled over 50 percent of our digital sales through our same-day fulfillment options, which reflects our ability to leverage technology resources to enhance operational efficiency and meet consumer demands. Our comparable digitally originated sales increased 1.5 percent, indicating our capability to adapt to changing market dynamics and consumer preferences. In response to rising guest demand and supply chain constraints, we took various actions, including ordering merchandise earlier and increasing the use of air transport for certain merchandise, demonstrating our operational flexibility and responsiveness to external influences. Our investments in technology infrastructure and digital capabilities are critical in transforming our business processes and enhancing our competitive advantage. The increase in capital expenditures reflects our commitment to optimizing front-end space in high-volume locations to increase the efficiency of our same-day services, which is essential for maintaining market agility. We expect capital expenditures in 2023 to support full-store remodels and supply chain projects, which will modernize our network and enhance our last-mile delivery capabilities. Our ability to differentiate our guests' shopping experience through a careful combination of merchandise assortment, price, convenience, and guest experience underscores the importance of strategic resource allocation and management capability in driving long-term profitability. We have also invested in our team through updated starting wages and expanded access to health care benefits, which are integral to our organizational capabilities and overall performance. The collective interaction of macroeconomic, competitive, and consumer behavioral factors influences our sales metrics and operational decisions. Our focus on digital transformation and IT deployment is essential for enhancing our information management capability, ensuring data accuracy, timeliness, and security. We believe that our strategic investments in technology and operational processes will continue to create sustainable long-term value and improve our organizational effectiveness. Our approach to capital allocation prioritizes profitable growth opportunities and maintaining a competitive dividend, reflecting our commitment to delivering business value and enhancing shareholder returns. We monitor the percentage of purchases paid for using our Target-branded credit cards, as this internal analysis indicates a meaningful portion of incremental purchases are also incremental sales for Target. Our ability to manage inventory levels and respond to shifts in consumer demand is critical for maintaining operational efficiency and profitability. The ongoing evaluation of our performance metrics and strategic management practices will guide our future investments and operational strategies, ensuring alignment with our organizational goals and market positioning.

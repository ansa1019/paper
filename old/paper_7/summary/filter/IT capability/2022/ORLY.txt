Our long-term business strategy requires capital to invest in enhanced information technology systems and tools, which are critical for supporting our operational and strategic objectives. We believe the increased sales are the result of superior inventory availability, including same day and overnight access to inventory from our regional distribution centers and hub store network, enhanced services and programs offered in our stores, and a broader selection of product offerings facilitated by a dynamic catalog system to identify and source parts. Our strong supplier relationships allowed us to maintain better in-stock inventory positions than the broader market, contributing to our sales growth. The rollout of our professional pricing initiative was a strategic investment aimed at ensuring we are more competitively priced on the professional side of our business. Our dual market strategy focuses on serving both DIY and professional service provider customers, leveraging our operational capabilities to enhance customer service and satisfaction. We have ongoing initiatives focused on marketing and training to educate customers on the advantages of ongoing vehicle maintenance, which aligns with our business process focus and operational flexibility. We expect to fund our short- and long-term cash and capital requirements with our primary sources of liquidity, which include funds generated from the normal course of our business operations, borrowings under our unsecured revolving credit facility, and senior note offerings. The increase in capital expenditures was primarily due to an increase in store and distribution enhancement and expansion projects, which are essential for supporting our growth and operational efficiency. We plan to open new stores, which will require significant investment in technology infrastructure and operational capabilities to ensure effective integration into our existing systems. Our material cash requirements necessary to maintain current operations include investments in technology resources, which are vital for enhancing our information management capabilities and supporting our strategic resource allocation. The strength of our distribution network and our commitment to technology deployment have positioned us to respond effectively to market dynamics and consumer demands. We remain confident in our ability to gain market share in our existing markets and grow our business in new markets by focusing on our core values and leveraging our IT capabilities to enhance operational performance. Our investments in technology are aimed at improving our information processing capacity and ensuring the reliability and accuracy of data provided to users, which is critical for informed decision-making and strategic alignment with business objectives. The evolving landscape of the automotive aftermarket requires us to continuously adapt our IT capabilities to meet changing business needs and directions, ensuring we remain competitive in a dynamic market environment.

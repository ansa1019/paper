EOG Resources, Inc. operates under a consistent business and operational strategy that focuses predominantly on maximizing the rate of return on investment of capital by controlling operating and capital costs and maximizing reserve recoveries. The company emphasizes the drilling of internally generated prospects to find and develop low-cost reserves, which is intended to enhance the generation of cash flow and earnings from each unit of production on a cost-effective basis. EOG's strategy includes maintaining the lowest possible operating cost structure consistent with efficient, safe, and environmentally responsible operations. EOG continues to evaluate potential crude oil and liquids-rich natural gas exploration and development prospects and seeks opportunities to add drilling inventory through leasehold acquisitions and tactical acquisitions. The company has placed an emphasis on applying its horizontal drilling and completion expertise to unconventional crude oil and liquids-rich reservoirs, focusing on increasing drilling, completion, and operating efficiencies gained in prior years. EOG's capital expenditures are structured to maintain capital discipline by funding exploration, development, and exploitation activities primarily from available internally generated cash flows. The company has significant flexibility with respect to financing alternatives, including borrowings under its commercial paper program and equity and debt offerings. EOG's management believes it has one of the strongest prospect inventories in its history and will make acquisitions that bolster existing drilling programs or offer incremental exploration and production opportunities. EOG's financial results reflect a focus on operational efficiency, with net cash provided by operating activities increasing due to favorable changes in working capital and cash received for settlements of commodity derivative contracts. The company recognizes the importance of mobilizing and deploying IT-based resources in combination with leveraging the value of other resources and capabilities to support business needs. EOG's ability to effectively integrate acquired properties into its operations and accurately estimate reserves and production costs is critical to its operational success. The company is also exposed to cybersecurity threats and disruptions to its business and operations from breaches of its information technology systems, which underscores the significance of information technology in maintaining operational integrity and competitive positioning. EOG continues to monitor foreign currency exchange rates and may implement measures to protect against foreign currency exchange rate risk. The company's strategic management practices emphasize the importance of decision-making speed and resource allocation in response to market dynamics and competitive actions. EOG's operational and financial strategies are designed to enhance its market agility and responsiveness to environmental factors, ensuring that the company remains a competitive force in the oil and gas industry.

During the third quarter of 2019, we completed the acquisition of BTG plc, which was composed of three key businesses, enhancing our operational capabilities and integrating new technologies into our existing portfolio. Our endoscopy business develops and manufactures devices that leverage innovative technologies to diagnose and treat a broad range of gastrointestinal and pulmonary conditions, reflecting our commitment to advancing medical technologies and investing in meaningful research and development projects across our businesses. We have increased our investment in infrastructure in emerging markets to maximize opportunities, indicating a strategic resource allocation to enhance our market presence and operational flexibility. Our operational net sales growth included contributions from recent acquisitions, demonstrating the importance of integrating new technologies and capabilities into our existing operations to drive performance gains. The integration of BTG's interventional medicine business into our peripheral interventions division exemplifies our strategy of leveraging technology functionalities to improve our service offerings and enhance customer relationships. We remain committed to advancing our information management capabilities, ensuring that we provide data and information to users with appropriate levels of accuracy, timeliness, reliability, and security. Our internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements, emphasizing the importance of effective governance and management capabilities in supporting our business strategies. The ongoing assessment of our internal controls, including those related to cybersecurity, reflects our proactive approach to managing operational risks and ensuring compliance with regulatory requirements. We expect to incur significant expenditures associated with the implementation of the EU MDR, which represents a substantial change to our regulatory framework, highlighting the need for strategic management practices in navigating complex regulatory environments. Our commitment to process optimization and continuous improvement initiatives, including the functional expansion of global shared services and robotic process utilization, underscores our focus on enhancing operational efficiency and agility. The integration of acquired technologies and capabilities is critical to maintaining our competitive advantage in the market, as we aim to align our business strategies with evolving consumer demands and market dynamics. Our strategic decisions are informed by comprehensive evaluations of market-based performance and investment opportunities, ensuring that we mobilize resources effectively to achieve our organizational goals. The successful execution of our restructuring initiatives, aimed at enhancing our operational capabilities and reducing costs, further illustrates our commitment to driving business transformation and achieving sustainable growth.

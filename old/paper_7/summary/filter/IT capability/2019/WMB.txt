We focus on consistently attracting new business by providing highly reliable service to our customers. Our ongoing strategy of midstream operations is to safely and reliably operate large-scale midstream infrastructure where our assets can be fully utilized and drive low per-unit costs. Our operations are presented within reportable segments, which include the coordination of firm assets and internal processes. The expansion of services for certain customers to provide additional rich gas processing capacity in the Marcellus and Upper Devonian shale reflects our commitment to operational flexibility and market responsiveness. The project expansions are supported by long-term, fee-based agreements and volumetric commitments, emphasizing our strategic resource allocation. We have executed agreements that involve significant capital investments, demonstrating our focus on actionable investments that enhance our operational efficiency and business value. Our strategy is designed to maximize the opportunities created by the vast supply of natural gas and natural gas products that exists in the United States, which aligns with our goals of transforming business processes and enhancing firm performance. We anticipate that our growth capital and investment expenditures will be in a range from $1.1 billion to $1.3 billion, which includes projects that maintain our assets for safe and reliable operations, as well as projects that meet legal, regulatory, and contractual commitments. Our business plan includes a continued focus on earnings and cash flow growth while controlling operating costs. The organizational realignment is expected to benefit our expenses, which is crucial for maintaining operational efficiency. We are committed to projects that enhance our technology infrastructure and improve our information management capabilities, which are essential for supporting business needs and enhancing customer relationships. Our strategic management practices are designed to leverage our IT capabilities, ensuring that we can respond effectively to market dynamics and competitive actions. The integration of our technology portfolio will facilitate process optimization and enhance our organizational effectiveness. We seek to maintain a strong financial position and liquidity while managing a diversified portfolio of energy infrastructure assets, which continue to serve key growth markets.

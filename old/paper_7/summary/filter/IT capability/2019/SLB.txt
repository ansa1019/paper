Schlumberger is continuing to scale-to-fit its organization and portfolio by repurposing or exiting underperforming business units, focusing on asset-light operations, and expanding its technology access business models. This strategy aims to promote margin expansion and improve returns in the North America land market. The strong international performance was the result of increased activity on the part of operators, as they continued to invest in longer-term resource development following a sustained period of underinvestment and declining production. Schlumberger's financial performance in 2019 was primarily driven by the international markets, with international revenue growth outpacing North America revenue, reflecting a commitment to leveraging technology resources and capabilities to enhance operational efficiency and business performance. The company completed two major milestones during the fourth quarter of 2019: the formation of the Sensia joint venture and the divestiture of the drilling tools business, which are indicative of strategic resource allocation and investment decisions aimed at enhancing operational flexibility and market responsiveness. Schlumberger expects its international portfolio revenue to grow at a similar pace or higher, excluding the effects of the businesses transferred to the Sensia joint venture and the businesses divested in the drilling tools transaction. The expectation for 2020 exploration and production capital expenditure spending growth rate in the international markets is projected to be in the mid-single-digit range, driven by increasing offshore activity and improving activity mix from the early deepwater growth cycle. The company has experienced sequential international margin growth in each of the last three quarters, indicating a positive trend in operational effectiveness and strategic alignment with market dynamics. Schlumberger's focus on technology deployment and integration, alongside its commitment to innovation partnerships, positions the firm to respond effectively to competitive actions and market restructuring. The company is also enhancing its information management capability to provide data and information to users with appropriate levels of accuracy, timeliness, reliability, and security, which is essential for supporting business needs and enhancing decision-making speed. The operational strategies implemented are designed to optimize processes and enhance the overall organizational capability, ensuring that Schlumberger remains a competitive force in the evolving market landscape. The formation of the Sensia joint venture with Rockwell Automation reflects an investment in digital technologies and infrastructure capability, aimed at improving the value chain and fostering business innovation. Schlumberger's strategic management practices emphasize the importance of mobilizing and deploying IT-based resources in combination with other resources and capabilities to achieve organizational goals and enhance firm performance.

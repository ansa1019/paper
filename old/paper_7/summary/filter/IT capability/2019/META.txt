In 2019, we continued to focus on our main revenue growth priorities, which include helping marketers use our products to connect with consumers and making our ads more relevant and effective. We intend to continue to invest based on these priorities, anticipating that additional investments in our data center capacity, network infrastructure, and office facilities will drive expense growth. Our advertising revenue is generated by displaying ad products on Facebook, Instagram, Messenger, and third-party affiliated websites, with marketers paying based on impressions delivered or actions taken by users. The number of ads we show is subject to methodological changes as we evolve our ads business. Our cost of revenue consists primarily of expenses associated with the operation of our data centers and technical infrastructure, which include facility and server equipment depreciation, salaries, benefits, and energy costs. Research and development expenses increased significantly, primarily due to increases in payroll and benefits expenses and facilities-related costs, reflecting a growth in employee headcount in engineering and technical functions. We plan to continue hiring software engineers and other technical employees to support our research and development initiatives. The increase in operational expenses related to our data centers and technical infrastructure is expected to continue as we expand to support user growth and engagement. Our marketing and sales expenses also increased, driven by increases in marketing expenses and payroll, as we continue to invest in community and product operations to support our security efforts. We have made significant investments in our technology infrastructure, which is critical for enhancing our operational efficiency and supporting our business processes. The complexity of our user metrics relies on sophisticated techniques, algorithms, and machine learning models to estimate the number of unique users across our family of products. We view daily and monthly active users as measures of engagement, which directly influence our revenue and financial results. Our ability to provide accurate and timely data to users is essential for maintaining information reliability and supporting business needs. We recognize that our IT capabilities are integral to transforming our firm into a competitive force, as they enable us to mobilize and deploy IT-based resources effectively. The ongoing evolution of our IT capabilities encompasses the coordination of our assets and internal processes, enhancing our business strategy alignment and operational flexibility. Additionally, we are committed to improving our information management capability to ensure that we can tailor our data provision in response to changing business needs and directions. The anticipated increase in capital expenditures reflects our strategic resource allocation towards enhancing our technology portfolio and infrastructure capability, which is essential for driving future growth and maintaining our competitive positioning in the market.

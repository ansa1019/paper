3M is investing in an initiative called business transformation, which encompasses the ongoing multi-year phased implementation of an enterprise resource planning (ERP) system on a worldwide basis, as well as changes in processes and internal/external service delivery across 3M. The company is increasing its investment in manufacturing and sourcing capability in order to more closely align its product capability with its sales in major geographic areas to best serve its customers throughout the world with proprietary, automated, efficient, safe, and sustainable processes. 3M's focus on research and development has resulted in a portion of its value being comprised of internally developed businesses that have no goodwill associated with them. The company believes that discussion of results adjusted for significant litigation-related charges provides a useful analysis of ongoing underlying operating trends. The company is actively considering additional acquisitions, investments, and strategic alliances, and from time to time may also divest certain businesses. In 2019, 3M generated $7.070 billion of operating cash flow, an increase primarily due to lower year-on-year significant litigation-related charges and the timing of associated payments. 3M's capital spending was directed towards investments in property, plant, and equipment, which enable growth across diverse markets, helping to meet product demand and increasing manufacturing efficiency. The company expects to continue investing in its businesses to drive organic growth, including research and development, capital expenditures, and commercialization capability. 3M's business segments are managed to better serve global customers and markets, with a focus on aligning customer account activity to correlate with primary divisional product offerings. The company has made changes to its business segments to improve the alignment of businesses around markets and customers, which reflects the impact of these changes for all periods presented. The company’s operational efficiency is enhanced through investments in IT capabilities that support business needs and enhance organizational goals. 3M's strategic resource allocation includes a focus on digital technologies and innovation partnerships to drive business performance and market responsiveness. The company’s management practices emphasize the importance of mobilizing and deploying IT-based resources in combination with leveraging the value of other resources and capabilities. 3M's operational flexibility is supported by its IT architecture, which facilitates effective support of business strategies and work processes. The company’s approach to managing its operations reflects a commitment to improving growth and operational efficiency through strategic management practices and technology deployment. 3M continues to monitor its reporting units and asset groups for any triggering events or other indicators of impairment, ensuring that its organizational capabilities are aligned with its strategic objectives. The company’s investments in IT and related capabilities are integral to its goal of transforming into a competitive force in the market, enhancing its ability to respond to changing business needs and directions.

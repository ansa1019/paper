The company's management is responsible for the integrity and accuracy of the financial statements, which includes ensuring that material information required to be disclosed is recorded, processed, summarized, and communicated to management and reported within the required time periods. In meeting its responsibility for the reliability of the financial statements, management relies on a system of internal accounting control designed to provide reasonable assurance that assets are safeguarded and transactions are executed in accordance with management's authorization. The design of this system recognizes that errors or irregularities may occur and that estimates and judgments are required to assess the relative cost and expected benefits of the controls. Management believes that the company's internal accounting controls provide reasonable assurance that errors or irregularities that could be material to the financial statements are prevented or would be detected within a timely period. The audit committee of the board of directors oversees the company's financial reporting process and meets with management and the company's internal auditors periodically to review the work of each and to monitor the discharge of responsibilities. The independent auditors express an opinion on the company's consolidated financial statements and on the company's internal control over financial reporting, based on procedures believed to be sufficient to provide reasonable assurance that the financial statements contain no material errors and that the company's internal controls are effective.

The objectives of our management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are to provide users of our consolidated financial statements with a narrative explanation from the perspective of management of our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, liquidity, and certain other factors that may affect future results. Our un-carrier strategy has disrupted the wireless communications services industry by actively engaging with and listening to our customers, thereby eliminating their existing pain points and implementing signature initiatives that have changed wireless for good. The merger with Sprint is expected to build upon our foundational 5G network to deliver transformational broad, deep, and nationwide 5G for all, accelerate innovation, and increase competition in the U.S. wireless, video, and broadband industries. Our ability to acquire and retain branded customers is important to our business in the generation of revenues, and we believe our un-carrier strategy, along with ongoing network improvements, has been successful in attracting and retaining customers. The total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2019, increased primarily due to growth in service revenues, driven by the continued growth in our average branded customer base and the success of new customer segments and rate plans. The operating income for the year ended December 31, 2019, increased primarily due to higher service revenues. The positive impact of the new lease standard and the merger-related costs were significant factors in our financial performance. Our liquidity requirements have been driven primarily by capital expenditures for spectrum licenses and the construction, expansion, and upgrading of our network infrastructure, including the deployment of 5G. We expect cash purchases of property and equipment to be significant in 2020, reflecting our ongoing commitment to network transformation. The adoption of the new lease standard has resulted in the recognition of right-of-use assets and lease liabilities for operating leases that had not previously been recorded, impacting our financial statements. Our management believes that the adjustments made for the new lease standard will enhance our operational flexibility and efficiency. The strategic resource allocation towards technology infrastructure supports our objectives in enhancing customer experience and operational capabilities. The increased focus on digital transformation and IT capabilities is integral to our strategy, enabling us to respond to market dynamics and consumer demands effectively. Our ongoing investments in technology resources and capabilities are expected to yield performance gains and enhance our competitive positioning in the market. The integration of digital technologies into our operations is essential for achieving our organizational goals and improving overall business performance. The management of our technology portfolio, including the deployment of IT systems and infrastructure, is critical to our success in navigating the competitive landscape and achieving sustainable growth. The financial condition and results of operations reflect our commitment to leveraging IT capabilities to support business strategies and enhance operational effectiveness.

The increase in professional fees in 2019 compared with 2018 was primarily driven by higher consulting fees related to our strategic investments in operating, customer-facing, and back-office technologies. The increase in other expenses in 2019 compared with 2018 was principally driven by higher litigation reserves and increased infrastructure costs associated with our investments in technology. Our strategic pricing efforts focus on ensuring we overcome inflationary cost pressures and grow margins, which is supported by technology deployment and management capabilities that enhance operational efficiency.

The increase in selling, general, and administrative expenses in 2019 was primarily attributable to costs associated with planned investments in our people and technology, indicating a strategic alignment with our operational goals. We have also been working to improve the financial returns of our recycling line of business by driving a fee-based pricing model that addresses the cost of processing materials, which is facilitated by our information management capabilities. The company believes that its investment-grade credit ratings and the large value of unencumbered assets enable it to obtain adequate financing to meet its ongoing capital, operating, and liquidity requirements, which are critical for sustaining our technology infrastructure and operational effectiveness. We continually monitor our actual and forecasted cash flows, liquidity, and capital resources, enabling us to plan for present needs and fund unbudgeted business activities that may arise due to changing business conditions or new opportunities.

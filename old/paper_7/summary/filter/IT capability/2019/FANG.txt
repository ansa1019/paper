We operate in two business segments: the upstream segment, which is engaged in the acquisition, development, exploration, and exploitation of unconventional, onshore oil and natural gas reserves, and the midstream operations segment, which focuses on ownership, operation, development, and acquisition of midstream infrastructure assets. Our activities are primarily directed at the horizontal development of formations in the Permian Basin, where we intend to continue to develop reserves and increase production through development drilling and exploitation activities. We have entered into multiple fee-based commercial agreements utilizing our infrastructure assets to provide essential services critical to our upstream operations. Our development program is focused entirely within the Permian Basin, where we continue to focus on long-lateral multi-well pad development. We emphasize low-cost operations and best-in-class execution, seeking opportunities to control additional well costs. Our capital expenditures for drilling and infrastructure are significant, and we regularly consider which capital resources are available to meet our financial obligations and planned capital activities. We monitor and adjust our projected capital expenditures in response to drilling results, prices, and other factors. Our agreements with Rattler include substantial acreage dedications, which enhance our operational capabilities. We utilize technology resources to support our business strategies and work processes, emphasizing the importance of mobilizing and deploying IT-based resources in combination with other capabilities. Our midstream services revenue represents fees charged for the transportation of oil and natural gas, as well as water gathering and related disposal facilities, which complement our operations in areas with significant production. We recognize revenue based on the per unit fees charged for our services, which are influenced by market conditions. Our operational flexibility allows us to adjust our drilling activities in response to commodity price fluctuations, maintaining a focus on efficiency and performance improvement. We are committed to enhancing our organizational capabilities through effective resource allocation and management practices. Our liquidity and cash flow management are critical as we pursue reserves and production growth, with our future ability to grow dependent on the capital resources available to us. We have budgeted significant capital expenditures for horizontal drilling and midstream investments, reflecting our strategic focus on enhancing operational efficiency and market responsiveness. Our operational updates indicate a commitment to navigating industry challenges while improving our cost structure and increasing environmental transparency. The integration of technology into our operational framework supports our strategic objectives, enabling us to respond effectively to market dynamics and consumer demands. We recognize the importance of information management capabilities, including the provision of accurate and timely data to users, which is essential for informed decision-making and enhancing competitive advantage. Our focus on digital transformation and IT deployment is integral to our business strategy, ensuring that we leverage technology to optimize our processes and improve overall firm performance.

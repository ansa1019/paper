Management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations highlights that our technologies give law enforcement the confidence, focus, and time they need to protect their communities, indicating a focus on the coordination of a firmâ€™s assets and internal processes. Our core mission is to protect life through developing hardware and software products that advance our long-term vision, which underscores the importance of mobilizing and deploying IT-based resources in combination with leveraging the value of other resources and capabilities. The increase in revenue from our software and sensors segment, which includes cloud-hosted software and related professional services, reflects our commitment to enhancing our information management capability and supporting business needs. We expect revenue growth in the software and sensors segment to result in improved operating margins over time, as additional revenue will cover a larger portion of our selling, general and administrative expenses and research and development costs. Our strategic intent to shift an increasing amount of our business to a subscription model aligns with the municipal budgeting process of our customers, allowing for multiple product offerings to be bundled into existing subscriptions. We anticipate that investments in research and development will continue to increase as we focus on growing the software and sensors segment, which is expected to enhance our operational efficiency and support our business transformation efforts. The increase in our subscription revenue base is projected to result in revenue increasing faster than the increase in selling, general and administrative expenses and research and development costs, as we reach economies of scale. Our operations team has flexibility to adapt to changing market dynamics, which is crucial for maintaining operational flexibility and market responsiveness. The introduction of the Taser 7, primarily sold in subscription offerings, continues to accelerate our strategic shift towards subscription-based revenue models. We believe that these investments will lead to performance gains and improved firm capabilities, particularly in the context of competitive positioning and market agility. Additionally, we have entered into a purchase agreement for cloud data storage, which is expected to manage future storage and compute costs effectively, despite anticipated increases in the amount of data stored. Our focus on enhancing IT capability is reflected in our commitment to developing scalable cloud-connected device platforms, which will further advance our information technology capabilities and support our long-term strategic objectives. The significant increase in backlog, particularly in the software and sensors segment, is indicative of expected revenue growth and reflects our ability to manage resources effectively in response to market demands. We recognize that our ongoing investments in technology infrastructure and operational processes are essential for achieving our organizational goals and enhancing our overall performance metrics.

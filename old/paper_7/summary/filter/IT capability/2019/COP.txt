The company has also recognized the significance of technology capabilities in enhancing operational efficiencies and reducing environmental impacts. Additionally, the management's discussion highlights the need for effective information management capability, which entails providing data and information to users with appropriate levels of accuracy, timeliness, reliability, security, confidentiality, connectivity, and access.

At AT&T, our business strategies reflect bundled product offerings that cut across product lines and utilize shared assets. We believe future wireless growth will depend on our ability to offer innovative services, plans, and devices that take advantage of our premier 5G wireless network, and to provide these services in bundled product offerings. Our strategic services include data services, voice service, security and cloud solutions, and managed, professional, and outsourcing services. The integration of data/broadband and entertainment services is a focus as the communications industry evolves into internet-based technologies capable of blending wireline, satellite, and wireless services. We expect revenue growth in our wireless and broadband businesses as customers demand premium content, instant connectivity, and higher speeds made possible by our fiber network expansion and wireless network enhancements through 5G deployment. The software benefits of our 5G wireless technology and new video delivery platforms should result in a more efficient use of capital and lower network-related expenses in the coming years. We continue to invest significant capital in expanding our network capacity, as well as to secure and utilize spectrum that meets our long-term needs. Our capital expenditures are predominantly spent on our networks, including product development and related support systems. We are transitioning our hardware-based network technology to more efficient and less expensive software-based technology to meet increased customer demand for enhanced wireless and broadband services. Our investments will prepare us to support growth initiatives, primarily our 5G deployment and FirstNet build. We anticipate that applications like video streaming will drive greater demand for broadband. Our operational flexibility and ability to mobilize and deploy IT-based resources in combination with leveraging the value of other resources and capabilities are crucial for transforming our firm into a competitive force. The operational efficiencies achieved through our continued focus on cost management and the shift to a software-based network are expected to enhance our performance metrics. Our strategic resource allocation, including investments in technology capabilities and infrastructure, is aimed at improving our organizational effectiveness and agility in responding to market dynamics. The deployment of advanced IP-based services and the focus on customer relationships through integrated telecommunications networks are central to our operational strategy. We expect that our network quality and FirstNet deployment will contribute to wireless subscriber and service revenue growth, and that 5G handset introductions will drive wireless equipment revenue growth. Our strategic management practices include the evaluation of segment performance based on EBITDA, which is an important metric that management uses to evaluate operating performance. The expected growth areas over the next few years include wireless, software-based video offerings, IP-based broadband services, and advertising and data insights. We are committed to leveraging our IT capabilities to enhance our business processes and achieve performance excellence in a competitive environment.

Visa is a global payments technology company that enables fast, secure and reliable electronic payments across more than 200 countries and territories. Our advanced transaction processing network, Visanet, enables authorization, clearing and settlement of payment transactions and allows us to provide our financial institution and merchant clients a wide range of products, platforms and value-added services. We continue to invest in growing our business, reflecting our commitment to enhancing our IT capabilities and supporting business needs. Our financial results for fiscal 2019 reflect the impact of overall growth in nominal payments volume, nominal cross-border volume, and processed transactions, which are critical drivers of our service revenues and data processing revenues. The increase in revenues was partially offset by increases in client incentives, which are designed to grow payments volume and drive innovation. Our capital expenditures increased during fiscal 2019 due to investments in technology, infrastructure and growth initiatives, which are essential for supporting our digital solutions and core business initiatives. We expect to continue investing in technology assets and payments system infrastructure to enhance our operational efficiency and maintain our competitive advantage in the market. The growth in processed transactions reflects the ongoing worldwide shift to electronic payments, highlighting the importance of our IT capabilities in facilitating these transactions. Our liquidity management policies ensure we have adequate resources to cover operating expenditures and make planned capital investments in our business, which includes leveraging our IT architecture and infrastructure capabilities. The adoption of new revenue standards has impacted the classification and timing of revenue recognition, emphasizing the need for robust information management and data processing capabilities to support our financial performance. We maintain global credit settlement risk policies and procedures to manage settlement risk, which may require clients to post collateral if certain credit standards are not met. Our investment portfolio is designed to invest cash in securities that enable us to meet our working capital and liquidity needs, reflecting our strategic resource allocation in response to market dynamics. We believe that cash flow generated from operations, in conjunction with access to our other sources of liquidity, will be more than sufficient to meet our ongoing operational needs. Our technology capabilities, including software development and data analytics, are integral to our business strategy and operational flexibility, allowing us to respond effectively to consumer demands and market restructuring. The integration of digital technologies into our operations is crucial for enhancing our organizational capabilities and achieving performance excellence. We recognize that our IT governance and management skills play a significant role in mobilizing and deploying IT-based resources to support our business transformation and drive value creation. The strategic alignment of our technology portfolio with our business objectives is essential for maintaining our market positioning and enhancing our overall firm performance.

Throughout this MD&A, we provide commentary regarding organic sales growth, which describes the impact of changes in volume, product mix, and net selling prices on net sales. We continue to focus on generating cash flow and allocating capital to shareholders. Our strategies for long-term success include growing our brands, leveraging our financial discipline, and allocating capital in value-creating ways. The comparison of our operating profit benefited from organic sales growth and cost savings, which are essential for enhancing our operational efficiency and market agility. The 2018 global restructuring program was initiated to reduce our structural cost base by streamlining and simplifying our manufacturing supply chain and overhead organization, which underscores our commitment to transforming our business processes and enhancing our operational flexibility. We expect to incur incremental capital spending related to this program, reflecting our focus on strategic resource allocation and investment decisions that align with our business needs. Our capital spending in 2019 was $1.2 billion, reflecting incremental spending related to the 2018 global restructuring program. The effective tax rate in 2019 included a net benefit related to a nonrecurring capital loss from a legal entity restructuring, which illustrates the impact of strategic management practices on our financial performance. We believe our ability to generate cash from operations and our capacity to issue short-term and long-term debt are adequate to fund working capital and other needs for the foreseeable future. Our share of net income of equity companies was positively impacted by organic sales growth and cost savings, demonstrating the importance of leveraging our IT capabilities and resources to enhance firm performance. The analysis of consolidated results indicates that net sales were influenced by changes in foreign currency exchange rates and exited businesses, which highlights the need for effective information management and data analytics to respond to market dynamics. The adjustments in our financial measures, including non-GAAP financial measures, provide additional insight into our underlying results and trends, which are critical for evaluating management's performance and strategic decisions. Our focus on operational efficiency and the integration of technology capabilities into our business processes is essential for maintaining competitive advantage and responding to consumer demands in a rapidly changing business environment. The challenges associated with regulatory context and market restructuring require us to continuously adapt our strategies and enhance our organizational capabilities to achieve performance excellence and value creation.

The management and franchise segment provides services, including hotel management and licensing of our brands, generating revenue from management and franchise fees charged to third-party hotel owners, licensing fees from strategic partnerships for the right to use certain Hilton marks and IP, and fees for managing owned and leased hotels. This segment's operations rely on effective information technology services, including our reservation system, marketing, and information technology services, which are critical for maintaining competitive advantage and supporting business needs. The success and sustainability of our management and franchise business depend on our ability to perform under management and franchise contracts and maintain good relationships with third-party owners and franchisees, which generate new incremental opportunities for property development that can support our growth. Our investment policy focuses on maximizing the return on new and existing investments and returning available capital to stockholders through dividends and share repurchases, with long-term liquidity requirements including corporate capital and information technology expenditures. The increase in depreciation and amortization expense was primarily due to an increase in amortization expense related to capitalized software costs placed into service, reflecting our commitment to enhancing our technology resources. Additionally, cash used for investing activities included capitalized software costs related to various systems initiatives benefiting both hotel owners and corporate operations. We evaluate the economic viability of properties based on geographic location and other factors, which underscores the importance of mobilizing and deploying IT-based resources in combination with leveraging the value of other resources and capabilities. Our relationships with third-party owners, franchisees, and developers are essential for the growth and maintenance of our hotel system, and we believe that we have good relationships with these stakeholders. The effectiveness of our cost-cutting efforts related to owning and leasing hotels or corporate operations is limited by inherent fixed costs, yet we continue to optimize our customers' experience and the value of our hotels and brands through strategic resource allocation. The hospitality industry is sensitive to business and personal discretionary spending levels, and declines in consumer demand due to adverse economic conditions can lower management and franchise fee revenues, highlighting the need for operational flexibility and market responsiveness. Our cash management policy aims to maintain existing leverage levels and liquidity availability while minimizing operational costs, ensuring that we can meet anticipated requirements for operating expenditures, including technology infrastructure. The digital transformation initiatives and the deployment of IT systems are integral to our business strategy, enhancing our operational efficiency and supporting our organizational goals. The ability to provide data and information to users with appropriate levels of accuracy, timeliness, reliability, security, and access is crucial for meeting changing business needs and directions, reinforcing the strategic alignment of our IT capabilities with overall business objectives.

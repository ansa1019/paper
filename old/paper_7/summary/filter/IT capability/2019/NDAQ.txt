The following discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations of Nasdaq should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included in this Form 10-K. The comparability of our results of operations between reported periods is impacted by our acquisition of Cinnober in January 2019, which has implications for our technology capabilities and market technology revenues. Market technology revenues increased in 2019 compared with 2018 primarily due to the inclusion of revenues associated with the acquisition of Cinnober, an increase in the size and number of software delivery projects, and higher SaaS surveillance revenues. These developments reflect our strategic focus on enhancing our IT capabilities to support business needs and improve operational efficiency. Our financial performance metrics, including annualized revenue run rate (ARR), are critical for assessing the health and trajectory of our business, highlighting the importance of IT capabilities in driving market-based performance.

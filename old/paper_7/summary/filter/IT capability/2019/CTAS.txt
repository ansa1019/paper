Cintas helps more than one million businesses of all types and sizes by providing a wide range of products and services that enhance customers' image and help keep their facilities and employees clean, safe, and looking their best. The company’s principal objective is to exceed customers' expectations to maximize long-term value for shareholders and working partners, which provides the framework for Cintas' business strategy. This strategy includes achieving revenue growth by increasing penetration at existing customers and broadening the customer base to include previously unserved segments. Cintas has a highly talented and diverse team of service professionals who regularly visit customers, enabling the development of close personal relationships. The combination of the distribution system and strong customer relationships provides a platform for launching additional products and services. Cintas evaluates operating segment performance based on revenue and income before income taxes and regularly reviews its operating segments for reporting purposes based on information used by the chief operating decision maker for resource allocation and performance assessment. The company completed the acquisition of G&K Services, Inc., which operates within the uniform rental and facility services segment, and evaluates strategic acquisitions as opportunities arise. The financial accounting standards board issued guidance intended to improve disclosure requirements and enhance comparability of revenue recognition practices, which Cintas adopted effective June 1, 2018. Revenue growth was driven by new business, the penetration of additional products and services into existing customers, and price increases, partially offset by lost business. Sales productivity improvements are attributed to increased tenure and improved training of sales representatives, resulting in a higher number of products and services sold. Selling and administrative expenses increased due to the acquisition of G&K and investments in a new enterprise resource planning system, which reflects the company's commitment to enhancing operational efficiency and supporting business needs. The company’s cash flows from operating activities have historically supplied significant liquidity, which is utilized for operations, expansion activities, and dividends. Cintas' access to commercial paper and long-term debt markets has historically provided sources of liquidity, and the company does not anticipate difficulty in obtaining financing in the future. The company has implemented a new lease system in connection with the adoption of updated accounting standards, which will recognize lease assets and liabilities on the balance sheet. The company plans to elect practical expedients that allow it to carry forward existing leases and classify them without significant changes. Cintas is also evaluating the impact of new accounting standards on its consolidated financial statements, including those related to credit losses and revenue recognition. The preparation of consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that significantly affect reported amounts, particularly in areas such as revenue recognition, goodwill impairment, and service contracts. The company’s ability to continue accessing favorable financing terms will depend on credit ratings assigned by agencies, which could be adversely affected by significant changes in ratings.

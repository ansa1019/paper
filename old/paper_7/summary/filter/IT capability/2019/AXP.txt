We are a globally integrated payments company with three reportable operating segments: global consumer services group (gcsg), global commercial services (gcs), and global merchant and network services (gmns). Our strategy of investing in share, scale, and relevance demonstrates our success in executing against our four strategic imperatives, which include investing in new services and card member benefits, refreshing and launching new products, and expanding our merchant network. We continued to see attractive growth opportunities across our businesses and plan to invest to take advantage of them in order to generate and sustain a strong level of revenue growth. The management reporting process allocates revenue and expense using various methodologies, including the allocation of technology costs based on support service activities directly attributable to the segment. Our global merchant and network services segment operates a global payments network that processes and settles card transactions, acquires merchants, and provides multi-channel marketing programs and capabilities, services, and data analytics, leveraging our global integrated network. The increase in marketing and business development expenses was primarily due to higher cobrand partner payments and increased corporate client incentives driven by higher volumes, reflecting our commitment to enhancing the value of our premium products to drive higher customer engagement. Our information security program and operating model are designed to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information and information systems from unauthorized access, use, disclosure, disruption, modification, or destruction. We have implemented a comprehensive operational risk framework that identifies, measures, monitors, and reports inherent and emerging operational risks, which includes the assessment of operational risk events to determine root causes and impacts. The risk management governance structure includes oversight from our board of directors through various committees, ensuring that risk management processes, controls, and capabilities are effectively implemented. Our enterprise data governance framework defines governance requirements for data used in critical processes, supporting our information management capability. Our technology investments are aimed at enhancing operational efficiency and supporting strategic resource allocation across our business segments. We continue to focus on delivering differentiated value to our merchants, card members, and business partners while managing the challenges posed by economic and geopolitical uncertainty, regulation, and intense competition. The effective management of our IT capabilities is crucial in transforming our firm into a competitive force, ensuring that we can adapt to changing market dynamics and consumer demands. Our operational flexibility and strategic alignment with business needs enable us to leverage IT resources effectively, enhancing our organizational capabilities and supporting our overall business strategy.

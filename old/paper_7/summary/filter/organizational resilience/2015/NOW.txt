Servicenow is a leading provider of enterprise cloud computing solutions that define, structure, manage, and automate services across the global enterprise. Our mission is to help the modern enterprise operate faster and be more scalable by applying a service-oriented lens to the activities, tasks, and processes that comprise day-to-day work life. We continue to invest in the development of our services, infrastructure, and sales and marketing to drive long-term growth. Our solutions empower enterprises to change the way people work, reflecting our commitment to operational flexibility and adaptability in the face of market demands. The increase in our overall employee headcount to 3,686 as of December 31, 2015, from 2,826 as of December 31, 2014, demonstrates our resource allocation strategy aimed at enhancing organizational capabilities and resilience. We calculate our renewal rate by subtracting our attrition rate from 100%, with our renewal rates being 98%, 97%, and 96% for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively, indicating strong customer retention and organizational health. Our upsell rate, which is crucial for generating additional sales from existing customers, was 38%, 43%, and 39% for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively, reflecting our ability to adapt and respond to customer needs effectively. The total enterprise customer count was approximately 3,000, 2,300, and 1,800 as of December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively, showcasing our growth trajectory and market penetration. Our international operations provide a significant portion of our total revenues, and we anticipate that our current cash and cash equivalents balance and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to meet our liquidity needs, including the expansion of data centers and investments in office facilities to accommodate growth for at least the next 12 months. We recognize that our expanding international operations will continue to increase our exposure to currency risks, and we are conducting an ongoing evaluation of the costs and benefits of initiating a hedging program. Our strategic initiatives include enhancing our core platform and developing new applications to fill market needs, which are essential for maintaining performance under pressure and ensuring organizational resilience. We expect our subscription revenues to grow in absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenues, driven by our upsells, renewals, and an increase in our customer count. The general strengthening of the U.S. dollar relative to other major foreign currencies had an unfavorable impact on our revenues, emphasizing the need for effective risk management strategies. Our commitment to learning organization principles and knowledge management practices supports our ability to foresee and confront sudden disruptive changes, ensuring our organizational survival and success in turbulent markets. We continue to focus on investing in the long-term growth of our business, which is critical for sustaining our competitive advantage and operational continuity in a dynamic business environment.

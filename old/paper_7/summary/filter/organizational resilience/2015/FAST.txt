The decrease in our fastener sales as a percentage of total sales has been driven by the continued success of our non-fastener product lines and by the growth of our industrial vending program. This program has led to greater resilience to weak industrial production of our non-fastener business compared to our fastener business. The non-fastener business demonstrated greater relative resilience over the last several years, due to our strong industrial vending program. However, this business was not immune to the impact of a weak industrial environment. Our short-term gross profit percentages historically fluctuate due to impacts related to transactional gross profit, organizational gross profit, and supplier incentive gross profit. In the short-term, periods of inflation or deflation can influence the first two categories, while sudden changes in business volume can influence the third. The transactional gross profit, our most meaningful component, is heavily influenced by our store-based compensation programs, which are directly linked to sales growth and gross profit, and incentivize our employees to improve both.

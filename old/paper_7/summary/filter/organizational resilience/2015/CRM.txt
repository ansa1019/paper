We are a leading provider of enterprise cloud computing solutions, focusing on customer relationship management, with a mission to help our customers transform into customer-centric companies by empowering them to connect with their customers in new ways. Our strategy includes strengthening market-leading solutions, expanding strategic relationships, and encouraging the development of third-party applications on our platforms. We believe that factors influencing our ability to achieve objectives include the performance and security of our service, successful customer adoption, and the emergence of competitors. To address these factors, we need to add substantial numbers of paying subscriptions, provide high-quality technical support, and focus on retaining customers at renewal. Our plans for future growth include expanding data center capacity, hiring additional personnel, and developing new services. We regularly evaluate acquisitions or investment opportunities to expand our service offerings. Our aggressive growth plans have incurred significant expenses, resulting in net losses on a GAAP basis, but we remain focused on improving operating margins. We expect our attrition rate to remain favorable as we continue to invest in customer success programs. Our operating segments are evaluated on a consolidated basis, and we derive revenues primarily from subscription fees and related professional services. We recognize subscription and support revenues ratably over contract terms, and our typical contract length is between 12 and 36 months. We have increased our headcount significantly to meet higher demand for services, which facilitates the adoption of our offerings. Our research and development efforts focus on adding new features and services and integrating acquired technologies, which we expect to increase in absolute dollars as we invest in technology to support development. Marketing and sales expenses are our largest cost, and we plan to continue investing in these areas to build brand awareness and attract new customers. We have made significant investments in our infrastructure to scale operations and increase productivity, and we plan to continue these investments. Our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities provide sufficient liquidity to meet our working capital and capital expenditure needs. We regularly assess the realizability of our deferred tax assets and establish a valuation allowance when necessary. Our non-GAAP financial measures provide additional views of operational performance by excluding expenses not directly related to performance in any particular period. We believe that these measures reflect our ongoing business in a manner that allows for meaningful comparisons and analysis of trends. We expect to continue to make additional investments in our infrastructure to scale operations and increase productivity, and we may seek additional equity or debt financing in the future.

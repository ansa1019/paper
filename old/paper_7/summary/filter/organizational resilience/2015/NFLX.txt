The increase in technology and development expenses was primarily due to a significant growth in average headcount supporting continued improvements in our streaming service and our international expansion, reflecting our adaptability to market demands and operational flexibility. We have demonstrated our ability to grow domestic streaming contribution margin, indicating resilience in our operational performance despite external pressures. Our international revenues increased due to substantial growth in the average number of paid international memberships, showcasing our capacity to absorb strain and preserve functioning under challenging conditions. The increase in international cost of revenues was primarily due to a significant rise in content expenses, which relates to our strategic initiatives for global expansion and the acquisition of exclusive and original programming. We believe international revenues would have been higher if foreign exchange rates had remained consistent, highlighting the impact of external disturbances on our financial performance. The increase in marketing expenses, particularly in our international streaming segment, reflects our proactive measures to build consumer awareness and support our expansion efforts. The significant net cash used in operations is due primarily to increased investments in streaming content, which require more upfront payments, demonstrating our resource allocation strategies in response to market opportunities. Our ability to obtain additional financing will depend on our development efforts and operating performance, indicating a need for strategic foresight in managing financial resources. The contractual obligations for streaming content obligations increased significantly, reflecting our commitment to expanding our content library and maintaining competitive advantage through strategic resource deployment. The increase in domestic streaming revenues was driven by growth in paid memberships and revenue, which continued to outpace content and marketing spending, demonstrating operational resilience. Our focus on building consumer awareness of our streaming offerings, particularly original content, is indicative of our organizational practices aimed at sustaining growth and performance under pressure. The increase in international contribution losses was a result of increased spending for our international expansion, emphasizing the complexities and risks associated with entering new markets. We expect to significantly increase our investments in global streaming content, particularly in original content, which could impact our liquidity and result in future negative free cash flows, indicating a need for careful resource management. Our operational continuity is supported by our investments in technology and development, which are essential for maintaining service quality and adapting to changing consumer preferences. The increase in personnel-related costs in general and administrative expenses reflects our commitment to enhancing organizational capabilities to support our growth initiatives. Overall, our strategic response to market changes and our focus on innovation and service delivery are critical components of our organizational resilience, enabling us to confront and benefit from sudden disruptive changes in the business environment.

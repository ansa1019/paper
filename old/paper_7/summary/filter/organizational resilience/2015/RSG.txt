In January 2016, we realigned our field support functions by combining two organizational layers into one, which includes the elimination of our three regions, the consolidation of our 20 areas into 10, and the streamlining of select roles at our Phoenix headquarters. We will reinvest and deploy resources into our areas by creating 10 area offices equipped with enhanced teams of operators and functional support roles. We expect to reduce administrative staffing levels, relocate office space, and close certain office locations. As such, we will incur restructuring charges of approximately $25 million primarily for severance benefits, transition costs, and lease termination costs. Substantially all of these charges will be recorded in our corporate segment, and we expect the majority of the charges to be incurred in the first half of 2016. We expect the savings realized from these restructuring efforts will be reinvested in our customer-focused programs and other initiatives we recently launched. In connection with our restructuring, we will further evaluate our 2016 reporting segments. We have considered the implications of our restructuring on our reporting units used to measure for goodwill impairment, and we have noted no indicators of goodwill impairment. This restructuring reflects our strategic response to enhance operational flexibility and resource allocation, aiming to maintain performance under pressure and adapt to external pressures. The consolidation of our organizational structure is intended to improve our operational management and resilience, allowing us to better confront future challenges and disruptions. By streamlining our operations and reallocating resources, we are positioning ourselves to enhance our organizational effectiveness and ensure continuity in our service delivery, thereby supporting our long-term objectives and competitive advantage in a turbulent market environment.

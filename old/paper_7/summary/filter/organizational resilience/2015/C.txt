Citi's full year 2015 results reflected a solid overall performance, with net income of $17.1 billion, its highest since the pre-financial crisis. The company was able to grow revenues by 3% and make investments in its core Citicorp businesses while reducing overall expenses, thus improving its efficiency ratio. Citi maintained disciplined expense management during 2015, even as it absorbed increased regulatory and compliance costs in Citicorp and made ongoing business investments. The efficient resource allocation and disciplined expense management were further aided by lower legal and related expenses and lower repositioning expenses in Citicorp compared to the prior year. Despite market volatility and uncertainties, including macroeconomic uncertainties and slower global growth, Citi executed its priorities effectively. The company expects the operating environment in 2016 to remain challenging, with many uncertainties continuing to impact its results. Citi intends to build on the progress made during 2015 by remaining focused on execution priorities and target client strategies. Citicorp's net income increased 50% from the prior year, driven by lower expenses and lower net credit losses. Citicorp's revenues decreased 1% from the prior year, reflecting largely unchanged revenues in the Institutional Clients Group (ICG) and a decrease in global consumer banking revenues. The overall strategy of Citicorp is to leverage its global footprint and seek to be the preeminent bank for emerging affluent and affluent consumers in large urban centers, which reflects a focus on organizational resilience through adaptation and resource allocation. The company has exited or is in the process of exiting 20 consumer markets to concentrate its resources effectively. Citi Holdings' net income was $1.0 billion in 2015, compared to a net loss of $3.5 billion in the prior year, primarily reflecting lower expenses and lower credit costs. The overall wind-down of Citi Holdings' portfolio and the impact of redemptions of high-cost debt were significant factors in its performance. The companyâ€™s ability to maintain profitability during challenging conditions demonstrates its organizational resilience. Citi's capital ratios improved, with a common equity tier 1 capital ratio of 12.1% as of December 31, 2015, reflecting a strong foundation for future resilience strategies. The company anticipates that its credit costs will likely be higher in 2016, indicating a need for ongoing risk assessment and management. The focus on operational flexibility and strategic initiatives is evident in Citi's approach to navigating external pressures and maintaining organizational health. The company's performance under pressure and its ability to adapt to environmental disruptions are key components of its resilience framework, ensuring it can confront future challenges effectively.

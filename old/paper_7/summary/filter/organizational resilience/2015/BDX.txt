Becton, Dickinson and Company ("BD") continues to invest in research and development, geographic expansion, and new product promotions to drive further revenue and profit growth. Our ability to sustain long-term growth will depend on several factors, including our ability to expand our core business, develop innovative new products, and continue to improve operating efficiency and organizational effectiveness, including the integration of CareFusion. While the economic environment for the healthcare industry has stabilized, pricing pressures continue for some of our products. Healthcare utilization has stabilized and slightly improved in the United States; however, any destabilization in the future could adversely impact our U.S. businesses. Additionally, macroeconomic challenges in Europe continue to constrain healthcare utilization. The organizational structure was realigned to better complement our customer-focused solutions strategy, which reflects a strategic initiative aimed at enhancing operational flexibility and resilience in response to external pressures. The acquisition of CareFusion is part of our strategy to create a global leader in medication management and patient safety solutions, which aligns with our objectives to adapt to disruptive events and maintain organizational health. The realignment of BD's organizational structure from a three-segment to a two-segment structure demonstrates our commitment to reconfiguring our operational capabilities to better respond to market demands and enhance our competitive advantage. Our reporting units were reassessed upon the realignment and acquisition, ensuring that we maintain performance integrity and address any potential impairments effectively. The focus on organizational effectiveness and the integration of CareFusion reflects our proactive measures to enhance resilience and adaptability in a complex and evolving healthcare landscape. We are committed to ensuring that our organizational practices support our long-term objectives and enable us to confront and benefit from sudden disruptive changes, thereby fostering a culture of resilience and continuous improvement.

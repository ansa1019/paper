In 2015, FIS finalized a reorganization and began reporting its financial performance based on three segments: integrated financial solutions ("IFS"), global financial solutions ("GFS"), and corporate and other. With the acquisition and integration of SunGard, another assessment of organizational structure and how best to allocate resources and analyze performance is underway that may result in a change in our reportable segments in 2016. SunGard is included within the GFS segment following the November 30, 2015 acquisition, as its economic characteristics, international business model, and various other factors are largely aligned with those of GFS. This reorganization reflects an adaptation strategy to enhance operational flexibility and resource allocation in response to changing market conditions. The assessment of organizational structure aims to improve performance maintenance and resilience by ensuring that resources are deployed effectively to confront external pressures and support business continuity. A description of these segments is included in note 18 of the notes to consolidated financial statements. Revenues by segment and the results of operations of our segments are discussed below in segment results of operations.

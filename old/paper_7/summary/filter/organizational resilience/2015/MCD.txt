The strength of the alignment among the company, its franchisees, and suppliers has been key to McDonald's long-term success, enabling the identification, implementation, and scaling of ideas that meet customers' changing needs and preferences. The company's business model allows for consistent delivery of locally relevant restaurant experiences and integration within the communities it serves. In 2015, McDonald's initiated a turnaround plan, which included a restructuring to enhance operational flexibility and drive greater accountability. This new operating structure is designed to enable faster decision-making and improve the ability to move proven initiatives quickly across markets. The system focuses on the fundamentals of running great restaurants, emphasizing hot and fresh food, fast and friendly service, and a contemporary restaurant experience. The company is building on its competitive advantages of convenience, scale, geographic diversification, and system alignment. The priorities of the turnaround plan include driving operational growth, creating brand excitement, and enhancing financial value. Enhancements to the quality of the menu, local sourcing of ingredients, and sustainability commitments are aimed at improving consumer confidence in the brand. The company is optimizing its restaurant ownership mix by refranchising approximately 4,000 restaurants through 2018, which is expected to generate more stable and predictable revenue streams. This shift to a greater percentage of franchised restaurants is anticipated to enhance the company's operational resilience by reducing capital intensity and allowing franchisees to invest in their businesses. McDonald's maintains a strong financial foundation supported by industry-leading unit volumes, enabling growth through business cycles while returning significant cash to shareholders. The company's substantial cash flow and strong credit rating provide flexibility to fund capital expenditures and return cash to shareholders. The management's proactive measures in optimizing capital structure and increasing cash returns to shareholders reflect confidence in the company's future. The company continually reviews its mix of company-operated and franchised restaurants to optimize overall performance, with a long-term goal of being 95% franchised. McDonald's is committed to elevating every aspect of the customer experience while navigating challenges in larger markets. The system is focused on enhancing operational management, strategic adaptation, and resilience strategies to confront external pressures and ensure organizational survival. The company's ability to absorb strain and maintain performance under adverse conditions is reflected in its strategic initiatives and response mechanisms, which are designed to foster organizational health and effectiveness.

This annual report includes forward-looking statements reflecting management's current expectations and the inherent uncertainties associated with them. We focus on improving all aspects of the customer experience, including lowering prices, improving availability, offering faster delivery and performance times, increasing selection, and earning customer trust, which are critical for maintaining operational flexibility and adaptability in a competitive landscape. Our financial focus is on long-term, sustainable growth in free cash flows, driven primarily by increasing operating income and efficiently managing working capital and cash capital expenditures. We seek to reduce our variable costs per unit and work to leverage our fixed costs, which are essential for maintaining performance under pressure. We continually evaluate opportunities to sell additional equity or debt securities, obtain credit facilities, and finance arrangements to strengthen our financial position and ensure operational continuity. Our investments in technology and content are aimed at enhancing the customer experience and improving process efficiencies, which are vital for organizational resilience. We believe that advances in technology will continue to improve the consumer experience and increase its ubiquity in people's lives, thus supporting our strategic initiatives. The increase in operating cash flow is primarily due to the increase in net income, excluding non-cash charges, and changes in working capital, highlighting our ability to absorb strain and maintain functioning despite external pressures. We expect variability in inventory turnover over time, which is influenced by several factors, including our product mix and investment in new geographies and product lines. Our technology and content investments support a variety of product and service offerings due to geographic expansion and the cross-functionality of our systems and operations. We seek to invest efficiently in technology infrastructure to enhance customer experience and improve process efficiencies, which are critical for organizational effectiveness. We regularly evaluate our facility requirements and seek to expand our fulfillment capacity to accommodate greater selection and in-stock inventory levels. The increase in fulfillment costs is primarily due to variable costs corresponding with increased sales volume and payment processing costs, which we aim to mitigate through operational efficiencies. Our marketing expenses are largely variable and are influenced by competition and changes in traffic sources, which are essential for maintaining competitive advantage. We believe that offering low prices to our customers is fundamental to our future success, and we intend to continue offering shipping offers as effective marketing tools. Our effective tax rate is subject to significant variation due to several factors, including changes in how we do business and audit-related developments, which could impact our organizational health. We have recorded valuation allowances against deferred tax assets associated with losses for which we may not realize a related tax benefit, reflecting our proactive measures in risk management. The increase in technology and content costs is primarily due to spending on technology infrastructure and payroll related to expanding our products and services, which are essential for maintaining organizational agility and resilience.

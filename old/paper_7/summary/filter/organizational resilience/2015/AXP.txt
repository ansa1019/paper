We are a global services company that provides our customers with access to products, insights, and experiences that enrich lives and build business success. Our performance in 2015 reflected both the strength of our business and the headwinds we have been managing throughout the year. Our results were challenged by several factors, including increasing competition from non-traditional players that leverage new technologies and customers' existing accounts and relationships. The economic, regulatory, and competitive environments all became even more challenging as the year progressed. We have launched cost initiatives designed to remove $1 billion from our overall cost base by the end of 2017, which reflects our commitment to operational flexibility and adaptability in response to external pressures. Our capital position allowed us to return over $5 billion to our shareholders, reflecting our ongoing commitment to using our capital strength to create value. We expect to see strong growth in loans held for investment in 2016, and we continue to believe there are opportunities to increase our share of lending without significantly changing our overall risk profile. The combination of our strategic initiatives and disciplined operating expense control has contributed to our organizational health and resilience. We have developed a trajectory model of organizational resilience that focuses on how we project temporal trajectories of responses toward disruptive events and reconfigure these trajectories toward the ensuing future. Our risk management governance includes a comprehensive enterprise-wide risk management program to identify, aggregate, monitor, and manage risks, which is essential for maintaining our organizational resilience. The implementation and execution of this program are overseen by our chief risk officer, ensuring that we maintain our integrity and performance under challenging conditions. We seek to maintain access to a diverse set of on- and off-balance sheet liquidity sources to meet our expected future financing obligations and business requirements for at least a 12-month period, even in the event we are unable to raise new funds during a substantial weakening in economic conditions. Our funding strategy includes maintaining a solid and flexible equity capital profile and a broad, deep, and diverse set of funding sources. We have established clear objectives for liquidity risk management, including compliance with regulatory requirements, which supports our resilience strategies. Our operational risk management process defines operational risk as the risk of not achieving business objectives due to inadequate or failed processes, people, or information systems. We have implemented a comprehensive operational risk framework to identify, measure, monitor, and report inherent and emerging operational risks, which is crucial for our organizational effectiveness and adaptability. We continuously assess our operational capabilities and make necessary adjustments to ensure we can confront and recover from unexpected situations and environmental disruptions. Our strategic response to the evolving business environment reflects our commitment to organizational resilience, enabling us to maintain positive adjustment under challenging conditions.

We are a global media and technology company with two primary businesses, Comcast Cable and NBCUniversal. Our cable communications segment generates revenue primarily from residential and business customers subscribing to our cable services, which we market individually and as bundled services. We are actively deploying x1 set-top boxes and cloud DVR technology to improve service delivery and customer experience. Our cable communications segment offers a broad variety of video service packages and high-speed internet services, with ongoing investments in network infrastructure to increase capacity and enhance operational flexibility. We continue to expand our network of residential, outdoor, and business Wi-Fi hotspots, allowing customers to access high-speed internet services in various environments, which supports our resilience strategies in adapting to customer needs. Our business services segment has seen significant growth, primarily due to our efforts to gain market share from competitors by offering competitive services and pricing. 

The results of our operations are affected by competition, as all of our businesses operate in intensely competitive, consumer-driven environments. We expect that our programming expenses will continue to increase, which may negatively impact our operating margin. We will attempt to mitigate increases in operating costs and expenses by growing revenue, particularly in our high-speed internet, video, and business services. Our consolidated revenue in 2015 included significant contributions from various segments, reflecting our ability to adapt and respond effectively to environmental disruptions and changes in consumer behavior. 

Our operations are subject to seasonal and cyclical variations, impacting customer acquisition and advertising revenue. We recognize the importance of strategic initiatives and resource allocation to maintain performance under pressure. Our investments in customer experience improvements, including hiring additional personnel and developing technology tools, are aimed at enhancing organizational effectiveness and resilience. 

The acquisition of a 51% interest in Universal Studios Japan and the development of a theme park in China are part of our strategy to expand our operational footprint and enhance our competitive advantage. We believe that adding more content and delivering it through various platforms will help us attract and retain customers, thereby improving organizational health and sustainability. 

Our liquidity and capital resources are supported by significant cash flows from operating activities, which we believe will enable us to meet our current and long-term obligations. We maintain significant availability under our lines of credit to meet short-term liquidity requirements. Our commitment to invest in growth-oriented companies through strategic partnerships reflects our proactive measures in navigating complex situations and ensuring future-oriented resilience. 

We continue to assess our operational strategies and performance metrics to adapt to the evolving business environment, ensuring that we remain agile and responsive to both internal and external pressures. Our focus on innovation, resource management, and strategic foresight positions us to confront challenges and leverage opportunities for organizational success.

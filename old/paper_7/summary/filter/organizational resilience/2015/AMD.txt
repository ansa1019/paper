We faced a challenging business environment in 2015, with the impact of global macro-economic conditions contributing to a decrease in demand for our products. Competitive pressures and reduced demand from our original equipment manufacturers customers further complicated our operational landscape. Despite these challenges, we made important changes to our business, focusing on introducing a more diverse product portfolio as part of our long-term strategy to deliver great products. We implemented a restructuring plan aimed at simplifying our business and better aligning resources around our priorities and business outlook, which included a workforce reduction and outsourcing certain IT services. This restructuring plan is expected to yield operational savings and enhance our organizational flexibility. We also continued to focus on reducing our expenses, which decreased significantly compared to previous years. Our operational management strategies involved realigning our organizational structure into reportable segments to better assess performance and respond to market demands. The enterprise, embedded, and semi-custom segment experienced a decline in revenue due to increased competitive pressures and lower unit shipments, highlighting the need for adaptability in our operational strategies. The restructuring actions taken were aimed at improving our operational effectiveness and ensuring we could maintain performance under pressure. Our cash and cash equivalents, while lower than the previous year, are believed to be sufficient to fund operations over the next 12 months, demonstrating our commitment to maintaining organizational health amid adversity. We recognize that uncertain global economic conditions may adversely impact our business in the future, necessitating ongoing risk assessment and strategic response mechanisms to ensure resilience. The formation of joint ventures and strategic partnerships is part of our approach to enhance our operational capabilities and resource generation. We anticipate that these collaborative networks will support our recovery and adaptation strategies in the face of environmental disruptions. Our focus on innovation and the introduction of new products is essential for maintaining competitive advantage and ensuring long-term organizational success. We are committed to learning from past experiences and implementing changes that enhance our organizational resilience, allowing us to confront future challenges effectively. The ongoing assessment of our operational resources and strategic initiatives will be critical in navigating the complexities of the current business environment and achieving our major objectives.

Stryker Corporation is committed to internal innovation to develop products and services that improve outcomes and deliver greater cost savings and efficiencies. Our success depends on the ability of our people to execute effectively, every day. We believe our success in the highly competitive product categories in which we operate depends on our ability to develop new products and make improvements to existing products. We express this through our mission statement: "together with our customers, we are driven to make healthcare better." The increase in consolidated net sales was led primarily by higher product shipments of neurotechnology, trauma and extremities, medical and instruments, reflecting our operational flexibility and adaptability to market demands. Our capital allocation strategy prioritizes investments that enhance our organizational health and resilience, including acquisitions that complement our portfolio of businesses. We have a strong business results and a global cash management strategy that takes into account liquidity management, economic factors, and tax considerations, which supports our operational continuity. We anticipate being able to support our short-term liquidity and operating needs, including recall-related payments, from a variety of sources, including cash from operations and existing credit lines. Our ability to generate substantial cash from operations is indicative of our organizational effectiveness and resilience. We continually evaluate our receivables, particularly in regions with economic challenges, and believe that our current reserves related to receivables are adequate. The outcomes of various ongoing legal proceedings and claims may not be known for prolonged periods of time, and if actual outcomes are less favorable than projected, additional expenses may be incurred, which could unfavorably affect future operating results. We maintain a focus on strategic initiatives that enhance our resilience and ability to confront external pressures. Our investments in research, development, and engineering reflect our commitment to innovation and adaptability in response to changing market conditions. The strategic response to environmental disruptions is evident in our operational management practices, which emphasize flexibility and resource allocation to meet customer needs. We have established mechanisms for crisis management and preparedness to ensure organizational survival and performance maintenance under pressure. The integration of acquired businesses and the ongoing assessment of our operational resources are critical to our resilience strategies. Our approach to managing risks associated with product recalls and legal matters demonstrates our commitment to maintaining organizational integrity and performance amidst adversity. We believe that our ability to foresee and adapt to complex situations will allow us to thrive in turbulent markets and achieve our major objectives. Our focus on collaboration networks and inter-organizational collaboration enhances our organizational strength and capacity for recovery from disruptive events. The emphasis on learning organization principles and knowledge management supports our ongoing evolution and strategic foresight, positioning us to benefit from future opportunities and challenges in the healthcare landscape.

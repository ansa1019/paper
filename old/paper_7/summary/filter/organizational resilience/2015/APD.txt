Effective 1 October 2014, we began operating under a new organizational structure that is aligned with the regional nature of the industrial gases business. We began reporting our results under the following seven new segments: industrial gases – americas, industrial gases – emea (europe, middle east, and africa), industrial gases – asia, industrial gases – global, materials technologies, energy-from-waste, and corporate and other. The financial statements and analysis that follow discuss our results based on these operations. Prior year segment information has been restated to conform with the fiscal year 2015 presentation. Business realignment and reorganization on 18 September 2014, we announced plans to reorganize the company, including realignment of our businesses in new reporting segments and other organizational changes, effective as of 1 October 2014, which resulted in the largest transformational change in the history of the company. As a result of this reorganization, we have incurred ongoing severance and other charges. The transformational change reflects our ability to adapt to new market conditions and reconfigure our operational structure to enhance resilience against external pressures and disruptions. This strategic initiative aims to maintain organizational effectiveness and performance under varying conditions, thus ensuring our capacity to respond effectively to environmental disruptions and sustain operational continuity. The reorganization is a proactive measure to bolster our organizational strength and enhance our competitive advantage in a turbulent market environment. The adjustments made are intended to facilitate better resource allocation and operational flexibility, allowing us to confront challenges and capitalize on opportunities for growth. By implementing these changes, we aim to improve our organizational coherence and resilience, ensuring that we can navigate through adverse situations while maintaining a focus on our major objectives and long-term sustainability. The ongoing evaluation of our organizational dynamics and the integration of strategic tools will support our efforts in fostering a culture of adaptability and innovation, which are essential for thriving in complex and unpredictable business landscapes.

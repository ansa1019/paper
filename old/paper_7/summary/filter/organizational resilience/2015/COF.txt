The results of our individual businesses reflect the manner in which management evaluates performance and makes decisions about funding our operations and allocating resources. We may periodically change our business segments or reclassify business segment results based on modifications to our management reporting methodologies and changes in organizational alignment. Our internal management and reporting process employs various allocation methodologies to assign certain balance sheet assets, deposits, and other liabilities and their related revenue and expenses directly or indirectly attributable to each business segment. The underwriting criteria are customized for individual products and marketing programs and based on analysis of net present value of expected revenues, expenses, and losses, subject to maintaining resilience under a variety of stress conditions. We regularly assess the assumptions, methodologies, and reporting classifications used for segment reporting, which may result in the implementation of refinements or changes in future periods. Our funds transfer pricing process provides a funds credit for sources of funds, such as deposits generated by our consumer banking and commercial banking businesses, and a funds charge for the use of funds by each segment. The allocation process is unique to each business segment and acquired businesses. We generally retain all of our auto loans, though we have securitized and sold auto loans in the past and may do so in the future.

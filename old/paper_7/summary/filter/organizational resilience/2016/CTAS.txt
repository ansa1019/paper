Cintas regularly reviews its operating segments for reporting purposes based on the information its chief operating decision maker regularly reviews for purposes of allocating resources and assessing performance and makes changes when appropriate. As a result of a recent evaluation, effective June 1, 2015, Cintas realigned its organizational structure and updated its reportable operating segments in light of certain changes in its business including the acquisition of Zee in the first quarter of fiscal 2016. The company evaluates operating segment performance based on revenue and income before income taxes, which reflects the organization’s ability to adapt to changes and maintain operational effectiveness. The updated reportable operating segments include uniform rental and facility services and first aid and safety services, indicating a strategic response to evolving customer needs and market conditions. The uniform rental and facility services segment consists of the rental and servicing of uniforms and other garments, restroom cleaning services, and the sale of items from catalogs to customers on route, demonstrating resource allocation towards maintaining service innovation and operational continuity. The first aid and safety services segment consists of first aid and safety products and services, which contributes to the company’s resilience by addressing external pressures and enhancing organizational capabilities. The remainder of Cintas' business, primarily fire protection services and its direct sale business, is included in all other, suggesting a multifaceted approach to managing diverse operational demands. All prior fiscal year results presented have been recast to reflect these new reportable operating segments, highlighting the importance of adaptability in organizational change processes. Cintas' strategic initiatives and operational flexibility are essential for navigating environmental disruptions and ensuring performance maintenance under varying conditions. The company’s ability to reconfigure its operational structure in response to disruptive events aligns with the concept of organizational resilience, emphasizing the importance of effective resource deployment and performance assessment in sustaining organizational health and success.

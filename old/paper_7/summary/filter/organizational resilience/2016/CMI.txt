Beginning with the second quarter of 2016, we realigned certain of our reportable segments to be consistent with changes to our organizational structure and how the chief operating decision maker monitors the performance of our segments. We reorganized our business to combine our power generation segment and our high-horsepower engine business to create the new power systems segment. The formation of the power systems segment combined two businesses that were already strongly interdependent, which will allow us to streamline business and technical processes to accelerate innovation, grow market share and more efficiently manage our supply chain and manufacturing operations. This reconfiguration is aimed at enhancing our operational flexibility and adaptability in response to external pressures and environmental disruptions. By integrating these segments, we are positioning ourselves to better confront disruptive events and maintain performance under pressure, thereby supporting our organizational resilience. The strategic initiative to consolidate these segments reflects our commitment to fostering organizational coherence and effectiveness, enabling us to respond effectively to challenges and capitalize on opportunities for growth. The changes implemented are designed to enhance our resource management and utilization, ensuring that we can absorb strain and preserve functioning despite the presence of adversity. This approach underscores our focus on maintaining a trajectory of positive adjustment under challenging conditions, thereby reinforcing our organizational health and sustainability in a turbulent market environment.

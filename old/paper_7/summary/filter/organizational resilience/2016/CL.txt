Implementing the company's shared service organizational model in all regions of the world extends shared business services and streamlines global functions. While initially focused on finance and accounting, these shared services are now being expanded to additional functional areas to streamline global functions. This initiative reflects an organizational response to enhance operational flexibility and adaptability in the face of external pressures and demands. By reconfiguring and optimizing resource allocation across various departments, the organization aims to maintain performance under pressure and ensure business continuity. The expansion of shared services can be viewed as a strategic initiative that fosters collaboration networks and inter-organizational collaboration, which are essential for navigating complex situations and environmental disruptions. This approach not only supports operational management but also contributes to the resilience strategies necessary for confronting unexpected situations and mitigating risks. The emphasis on streamlining global functions indicates a proactive measure to enhance organizational effectiveness and resource utilization, thereby improving the organization's ability to absorb strain and preserve functioning despite adversity. The focus on extending shared services aligns with the broader objective of fostering organizational health and ensuring that the organization can respond effectively to disruptive events. By enhancing its operational capabilities and fostering a culture of continuous improvement, the organization positions itself to benefit from sudden disruptive change, ultimately supporting its long-term survival and growth.

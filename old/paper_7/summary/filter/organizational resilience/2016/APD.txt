On 18 September 2014, we announced plans to reorganize the company, including realignment of our businesses in new reporting segments and other organizational changes, effective as of 1 October 2014, which at the time resulted in the largest transformational change in the history of the company. This reorganization reflects our ability to adapt to internal and external variations and disturbances, thereby maintaining organizational health and operational flexibility under challenging conditions. As a result of this reorganization, we incurred severance and other charges, which are part of our strategic response to ensure business continuity and resilience in the face of disruptive events. The changes implemented are indicative of our commitment to reconfiguring our organizational structure to enhance performance and address pressures in the business environment. This transformation aims to preserve or improve functioning despite the presence of adversity, demonstrating our capacity for positive adjustment and operational continuity. The reorganization is a critical step in our trajectory model of resilience, focusing on how we project responses toward disruptive events and reconstitute our operational strategies to emerge stronger from challenging situations.

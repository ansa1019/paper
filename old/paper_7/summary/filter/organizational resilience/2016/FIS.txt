In conjunction with the organizational modifications in the first quarter of 2016, we reallocated goodwill associated with the reclassified businesses based on relative fair values as of January 1, 2016. We refreshed our step zero qualitative analysis, identifying no indications of impairment for any of our reporting units. This process reflects our capacity to adapt and respond effectively to internal variations and external pressures, thereby maintaining operational continuity and organizational health. The reallocation of resources signifies an effort to enhance our resilience strategies and ensure that we can confront potential adversities while preserving our performance. By identifying and addressing any indications of impairment, we demonstrate our commitment to organizational effectiveness and the maintenance of positive adjustment under challenging conditions. The proactive measures taken during this period underscore our focus on resource management and strategic adaptation, which are essential for navigating complex situations and ensuring long-term sustainability. The ability to refresh our qualitative analysis indicates our organizational foresight and preparedness to manage risks associated with disruptive events. This approach aligns with our overarching objectives to enhance our operational flexibility and resilience in the face of environmental disruptions, thereby positioning us to flourish despite potential challenges.

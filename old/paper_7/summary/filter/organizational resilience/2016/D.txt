Organizational resilience is defined as the organization’s ability to absorb strain and preserve or improve functioning despite the presence of adversity. Resilience can be defined as the system’s ability to maintain its integrity and its performance, at least partially, while under internal or external variations and disturbances, whether nominal, extreme, or exceptional. The concept of resilience draws attention to systems as well as individuals, to partial maintenance of integrity and performance, to the opposite of brittleness, and to disturbances that vary both in scale and source. Resilience is a multifaceted concept that reflects businesses’ ability to foresee, confront, and benefit from sudden disruptive change to survive, grow, and flourish. The trajectory model of organizational resilience focuses on how actors project temporal trajectories of responses toward disruptive events, reconstitute the trajectories in immediate response to the event, and reconfigure the trajectories toward the ensuing future.

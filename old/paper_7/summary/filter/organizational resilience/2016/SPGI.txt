We have repositioned S&P Global as a more focused company in the capital and commodity markets by exiting non-core assets and investing for growth in markets that have size and scale. Our operations consist of three reportable segments: ratings, market and commodities intelligence, and S&P Dow Jones indices. We strive to deliver on our strategic priorities in the following four categories by investing to meet customer needs in high growth areas and expanding in international markets. We embrace operational excellence in all that we do and accelerate digital transformation and stimulate innovation. The successful completion of our growth and performance plan aligns our efforts against key strategic priorities, which include enhancing leadership and accountability. We have continued to create a portfolio focused on scalable, industry-leading, interrelated businesses in the capital and commodity markets. The market and commodities intelligence segment is designed to help the financial community track performance, generate better investment returns, identify new trading and investment ideas, perform risk analysis, develop mitigation strategies, and provide high-value information to the commodity and energy markets. We recorded a pre-tax gain of $1.1 billion in gain on dispositions related to the sale of J.D. Power, which was classified as held for sale in our consolidated balance sheet. The acquisition of SNL Financial enhanced our capabilities in providing data, analytics, and research to various sectors, thereby improving our operational flexibility and resource generation. Our strategic initiatives include integrating and leveraging recent acquisitions to expand our analytical offerings and enhancing our market intelligence capabilities. We continuously assess the impact of external pressures, including regulatory changes and market volatility, on our operations and adapt our strategies accordingly. Our financial position remains strong, with cash flows from operations expected to meet our ongoing operational needs. The organizational structure has been realigned to reflect changes in how our chief executive officer evaluates the performance of these segments, which supports our adaptability and responsiveness to market conditions. We have implemented changes required by new laws and regulations, which we believe will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations. Our commitment to operational continuity and crisis management is reflected in our approach to risk assessment and mitigation strategies, ensuring that we maintain performance under pressure. The focus on enhancing our organizational capabilities and resilience strategies positions us to confront future challenges and capitalize on opportunities for growth and innovation.

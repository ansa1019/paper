The results of our individual businesses reflect the manner in which management evaluates performance and makes decisions about funding our operations and allocating resources. We may periodically change our business segments or reclassify business segment results based on modifications to our management reporting methodologies and changes in organizational alignment. Our business segment results are intended to reflect each segment as if it were a stand-alone business. We regularly assess the assumptions, methodologies and reporting classifications used for segment reporting, which may result in the implementation of refinements or changes in future periods. Management re-evaluated the organizational structure of the credit card business, concluding that the domestic and international card components should be aggregated into a single reporting unit because they share similar economic characteristics, products, types of customers, operations, assets and other resources. The business has evolved, particularly our Canadian business, which now comprises the majority of the reporting unit's assets, resulting in more shared characteristics and resources with our domestic operations. Underwriting decisions for auto loans are based on an applicant's income, estimated debt-to-income ratio, and credit bureau information, along with collateral characteristics, subject to maintaining resilience under a variety of stress conditions. This reflects our ability to respond effectively to environmental disruptions and transform ourselves to emerge stronger from challenging situations. The allocation process is unique to each business segment and acquired businesses, which indicates our adaptability and operational flexibility in resource deployment. The credit risk associated with our operations arises from an obligor's failure to meet the terms of any contract with the company, impacting our financial condition and resilience. Our internal management and reporting process employs various allocation methodologies, including funds transfer pricing, to assign certain balance sheet assets, deposits and other liabilities and their related revenue and expenses directly or indirectly attributable to each business segment. The net interest income of each segment reflects the results of our funds transfer pricing process, which is based on a matched maturity method that considers market interest rates. This process provides a funds credit for sources of funds and a funds charge for the use of funds by each segment, demonstrating our strategic response to resource management under varying conditions. We generally retain all of our auto loans, though we have securitized and sold auto loans in the past and may do so in the future, indicating our capacity for resource reconfiguration and operational continuity in response to market demands. Overall, our organizational practices and strategic initiatives reflect a commitment to maintaining performance under pressure and adapting to complex situations, ensuring our resilience in a turbulent business environment.

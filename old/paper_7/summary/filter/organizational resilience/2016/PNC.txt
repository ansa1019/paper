Operational risk is the risk to the current or projected financial condition and resilience arising from inadequate or failed internal processes or systems, human errors or misconduct, or adverse external events. Operational risk is inherent to the entire organization. The ability to respond effectively to environmental disruptions and transform itself to emerge stronger from a challenging situation is critical for organizational resilience. This resilience reflects the organizationâ€™s capacity to absorb strain and preserve or improve functioning despite the presence of adversity. It emphasizes the importance of maintaining integrity and performance while under internal or external variations and disturbances, which can include pressures, constraints, failures, errors, violations, and hazards. The multifaceted nature of resilience draws attention to the necessity for organizations to foresee, confront, and benefit from sudden disruptive change to survive, grow, and flourish. Resilience strategies and mechanisms are essential for organizations to navigate complex situations and manage operational flexibility. The focus on operational risk management highlights the need for effective resource allocation and strategic initiatives that enhance organizational capabilities and performance under pressure. By developing a trajectory model of organizational resilience, organizations can project temporal trajectories of responses toward disruptive events, reconstitute these trajectories in immediate response, and reconfigure them toward future objectives. This approach underscores the significance of knowledge management and the importance of social capital and collaboration networks in fostering resilience. The ability to adapt and reconfigure resources in response to unexpected situations is crucial for maintaining organizational health and effectiveness. Organizations must engage in proactive measures and strategic foresight to mitigate risks and enhance their resilience in the face of environmental turbulence and uncertainty. The integration of operational management practices and crisis response strategies is vital for ensuring operational continuity and achieving major objectives. By fostering a culture of learning and adaptability, organizations can enhance their absorptive capacity and improve their response mechanisms. The emphasis on organizational dynamics and the interplay between internal variations and external disturbances is essential for understanding the complexities of resilience. Ultimately, the resilience of an organization is determined by its ability to manage risks, maintain operational integrity, and leverage its strengths to navigate challenges effectively.

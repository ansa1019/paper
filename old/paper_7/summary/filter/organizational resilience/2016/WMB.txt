In September 2016, we announced organizational changes aiming to simplify our structure, increase direct operational alignment to advance our natural gas-focused strategy, and drive continued focus on customer service and execution. Effective January 1, 2017, we implemented these changes, which combined the management of certain of our operations and reduced the overall number of operating areas managed within our business. This organizational realignment reflects our response to external pressures and aims to enhance operational flexibility and effectiveness in the face of challenges. The changes included a $37 million increase for severance and related costs associated with workforce reductions incurred in the first quarter of 2016 and the organizational realignment in the fourth quarter of 2016. The adjustments made during this period are indicative of our commitment to maintaining performance under pressure and ensuring business continuity despite the adversities faced. The organizational documents of entities in which we have an equity-method investment generally require distribution of their available cash to their members on a quarterly basis. In each case, available cash is reduced, in part, by reserves appropriate for operating their respective businesses. This approach to resource allocation and management is essential for sustaining operational integrity and resilience amidst varying conditions.

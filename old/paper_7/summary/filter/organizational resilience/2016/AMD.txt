We are a global semiconductor company primarily offering x86 microprocessors and server and embedded processors. As we continued to focus on our strategy to improve our business, we made progress towards strengthening our competitive position and improving our financial performance. The improvement in operating performance was due to an increase in net revenue, a reduction in restructuring and other special charges, and a licensing gain related to an intellectual property license agreement. During 2016, we continued to closely manage our operating expenses and improved our balance sheet by reducing our debt and extending our debt maturities. We executed our roadmap by delivering a number of new products and technologies across our business segments, which reflects our ability to adapt and innovate in response to market demands. Our research and development expenses increased, driven by product engineering and design costs, which underscores our commitment to maintaining operational flexibility and enhancing our product offerings. We recognized a licensing gain associated with our joint venture, which supports our expansion into the server product market in China, demonstrating our strategic initiatives to leverage external knowledge and resources. The establishment of joint ventures and collaborations illustrates our approach to inter-organizational collaboration, which is essential for navigating complex market conditions and enhancing our resilience. We also entered into a sixth amendment to our wafer supply agreement, providing us greater flexibility in sourcing foundry services across our product portfolio, which is crucial for maintaining operational continuity and mitigating risks associated with supply chain disruptions. Our financial condition reflects our ability to manage uncertainties in the business environment, and we believe our cash and cash equivalents balance, along with our secured revolving line of credit, will be sufficient to fund operations over the next 12 months. The uncertain global economic conditions have in the past adversely impacted our business, and we recognize that if market conditions deteriorate, we may be limited in our ability to access capital markets to meet liquidity needs on favorable terms. We have implemented restructuring plans aimed at simplifying our business and better aligning resources around our priorities, which is indicative of our proactive measures to enhance organizational resilience. Our total purchases from joint ventures and collaborations reflect our commitment to resource generation and operational management, ensuring we can respond effectively to external pressures. The ongoing evaluation of our financial condition and results of operations is based on critical accounting estimates that require subjective judgments, which are essential for maintaining organizational health and performance under pressure. As we navigate through environmental disruptions and competitive pressures, our focus on strategic adaptation and resilience strategies will be vital for our long-term success and sustainability in the semiconductor industry.

Non-GAAP adjustments related to the 2014-2018 restructuring program and the 2012-2014 restructuring program reflect costs incurred that relate to the objectives of our program to transform our supply chain network and organizational structure. The restructuring initiatives are indicative of the organization's ability to adapt and respond effectively to internal and external pressures, thereby enhancing its operational flexibility and resilience. Costs that do not meet the program objectives are not reflected in the non-GAAP adjustments, which suggests a focus on maintaining performance and integrity during periods of change. This transformation is essential for the organization to confront challenges and ensure continuity in functioning, thereby supporting its resilience strategies. The emphasis on reconfiguring the supply chain network aligns with the broader goal of improving organizational health and effectiveness in the face of disruptive events. The program aims to facilitate resource allocation and deployment in a manner that enhances the organizationâ€™s capacity to absorb strain and maintain positive adjustment under challenging conditions. By prioritizing these strategic initiatives, the organization demonstrates a commitment to fostering resilience through proactive measures and operational management, which are critical for navigating complex situations and ensuring long-term sustainability.

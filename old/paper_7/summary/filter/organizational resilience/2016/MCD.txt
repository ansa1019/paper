The strength of the alignment among the company, its franchisees, and suppliers is key to McDonald's long-term success. By leveraging the system, McDonald's is able to identify, implement, and scale ideas that meet customers' changing needs and preferences. The company believes that franchising is paramount to delivering great-tasting food and locally relevant customer experiences, driving profitability, and maintaining operational flexibility. The turnaround plan introduced in 2015 represented a significant step change in how McDonald's operates, focusing on running better restaurants, driving operational growth, and enhancing financial value. The company made purposeful changes in 2016, including right-sizing the organization and blending executives with deep McDonald's experience with new executives to generate fresh energy and innovative ideas. The company continually reviews its mix of company-operated and franchised restaurants to help optimize overall performance, with a goal to be approximately 95% franchised over the long term. The refranchising efforts are expected to provide a more predictable and stable revenue stream with significantly lower operating costs and risks. The company's ability to respond effectively to environmental disruptions and transform itself to emerge stronger from challenging situations is reflected in its strategic initiatives. McDonald's has enhanced financial value through refranchising efforts, cost savings initiatives, and cash return to shareholders. The company expects to achieve its refranchising target of 4,000 restaurants by the end of 2017, a full year ahead of the original target date. The company also plans to accelerate its focus and investment on its delivery platform to expand the convenience customers expect. In analyzing business trends, management reviews results on a constant currency basis and considers a variety of performance and financial measures, including comparable sales and comparable guest count growth, which are indicative of the impact of the company's initiatives as well as local economic and consumer trends. The company has established long-term financial targets, including systemwide sales growth and operating margin, which reflect its commitment to maintaining performance under pressure and adapting to changing market conditions. The company expects to realize net annual general and administrative savings as part of its restructuring initiatives, which will further enhance its operational effectiveness. The company's cash provided by operations and free cash flow demonstrate its ability to generate significant cash resources, which can be utilized to pursue opportunities to enhance shareholder value. The company's strategic direction emphasizes sustainable guest count growth and a customer-centric growth strategy informed by deep customer research. The company is committed to enhancing its customer experience through modernization and technology, which aligns with its resilience strategies to adapt to market demands and ensure long-term sustainability.

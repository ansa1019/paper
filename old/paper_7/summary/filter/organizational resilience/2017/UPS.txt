In 2017, we produced solid growth and operating results across all operating segments, with consolidated revenue increasing 8.2% to $65.872 billion. This growth was driven by shipment growth, yield expansion, and benefits recognized from network investments and portfolio initiatives. However, operating profits were partially offset by impacts from natural disasters and capacity constraints due to volume surges. We believe that these adjusted measures provide meaningful information to assist investors and analysts in understanding our financial results and assessing our prospects for future performance. We continually adjust our air and ground networks to better match higher volume levels, demonstrating operational flexibility in response to environmental perturbations. Our strategic initiatives include deploying technology to increase package sorting and delivery productivity, which reflects our commitment to operational continuity and resilience strategies. The adjustments made to exclude mark-to-market pension charges from our operating results provide important supplemental information that reflects the anticipated long-term cost of our defined benefit plans. We recognize changes in the fair value of plan assets and net actuarial gains and losses, which impact our organizational health and financial resources. Our ability to respond effectively to environmental disruptions and transform ourselves to emerge stronger from challenging situations is crucial for maintaining performance under pressure. The increase in operating expenses was driven by higher employee compensation and benefit costs, largely resulting from volume growth and an increase in average daily union labor hours. We incurred higher costs associated with outside contract carriers due to volume growth, which reflects our adaptability to changing market conditions. The growth in business-to-consumer shipments, which represented more than 50% of total U.S. domestic package volume, illustrates our capability to foresee and benefit from sudden disruptive change. Our overall average daily volume increased, largely due to continued strength in business-to-consumer volume and strong demand from several sectors, including retail and healthcare. The increase in revenue per piece was positively impacted by base rate increases and higher fuel surcharge rates. We also experienced increased volume for our deferred air services, particularly for those products aligned with business-to-consumer shipping. Our operational management strategies, including the expansion of Saturday operations, demonstrate our proactive measures to enhance service innovation and operational flexibility. The adjustments to our expense allocation methodologies reflect our commitment to resource allocation and strategic management. We believe that our current cash position and access to long-term debt capital markets will enable us to meet our operational needs and fund strategic initiatives. Our collective bargaining agreements with unions and the ongoing negotiations reflect our engagement with stakeholder needs and organizational dynamics. The ability to absorb strain and preserve functioning despite adversity is essential for our organizational resilience, as we navigate the complexities of the business environment and respond to external pressures.

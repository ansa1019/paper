Management continued its focus on liquidity and cash flows as well as improving its operating performance through cost reductions, streamlined organizational structures, margin enhancement, and profitable revenue generation. This focus and the related results enabled Arconic to end 2017 with a solid financial position. In January 2018, management announced a change in the organizational structure of the engineered products and solutions segment, from four business units to three business units, with a focus on aligning its internal structure to core markets and customers and reducing cost. The change reflects an adaptation strategy aimed at improving organizational effectiveness and operational flexibility in response to external pressures. As a result of this change, goodwill will be reallocated to the three new reporting units and evaluated for impairment during the first quarter of 2018. The company does not expect any goodwill impairment as a result of this realignment, indicating a proactive measure to maintain organizational health and performance under potential adverse conditions.

Non-GAAP adjustments related to the 2014-2018 restructuring program reflect costs incurred that relate to the objectives of our program to transform our supply chain network and organizational structure. The program aims to enhance organizational resilience by addressing internal knowledge and resource allocation to adapt to external pressures and disruptive events. Costs that do not meet the program objectives are not reflected in the non-GAAP adjustments. The restructuring program is designed to improve operational flexibility and maintain performance under pressure, thereby contributing to the organization's ability to confront and benefit from sudden disruptive changes. This transformation process is essential for ensuring business continuity and enhancing organizational effectiveness in the face of environmental disruptions. For more information on the 2012-2014 restructuring program, refer to our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016.

Operational risk is the risk to the current or projected financial condition and resilience arising from inadequate or failed internal processes or systems, human errors or misconduct, or adverse external events. Operational risk is inherent to the entire organization. The concept of resilience draws attention to systems as well as individuals, to partial maintenance of integrity and performance, to the opposite of brittleness, and to disturbances that vary both in scale and source. Resilience is a multifaceted concept that reflects businessesâ€™ ability to foresee, confront, and benefit from sudden disruptive change to survive, grow, and flourish. The organization's ability to absorb strain and preserve or improve functioning despite the presence of adversity is critical for maintaining operational continuity. Resilience strategies must encompass effective responses to environmental disruptions and the capacity to transform in order to emerge stronger from challenging situations. The maintenance of positive adjustment under challenging conditions is essential for organizational health and effectiveness. Organizations must develop mechanisms for risk assessment and mitigation to enhance their operational flexibility and adaptability in the face of external pressures and internal variations. The ability to reconfigure resources and practices in response to unexpected situations is vital for sustaining performance under pressure. This includes the integration of knowledge management practices that facilitate learning and innovation, enabling organizations to adapt to complex situations and environmental turbulence. The deployment of strategic tools and initiatives aimed at enhancing organizational capabilities and resilience is necessary for navigating crises and ensuring long-term survival. Organizations must also focus on building social capital and fostering collaboration networks to strengthen their resilience against adverse events. The interplay of operational resources and strategic response mechanisms is crucial for maintaining system integrity and performance during periods of strain. By leveraging dynamic capabilities and fostering a culture of learning, organizations can enhance their absorptive capacity and improve their response to disruptive events. The emphasis on proactive measures and future planning is essential for developing organizational foresight and ensuring preparedness for potential crises. In summary, the resilience of an organization is fundamentally linked to its ability to manage operational risks, adapt to changing conditions, and maintain effective functioning in the face of adversity.

In 2017, the company experienced an 18 percent increase in sales and revenues, attributed to improved end-user demand and favorable changes in dealer inventories across all regions and most end markets. The favorable price realization, particularly in construction industries, contributed to this sales improvement. The management emphasized the importance of achieving a flexible and competitive cost structure, having incurred substantial restructuring costs aimed at enhancing operational flexibility and resilience. The restructuring actions included the closure of a facility in Gosselies, Belgium, and other initiatives across the company, reflecting a strategic response to external pressures and market conditions. The company expects these restructuring actions to continue into 2018, with anticipated costs of approximately $400 million, which are part of a broader strategy to maintain operational continuity and adaptability in a competitive landscape. 

The management's discussion highlighted the need for effective resource allocation and risk assessment in response to environmental perturbations and unexpected situations. The company recognized the significance of maintaining organizational health and operational resources to support performance under pressure. The increase in profit was primarily due to higher sales volume and improved price realization, despite challenges such as higher taxes resulting from U.S. tax reform legislation. The management noted that the restructuring costs incurred were aimed at achieving long-term benefits, reinforcing the company's commitment to resilience strategies and mechanisms that facilitate recovery and transformation.

Additionally, the company’s operational management practices included strategic initiatives to enhance organizational effectiveness and performance maintenance. The favorable changes in dealer inventories and end-user demand were seen as indicators of the company's ability to absorb strain and preserve functioning despite adverse conditions. The management utilized internal charts to communicate performance metrics to the board of directors and employees, emphasizing the importance of organizational coherence and stakeholder engagement in navigating complex situations. 

The financial products segment demonstrated resilience through increased revenues, reflecting higher average financing rates and intercompany lending activity. The management's focus on maintaining a strong cash and liquidity position was evident, with consolidated cash balances increasing significantly. The company’s proactive measures in financial management, including the early redemption of long-term debt, were indicative of its strategic foresight and commitment to sustaining operational agility. 

Overall, the company's performance in 2017 illustrated its capacity for positive adjustment under challenging conditions, underscoring the multifaceted nature of organizational resilience as it navigated through various external disturbances and internal restructuring efforts.

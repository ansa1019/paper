In the third quarter of fiscal 2017, three hurricanes impacted our operations in the continental U.S., Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands, demonstrating our ability to confront and adapt to disruptive events. Hurricane-related sales contributed approximately $662 million to net sales in the second half of fiscal 2017, although the gross profit on these sales was considerably less than the company average, reflecting the complexities and challenges of maintaining operational effectiveness under extreme conditions. We incurred approximately $170 million of hurricane-related expenses during this period, illustrating the resource allocation and risk management strategies employed to mitigate the impact of external pressures. Our results for fiscal 2017 also included a one-time cash bonus to our U.S. hourly associates, which negatively impacted net earnings, highlighting the importance of employee engagement and organizational health in maintaining performance under pressure. The enactment of the tax act on December 22, 2017, resulted in a net charge of $127 million, which affected our financial performance, yet we continued to focus on strategic initiatives to enhance our resilience. Our operational flexibility was evident as we opened three new stores in the U.S. and three in Mexico, contributing to a total store count of 2,284, which reflects our commitment to growth and adaptation in a competitive landscape. The increase in net sales for fiscal 2017 was driven by positive comparable sales, underscoring our ability to absorb strain and preserve functioning despite market volatility. Our comparable sales increased 6.8%, supported by broad-based growth across our stores and online platforms, indicating our adaptability and responsiveness to customer needs. Online sales represented 6.7% of net sales and grew 21.5%, further demonstrating our strategic response to environmental disruptions and the importance of digital transformation in enhancing organizational resilience. The modest decline in gross profit margin for fiscal 2017, attributed to lower margin hurricane-related sales, reflects the challenges of maintaining profitability while navigating adverse conditions. We believe that our current cash position, access to long-term debt capital markets, and cash flow generated from operations will be sufficient to support our operational continuity and strategic planning initiatives in the face of future uncertainties. Our ability to manage working capital effectively, alongside significant capital expenditures and share repurchases, illustrates our commitment to resource management and operational resilience. The establishment of liabilities for self-insurance and the evaluation of long-lived assets for impairment further demonstrate our proactive measures in risk assessment and management. Overall, our financial performance and strategic decisions reflect a multifaceted approach to organizational resilience, emphasizing our capacity to adapt, recover, and thrive in the face of adversity and environmental turbulence.

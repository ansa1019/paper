Our disciplined strategy for profitable growth emphasizes the importance of maintaining organizational health and resilience, particularly in the face of regulatory complexities and competitive conditions. 

The anticipated loss of a large client and lower retention rates on legacy platforms have prompted internal focus on understanding the causes of client losses and their impact on revenue retention. Upgrading clients from legacy platforms to our new cloud-based solutions is a critical aspect of our long-term strategy, aimed at enhancing client experience and operational continuity. Our implementation team's effectiveness in delivering services and our sales force's capabilities have driven revenue growth, underscoring the importance of organizational capabilities and resource allocation in achieving firm performance.

During fiscal 2017, we incurred charges related to a multi-year service alignment initiative designed to optimize our client service operations, which reflects our proactive measures in managing operational resources and enhancing organizational effectiveness. The sale of our consumer health spending account and consolidated omnibus reconciliation act businesses has allowed us to sharpen our focus on core capabilities, facilitating a seamless delivery of a full suite of human capital management solutions.

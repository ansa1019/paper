On December 2, 2016, the company publicly announced that it will pursue the conversion of Aflac Japan from a branch structure to a subsidiary structure, with the subsidiary incorporated as a "kabushiki kaisha." The subsidiary structure has emerged as the more prevalent structure for both domestic and foreign companies operating in Japan, and the adoption of this new organizational framework is expected to be tax-neutral and not to have a material impact on the daily operations of either Aflac Japan or Aflac U.S. The company expects to obtain enhanced flexibility in capital management and business development as a result of the conversion. This strategic initiative reflects the company's adaptability to emerging global regulatory standards that generally favor the subsidiary structure for foreign insurance and financial service companies, thereby demonstrating a proactive approach to organizational change processes. The anticipated completion of the conversion as early as April 1, 2018, indicates a forward-looking perspective that aligns with the company's major objectives of maintaining operational continuity and enhancing organizational effectiveness. As an interim step, effective January 1, 2018, investments of Aflac U.S. as well as certain sub-advised assets of Aflac Japan are managed by the company's U.S. asset management subsidiary, Aflac Asset Management LLC (AAM), which is indicative of the company's resource allocation strategies aimed at optimizing performance under pressure. Additionally, investments of Aflac Japan are managed pursuant to an investment advisory agreement between Aflac Japan and the company's asset management subsidiary in Japan, Aflac Asset Management Ltd. (AAMJ), which is licensed as a discretionary asset manager under the Japan Financial Instruments and Exchange Act. This operational flexibility allows the company to navigate external pressures and environmental disruptions effectively, reinforcing its organizational resilience. AAM and AAMJ will be reported in the "other business segments" category; however, the assets that they manage will be reported in the respective Aflac Japan and Aflac U.S. business segments. The strategic response to the evolving business environment illustrates the company's commitment to maintaining positive adjustment under challenging conditions, thereby enhancing its organizational strength and ensuring long-term sustainability.

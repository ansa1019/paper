The liquidity coverage ratio rule issued by federal banking regulators is designed to promote the short-term resilience of the liquidity risk profile of large and internationally active banking organizations in the United States. This quantitative requirement necessitates that covered banks maintain an amount of high-quality liquid assets sufficient to cover projected net cash outflows during a prospective 30-day calendar period under an acute, hypothetical liquidity stress scenario. The modified liquidity coverage ratio requirement, applicable to our current asset size, mandates a lower level of high-quality liquid assets to meet the minimum ratio requirement due to adjustments to the net cash outflow amount. Under the rule's transition period, a liquidity ratio of 100% was required in 2017, and as of December 31, 2017, our liquidity coverage ratio was in excess of the applicable regulatory requirement. The final rule issued by the federal reserve will require us to publish quarterly public disclosures regarding our liquidity risk profile and components of our liquidity coverage ratio beginning the fourth quarter of 2018. This regulatory framework emphasizes the importance of maintaining operational flexibility and resilience in the face of potential liquidity disruptions, thereby supporting the organization's ability to adapt and respond effectively to external pressures and challenges. The requirement to maintain high-quality liquid assets reflects a strategic initiative aimed at enhancing organizational resilience, ensuring that the organization can preserve its functioning and performance under adverse conditions. The focus on liquidity management aligns with the broader objectives of risk assessment and mitigation, reinforcing the organization's capacity to confront unexpected situations and maintain stability in turbulent markets.

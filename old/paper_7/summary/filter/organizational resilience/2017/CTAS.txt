As a result of our evaluation in fiscal 2016, effective June 1, 2015, Cintas realigned its organizational structure and updated its reportable operating segments in light of certain changes in its business, including the acquisition of Zee Medical Inc. (Zee) in the first quarter of fiscal 2016. Cintas evaluates operating segment performance based on revenue and income before income taxes. The company regularly reviews its operating segments for reporting purposes based on the information its chief operating decision maker regularly reviews for purposes of allocating resources and assessing performance and makes changes when appropriate. This process reflects the organization's adaptability to internal and external variations and disturbances, ensuring operational continuity and performance maintenance amid changing conditions. The evaluation and realignment of segments demonstrate a strategic response to environmental disruptions, which is essential for maintaining organizational effectiveness and resilience. The updated reportable operating segments are uniform rental and facility services and first aid and safety services. The uniform rental and facility services reportable operating segment, which includes G&K, consists of the rental and servicing of uniforms and other garments including flame resistant clothing, mats, mops, and shop towels and other ancillary items. In addition to these rental items, restroom cleaning services and supplies, carpet and tile cleaning services, and the sale of items from our catalogs to our customers on route are included within this reportable operating segment. The first aid and safety services reportable operating segment, which includes Zee, consists of first aid and safety products and services. The remainder of Cintas' business, which consists of fire protection services and its uniform direct sale business, is included in all other. Revenue and income before income taxes for each of these reportable operating segments for the years ended May 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015 are presented in note 14 entitled operating segment information of "notes to consolidated financial statements." The ability to absorb strain and preserve functioning despite the presence of adversity is reflected in the company's strategic initiatives and resource allocation processes. This proactive approach to managing operational resources and adapting to market conditions underscores the importance of organizational resilience in achieving major objectives and sustaining performance under pressure. The organizational change processes initiated by Cintas exemplify a commitment to continuous improvement and operational flexibility, which are critical in navigating complex situations and ensuring long-term survival and growth in a turbulent business environment.

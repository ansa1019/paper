Selling, general, and administrative expenses (SG&A) decreased primarily due to the absence of certain project development costs associated with the Canadian PDH facility that were expensed in 2016, lower labor-related costs resulting from our workforce reductions that occurred late in first-quarter 2016, ongoing cost containment efforts, lower strategic development costs, and the absence of costs associated with our former Canadian and Gulf Coast operations. These decreases were partially offset by higher severance and organizational realignment costs in 2017 and a settlement charge from a pension early payout program. The $37 million increase for severance and related costs associated with workforce reductions incurred in the first quarter of 2016 and the organizational realignment in the fourth quarter of 2016 reflects the organization's response to internal pressures and the need for adaptation in the face of operational changes. Distributions from equity-method investees indicate that the organizational documents of entities in which we have an equity-method investment generally require distribution of their available cash to their members on a quarterly basis. In each case, available cash is reduced, in part, by reserves appropriate for operating their respective businesses, highlighting the importance of strategic resource allocation and management in maintaining organizational health and resilience amid external pressures.

Becton, Dickinson and Company ("BD") is a global medical technology company engaged in the development, manufacture, and sale of a broad range of medical supplies, devices, laboratory equipment, and diagnostic products used by healthcare institutions, life science researchers, clinical laboratories, the pharmaceutical industry, and the general public. The company's organizational structure is based upon two principal business segments, BD Medical ("Medical") and BD Life Sciences ("Life Sciences"). Life Sciences segment volume growth in 2017 was driven by growth in all three of its organizational units, particularly in its preanalytical and diagnostic systems units. The company continues to invest in research and development, geographic expansion, and new product promotions to drive further revenue and profit growth. The ability to sustain long-term growth will depend on several factors, including the capacity to expand the core business, develop innovative new products, and continue to improve operating efficiency and organizational effectiveness. While the economic environment for the healthcare industry and healthcare utilization in the United States have generally stabilized, destabilization in the future could adversely impact the business. Additionally, macroeconomic challenges in Europe continue to constrain healthcare utilization, although the environment is currently viewed as stable. In emerging markets, the company's growth is dependent primarily on government funding for healthcare systems. Furthermore, pricing pressure exists for certain geographies and could adversely impact the businesses. The company recognizes the importance of operational flexibility and adaptability in responding to external pressures and environmental disruptions. The strategic initiatives undertaken aim to enhance organizational resilience by ensuring effective resource allocation and developing capabilities to confront unexpected situations. The focus on innovation and continuous improvement is essential for maintaining organizational health and performance under pressure, particularly in the face of potential adverse conditions. The company emphasizes the significance of collaboration networks and inter-organizational collaboration as mechanisms to bolster resilience and navigate complex situations. The commitment to learning organization principles and knowledge management is integral to enhancing organizational capabilities and ensuring preparedness for future challenges. The emphasis on strategic foresight and proactive measures is critical for anticipating and mitigating risks associated with environmental turbulence and market volatility. Overall, BD's approach to organizational resilience involves a multifaceted strategy that includes investment in human capital, operational management, and maintaining a dynamic response to changing market conditions, thereby supporting the company's long-term objectives and enhancing its ability to thrive amidst adversity.

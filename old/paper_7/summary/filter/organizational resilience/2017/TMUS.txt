During the third and fourth quarters of 2017, our operations in Texas, Florida, and Puerto Rico experienced losses related to hurricanes, which impacted our operational continuity and business performance. The negative impact from the hurricanes for the year ended December 31, 2017, was approximately $201 million, net of insurance recoveries. We continue to assess the damage of the hurricanes and work with our insurance carriers to submit claims for property damage and business interruption, indicating our commitment to recovery and resilience strategies in the face of external pressures. Our ability to adapt and respond effectively to these environmental disruptions is critical for maintaining operational flexibility and ensuring business continuity. The un-carrier strategy, introduced in 2013, aims to eliminate customer pain points and enhance customer relationships, reflecting our focus on service innovation and strategic initiatives that contribute to organizational health and competitive advantage. 

The financial condition and results of operations discussed throughout our management's discussion and analysis are indicative of our capacity to absorb strain and preserve functioning despite adversity. We believe our un-carrier strategy, along with ongoing network improvements, has been successful in attracting and retaining customers, as evidenced by continued branded customer growth and improved churn rates. Our operational resources, including the management of costs associated with services and equipment sales, are aligned with our major objectives of sustaining performance under pressure and adapting to market volatility. 

The increase in service revenues was primarily driven by strong customer response to our un-carrier initiatives and promotions, which reflects our organizational capabilities in navigating complex situations and maintaining positive adjustment under challenging conditions. We also recognized insurance recoveries related to hurricane losses, which contributed to our financial resilience. Our strategic response to the adverse impacts of hurricanes and other disruptions demonstrates our commitment to risk management and preparedness, ensuring that we can confront unexpected situations effectively. 

Additionally, our focus on future planning and strategic foresight is evident in our liquidity management and capital expenditures, which are driven by the need to support ongoing network expansion and technological advancements. We regularly review and update our projections for changes in financial and operating results, general economic conditions, and the competitive landscape, which are essential for maintaining organizational effectiveness and resilience. Our ability to foresee and adapt to external disturbances is crucial for sustaining growth and ensuring organizational survival in turbulent markets.

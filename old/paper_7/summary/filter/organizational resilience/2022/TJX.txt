TJX provides projections and other forward-looking statements particularly relating to our future financial performance, which are estimates based on information currently available and subject to risks and uncertainties. Our results are influenced by external pressures, including those described in risk factors and other filings. We operate over 4,800 stores through four main segments, which allows us to maintain operational flexibility and adapt to changing market conditions. For fiscal 2023, net sales increased 3% to $49.9 billion, reflecting our ability to absorb strain and preserve functioning despite challenges. The increase in net sales includes a fully open store base for fiscal 2023 compared to temporary store closures in fiscal 2022 due to COVID-19, demonstrating our resilience in navigating disruptive events. U.S. comparable store sales were flat for fiscal 2023, reflecting a decrease in customer traffic but offset by an increase in average basket size, indicating adaptability to customer needs. Our segment profit margin decreased slightly, driven by lower merchandise margins and higher store wages, but was partially offset by reduced COVID-related expenses, showcasing our resource allocation strategies in response to operational challenges. We returned $3.6 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends, reflecting our commitment to maintaining financial health and operational continuity. Our liquidity requirements have traditionally been funded through cash generated from operations, supplemented by short-term bank borrowings when necessary, indicating a proactive approach to resource management. As of January 28, 2023, we held $5.5 billion in cash, demonstrating our preparedness for future operational needs. We expect to continue investing in our infrastructure, with capital expenditures planned to support growth and operational management. Our ability to respond effectively to environmental disruptions is evident in our strategic initiatives to enhance our e-commerce capabilities, which accounted for less than 3% of total sales but are crucial for future planning. The impact of foreign currency exchange rates on our operating results underscores the importance of risk management and adaptability in a volatile market. Our focus on maintaining a strong merchandise margin while managing costs reflects our strategic response to external disturbances. The divestiture of our minority investment in Familia, resulting in an impairment charge, illustrates our capacity for reconfiguring resources in response to changing market dynamics. Overall, our organizational practices emphasize resilience through operational flexibility, strategic foresight, and a commitment to maintaining performance under pressure, ensuring our ability to confront and benefit from sudden disruptive changes.

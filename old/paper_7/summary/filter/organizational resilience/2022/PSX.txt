Effective October 1, 2022, we changed the organizational structure of the internal financial information reviewed by our president and chief executive officer, and determined this resulted in a change in the composition of our operating segments. As part of the realignment, we moved the results and net assets of our Merey Sweeny vacuum distillation and delayed coker units at our Sweeny refinery and the isomerization unit at our Lake Charles refinery from our midstream segment to our refining segment. Additionally, commissions charged to the refining segment by the M&S segment related to sales of specialty products were eliminated and the costs of the sales organization were reclassified from the M&S segment to the refining segment. Further, we are no longer presenting disaggregated business line results for our chemicals and M&S segments to align with changes in our internal financial reporting. This realignment reflects an adaptive strategy to enhance operational flexibility and maintain organizational effectiveness in response to evolving business conditions. The adjustments made to our organizational structure demonstrate our commitment to resilience by ensuring that we can effectively manage internal variations and external pressures while optimizing resource allocation and operational continuity. The changes are aimed at improving our ability to respond to environmental disruptions and to maintain performance under pressure, thereby supporting our major objectives and enhancing our competitive advantage in a turbulent market.

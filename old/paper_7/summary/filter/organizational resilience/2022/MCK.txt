We report our financial results in four reportable segments: U.S. pharmaceutical, prescription technology solutions ("RXT"), medical-surgical solutions, and international. Our organizational structure also includes corporate, which consists of income and expenses associated with administrative functions and projects as well as the results of certain investments. The factors for determining the reportable segments include the manner in which management evaluates the performance of the company combined with the nature of individual business activities. We evaluate the performance of our operating segments on a number of measures, including revenues and operating profit (loss) before interest expense and income taxes.

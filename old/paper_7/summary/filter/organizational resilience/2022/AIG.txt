These forward-looking statements are intended to provide management's current expectations or plans for future operating and financial performance, based on assumptions believed to be valid and accurate. The statements may encompass projections, goals, and assumptions that relate to future actions, prospective services or products, and the outcome of contingencies such as legal proceedings, which may affect organizational resilience. Anticipated organizational, business, or regulatory changes, such as the separation of the life and retirement business from AIG, may also reflect the organization’s strategic response to external pressures.

The successful integration of acquired businesses and management succession and retention plans are critical for preserving organizational health and ensuring performance under pressure. Exposure to risk and trends in operations and financial results may necessitate a focus on resource allocation and operational flexibility to address unexpected situations. The company’s ability to foresee, confront, and benefit from sudden disruptive change is essential for survival and growth, highlighting the importance of organizational capabilities and resilience strategies. These elements contribute to the company’s overall performance maintenance and effectiveness in navigating complex situations and environmental turbulence. The management's discussion may also address implications for future planning and the need for strategic initiatives that enhance organizational agility and adaptability in the face of adversity.

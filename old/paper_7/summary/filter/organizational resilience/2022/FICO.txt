In fiscal 2022, we continued to promote adoption of our most predictive scores, including the fico® resilience index, which identifies consumers who are more resilient to economic stress relative to other consumers within the same fico score bands. This initiative reflects our commitment to enhancing organizational resilience by developing scores that utilize alternative data to improve conventional credit bureau data, thereby generating scores for otherwise un-scorable consumers. The fico® resilience index serves as a strategic tool to assess consumer resilience, which is essential in maintaining positive adjustment under challenging economic conditions. Our efforts in this area demonstrate a multifaceted approach to understanding and addressing external pressures that impact consumer behavior and financial stability. By focusing on resilience, we aim to enhance our operational flexibility and adaptability in the face of environmental disruptions, thereby ensuring business continuity and supporting our overall strategic initiatives. The development of these scoring solutions is aligned with our objective to respond effectively to disruptive events and to leverage insights from consumer data to foster organizational health and performance maintenance. Through these measures, we are not only addressing immediate challenges but also positioning ourselves to thrive in a competitive landscape characterized by uncertainty and volatility. The integration of resilience-focused metrics into our business strategy underscores our commitment to resource allocation that prioritizes innovation and responsiveness to customer needs, ultimately contributing to our organizational success and sustainability in turbulent markets.

We began operating as Elevance Health, Inc. and trading under our new ticker symbol "ELV" on June 28, 2022. As part of our name change, we announced that over the next several years we will organize our brand portfolio into core go-to-market brands, intending to unite select non-BCBSA licensed Medicare, Medicaid, and commercial plans under the Wellpoint name, and to bring together our healthcare-related services and capabilities under the Carelon brand. In 2022, we managed our operations by customer type through four reportable segments, and we are evaluating and making changes to how we manage our business, including a review of the products in each of our operating segments, which resulted in restructurings. We expect to reclassify previously reported information to conform to the new presentation. Our growth strategy is designed to enable us to take advantage of additional economies of scale and provide access to new and evolving technologies and products, while geographic and product diversity reduces exposure to local or regional regulatory, economic, and competitive pressures. We will continue to monitor the COVID-19 pandemic and resulting legislative and regulatory changes to manage our response and assess and mitigate potential adverse impacts to our business. The pandemic has impacted our membership, benefit expense, and member behavior, and we will continue to adapt our strategies in response to these challenges. Our comprehensive PBM services portfolio includes features such as formulary management and pharmacy networks, which enhance our ability to integrate pharmacy benefits within our medical and specialty platform. We believe that our initiatives largely represent the next step forward in our progression towards becoming a more agile organization, including process automation and a reduction in our office space footprint. The COVID-19 pandemic continues to evolve, putting pressure on the healthcare system, and we are committed to adapting our operational strategies to maintain our organizational effectiveness and resilience. Our operating revenue consists of premiums, product revenue, and administrative fees, with the increase in operating revenue driven by higher premium revenue in our Medicaid business due to organic membership growth and acquisitions. We continue to closely monitor the pandemic's impacts on our pricing and healthcare costs, adjusting our strategies as necessary to respond to changing conditions. We have established a strong financial condition and liquidity position, with consolidated cash and investments enabling us to meet short-term and long-term obligations. Our investment strategy is consistent with insurance statutes and regulatory requirements, preserving our asset base while maximizing long-term returns. We maintain a common stock repurchase program and intend to utilize funds from future operating cash flows for strategic transactions. We regularly review the appropriate use of capital, including acquisitions and dividends, ensuring that our financial resources are aligned with our operational needs and strategic objectives. We are committed to maintaining our organizational resilience through effective risk management, operational flexibility, and strategic adaptation to the evolving healthcare landscape.

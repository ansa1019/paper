Management's discussion and analysis contracts indicate that effective risk management is vital to the success of business activities, with an enterprise risk management (ERM) framework integrating diverse roles of risk management into a holistic structure. This framework facilitates the incorporation of risk assessment into decision-making processes across the firm, identifying, measuring, monitoring, escalating, mitigating, and controlling principal risks involved in various business segments. The fast-paced, complex, and constantly evolving nature of global financial markets requires maintaining a risk management culture that is incisive and knowledgeable about specialized products and markets. The risk appetite defines the aggregate level and types of risk the firm is willing to accept to achieve business objectives, taking into account client interests and fiduciary duties to shareholders. This appetite is embedded in the risk culture and linked to strategic, capital, and financial plans, as well as compensation programs. The governance structure requires independent firm-level oversight, accountability of business divisions, and effective communication of risk matters across the firm. The board oversees the ERM framework and is responsible for ensuring that risks are managed soundly, while committees within the framework facilitate risk oversight responsibilities. The operations and technology committee oversees operational risk, including business continuity and resilience, which are critical for maintaining organizational effectiveness under adverse conditions. The firm risk committee, co-chaired by the chief executive officer and chief risk officer, monitors capital levels and material risks, ensuring that management has taken appropriate steps to manage such risks. The internal audit department independently assesses risk management processes and controls, reinforcing the importance of maintaining operational continuity and resilience in the face of market volatility and external pressures. The firm’s culture, values, and conduct program emphasize accountability and adherence to core values, which support resilience strategies by fostering a culture of integrity and ethical conduct. The risk limits framework provides a basis for monitoring risk-taking activity and avoiding outsized risk-taking, ensuring that the firm can adapt to unexpected situations and maintain performance under pressure. The comprehensive risk management framework includes stress testing and scenario analyses to assess the impact of adverse events and to ensure preparedness for future challenges. The firm actively manages credit risk through a comprehensive framework that evaluates, monitors, and controls credit exposure, which is essential for organizational survival and resilience. The evaluation of credit risk includes assessing the probability of default and loss given default, ensuring that the firm can respond effectively to environmental disruptions and maintain operational flexibility. The firm’s strategic initiatives focus on enhancing resilience through proactive measures and continuous improvement in risk management practices, ensuring that the organization can confront and adapt to complex situations and maintain its integrity and performance.

In September 2022, we announced a new organizational structure which aligns our businesses more closely with the foundational shifts that are driving the evolution of the global financial system. The new corporate structure includes three business segments: market platforms, capital access platforms, and anti-financial crime. All prior periods have been restated to conform to the current period presentation. This restructuring reflects our approach to resource allocation and performance assessment, as management manages these businesses as three separate segments. Under ASC 350-20, "Intangibles Goodwill and Other," when a company reorganizes its reporting structure, an impairment test must be performed both before and after the change, and goodwill must be reassigned to reporting units. Accordingly, goodwill was reassigned based on the relative fair value of each reporting unit. We perform our goodwill impairment test at the reporting unit level. For 2022, we performed the goodwill impairment test under our previous organizational structure, which represented our five reporting units. We also performed the test under our current organization structure, which includes three reporting units. This transformation in our organizational structure is indicative of our adaptability and strategic response to external pressures and market dynamics, ensuring operational continuity and resilience in the face of evolving challenges within the financial sector. The changes made are aimed at enhancing our organizational effectiveness and maintaining performance under pressure, thereby supporting our long-term objectives and positioning us to confront future uncertainties.

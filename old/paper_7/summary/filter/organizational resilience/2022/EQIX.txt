We provide a global, vendor-neutral data center, interconnection and edge solutions platform with offerings that aim to enable our customers to reach everywhere, interconnect everyone and integrate everything. Our interconnected data centers around the world allow our customers to increase information and application delivery performance to users, and quickly access distributed IT infrastructures and business and digital ecosystems, while significantly reducing costs. This global platform enables scalable, reliable and cost-effective interconnection that increases data traffic exchange while lowering overall cost and increasing flexibility. Our focused business model is built on our critical mass of enterprise and service provider customers and the resulting "marketplace" effect. We continue to monitor the available capacity in each of our selected markets, as limited capacity may restrict our growth in those areas. We perform demand studies on an ongoing basis to determine if future expansion is warranted in a market, which reflects our adaptability to changing conditions. Our business is based on a recurring revenue model comprised of colocation and related interconnection and managed infrastructure offerings, which contributes to our resilience by providing a stable revenue stream. We have continued to closely monitor the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our people and business, demonstrating our crisis management capabilities and operational continuity under adverse conditions. Our expansion criteria will be dependent on various factors, including demand from new and existing customers and quality of design, which underscores our strategic response to external pressures. We believe we have sufficient cash, coupled with anticipated cash generated from operating activities and external financing sources, to meet our operating requirements, including repayment of debt and expansion projects. Our results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2022, include the results from recent acquisitions, which are integral to our strategy of enhancing organizational resilience through resource generation and operational flexibility. We expect our operating expenses to increase as we continue to invest in our operations to support growth, including investments to enhance our technology platform and integrate recent acquisitions. The ongoing assessment of our financial condition and results of operations is intended to assist in understanding our organizational health and performance under pressure. We have established a strong customer base and have continued to experience relatively strong collections, which contributes to our resilience in the face of market volatility. Our strategic initiatives focus on enhancing our operational capabilities and ensuring we can adapt to future challenges, thereby maintaining our competitive advantage. The nature of our business model, which includes a significant portion of recurring revenues, positions us favorably to confront unexpected situations and environmental disruptions, ensuring we can sustain performance and continue to flourish in turbulent markets.

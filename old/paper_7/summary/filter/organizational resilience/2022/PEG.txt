We are focused on investing to modernize our energy infrastructure, improve reliability and resilience, increase energy efficiency, and deliver cleaner energy to meet customer expectations and be well aligned with public policy objectives. In furtherance of these goals, over the past few years, our investments have simplified our business mix to reflect a higher percentage of earnings contribution by PSE&G. We have further proactively changed our business mix through the sale of our fossil generation portfolio which closed in 2022. The passage of the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) established a production tax credit (PTC) for nuclear from 2024 through 2032 which is expected to provide downside price protection for our nuclear generation fleet. We aim to obtain approval of and execute on our utility capital investment program to modernize our infrastructure, improve the reliability and resilience of the service we provide to our customers, and align our sustainability and climate goals with New Jersey's energy policy.

The coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic and its effects are impacting and will likely continue to impact market conditions and business operations across industries worldwide, including at TI. Therefore, we remain cautious about how the economy might behave for the next few years and continue to monitor potential impact on our operations. During this time, we will continue to manage our operating plan and expenses with a steady hand as we focus on long-term investments to strengthen our competitive advantages. We believe that our business model with the combined effect of our four competitive advantages sets TI apart from our peers and will for a long time to come. We will invest to strengthen our competitive advantages, be disciplined in capital allocation, and stay diligent in our pursuit of efficiencies. Our strategic focus is on analog and embedded processing products. While all of these end markets represent good opportunities, we place additional strategic emphasis on designing and selling our products into the industrial and automotive markets, which we believe represent the best long-term growth opportunities. Our focus on analog and embedded processing allows us to generate strong cash flow from operations. We consider the following accounting policies to be those that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and that require a higher degree of judgment. We believe we have the necessary financial resources and operating plans to fund our working capital needs, capital expenditures, dividend and debt-related payments, and other business requirements for at least the next 12 months. As we continue to invest to strengthen our competitive advantage in manufacturing and technology as part of our long-term capacity planning, our capital expenditures are expected to be higher than historical levels. We expect to receive the cash benefit associated with the investment tax credit for qualifying capital expenditures in future periods and to apply for other incentives provided by the legislation. We will continue to manage our operating plan and expenses with a steady hand as we focus on long-term investments to strengthen our competitive advantages. We are committed to maintaining operational continuity and adapting to changes in market conditions. Our investments are aimed at enhancing our organizational capabilities and resilience in the face of external pressures and disruptions. Our approach includes a focus on resource allocation and strategic initiatives that support our long-term objectives. We recognize the importance of operational flexibility and the ability to respond effectively to environmental disruptions. Our financial condition at the end of 2022 reflects our commitment to maintaining organizational health and performance despite challenges. We believe that our ability to absorb strain and preserve functioning will enable us to confront adversity and emerge stronger from challenging situations. We will continue to monitor market conditions and adjust our strategies accordingly, ensuring that we remain agile and responsive to changes in demand and operational needs. Our focus on long-term growth of free cash flow per share is the ultimate measure to generate value, which underscores our commitment to organizational resilience and adaptability in a turbulent business environment.

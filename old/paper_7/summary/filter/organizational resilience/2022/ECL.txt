During 2018, we formally commenced a restructuring plan accelerate 2020 ("the a2020 plan"), to leverage technology and system investments and organizational changes. The goals of the plan are to further simplify and automate processes and tasks, reduce complexity and management layers, consolidate facilities, and focus on key long-term growth areas by further leveraging technology and structural improvements. This initiative reflects the organizationâ€™s ability to adapt and respond effectively to internal and external pressures, thereby enhancing operational flexibility and resilience. During 2020, we expanded the plan for additional costs and savings to further leverage the technology and structural improvements, demonstrating our commitment to continuous improvement and resource reconfiguration in the face of challenges. We completed the plan with actual costs of $254 million ($198 million after tax), or $0.69 per diluted share, which underscores our strategic response to maintain performance and operational continuity amidst adverse conditions. The restructuring plan illustrates our focus on organizational change processes that aim to enhance resilience by addressing complexity and improving overall organizational health.

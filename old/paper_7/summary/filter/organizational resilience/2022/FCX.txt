In September 2022, we published our updated climate report which details our ongoing initiatives to enhance our resilience to future climate-related risks. We continue to advance greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions reduction initiatives across our global operations and established our 2030 GHG reduction targets that collectively cover nearly 100% of our scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions. The report emphasizes our commitment to improve energy efficiency and evaluate and integrate the use of lower carbon and renewable energy sources, which are essential for maintaining operational flexibility and adapting to environmental perturbations. Furthermore, the document refers to item 1a, "risk factors," contained in part I of our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022, which provides further discussion of climate-related risks, highlighting the importance of strategic initiatives and preparedness in the face of external pressures and disruptive events. This proactive approach reflects our understanding of the multifaceted nature of organizational resilience, focusing on the ability to foresee and confront challenges while ensuring the continuity of operations and performance maintenance under adverse conditions.

In 2022, we continued to focus on our main revenue growth priorities, which include helping marketers use our products to connect with consumers and making our ads more relevant and effective. We experienced a reduction in advertising demand during 2022 compared to 2021, primarily driven by reduced marketer spending as a result of a more challenging macroeconomic environment, as well as limitations on our ad targeting and measurement tools arising from changes to iOS and the regulatory environment. In response to these pressures, we initiated a series of cost management initiatives, including facilities consolidation and a layoff of approximately 11,000 employees, which were part of our restructuring efforts aimed at pursuing greater efficiency and realigning our business and strategic priorities. We expect to incur significant additional restructuring charges as we continue to focus on cost efficiency measures through 2023. Our operational flexibility has been impacted by external disturbances, including the war in Ukraine, which restricted access to our services in Russia and adversely affected user growth and engagement. The COVID-19 pandemic also had a varied impact on our business, contributing to fluctuations in advertising demand and pricing. We believe that the pandemic accelerated the growth of online commerce, leading to increased demand for advertising, although this growth has subsequently declined as activities shifted back to in-person settings. To mitigate the effects of these disruptions, we are working to evolve our advertising systems and developing privacy-enhancing technologies to improve performance while reducing the amount of personal information processed. Our investment philosophy emphasizes addressing major social issues, building new experiences, and supporting businesses that rely on our services. We anticipate that investments in our data center capacity and technical infrastructure will continue to drive expense growth, which may adversely affect our operating margin and profitability. We are also making significant investments in our metaverse efforts, which are expected to be complex, evolving, and long-term initiatives. Our ability to support these efforts is dependent on generating sufficient profits from other areas of our business. We recognize that our organizational capabilities must adapt to the dynamic landscape, and we are engaging with industry peers to explore new standards for data processing in advertising. The trends impacting our advertising spend are dynamic and interrelated, making it challenging to quantify the exact impact of each trend on our revenue. Our financial condition is influenced by various factors, including inflation, rising interest rates, and competitive pressures, which have led to reduced marketer spending. We continuously evaluate our liquidity and capital resources to ensure we can finance our future capital requirements and maintain operational continuity. The uncertainties surrounding our business environment necessitate a proactive approach to risk management and organizational resilience, enabling us to confront and adapt to unexpected situations while striving for sustained performance and growth.

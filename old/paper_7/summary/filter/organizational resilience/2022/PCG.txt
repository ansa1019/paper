The California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) initiated a formal investigation into PG&E Corporation's organizational culture and governance, focusing on whether these elements prioritize safety and effectively direct resources to promote accountability and achieve safety goals and standards. The investigation, known as the "safety culture oii," directed the Safety and Enforcement Division (SED) to evaluate the utility's organizational culture, governance, policies, practices, and accountability metrics in relation to its operational record, including safety incidents. This evaluation implicitly relates to organizational resilience by examining how the utility's internal practices and governance structures can absorb strain and maintain operational integrity under challenging conditions, particularly in the context of safety and accountability. The investigation seeks to understand how PG&E Corporation's organizational culture can adapt to external pressures and ensure effective resource allocation to mitigate risks associated with safety incidents. By assessing the utility's ability to confront and respond to safety challenges, the CPUC aims to identify mechanisms that promote organizational resilience, thereby enhancing the utility's capacity to function effectively amidst adversity and maintain performance standards. The focus on governance and accountability metrics underscores the importance of organizational practices in fostering resilience, as these elements are critical in navigating disruptive events and ensuring operational continuity. The investigation highlights the need for a systemic perspective on organizational health, emphasizing the role of internal knowledge and strategic initiatives in building resilience against environmental disturbances and operational failures. Through this inquiry, the CPUC aims to promote a culture of safety that not only addresses immediate concerns but also supports long-term organizational effectiveness and adaptability in the face of future challenges.

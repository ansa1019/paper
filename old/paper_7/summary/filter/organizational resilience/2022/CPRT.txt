We believe we contribute to disaster recovery and resilience in the communities we serve. For example, we mobilized our people, entered into emergency leases, and engaged with a multitude of service providers to timely retrieve, store, and remarket tens of thousands of flood-damaged vehicles in the New York metropolitan area in the wake of Hurricane Ida in the fall of 2021. Additionally, we contribute to economic development and well-being by enabling more affordable access to mobility around the world. Many of the automobiles sold through our auction platform are purchased for use in developing countries where affordable transportation is a critical enabler of education, health care, and well-being more generally. Our actions reflect a commitment to organizational resilience by addressing external pressures and adapting to environmental disruptions, thereby enhancing our operational flexibility and supporting community resilience in challenging conditions.

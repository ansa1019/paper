Abbott has continually monitored the effects of the pandemic on its operations and has taken aggressive steps to limit exposure to COVID-19 and enhance the safety of facilities for its employees. Throughout the pandemic, Abbott ensured that its operations worldwide were aligned with specific governmental orders and guidelines affecting each location. Despite challenges, overall volume trends improved in several cardiovascular businesses in 2021 and 2022. Abbott has also taken various actions to mitigate the impact of the recall on the supply of formula in the U.S., which included prioritization of infant formula production and increased production at various manufacturing sites. The company has managed to navigate various supply chain challenges without significant supply disruption or shortage for services, raw materials, and supplies. Abbott's operating margin as a percentage of sales increased from 15.5 percent in 2020 to 19.6 percent in 2021, reflecting the impact of sales volume increases for COVID-19 tests and growth across virtually all of Abbott's businesses, partially offset by inflation and supply chain challenges. The future extent to which inflation, supply chain disruptions, and unfavorable foreign exchange rates may have a material effect on Abbott's operating results is uncertain. Abbott's diagnostics segment experienced significant changes in sales due to the pandemic, with COVID-19 testing-related sales totaling approximately $8.4 billion in 2022. The demand for COVID-19 tests has been volatile, and Abbott is evaluating potential impacts of the end of the public health emergency. The company expects the COVID-19 pandemic to shift to an endemic state in 2023, likely resulting in significantly lower demand for COVID-19 tests. Abbott's nutritional and diabetes care businesses were the least affected by the pandemic, while the cardiovascular and neuromodulation businesses faced challenges due to surges of COVID-19 and healthcare staffing issues. The company has focused on launching various new products and expanding its market position across its businesses. Abbott's research and development efforts are directed towards advancing products in development and enhancing operational capabilities. The company has also engaged in restructuring plans to streamline operations and improve efficiencies across its segments. Abbott's financial position remains strong, with cash and cash equivalents totaling approximately $10.2 billion and a long-term debt of $16.8 billion. The company expects to maintain an investment-grade rating and has readily available financial resources to support its operations. Abbott's strategic initiatives include focusing on growth in emerging markets and continuing to invest in product development areas that provide opportunities for sustainable growth. The company is committed to ensuring operational continuity and resilience in the face of external pressures and market volatility.

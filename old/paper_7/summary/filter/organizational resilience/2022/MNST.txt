The Canarchy transaction facilitates our entry into the alcohol beverage sector and brings various brands to our beverage portfolio. Our organizational structure for our existing energy beverage business remains unchanged. Canarchy is functioning independently, retaining its own organizational structure and team. Provisions in our organizational documents and/or control by insiders may prevent changes in control even if such changes would be beneficial to other stockholders.

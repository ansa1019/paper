scholars have defined organizational resilience as “the maintenance of positive adjustment under challenging conditions” (vogus & sutcliffe, 2007: 3418). organizational resilience is defined as the organization’s ability to absorb strain and preserve or improve functioning despite the presence of adversity. resilience can be defined as the system’s ability to maintain its integrity and its performance, at least partially, while under internal or external variations and disturbances (i.e. pressures, constraints, failures, errors, violations, hazards), whether nominal, extreme, or exceptional. the concept of resilience draws attention to systems as well as individuals, to partial maintenance of integrity and performance, to the opposite of brittleness, and to disturbances that vary both in scale and source. resilience is a multifaceted concept that reflects businesses’ ability to foresee, confront, and benefit from sudden disruptive change to survive, grow, and flourish. the organization’s ability to respond effectively to environmental disruptions and transform itself to emerge stronger from a challenging situation is critical. organizations must develop a trajectory model of resilience that focuses on how actors project temporal trajectories of responses toward disruptive events, reconstitute the trajectories in immediate response to the event, and reconfigure the trajectories toward the ensuing future. this involves understanding the complexities of organizational dynamics, including the management of internal knowledge, resource allocation, and operational flexibility in the face of external pressures. organizations must also engage in strategic initiatives and inter-organizational collaboration to enhance their resilience capabilities. the ability to adapt and innovate in response to unexpected situations and environmental perturbations is essential for maintaining organizational health and effectiveness. resilience strategies should include mechanisms for risk assessment, resource generation, and crisis management to ensure operational continuity and performance maintenance under pressure. organizations must also focus on developing emotional resources and social capital to support their resilience efforts, as well as fostering a culture of learning and adaptability. the integration of strategic foresight and proactive measures into organizational practices can enhance resilience by enabling firms to anticipate and respond to potential disruptions. organizations should also consider the implications of performance variability and the need for effective decision-making processes to navigate complex situations. ultimately, the strength of an organization’s resilience lies in its ability to manage change, leverage knowledge, and maintain coherence in the face of adversity, ensuring survival and growth in turbulent markets.

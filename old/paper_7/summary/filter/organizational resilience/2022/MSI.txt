We manage our business organizationally through two segments: "products and systems integration" and "software and services." Within these segments, we have principal product lines that also follow our three major technologies: LMR communications, video, and command center. In January 2023, we began using command center as a naming convention, eliminating the "software" descriptor from command center software in order to inform investors that the company has software components more broadly across all technologies; this name change does not require any financial information to be reclassified from previous periods. The organizational structure and segmentation may contribute to our operational flexibility and adaptability in response to external pressures and market demands. By maintaining a clear delineation of product lines and technologies, we enhance our ability to absorb strain and preserve functioning despite potential disruptions. The integration of software components across all technologies reflects an understanding of the need for resource allocation and innovation in the face of changing customer needs and environmental turbulence. Our strategic initiatives are designed to ensure business continuity and operational resilience, allowing us to confront unexpected situations and maintain performance under pressure. The reconfiguration of our naming conventions indicates a proactive measure to align our organizational identity with market expectations, thereby enhancing our competitive advantage. This approach also underscores our commitment to organizational health and effectiveness, as we strive to reconstitute our operational strategies in response to evolving challenges. By fostering inter-organizational collaboration and leveraging internal knowledge, we aim to build a resilient framework that supports our long-term objectives and enhances our capacity for recovery from adverse conditions. The emphasis on strategic planning and foresight is critical in navigating the complexities of the business environment, ensuring that we remain agile and responsive to both internal variations and external disturbances. Our focus on performance maintenance and the development of dynamic capabilities positions us to thrive in turbulent markets, ultimately contributing to our organizational success and sustainability.

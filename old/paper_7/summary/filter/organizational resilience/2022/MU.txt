Our consolidated results for the year ended 2022 indicate that total revenue increased 11% compared to 2021, primarily due to increases in sales of both DRAM and NAND products, reflecting our operational flexibility and adaptability in response to market demands. However, in the fourth quarter of 2022, the memory and storage industry environment deteriorated sharply due to global and macroeconomic challenges, leading to significant reductions in bit shipments and average selling prices, which exemplifies the external pressures faced by our organization. To address elevated inventory levels and reduce supply growth, we are selectively reducing facility utilization in both DRAM and NAND, demonstrating our strategic response to unexpected situations. Our consolidated gross margin percentage increased to 45% for 2022 from 38% for 2021, driven by improvements in margins for both product lines, indicating a positive adjustment under challenging conditions. We are continuously evaluating alternatives for efficiently funding our capital expenditures and ongoing operations, which reflects our commitment to resource allocation and operational management. Furthermore, we plan to invest in two leading-edge memory manufacturing fabs in the United States, contingent on government support, which aligns with our future orientation and strategic initiatives to enhance our capabilities in response to anticipated memory demand. Our board of directors has authorized a discretionary repurchase of up to $10 billion of our outstanding common stock, which is subject to market conditions and reflects our organizational strength and resilience strategies. The preparation of financial statements involves significant judgment and estimates, particularly in assessing contingencies and the realizability of deferred tax assets, which underscores the complexity and dynamic capabilities required in our operations. We have implemented changes in our inventory costing method to better manage resource utilization and mitigate risks associated with market volatility. Our management believes that our cash and investments, cash flows from operations, and available financing will be sufficient to meet our requirements at least through the next 12 months, indicating our operational continuity and resilience in maintaining performance under pressure. The increase in cash provided by operating activities for 2022 compared to 2021 was primarily due to higher net income adjusted for non-cash items, reflecting our organizational effectiveness and ability to absorb strain. We are also subject to various contingencies that require significant judgment to estimate potential losses, which highlights the importance of risk management and organizational foresight in our financial planning. Overall, our strategic planning and operational management are focused on sustaining growth and adapting to environmental disruptions, ensuring our organizational survival and success in a turbulent market landscape.

As previously announced, on November 20, 2022, Robert A. Iger returned to the company as Chief Executive Officer ("CEO") and a director, with a mandate from the company's board of directors "to set the strategic direction for renewed growth and to work closely with the board in developing a successor to lead the company at the completion of his term." The company anticipates that Mr. Iger will initiate organizational and operating changes within the company to address the board's goals. The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly impacted operations, particularly at DPEP, where theme parks and resorts were closed, and at DMED, where theatrical releases were delayed or canceled, highlighting the need for effective crisis management and operational flexibility. Operations have resumed at various points since May 2020, but many businesses continue to experience impacts from COVID-19, such as increased health and safety measures and related expenses, capacity restrictions, and disruptions in content production activities. The impact of COVID-19-related disruptions on financial and operational results will depend on the duration and severity of the pandemic and governmental actions imposed in response. The company has incurred and will continue to incur additional costs to address government regulations and the safety of employees, guests, and talent. The company believes that its financial condition is strong and that its cash balances, other liquid assets, operating cash flows, access to debt and equity capital markets, and borrowing capacity provide adequate resources to fund ongoing operating requirements and upcoming debt maturities, as well as future capital expenditures related to the expansion of existing businesses and development of new projects. The company's operational management strategies include maintaining operational continuity and adapting to external pressures, which are critical for sustaining organizational resilience. The increase in operating cash flow at DPEP was due to higher operating cash receipts driven by increased revenue, partially offset by higher operating cash disbursements due to increased operating expenses. The company evaluates the performance of its operating segments based on segment operating income, which assists investors in evaluating changes in the operating results of the company's portfolio of businesses. The company has taken an intentionally flexible approach to distribution, allowing for adjustments in response to changing market conditions. This flexibility is essential for maintaining organizational effectiveness and resilience in the face of environmental disruptions. The company recognizes the importance of strategic initiatives and inter-organizational collaboration to enhance its resilience strategies. The restructuring and change in business strategy, once determined, could result in impairment charges, emphasizing the need for effective resource allocation and risk assessment. The company has incurred restructuring and impairment charges primarily due to asset impairments and severance costs related to operational adjustments. The increase in segment operating income reflects growth at DPEP, driven by higher attendance and spending at theme parks, which underscores the importance of adaptability and responsiveness to customer needs. The company's ability to foresee and confront sudden disruptive changes is critical for its survival and growth, reinforcing the multifaceted nature of organizational resilience.

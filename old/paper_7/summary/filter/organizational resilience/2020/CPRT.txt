We believe we contribute to disaster recovery and resilience in the communities we serve. For example, we mobilized our people, entered into emergency leases, and engaged with a multitude of service providers to timely retrieve, store, and remarket tens of thousands of flood-damaged vehicles in the Houston, Texas metropolitan area in the wake of Hurricane Harvey in the summer of 2017. We also support the world's communities by enabling more affordable access to mobility around the world, which contributes to economic development and well-being. Many of the automobiles sold through our auction platform are purchased for use in developing countries where affordable transportation is a critical enabler of education, health care, and well-being more generally. The special role we play in responding to catastrophic weather events highlights our organizational capabilities in crisis management and recovery, demonstrating our ability to adapt and respond effectively to environmental disruptions. Our efforts reflect a commitment to maintaining operational continuity and supporting community resilience in the face of adversity.

These organizational and process changes impact frequency and severity statistics as changes in claim opening and closing practices and shifts in timing, if any, can impact comparisons to prior periods. The ability to respond effectively to environmental disruptions and transform itself to emerge stronger from a challenging situation is essential for maintaining organizational resilience. This resilience reflects the organization’s capacity to absorb strain and preserve or improve functioning despite the presence of adversity. It emphasizes the importance of maintaining integrity and performance under internal or external variations and disturbances, whether nominal, extreme, or exceptional. The multifaceted nature of resilience draws attention to the organization’s ability to foresee, confront, and benefit from sudden disruptive change, which is critical for survival, growth, and flourishing. The changes in organizational practices and processes can significantly influence the organization’s operational flexibility and adaptability, which are vital for effective crisis management and recovery. Furthermore, the organization’s strategic response to pressures and constraints, as well as its ability to manage risks and reconfigure resources, plays a crucial role in sustaining performance under pressure. The integration of knowledge management and the development of collaborative networks enhance the organization’s capabilities to navigate complex situations and environmental turbulence. The emphasis on strategic initiatives and future planning enables the organization to project temporal trajectories of responses toward disruptive events and to reconstitute these trajectories in immediate response to challenges. Overall, the organization’s resilience is characterized by its dynamic capabilities, which facilitate performance maintenance and operational continuity in the face of adversity.

This annual report on Form 10-K may include projections, goals, assumptions, and statements that represent beliefs regarding future events, many of which are inherently uncertain and outside AIG's control. These projections may relate to future actions, prospective services or products, future performance or results of current and anticipated services or products, and the outcome of contingencies such as legal proceedings and anticipated organizational changes. The effect of catastrophes, such as the COVID-19 crisis, and macroeconomic events are also considered, which highlights the organization's need to respond effectively to environmental disruptions. General operating and other expenses decreased in 2020 compared to 2019 primarily due to lower employee-related expenses and a reduction in travel expenses as a result of the COVID-19 crisis, demonstrating operational flexibility and adaptation to external pressures. The declines in expenses were partially offset by increases caused by acquisitions, indicating a strategic response to enhance organizational capabilities through resource generation and reconfiguration. General operating and other expenses for 2020, 2019, and 2018 included significant pre-tax restructuring and other costs primarily comprised of employee severance charges and costs related to organizational simplification, operational efficiency, and business rationalization, which reflect efforts to maintain performance under pressure and ensure organizational health. The emphasis on operational continuity and the integration of acquired businesses underscores the importance of resilience strategies and mechanisms in navigating complex situations and ensuring long-term survival and growth. The management succession and retention plans also indicate a focus on organizational strength and the development of human capital as a critical component of resilience. Overall, the report illustrates AIG's commitment to adapting to challenges and enhancing its operational management to sustain performance amidst environmental turbulence and uncertainty.

Throughout fiscal 2021, we have operated with a clear set of priorities to guide our decision making through the COVID-19 pandemic, supporting our associates on the front lines in terms of their physical safety, financial health, and emotional well-being. We are providing extra pay and benefits, including special cash bonuses to associates and the introduction of a COVID-19 emergency leave policy in the U.S. We have taken certain strategic actions to strengthen our Walmart International portfolio for the long term, including acquisitions and divestitures that reflect our adaptability to changing market conditions. The pandemic led to significant economic pressures and channel and mix shifts due to changes in consumer behavior, including accelerated growth in e-commerce in several markets. We expect continued uncertainty in our business and the global economy due to the duration and intensity of the COVID-19 pandemic, which may impact our results. Our objective of prioritizing strong, efficient growth means we will focus on the most productive growth opportunities, increasing comparable store and club sales, accelerating e-commerce sales growth, and expanding omni-channel initiatives. We define our financial framework as strong, efficient growth, consistent operating discipline, and strategic capital allocation. We measure operating discipline through expense leverage, which we define as net sales growing at a faster rate than operating expenses. Our operating expenses as a percentage of net sales benefited from strong growth in comparable sales and lapping prior year business restructuring charges, although these benefits were offset by incremental costs related to the COVID-19 pandemic. The increase in net cash provided by operating activities for fiscal 2021 was primarily due to the impact of the global health crisis, which accelerated inventory sell-through, as well as the timing and payment of inventory purchases. We maintained more cash at January 31, 2021, compared to January 31, 2020, to provide enhanced financial flexibility due to uncertainties related to the pandemic. Our working capital deficit decreased significantly, driven by the increase in cash and cash equivalents as well as the increase in current assets and current liabilities. We utilize intercompany financing arrangements to ensure cash can be made available in the country in which it is needed with minimal cost. The pandemic has prompted us to enhance our operational management and strategic response mechanisms, focusing on maintaining operational continuity and resilience in the face of external pressures. Our performance metrics indicate that we have effectively managed to sustain operations and adapt to the evolving business environment, demonstrating organizational resilience through strategic initiatives and resource allocation. The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in overall net sales growth during fiscal 2021, with strong comparable sales in the U.S. and the majority of our international markets, positively affected by e-commerce growth acceleration. We continue to focus on creating a seamless omni-channel experience for our customers, which is essential for maintaining competitive advantage and organizational health. The challenges posed by the pandemic have reinforced our commitment to strategic foresight and operational flexibility, enabling us to confront adversity and sustain performance under pressure.

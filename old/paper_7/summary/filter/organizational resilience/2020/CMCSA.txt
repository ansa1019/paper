COVID-19 materially impacted our 2020 results of operations, demonstrating the organization's ability to absorb strain and preserve functioning despite adversity. The distribution network performed well under the stress of increased traffic and peak usage driven by increased video streaming, gaming, and videoconferencing as customers worked and learned remotely from home. We incurred costs associated with compensating personnel in roles affected by COVID-19, including additional compensation for frontline personnel who worked to keep our customers connected. We implemented programs to support customer connectivity, including waiving certain fees and providing flexible payment options, reflecting our commitment to business continuity and customer needs during unexpected situations. The deterioration of economic conditions and increased uncertainty resulting from COVID-19 have resulted in reduced demand for certain services and increased risks associated with collections on outstanding receivables. Our liquidity, although negatively impacted, is expected to continue generating significant cash flows from operating activities, bolstering our financial position amid economic pressures. We took actions to conservatively manage cash through reductions in costs and capital expenditures, which are part of our strategic response to maintain operational flexibility. The temporary closure of theme parks significantly impacted our revenue and adjusted EBITDA, highlighting the challenges posed by extreme conditions. We expect the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic will continue to have a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations over the near to medium term, although we anticipate recovery strategies will evolve as conditions change. Our businesses implemented separate cost savings initiatives, including severance at NBCUniversal, to realign operational structures and reduce costs. We do not anticipate significant incremental costs under these plans, and cost savings may be reallocated to investments in content and other strategic initiatives. The creation and availability of our film and television programming have been disrupted, affecting our operational management and requiring adaptation strategies to navigate these challenges. We expect results in our filmed entertainment segment to continue to be negatively impacted over the near to medium term as a result of COVID-19. The postponement and cancellation of sporting events impacted our results, as advertising revenues and costs associated with broadcasting these programs are recognized when events are broadcast. Our assessment of goodwill and cable franchise rights reflects our ongoing evaluation of organizational health and performance under pressure, ensuring we maintain a proactive approach to risk management. We continue to evaluate the impacts of COVID-19 on our businesses, including the implications of overall economic conditions, which could result in the recognition of an impairment charge in the future. Our strategic initiatives are focused on maintaining operational continuity and adapting to the evolving business environment, ensuring we remain resilient in the face of external disturbances and competitive pressures.

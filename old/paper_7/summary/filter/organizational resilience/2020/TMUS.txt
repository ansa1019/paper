The merger enhanced our spectrum portfolio, increased our customer base, altered our product mix, and created opportunities for synergies in our operations. We expect to achieve significant synergies and cost reductions by eliminating redundancies within the combined network as well as other business processes and operations. Our response to the COVID-19 pandemic has included various steps to mitigate its impact on our customers and protect the health and well-being of our workforce and communities. As a critical communications infrastructure provider, our focus has been on providing crucial connectivity to our customers while ensuring operational continuity. We have implemented remote working arrangements for many employees and encouraged healthy practices such as social distancing and increased sanitation in all our facilities. We have not terminated service to any residential or small business customers due to their inability to pay their bills because of disruptions caused by the pandemic, and we waived late fees incurred by these customers. We have also taken temporary steps to ensure that all current customers with smartphone data plans were provided connectivity to learn and work remotely. Our restructuring initiatives following the merger aim to realize cost efficiencies, and we are evaluating additional restructuring initiatives that could affect our business operations. The pandemic has resulted in significant volatility in the U.S. and international markets, leading to economic uncertainty and increased unemployment, which could affect our customers' purchasing decisions and ability to make timely payments. The extent to which the pandemic impacts our business will depend on numerous future developments, including the duration and scope of the pandemic and the success of governmental and individual actions taken in response. We have incurred substantial expenses as a result of completing the merger and compliance with government commitments, and we are expected to incur substantial restructuring expenses in connection with integrating the businesses. Our liquidity requirements have been driven primarily by capital expenditures for spectrum licenses and the construction and expansion of our network infrastructure. We expect cash purchases of property and equipment to be significant in the coming years as we build out our nationwide 5G network. We have entered into financing arrangements that allow us to extend payment terms for invoices payable to certain vendors, which supports our operational flexibility. The merger has altered the size and scope of our operations, impacting our assets, liabilities, obligations, capital requirements, and performance measures. We are committed to maintaining our operational effectiveness and adapting to the challenges posed by the current business environment. Our strategic initiatives are designed to enhance our operational capabilities, ensuring we can respond effectively to external pressures and maintain our competitive advantage in the market. We continue to monitor developments regarding the pandemic and evaluate appropriate steps to align with guidelines from government agencies while doing what is best for our employees and customers.

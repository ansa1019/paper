We have been taking protective measures to limit disruptions to our supply chain and sales to limit potential negative impacts on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. We continue to increase our resources in customer service & logistics as well as in our factories and on our customs support teams. We are adapting our systems and processes for new and increased customs transactions. We continue to enhance resilience plans to aid in dealing with anticipated border delays. We are working to address new regulatory requirements such as packaging changes. Additionally, we continue to closely monitor and manage our inventory levels of imported raw materials, packaging and finished goods in the U.K. Any disagreements on trade terms or supply chain or distribution delays or other disruptions could negatively affect our U.K. business. The costs incurred that relate to the objectives of our program to transform our supply chain network and organizational structure reflect non-GAAP adjustments related to the simplify to grow program.

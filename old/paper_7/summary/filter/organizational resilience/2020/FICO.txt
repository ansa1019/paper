During fiscal 2020, we announced the launch of the FICO® Resilience Index, a new analytic tool designed to complement FICO® score models by identifying those consumers who are most resilient to economic stress relative to other consumers within the same FICO® score bands. The FICO® Resilience Index would enable industry participants to more precisely assess credit risk and extend credit to more consumers throughout the economic cycle by managing the risk that emerges during periods of economic stress. This initiative reflects our commitment to understanding and addressing external pressures and environmental disruptions that impact consumer behavior and creditworthiness. We continue to grow our business-to-consumer partnership with Experian, a leading global information services provider, which enhances our ability to respond effectively to market demands and adapt to changing economic conditions. Our industry-leading business-to-business FICO® scores have achieved a multi-year expansion in the growing U.S. business-to-consumer market, demonstrating our operational flexibility and strategic response to evolving consumer needs. The FICO® score open access program, which allows our participating clients to provide their customers with a free FICO® score along with content to help them understand the FICO® score their lender uses, has more than 240 million consumer accounts with access to their free FICO® scores. This program exemplifies our focus on resource generation and the deployment of strategic tools to enhance customer engagement and support systems. We continue to pursue additional partners to distribute FICO® scores with their product offerings sold directly to consumers, which indicates our proactive measures in fostering inter-organizational collaboration and expanding our market presence. The multifaceted nature of our initiatives underscores our organizational capabilities in navigating complex situations and maintaining performance under pressure, ultimately contributing to our resilience in a turbulent market environment.

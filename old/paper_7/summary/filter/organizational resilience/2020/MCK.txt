We implemented a new segment reporting structure commencing with the second quarter of 2021, which resulted in four reportable segments: U.S. pharmaceutical, international, medical-surgical solutions, and prescription technology solutions ("Rxts"). Other, for retrospective periods presented, consists of our equity method investment in Change Healthcare LLC ("Change Healthcare JV"), which was split-off from McKesson in the fourth quarter of 2020. All prior segment information has been recast to reflect our new segment structure and current period presentation. Our organizational structure also includes corporate, which consists of income and expenses associated with administrative functions and projects, and the results of certain investments. The factors for determining the reportable segments include the manner in which management evaluates the performance of the company combined with the nature of individual business activities. We evaluate the performance of our operating segments on a number of measures, including revenues and operating profit before interest expense and income taxes. The adaptability of our organizational structure allows for a strategic response to environmental disruptions, ensuring that we can maintain operational continuity and performance under pressure. This reconfiguration of our reporting segments reflects our commitment to organizational resilience, enabling us to absorb strain and preserve functioning despite internal or external variations and disturbances. By focusing on performance metrics that include revenues and operating profit, we are positioned to confront challenges and enhance our organizational effectiveness, thereby supporting our major objectives and fostering a culture of continuous improvement. Our approach emphasizes the importance of strategic initiatives and resource allocation in navigating complex situations and maintaining organizational health. The evaluation of our segments is integral to our resilience strategies, as it allows us to identify areas for improvement and innovation in response to market demands and external pressures. This structured evaluation process contributes to our overall resilience by ensuring that we can effectively manage risks and adapt to changing circumstances while striving for growth and sustainability in a turbulent business environment.

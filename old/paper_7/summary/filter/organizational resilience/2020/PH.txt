The business realignment charges consist primarily of severance and plant closure costs related to actions taken under the company's simplification initiative aimed at reducing organizational and process complexity, which is being implemented by its operating units throughout the world. During 2020, business realignment charges also include permanent workforce reductions to address the impact of covid-19 on our business. We anticipate that cost savings realized from the workforce reduction measures taken during 2020 will increase operating income for 2021 by approximately five percent in the diversified industrial North American operations and by approximately two percent in the diversified industrial international operations. In 2021, we expect to continue to take actions necessary to structure appropriately the operations of the diversified industrial segment. These actions are expected to result in approximately $53 million in business realignment charges in 2021. However, continually changing business conditions could impact the ultimate costs we incur.

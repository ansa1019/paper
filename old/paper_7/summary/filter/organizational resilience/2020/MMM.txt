3M recorded non-divestiture-related restructuring pre-tax charges aggregating $195 million in 2020, which included charges in the second quarter of 2020 to address certain COVID-related impacts and in the fourth quarter as 3M initiated actions to further enhance its operational and marketing capabilities. In 2019, charges included $282 million as the company committed to actions in light of slower than expected 2019 sales and associated with realigning its organizational structure and operating model. During the second quarter of 2019, in light of slower than expected 2019 sales, and additionally in the fourth quarter to realign 3M's organizational structure and operating model, management approved and committed to undertake certain restructuring actions. The resulting charges included $246 million impacting operating income (and $36 million impacting other expense (income)). These actions reflect the company's strategic response to external pressures and its efforts to adapt to changing market conditions, thereby maintaining operational flexibility and enhancing its capabilities in response to disruptive events. The restructuring efforts are indicative of 3M's approach to organizational change processes aimed at preserving performance under pressure and addressing resource constraints. The company's commitment to reconfiguring its operational model in response to environmental disruptions demonstrates a multifaceted strategy to ensure organizational resilience and effectiveness in navigating adversity.

The company is committed to investing in infrastructure modernization to meet the growing needs and expectations of customers while aligning with sustainability and climate goals. PSEG's transformation into a primarily regulated electric and gas utility is focused on meeting customer expectations and managing risks associated with regulatory changes and fluctuating commodity prices. The company emphasizes operational performance while developing opportunities in both competitive and regulated businesses, and its financial strength is predicated on a solid balance sheet and positive operating cash flow. PSEG's strategic planning includes investments in T&D facilities to enhance reliability and resiliency, as well as clean energy investments. The company continues to assess a broad range of strategic options to maximize long-term stockholder value and address the interests of multiple stakeholders, including investments in offshore wind with long-term contracts that provide predictability and reasonable risk-adjusted returns. PSEG's future success will depend on maintaining strong operational and financial performance, effectively managing energy obligations, and advocating for policies that promote fair and efficient electricity markets. The ongoing impacts of the coronavirus pandemic and associated economic conditions are expected to present challenges, and PSEG is committed to adapting its strategies to ensure organizational resilience in the face of these pressures.

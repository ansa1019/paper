Selling, general and administrative expenses were essentially flat, primarily reflecting lower charges in 2020 for the organizational efficiency plan and the risk corridors claim recovery recognized in the third quarter of 2020. The organizational efficiency plan is consistent with our commitment to affordability for our customers and clients; during the fourth quarter of 2019, the company committed to a plan to increase our organizational alignment and operational efficiency and reduce costs. As a result, we recognized a charge in selling, general and administrative expenses of $207 million, pre-tax, in the fourth quarter of 2019 and an additional charge of $31 million pre-tax in the first quarter of 2020. We expect to realize annualized after-tax savings of approximately $200 million, with a substantial portion of the savings realized in 2020. This approach reflects the organization's ability to adapt to internal and external pressures while maintaining operational effectiveness. The measures taken under the organizational efficiency plan demonstrate a strategic response to enhance operational flexibility and resource allocation, contributing to the overall resilience of the organization in the face of economic challenges. The focus on operational efficiency and alignment indicates a proactive measure to ensure business continuity and mitigate risks associated with external disturbances. By implementing these changes, the organization aims to preserve its performance and integrity, thereby enhancing its capacity to confront future adversities and maintain positive adjustment under challenging conditions. The commitment to operational efficiency is indicative of the organization's strategic foresight and adaptability, which are critical components of organizational resilience. The planned adjustments and the anticipated financial benefits underscore the organization's efforts to reconfigure its operational strategies in response to evolving market dynamics and pressures. This reflects an understanding of the importance of resource management and the need for continuous improvement in organizational practices to sustain performance under pressure. The organizational efficiency plan serves as a mechanism for recovery and transformation, positioning the company to emerge stronger from disruptive events and ensuring its long-term viability in a turbulent business environment. Overall, the initiatives undertaken are aligned with the principles of organizational resilience, emphasizing the importance of strategic adaptation, operational continuity, and the ability to absorb strain while improving functioning amidst adversity.

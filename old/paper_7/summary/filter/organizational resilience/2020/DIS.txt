In October 2020, the company announced a strategic reorganization of its media and entertainment businesses to accelerate the growth of its direct-to-consumer strategy. The operations of the media networks, studio entertainment, and direct-to-consumer segments were reorganized into four groups, which are focused on developing and producing content that will be used across all traditional and direct-to-consumer platforms. The COVID-19 pandemic significantly impacted the company, particularly in its parks, experiences, and products segment, where theme parks were closed or operated at reduced capacity, leading to substantial revenue losses. The company experienced significant disruptions in content production and availability, including delays in key live sports programming and the suspension of most film and television production. In response to these challenges, the company implemented various mitigation efforts, including increasing cash balances through the issuance of senior notes and entering into a $5.0 billion credit facility. The company suspended certain capital projects, reduced discretionary expenditures, and furloughed over 120,000 employees, many of whom have since returned as business operations reopened. The company also announced a workforce reduction plan impacting approximately 32,000 employees in the first half of fiscal 2021. The estimated adverse impact of COVID-19 on operating income across all businesses was approximately $7.4 billion, influenced by governmental actions and the uncertain duration of the pandemic. As operations resumed, the company incurred additional costs to comply with government regulations and ensure safety for employees and guests, including custodial services and personal protective equipment. The reopening of businesses is contingent upon government requirements, which vary by location and are subject to ongoing changes. The company has taken measures to mitigate the financial impact of COVID-19, including raising additional financing and potentially further suspending capital spending. The company believes that its financial condition remains strong, supported by cash balances, liquid assets, and access to capital markets, which provide adequate resources for ongoing operations and future capital expenditures. The company's strategic initiatives are aimed at adapting to the evolving business environment, focusing on operational flexibility and resilience in the face of external pressures. The anticipated costs associated with the pandemic are expected to total approximately $1 billion in fiscal 2021, reflecting the ongoing need to adapt to the changing operational landscape. The company recognizes the importance of maintaining organizational resilience through effective resource allocation, strategic planning, and the ability to confront and benefit from disruptive changes while ensuring operational continuity and performance maintenance.

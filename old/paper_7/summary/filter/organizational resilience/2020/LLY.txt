In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we have been focused on maintaining a reliable supply of our medicines; reducing the strain on the medical system; protecting the health, safety, and well-being of our employees; and ensuring affordability of and access to our medicines. We have experienced negative impacts to our underlying business due to the pandemic, including decreases in new prescriptions as a result of fewer patient visits to physician's offices and changes in payer segment mix. Additionally, we have experienced decreased demand due to lack of normal access and fewer in-person interactions by patients and employees with the healthcare system. We temporarily halted in-person interactions by our employees with healthcare providers and increased virtual interactions, demonstrating our operational flexibility and adaptability in response to unexpected situations. While in-person interactions have resumed in many locations, we may decide to halt such activity in the future, indicating our preparedness to adapt to changing conditions. Our ability to continue to operate without significant negative impacts will depend on our ability to protect our employees and our supply chain, highlighting the importance of resource allocation and risk management in maintaining organizational health. We have taken steps to protect our employees worldwide, particularly those working in manufacturing and distribution facilities. Although the pandemic has affected our operations, we have largely maintained normal operations and liquidity, reflecting our organizational resilience. The uncertainty resulting from the pandemic could adversely impact our manufacturing operations, global supply chain, and distribution systems, which could affect our ability to produce and distribute our products. We remain committed to discovering and developing new treatments, and we have resumed clinical trial activities after a temporary pause. However, significant delays or unexpected issues could adversely affect our ability to commercialize some assets in our product pipeline. Our long-term success depends on our ability to continually discover or acquire, develop, and commercialize innovative new medicines, which requires effective resource generation and strategic initiatives. The nature of the pharmaceutical business is high-risk, and we must invest in a large number of projects to maintain a successful portfolio of approved products. We expect that the entry of generic competition following the loss of patent exclusivity will cause a rapid and severe decline in revenue, necessitating strategic adaptation and resilience strategies to navigate these challenges. Our management continuously evaluates our liquidity and capital resources to ensure we can adequately finance our capital requirements, which include working capital for clinical trials and manufacturing materials. We anticipate our cash requirements will remain consistent with past levels relative to revenues, demonstrating our operational continuity and resilience in the face of external pressures. The COVID-19 pandemic has created additional pressure on health systems worldwide, and we continue to monitor the potential impacts of the economic environment and various international government funding levels on our operations. Our corporate risk-management policy aims to limit the impact of fluctuations in interest and currency exchange rates, further supporting our organizational resilience.

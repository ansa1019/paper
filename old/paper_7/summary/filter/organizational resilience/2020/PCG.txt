On August 27, 2015, the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) initiated a formal investigation into PG&E Corporation's organizational culture and governance, focusing on whether safety is prioritized and resources are adequately directed to promote accountability and achieve safety goals. The CPUC directed the Safety and Enforcement Division (SED) to evaluate PG&E's organizational culture, governance, policies, practices, and accountability metrics in relation to its operational record, including safety incidents. The SED engaged a consultant to assist in the investigation and prepare a report assessing PG&E's organizational practices, followed by a report on the implementation of the consultant's recommendations. On August 27, 2020, the CPUC adopted a final decision addressing climate adaptation outreach to disadvantaged communities and established requirements for each investor-owned utility (IOU) to create a "climate change team" with cross-departmental responsibilities, reporting directly to a designated executive at the senior vice president level or above. Each IOU is required to disclose changes in organizational structure, including the names and department titles of internal participants. Board members are instructed to oversee and prioritize climate adaptation planning, informed by senior leadership. The decision mandates that each IOU consider climate risks to assets, operations, and services under their direct control. Additionally, the IOUs are directed to seek acknowledgment in new contracts with third-party providers that long-term climate risk has been considered. Each IOU's completed Climate Vulnerability Assessment (CVA) will coincide with its ramp filing during its four-year General Rate Case (GRC) cycle, and they must detail resulting climate adaptation measures in a new chapter in future GRC applications. Each IOU must file a community engagement plan that details outreach on climate adaptation, covering all disadvantaged vulnerable communities and leveraging existing community outreach efforts. The proposals for the climate adaptation community engagement plans must be submitted one year prior to their CVA, with the first community engagement plan due in June 2023, as the utility's first CVA under this decision will be due in June 2024. A new memorandum account, the Climate Adaptation Vulnerability Assessment Memorandum Account, has been authorized to cover CVA costs and incremental costs of outreach. This structured approach reflects an organizational commitment to resilience through proactive measures and resource allocation aimed at addressing environmental disruptions and enhancing operational continuity in the face of climate-related challenges.

We have taken extensive measures to protect the health and safety of our employees and contractors at our facilities in response to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, modifying our workplace practices globally, which resulted in most of our employees working remotely for extended periods. We continue to monitor the implications of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, as well as our customers' and suppliers' businesses. In light of the changing nature and continuing uncertainty around the COVID-19 pandemic, our ability to predict the impact of COVID-19 on our business in future periods remains limited. We have also taken various actions to de-risk our business in light of the ongoing uncertainty, such as building semiconductor products to order instead of based on customer forecasts. Our strategy is designed to drive diversified and sustainable operating and financial results, combining best-of-breed technology leadership with unmatched scale on a common sales and administrative platform. The demand environment for our semiconductor products has been affected by various factors, including the ongoing pandemic, which may continue to cause fluctuations in our revenue. Our operational flexibility has been tested, and we have experienced various constraints in our supply chain due to the pandemic, including with respect to wafers and substrates, leading to extended supply lead times. The disruptions in our outsourced assembly and test capacity have largely resolved, allowing us to adapt our operations to the current environment. We recognize that significant customer concentration could materially affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition, particularly if we experience a loss of demand from any of our top customers. Our collaboration with leading OEM customers has enabled us to build extensive intellectual property and develop critical expertise regarding customer requirements, which enhances our organizational capabilities and resilience. We have established strong relationships with large global electronic component distributors, which support our operational management and resource allocation strategies. The ongoing uncertainty in the macroeconomic environment may impact our ability to maintain performance under pressure, necessitating proactive measures and strategic foresight to navigate potential disruptions. Our research and development investments are aimed at ensuring our products retain their technology leadership, which is crucial for our long-term adaptability and competitive advantage. The acquisition of the Symantec Corporation enterprise security business has strengthened our position and contributed to our resilience strategies by enhancing our cybersecurity solutions portfolio. We continue to assess the impact of external disturbances on our operational continuity and have implemented measures to ensure business continuity amid these challenges. Our organizational practices are focused on maintaining operational effectiveness and adapting to complex situations, which is essential for our survival and growth in turbulent markets. We believe our cash and cash equivalents on hand, cash flows from operations, and available credit will provide sufficient liquidity to operate our business and fund our obligations for the foreseeable future.

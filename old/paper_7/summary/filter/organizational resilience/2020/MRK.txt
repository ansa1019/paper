During 2020, Merck continued executing on its strategic priorities, reporting year-over-year sales growth despite the business challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic. The company experienced a partial recovery in the underlying demand for products across its key growth pillars in the latter part of the year. Merck employees across the organization maintained their important work, enrolling and maintaining clinical studies, progressing the pipeline, and ensuring the supply of and patient access to the company's portfolio of medically important medicines and vaccines. The company actively monitors the business development landscape for growth opportunities that meet its strategic criteria, demonstrating adaptability in its operations. Despite the pandemic, Merck remains confident in the fundamental underlying demand for its products and its prospects for long-term growth. The estimated negative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on Merck's sales was approximately $2.5 billion, largely attributable to the pharmaceutical segment, with approximately $50 million attributable to the animal health segment. The company believes that global health systems and patients have largely adapted to the impacts of COVID-19, although ongoing residual negative impacts are expected to persist, particularly during the first half of 2021. Merck's capital allocation priorities included completing business development transactions and investing in its pipeline, which reflects its commitment to operational flexibility and resource allocation. The company is focused on protecting the safety of its employees and ensuring that its supply of medicines and vaccines reaches its patients, contributing its scientific expertise to the development of antiviral approaches, and supporting healthcare providers and communities. Merck's restructuring program aims to optimize its manufacturing and supply network while reducing its global real estate footprint, with actions expected to be substantially completed by the end of 2023, resulting in annual net cost savings. The company is also pursuing opportunities that have the potential to drive both near- and long-term growth, including acquisitions and strategic collaborations to enhance its capabilities in oncology and animal health. Merck's response to environmental disruptions and external pressures demonstrates its commitment to resilience strategies and mechanisms that support organizational health and performance maintenance. The company has made significant investments in research and development, reflecting its focus on innovation and adaptability in response to changing market conditions. Merck's strong financial profile enables it to fund these initiatives while providing significant cash returns to shareholders, thus ensuring operational continuity and organizational survival in a turbulent market environment.

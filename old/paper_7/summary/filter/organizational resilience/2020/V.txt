This management's discussion and analysis provides a review of the results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity of Visa Inc. and its subsidiaries, outlining factors affecting recent and future earnings. COVID-19 continues to have an impact globally, and while we have been actively monitoring its spread, the extent to which it will ultimately affect our business remains difficult to predict. Our priority remains the safety of our employees, clients, and communities, and we are taking a measured approach in bringing employees back to the office, with most working remotely for the rest of 2020. We continue to maintain close contact with employees, clients, partners, and governments globally to help navigate these challenging times. Revenues in the latter half of fiscal 2020 were impacted by declines in volumes and transactions due to COVID-19, although we are exiting the year with improved results. We have taken measures to modify our business practices and reduce operating expenses, including scaling back hiring plans and restricting travel. The impact of COVID-19 on our business remains uncertain due to various factors, including the transmissibility and severity of the outbreak, the effectiveness of social distancing measures, and the development of effective treatments or vaccines. Our liquidity management involves evaluating cash requirements for operations and may include raising additional funds through debt or equity issuance. Our treasury policies aim to provide adequate liquidity to cover operating expenditures and ensure timely completion of payment settlement activities. We believe our projected sources of liquidity will be sufficient to meet our needs for more than the next 12 months. We hold approximately $7.7 billion of available liquidity globally to fund daily settlement in the event of client failures. We maintain and regularly review global settlement risk policies and procedures to manage settlement risk, which may require clients to post collateral if certain credit standards are not met. Our investment portfolio is designed to invest cash in securities to meet working capital and liquidity needs, and we will continue to review it in light of evolving market conditions. We are parties to various legal and regulatory proceedings, and our judgments regarding potential losses from these proceedings may materially affect our financial condition. We have established policies and control procedures to ensure that estimates and assumptions are appropriately governed and applied consistently. Our non-GAAP financial measures provide greater transparency into management's view of ongoing operating performance. We have entered into long-term incentive agreements with clients and partners to increase revenue by growing payments volume and driving innovation. Our operational flexibility and strategic initiatives are designed to adapt to changing conditions and maintain performance under pressure. We expect to continue investing in technology assets and payments system infrastructure to support our digital solutions and core business initiatives, which are essential for organizational resilience in the face of external disturbances and market volatility.

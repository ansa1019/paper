TJX temporarily closed all of its stores, online businesses, distribution centers, and offices in March 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, with associates working remotely where possible. The company took numerous steps designed to protect the health and well-being of associates and customers, establishing global task force teams focused on a broad range of strategies to navigate through this global health crisis. Upon reopening stores, TJX implemented new health and safety practices, including enhanced cleaning and social distancing protocols. The ongoing pandemic has led to modifications in operations, impacting consumer behavior and necessitating further adjustments to operations. The uncertainties in the global economy may impact the financial viability or business operations of some suppliers and service providers, which may interrupt the supply chain and require other changes to operations. The company has established practices including social distancing protocols, access to personal protective equipment, and enhanced cleaning efforts. The temporary closure of stores had a material impact on results of operations, financial position, and liquidity, resulting in a significant decline in net profit for the full fiscal year. The company generated $4.6 billion of operating cash flows during fiscal 2021 and ended the year with $10.5 billion of cash, increasing borrowing capacity by entering into a $500 million revolving credit facility. The challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic continue to evolve, and the company will continue to evaluate its financial position in light of future developments. The company negotiated rent deferrals for a significant number of stores, primarily for second quarter lease payments, with repayment at later dates. The impact of the pandemic resulted in impairment assessments for certain stores, leading to impairment charges related to operating lease right-of-use assets and store fixed assets. The company has implemented cost-saving initiatives to reduce ongoing variable and discretionary spending. The financial actions taken in response to the pandemic included issuing $4 billion in notes and refinancing higher interest notes with lower interest rate senior notes. The company continues to monitor developments, including government requirements and recommendations that could result in additional impacts to operations. The uncertainties surrounding the pandemic may lead to increased asset recovery and valuation risks, including impairment of stores and other assets. The company’s liquidity requirements have traditionally been funded through cash generated from operations, supplemented by short-term bank borrowings and the issuance of commercial paper. As of January 30, 2021, the company held $10.5 billion in cash, with a portion held by foreign subsidiaries. The company’s existing cash and cash equivalents, internally generated funds, and credit facilities are considered adequate to meet operating needs over the next fiscal year. The company expects its capital expenditures to be in the range of approximately $1.2 billion to $1.4 billion, including investments in infrastructure and distribution centers. The ongoing pandemic has caused significant challenges, and the company is focused on maintaining operational continuity and adapting to changing market conditions.

The business realignment charges consist primarily of severance and plant closure costs related to actions taken under the company's simplification initiative aimed at reducing organizational and process complexity, which is being implemented by its operating units throughout the world. The company anticipates that cost savings realized from the workforce reduction measures taken during 2018 will increase 2019 operating income by approximately three percent in both the diversified industrial North American and diversified industrial international operations. In 2019, the company expects to continue to take actions necessary to structure appropriately the operations of the diversified industrial segment, including the continued integration of 2017 acquisitions. Such actions are expected to result in approximately $35 million in charges in 2019. The majority of the diversified industrial international business realignment charges were incurred in Europe. In addition to the business realignment charges presented in the table above, the company recognized $12 million of expense associated with enhanced retirement benefits in connection with a plant closure during 2016. These actions reflect the organization's ability to adapt to internal and external pressures while maintaining operational flexibility and addressing resource allocation to enhance performance under challenging conditions. The focus on simplifying processes and reducing complexity indicates a strategic initiative aimed at improving organizational health and resilience in the face of disruptive events.

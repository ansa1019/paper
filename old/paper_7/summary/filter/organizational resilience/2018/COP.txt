Conocophillips' business strategy anticipates prices will remain cyclical and is designed to be resilient in lower price environments, with significant upside during periods of higher prices. Our value proposition principles focus on returns, maintain financial strength, grow our dividend, and pursue disciplined growth, executed in accordance with our priorities for allocating cash flows from the business.

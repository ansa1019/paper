During the third quarter of 2018, we made an organizational change to combine our artificial intelligence investments in edge computing with IoTG; accordingly, approximately $480 million of goodwill was reallocated from "all other" to the IoTG operating segment. This reallocation reflects our strategic response to internal variations and the need for operational flexibility in the face of evolving market demands. The integration of these investments is indicative of our commitment to enhancing organizational capabilities and maintaining performance under pressure, which are essential components of organizational resilience. By reconfiguring our resources and aligning them with major objectives, we aim to improve our adaptability to external pressures and environmental disruptions. This organizational change process is a proactive measure to ensure that we can confront challenges and sustain operational continuity, thereby preserving our integrity and performance amidst complex situations. The decision to combine these segments is part of our broader strategy to foster innovation and enhance our competitive advantage, ensuring that we can absorb strain and benefit from disruptive changes. Through this strategic initiative, we are reinforcing our resilience strategies, which are vital for navigating the uncertainties of the business environment and achieving long-term sustainability.

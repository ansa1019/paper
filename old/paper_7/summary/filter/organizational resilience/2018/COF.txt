The results of our individual businesses reflect the manner in which management evaluates performance and makes decisions about funding our operations and allocating resources. We may periodically change our business segments or reclassify business segment results based on modifications to our management reporting methodologies and changes in organizational alignment. Our internal management and reporting process employs various allocation methodologies, including funds transfer pricing, to assign certain balance sheet assets, deposits and other liabilities and their related revenue and expenses directly or indirectly attributable to each business segment. The allocation process is unique to each business segment and acquired businesses. Credit risk is the risk to current or projected financial condition and resilience arising from an obligor's failure to meet the terms of any contract with the company or otherwise perform as agreed. Underwriting decisions are generally based on an applicant's income, estimated debt-to-income ratio, and credit bureau information, along with collateral characteristics such as loan-to-value ("ltv") ratio, subject to maintaining resilience under a variety of stress conditions. Our auto loans generally have fixed interest rates and loan terms of 75 months or less, but can go up to 84 months. Similar to credit card accounts, the underwriting criteria are customized for individual products and marketing programs based on analysis of net present value of expected revenues, expenses and losses. We generally retain all of our auto loans, though we have securitized and sold auto loans in the past and may do so in the future. The underwriting process reflects our capacity to adapt to varying conditions and maintain operational continuity, emphasizing our strategic response to environmental disruptions.

TJX has evaluated a range of possible outcomes related to Brexit, sought to identify areas of concern, and implemented strategies to mitigate them. The company believes that these steps will help mitigate the operational risks that could result from Brexit. In addition, we continue to communicate with our associates about Brexit, including providing relevant information about additional procedures that may be required post-Brexit. Our European operations benefit from the free movement of goods and labor between the U.K. and the EU, and should the U.K. exit the EU, this could negatively impact our ability to efficiently move merchandise between the U.K. and the EU. We have developed a plan to realign our European division's supply chain to reduce the volume of merchandise flowing between the U.K. and the EU and have established resources and systems to support this plan. The company’s results are subject to risks and uncertainties, including those described in our risk factors, which can impact operational flexibility and overall performance. Our liquidity requirements have traditionally been funded through cash generated from operations, supplemented by short-term bank borrowings and the issuance of commercial paper. As of February 2, 2019, we believe our existing cash and cash equivalents, internally generated funds, and credit facilities are more than adequate to meet our operating needs over the next fiscal year. The increase in customer traffic across all segments indicates a positive adjustment under challenging conditions, reflecting our ability to adapt to market demands. Our consolidated net sales for fiscal 2019 totaled $39 billion, a 9% increase over fiscal 2018, driven primarily by an increase in customer traffic at each of our four segments. The fiscal 2019 increase in comp sales was primarily due to an increase in customer traffic, demonstrating our operational resilience in a competitive landscape. We also experienced a significant increase in net income, reflecting our effective management of resources and operational strategies. The company continues to invest in existing and new distribution centers, which supports our operational capabilities and enhances our ability to respond to market changes. Our strategic initiatives include enhancing our e-commerce capabilities, which represent a growing segment of our sales. The increase in segment profit margins across various segments indicates our ability to maintain performance under pressure, despite challenges such as increased supply chain costs and wage increases. The company’s proactive measures in risk management and resource allocation have positioned us to navigate environmental disruptions effectively. We have also established a robust framework for assessing risks and implementing strategies that enhance our organizational resilience. The ongoing investments in technology and systems are expected to further strengthen our operational management and adaptability in the face of future challenges. Overall, our focus on strategic planning, resource management, and operational flexibility underscores our commitment to sustaining organizational health and performance in a dynamic business environment.

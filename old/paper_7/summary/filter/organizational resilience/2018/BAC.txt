The corporation's ability to respond effectively to environmental disruptions and transform itself to emerge stronger from challenging situations is integral to its operational strategy. In preparation for the U.K. exit from the European Union, the corporation has implemented changes to its operating model, which are expected to enable continued service to clients with minimal disruption and retain operational flexibility. The corporation has established an enterprise-wide initiative to identify, assess, and monitor risks associated with the potential discontinuation of benchmarks, including LIBOR, and is actively engaged with global regulators to develop strategies for transitions to alternative reference rates. Risk management is a fundamental aspect of the corporation's operations, with a comprehensive approach that includes a defined risk framework and an articulated risk appetite statement. The corporation's risk appetite indicates the amount of capital, earnings, or liquidity it is willing to put at risk to achieve strategic objectives and business plans. This framework enables the corporation to maintain a strong and flexible financial position, allowing it to withstand challenging economic conditions and take advantage of organic growth opportunities. The corporation's strategic plan is aligned with its risk appetite, capital plan, and liquidity requirements, addressing strategic risks and ensuring that management regularly reviews business performance against these objectives. The corporation also conducts capital scenario management and stress forecasting to understand balance sheet, earnings, and capital sensitivities to economic and business scenarios, which is essential for maintaining financial resiliency. In managing operational risks, the corporation emphasizes the importance of sound processes, people, and systems, with a focus on proactive identification and management of risks. The corporation's approach to compliance and operational risk management is designed to ensure adherence to applicable laws and regulations, while also addressing reputational risks that may arise from its business practices. The corporation maintains contingency plans to respond to potential adverse economic or market stress, which include strategies for increasing capital and accessing funding sources. The management of credit risk is also critical, with ongoing assessments of borrower profiles and the use of statistical models to evaluate credit quality. The corporation's credit risk management practices are designed to mitigate losses and enhance customer support, particularly in consumer and commercial portfolios. The allowance for loan and lease losses reflects management's estimate of probable incurred credit losses, with adjustments made based on economic conditions and portfolio performance. The corporation's operational resilience is further supported by its ability to adapt to changes in the business environment, ensuring that it can meet customer needs and maintain effective operations under varying conditions.

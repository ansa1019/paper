The utility's ability to control its costs within the authorized levels of spending and to timely recover its costs through rates is critical for maintaining operational continuity. Additionally, the utility's implementation of a streamlined organizational structure and achievement of project savings are essential for sustaining performance under pressure.

These factors contribute to the utility's overall resilience and capacity to respond effectively to environmental disruptions, thereby preserving or improving functioning despite adversity. The focus on creating resilience zones and managing costs illustrates a proactive approach to risk management and resource allocation, which are vital for enhancing organizational strength and ensuring business continuity in the face of challenges.

Operational risk is the risk to the current or projected financial condition and resilience arising from inadequate or failed internal processes or systems, human errors or misconduct, or adverse external events. Operational risk is inherent to the entire organization. The ability to absorb strain and preserve or improve functioning despite the presence of adversity is critical for organizational resilience. This resilience encompasses the organization's capacity to maintain its integrity and performance while facing internal or external variations and disturbances, including pressures, constraints, failures, errors, violations, and hazards. The concept of resilience highlights the importance of responding effectively to environmental disruptions and transforming the organization to emerge stronger from challenging situations. Organizations must develop strategies to foresee, confront, and benefit from sudden disruptive changes to survive, grow, and flourish. The multifaceted nature of resilience reflects the need for organizations to manage operational flexibility, resource deployment, and strategic initiatives to enhance their capabilities in the face of adversity. Effective operational risk management is essential for maintaining organizational health and ensuring that the organization can adapt to unexpected situations while preserving performance under pressure. The integration of knowledge management and inter-organizational collaboration can further strengthen resilience by fostering an environment that supports learning and innovation. Organizations must also engage in proactive measures and strategic foresight to navigate complex situations and mitigate risks associated with environmental turbulence. By focusing on organizational dynamics and the development of relational structures, organizations can enhance their absorptive capacity and improve their response mechanisms to crises. This involves reconfiguring resources and capabilities to ensure operational continuity and effective crisis management. Ultimately, the ability to maintain positive adjustment under challenging conditions is a fundamental aspect of organizational resilience, enabling firms to thrive amidst uncertainties and disruptions in the business environment.

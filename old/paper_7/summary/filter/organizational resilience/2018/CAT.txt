In 2018, we incurred substantial restructuring costs to achieve a flexible and competitive cost structure, which is expected to continue as part of ongoing business activities. The increase in profit was primarily due to lower restructuring costs and higher sales volume, indicating operational flexibility and resilience in the face of external pressures. Our management utilizes charts internally to visually communicate with the company's board of directors and employees, reflecting a systemic perspective on performance and operational management. The improvement in demand across all regions and segments demonstrates our ability to adapt to changing market conditions and customer needs, contributing to organizational health and effectiveness. 

The increase in sales volume was driven by improved demand for equipment across the three primary segments, including favorable changes in dealer inventories, which reflects our capacity for resource allocation and management. We believe the strength of the U.S. economy and continued infrastructure development will support sales in 2019, showcasing our strategic foresight and future planning capabilities. The operational cash flow for 2018 was more than sufficient to cover capital expenditures and dividends, highlighting our financial resilience and resource generation strategies.

Restructuring actions, including the closure of the facility in Gosselies, Belgium, were part of a broader strategy to enhance operational continuity and maintain performance under pressure. The anticipated reduction in restructuring costs in 2019 suggests a proactive approach to managing resource constraints while ensuring business continuity. Our focus on strategic growth initiatives, including investments aligned with our long-term objectives, further underscores our commitment to organizational transformation and adaptability.

In addition, the company's ability to absorb strain and preserve functioning despite adversity is evident in our financial performance metrics, which include an increase in profit margins and a significant rise in sales volume. The favorable price realization across segments contributed to this performance, indicating a strong competitive advantage and operational resilience. 

We also recognize the importance of knowledge management and organizational learning processes in enhancing our adaptive strategies. Our investments in research and development are aligned with our strategic initiatives to foster innovation and improve operational effectiveness. The increase in sales and revenues across all regions, particularly in North America, reflects our organizational strength and capacity to confront market volatility and external disturbances.

Overall, our comprehensive approach to risk management, including the assessment of environmental perturbations and the implementation of resilience strategies, positions us favorably to navigate complex situations and ensure long-term sustainability. The strategic response to market demands and the ability to reconfigure resources effectively demonstrate our organizational agility and commitment to thriving in turbulent markets.

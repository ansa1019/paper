This management's discussion and analysis provides a review of the results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity of Visa Inc. and its subsidiaries, outlining factors that have affected recent earnings and those that may affect future earnings. Visa is a global payments technology company that enables fast, secure, and reliable electronic payments across more than 200 countries and territories, facilitating global commerce through the transfer of value and information among a network of consumers, merchants, financial institutions, businesses, strategic partners, and government entities. Our advanced transaction processing network enables authorization, clearing, and settlement of payment transactions, allowing us to provide clients a wide range of products, platforms, and value-added services. The financial results for fiscal years reflect the impact of significant one-time items and adjustments that provide a clearer understanding of our operating performance. Our business performance reflects solid global consumer spending growth, supported by favorable economic conditions and tempered by volatility in some emerging markets. The increase in operating revenues is primarily driven by growth in processed transactions and nominal payments volume, with total operating expenses increasing due to higher litigation provisions and investments to support business growth. We believe our projected sources of liquidity will be sufficient to meet our projected liquidity needs for more than the next 12 months, and we continue to assess our liquidity position in view of our operating performance and economic conditions. The management of liquidity risk is consistent with our corporate objectives, ensuring adequate liquidity to cover operating expenditures and liquidity contingency scenarios. Our treasury policies aim to provide timely completion of payments settlement activities and make planned capital investments in our business. The effects of the tax reform legislation enacted in December 2017 have resulted in significant tax benefits and adjustments to our deferred tax liabilities, impacting our financial results. We have established policies and control procedures to ensure that estimates and assumptions regarding our financial statements are appropriately governed and applied consistently. The assessment of fair value of our financial instruments is based on observable inputs, and we maintain global credit settlement risk policies to manage settlement risk. We are involved in various legal proceedings, and our judgments regarding the likelihood of loss and the amount of such loss are based on management's understanding of our litigation profile. The liquidity of our investment portfolio may be impacted by changes in market conditions, and we have policies that limit the amount of credit exposure to any one financial institution or type of investment. Our capital expenditures have increased due to investments in technology and infrastructure to support our digital solutions and core business initiatives. We anticipate continued investments in technology assets and payments system infrastructure to enhance our capabilities and support our strategic initiatives. The management of our liquidity, operational continuity, and strategic response to environmental disruptions are critical to maintaining organizational resilience and ensuring our ability to adapt to changing market conditions and external pressures.

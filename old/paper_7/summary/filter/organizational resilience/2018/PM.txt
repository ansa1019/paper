We are leading a transformation in the tobacco industry to create a smoke-free future and ultimately replace cigarettes with smoke-free products to the benefit of adults who would otherwise continue to smoke, society, the company and its shareholders. Through multidisciplinary capabilities in product development, state-of-the-art facilities and scientific substantiation, we aim to ensure that our smoke-free products meet adult consumer preferences and rigorous regulatory requirements. We are engaged in the development and commercialization of reduced-risk products ("rrps") that present less risk of harm to smokers who switch to these products versus continued smoking. Our portfolio comprises both international and local brands, and we have a wide range of premium, mid-price and low-price brands. Our net revenues and operating income are affected by various factors, including the volume of products we sell, the price of our products, changes in currency exchange rates and the mix of products we sell. The unfavorable currency impact during 2018 results from the fluctuations of the U.S. dollar, especially against the Indonesian rupiah, Russian ruble and Turkish lira, which has impacted our profitability across our primary revenue markets and local currency cost bases. We have made ongoing efforts to optimize our capital structure following the passage of the tax cuts and jobs act, including the decision to use existing cash to repay matured bonds. The changes in our reported diluted earnings per share for the year ended December 31, 2018, were influenced by various operational factors, including unfavorable volume/mix and higher marketing, administration and research costs in certain segments, while other segments experienced favorable pricing. Our principal sources of funds, including funds to make payment on our debt securities, are from the receipt of dividends and repayment of debt from our subsidiaries. The complexity of our operations necessitates a strategic response to external pressures and market volatility, ensuring that we maintain operational continuity and adaptability in the face of environmental disruptions. We focus on reconfiguring our business strategies to enhance resilience against adverse conditions, thereby supporting our transformation toward a smoke-free future. Our organizational practices emphasize the importance of stakeholder engagement and inter-organizational collaboration to navigate challenges effectively. We recognize the necessity of proactive measures in crisis management and the importance of resource allocation to sustain performance under pressure. Our commitment to innovation and strategic foresight enables us to confront and benefit from sudden disruptive changes, ensuring organizational survival and growth. The multifaceted nature of our operations requires us to absorb strain and preserve functionality despite the presence of adversity, which is critical for maintaining our competitive advantage in a turbulent market environment.

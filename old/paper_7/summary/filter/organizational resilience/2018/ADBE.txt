During fiscal 2018, we reported strong financial results consistent with the continued execution of our long-term plans for our two strategic growth areas, digital media and digital experience, while continuing to market and license a broad portfolio of products and solutions. We believe that investments in research and development, including the recruiting and hiring of software developers, are critical to remain competitive in the marketplace and are directly related to continued timely development of new and enhanced offerings and solutions. Our strategy with creative cloud is designed to enable us to increase our revenue with users, attract more new customers, and grow our recurring and predictable revenue stream that is recognized ratably. We continue to implement strategies that will accelerate awareness, consideration, and purchase of subscriptions to our creative cloud offerings. The increase in subscription revenue was primarily driven by continued adoption of our Adobe Experience Cloud offerings, which include analytics, social marketing, targeting, media optimization, and digital experience management. We expect that the addition of Market and Magento, and continued demand across our portfolio of Adobe Experience Cloud solutions, will drive revenue growth in future years. Our digital experience business provides comprehensive solutions that enable marketers to measure, personalize, and optimize marketing campaigns and digital experiences across channels for optimal marketing performance. We have made significant investments to broaden the scale and size of all of these routes to market, and our recent financial results reflect the success of these investments. We achieved record Adobe Experience Cloud revenue, which represents a significant aspect of our operational flexibility and adaptability in a competitive landscape. Our hierarchy of solutions in the digital experience segment consists of various cloud offerings that integrate creativity with data-driven insights, thereby enhancing our organizational capabilities and resilience in the face of market volatility. The increase in subscription revenue across our offerings was driven by strong performance with our marketing cloud offerings, which include Adobe Experience Manager and Adobe Campaign, and our analytics cloud offerings. The overall increase in revenue during fiscal 2018 was positively impacted by the relative weakening of the U.S. dollar against EMEA currencies, demonstrating our ability to navigate external pressures and capitalize on favorable market conditions. We regularly assess the likelihood of outcomes resulting from tax examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes, reflecting our proactive measures in risk management. Our existing cash, cash equivalents, and investment balances may fluctuate during fiscal 2019 due to changes in our planned cash outlay, including changes in incremental costs related to our acquisitions, indicating our ongoing assessment of resource allocation and operational continuity. We believe that our existing cash, cash equivalents, and investment balances, along with anticipated cash flows from operations, will be sufficient to meet our working capital and operating resource expenditure requirements for the next twelve months, underscoring our organizational resilience in maintaining positive adjustment under challenging conditions.

The company continues to manage its businesses to maximize operating cash flows as the primary source of liquidity, focusing on growth, cost reduction, and productivity initiatives. Our consolidated results are principally impacted by changes in global economic growth rates and industry conditions and demand in our key end markets, as well as the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. We believe our ability to consistently grow earnings derives from the consistent, rigorous deployment of the Honeywell operating system as well as a long history of identifying and investing in productivity initiatives. In 2019, we expect cash spending for repositioning actions to be approximately $300 million, funded through operating cash flows, which reflects our adaptability to changing market conditions. The effective management of our cash and financing uses through investment in existing core businesses, acquisition activity, share repurchases, and dividends demonstrates our strategic response to maintain operational continuity. Our areas of focus include driving profitable growth through research and development and technological excellence to deliver innovative products that customers value, which is essential for organizational resilience. The company’s commitment to a strategy and investments intended to enable us to become one of the world's leading software industrial companies illustrates our proactive measures to adapt to future market demands. We continuously assess the relative strength of each business in our portfolio to identify units that will most benefit from increased investment, which is crucial for maintaining organizational health and effectiveness. Our emphasis on safety of principal in managing cash balances and diversifying cash and cash equivalents among counterparties minimizes exposure to risks associated with liquidity. We monitor the third-party depository institutions that hold our cash and cash equivalents to ensure operational flexibility and resilience against external pressures. The company has not experienced limitations in accessing sources of liquidity, reflecting our strong financial position and organizational strength. Our strategic initiatives include executing disciplined, rigorous M&A and integration processes to deliver growth through acquisitions, which enhances our competitive advantage and adaptability in turbulent markets.

In 2018, we were required by a government customer to dispose of certain operations to address an organizational conflict of interest with respect to services provided to the customer. This decision reflects an aspect of organizational resilience, as it involved adapting to external pressures and reconfiguring our operations to maintain integrity and performance under challenging conditions. The sale of these operations, which included a public-facing contact-center business and certain operations within our information technology segment, demonstrates our ability to respond effectively to environmental disruptions. While the sale did not result in a gain for financial reporting purposes under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), it generated a taxable gain, indicating a strategic response to resource allocation and operational continuity amidst adversity. The actions taken in response to the organizational conflict of interest highlight our commitment to maintaining organizational health and effectiveness, ensuring that we can confront challenges while preserving our core capabilities. This situation illustrates the multifaceted nature of organizational resilience, as we navigated the complexities of compliance and operational integrity in a turbulent business environment. The disposal of these operations is a testament to our strategic initiatives aimed at sustaining performance and adapting to the evolving demands of our stakeholders, thereby reinforcing our organizational strength and agility in the face of unexpected situations.

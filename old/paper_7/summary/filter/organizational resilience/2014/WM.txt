In July 2012, we announced a reorganization of operations, designed to streamline management and staff support and reduce our cost structure, while not disrupting our front-line operations. This reorganization eliminated approximately 700 employee positions throughout the company, including positions at both the management and support level. The principal organizational changes included removing the management layer of our four geographic groups, each of which previously constituted a reportable segment, and consolidating and reducing the number of our geographic areas through which we evaluate and oversee our solid waste subsidiaries from 22 to 17. Voluntary separation arrangements were offered to many employees. The changes reflect an adaptation strategy aimed at enhancing operational flexibility and maintaining performance under pressure by addressing internal variations and resource constraints. The reorganization is indicative of our commitment to organizational resilience, as it seeks to preserve functioning and improve organizational health despite the challenges posed by the restructuring process. By consolidating management layers and geographic oversight, we aim to mitigate risks associated with fragmentation and enhance our ability to respond effectively to external pressures. This strategic initiative is designed to ensure continuity of operations and support our long-term objectives, ultimately contributing to our capacity to absorb strain and emerge stronger from adversity. The focus on reconfiguring our operational structure aligns with our goal of maintaining integrity and performance while navigating environmental disruptions. The measures taken are part of a broader effort to enhance our organizational capabilities and foster a culture of resilience, enabling us to confront and benefit from sudden disruptive changes in the business environment.

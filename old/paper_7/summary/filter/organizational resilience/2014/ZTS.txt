During the year ended December 31, 2014, we recorded restructuring charges of $12 million related to employee severance costs in EUAFME and $6 million related to employee severance costs in our global manufacturing operations, as a result of initiatives to reduce costs and better align our organizational structure. We may incur additional restructuring costs in 2015 as we finalize plans and programs aimed at improving operational and cost efficiencies. These initiatives reflect our organizational resilience by addressing internal pressures and adapting our operational framework to enhance efficiency and effectiveness in the face of external economic challenges. The restructuring efforts are part of a broader strategy to maintain performance and ensure that we can respond effectively to environmental disruptions, thereby preserving our organizational health and operational continuity. Through these measures, we aim to reconfigure our resources and align our organizational practices with the demands of a turbulent market, ensuring that we can confront adversity and maintain positive adjustment under challenging conditions. The focus on improving operational and cost efficiencies is indicative of our commitment to resilience strategies that enhance our ability to absorb strain and adapt to unexpected situations, ultimately contributing to our long-term survival and success in a competitive landscape.

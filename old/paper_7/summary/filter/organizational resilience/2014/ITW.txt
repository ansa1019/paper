ITW businesses have significant flexibility within the framework of the ITW business model to customize their approach in order to best serve their customers. This leads to a focused and simple organizational structure that can deliver operational excellence adapted to their customers and end markets. The business structure simplification initiative simplifies the company's organizational model and adds scale to the company's operating divisions in order to increase organic revenue growth, enhance global competitiveness, and drive operational efficiencies. This initiative focuses on reducing the number of the company's operating divisions and increasing the average revenue size of each division, while retaining the positive attributes of a decentralized operating model. The company expects to enhance its profitability and returns through a combination of applying its 80/20 business process to the new divisions, more focused growth investments, and reduced infrastructure. The emphasis on operational flexibility and adaptability within the organizational structure underscores the company's commitment to maintaining performance under pressure and responding effectively to environmental disruptions. By streamlining operations and enhancing organizational coherence, the company aims to bolster its resilience against external pressures and complex situations. The strategic initiatives reflect an understanding of the need for effective resource allocation and management, which are critical for sustaining performance and achieving major objectives in a competitive landscape. The focus on operational excellence and the ability to reconfigure divisions in response to market demands illustrates the company's proactive measures to ensure organizational health and adaptability in the face of adversity.

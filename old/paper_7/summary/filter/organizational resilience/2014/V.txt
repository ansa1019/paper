This management's discussion and analysis provides a review of the results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity of Visa Inc. and its subsidiaries. We believe that our projected sources of liquidity will be sufficient to meet our projected liquidity needs for more than the next 12 months. Our treasury policies provide management with the guidelines and authority to manage liquidity risk in a manner consistent with our corporate objectives, ensuring timely completion of payments settlement activities and making planned capital investments in our business. We regularly evaluate cash requirements for current operations, commitments, development activities, and capital expenditures. We continue to explore additional opportunities to enhance our competitive position by expanding the scope of payment solutions we provide. Our business performance reflects the impacts of overall economic conditions and consumer spending, which are critical to our operational flexibility and adaptability in a changing environment. The increase in operating revenues mainly reflects continued growth in our underlying business drivers, including nominal payments volume and processed transactions. Our financial results are impacted by the overall strengthening or weakening of the U.S. dollar, which can affect our operating revenues. We have established policies and control procedures to ensure that estimates and assumptions are appropriately governed and applied consistently. Our business is affected by external pressures, including economic conditions and regulatory changes, which require us to maintain operational continuity and resilience. The cash inflows and outflows related to the litigation escrow account are also reflected as offsetting cash flows within financing activities, indicating our preparedness to manage unexpected situations. We believe that cash flow generated from operating activities will be more than sufficient to meet our ongoing operational needs, demonstrating our organizational capabilities in managing resources effectively. We maintain global credit settlement risk policies and procedures to manage settlement risk, which may require clients to post collateral if certain credit standards are not met. Our operational management strategies include investments in technology and infrastructure to support our digital solutions and core business initiatives, enhancing our resilience against market volatility. The effective management of client incentives and contractual obligations is essential for maintaining our organizational health and performance under pressure. Our ability to absorb strain and preserve functioning despite adversity is reflected in our strategic initiatives and response mechanisms. We are committed to ensuring that our organizational practices support our long-term objectives and adaptability to complex situations. The litigation provision reflects our understanding of our litigation profile and the specifics of the cases, which requires significant judgment in assessing potential liabilities. We believe that our financial position and strategic response to external disturbances will enable us to navigate challenges effectively and sustain growth. Our ongoing investments in technology assets and infrastructure are designed to enhance our operational effectiveness and resilience in the face of future uncertainties.

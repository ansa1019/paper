We operate global marketplaces for trading and clearing a broad array of securities and derivatives contracts across major asset classes, including energy and agricultural commodities, interest rates, equities, equity derivatives, credit derivatives, bonds, and currencies. Our business is conducted as a single reportable business segment, and we have diversified our business so that we are less subject to the reduction in volatility, trading activity, or participation in any one asset class. We continue to focus on our strategy to broaden and diversify our revenue streams, as well as on our company-wide expense reduction initiatives in connection with our acquisition of NYSE in order to mitigate uncertainties. The business environments in which we operate directly affect our results of operations, which have been influenced by many factors, including the level of trading activity in our markets, competition, price volatility, and legislative and regulatory changes. We have increased our portion of non-transaction and clearing revenues from 13% in 2012 to 39% in 2014. The maintenance and growth of our revenues could also be impacted if we face increased pressure on pricing. We periodically make adjustments to our contract specifications aimed at making the contracts more relevant to more customers and their evolving hedging needs, which may result in fluctuations in trading volume in the near term, with the objective of making the contract more relevant to our customers over the long term. We expect that all of these factors will continue to impact our businesses. Our results have been and will continue to be affected by external pressures, including geopolitical events, weather and disasters, and real and perceived supply and demand imbalances. We have successfully transitioned all of the LIFFE futures and options contracts to ICE Futures Europe, which enhances our operational flexibility and ability to adapt to market changes. We also used the net cash proceeds from the IPO and sale of Euronext shares to repay debt, invest in growth initiatives, pursue strategic investments, and return capital to shareholders via dividends and share repurchases. Our operational management includes a focus on risk assessment and mitigation strategies to ensure business continuity and resilience in the face of disruptive events. We have established mechanisms to support market participants' trading and risk management activities, which are essential for maintaining organizational health and effectiveness. The implementation of new regulations may impact participation in our markets, creating uncertainty for market participants, which could affect trading volumes. We recognize that our operational resources must be agile to respond to changes in the competitive landscape, and we continuously evaluate our strategic initiatives to enhance our resilience capabilities. Our organizational practices include fostering inter-organizational collaboration and stakeholder engagement to improve our adaptability and performance under pressure. We are committed to maintaining a strong organizational identity and culture that supports our strategic objectives and enhances our resilience in turbulent markets.

On January 1, 2014, an organizational change occurred within our North America region from a country and product category structure to a regional product category structure. This change involved a reconfiguration of reporting units, resulting in our North America region now having two instead of four reporting units. The reorganization reflects an adaptation to internal and external pressures, aiming to enhance operational flexibility and maintain performance under changing conditions. For any reporting units that were reorganized, the goodwill was allocated to the new reporting unit structure based on relative fair values of the related business units. This strategic initiative demonstrates a response to the need for effective resource allocation and management in the face of organizational change processes. By streamlining the structure, the organization seeks to improve its resilience and ability to function effectively despite potential disruptions, thereby supporting future planning and operational continuity. The adjustments made are indicative of a broader strategy to enhance organizational capabilities and ensure sustained performance amidst environmental perturbations.

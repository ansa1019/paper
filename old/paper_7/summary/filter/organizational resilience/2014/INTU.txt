Management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations indicates that our growth strategy depends upon our ability to initiate and embrace disruptive technology trends, to enter new markets, and to drive broad adoption of the products and services we develop and market. The ongoing operation and availability of our information technology and communication systems and those of our external service providers is becoming increasingly important. We face risks associated with the hosting, collection, use, and retention of personal customer information and data. We are investing significant management attention and resources in our information technology infrastructure and in our privacy and security capabilities. The industry in which we operate is dynamic and highly competitive, characterized by rapid technological change, shifting customer needs, and frequent new product introductions and enhancements. Our business is subject to significant seasonality, and we believe the seasonality of our business is likely to continue in the future. Our strategy focuses on enhancing and marketing our connected services, which are critical for maintaining operational flexibility and adapting to customer needs. We expect connected services revenue as a percentage of our total revenue to continue to grow in the future, reflecting our strategic focus on these offerings. Customer acquisition in our small business online ecosystem has driven revenue growth, and we anticipate that our ability to respond effectively to environmental disruptions will enhance our organizational resilience. The transition to offering more connected services requires us to adapt our operational management and resource allocation strategies. We believe that our cash and cash equivalents, investments, and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to meet anticipated working capital needs and other liquidity requirements associated with our operations for at least the next 12 months. Our financial health is supported by our ability to generate significant cash from operations, which allows us to respond nimbly to opportunities for strategic initiatives and inter-organizational collaboration. The performance of our small business and consumer segments has been key to our revenue growth, and we expect this trend to continue as we navigate the complexities of the competitive landscape. Our operational resources and strategic response mechanisms are designed to enhance our resilience in the face of external pressures and environmental perturbations. We have also focused on building social capital and fostering collaboration networks to support our organizational practices. The ability to foresee and confront disruptive change is essential for our survival and growth, and we are committed to maintaining a trajectory of positive adjustment under challenging conditions. Our investments in research and development, marketing, and sales capabilities are aimed at sustaining our competitive advantage and ensuring our organizational effectiveness in a turbulent market. We continuously assess our operational continuity and the implications of our strategic planning to enhance our resilience strategies and mechanisms.

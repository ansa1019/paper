In our pursuit of operational excellence, financial strength, and disciplined investment, we closely monitor significant regulatory and legislative developments. Our business plan seeks to achieve growth while managing risks, focusing on operational excellence and financial strength, which have provided the base from which we have been able to execute our strategic initiatives. We continue to invest capital in transmission and distribution infrastructure projects aimed at maintaining the reliability of our service to our customers. Our flexibility in generating capacity has allowed us to respond to market volatility and capitalize on opportunities as they arise. The construction of transmission and solar projects proceeded on schedule and within budget, enhancing our operational resilience. We have begun work in our gas and electric distribution systems to improve resiliency, with the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities approving our Energy Strong proposal, which provides for cost recovery and aims to enhance the reliability of our infrastructure. Our financial strength is predicated on a solid balance sheet, positive cash flow, and reasonable risk-adjusted returns on increased investment, which are essential for maintaining operational continuity under challenging conditions. We emphasize operational performance while developing opportunities in both our competitive and regulated businesses, ensuring that we can adapt to unexpected situations and external pressures. Our diverse fuel mix and dispatch flexibility allowed us to generate significant electricity while addressing unit outages and balancing fuel availability and price volatility. We advocate for measures to ensure the implementation of market design rules that promote fair and efficient electricity markets, which is critical for our resilience strategies. The implications of regulatory and political uncertainty, as well as environmental regulations, are continuously assessed to mitigate risks and enhance our organizational capabilities. Our future success will depend on our ability to maintain strong operational and financial performance in a cost-constrained environment and to respond effectively to the challenges posed by regulatory developments and market dynamics. We engage multiple stakeholders, including regulators and customers, to ensure that our strategic initiatives align with broader industry trends and customer needs. The operational flexibility we maintain enables us to confront challenges and capitalize on growth opportunities, reinforcing our organizational strength and resilience in a turbulent market landscape. Our ongoing process of implementing improved procedures helps mitigate the risk of errors and enhances our operational management capabilities. We recognize that our ability to absorb strain and preserve functioning despite adversity is crucial for our long-term success and sustainability.

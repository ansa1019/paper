ADP's mission is to help organizations unlock their business potential with our insightful solutions, emphasizing our commitment to service excellence, which lies at the core of our relationship with each of our clients. Our strategic pillars are predicated on our ability to drive innovation and service excellence, and attract, build, and retain the right talent to position ADP as the global market leader in human capital management services. We seek to embrace new technology and innovation to deliver market-leading products and services that meet the needs of our clients across all of our markets. Our focus on product innovation and improvements in salesforce productivity led to growth in new business bookings, reflecting our organizational strength and operational flexibility. Our results during fiscal 2014 continue to reflect the strength of our underlying business model, including the diversity of our client base and products, which enhances our resilience against external pressures. We continue to benefit from the strength of our pays per control metric, which represents the number of employees on our clients' payrolls, indicative of our ability to adapt to changing market conditions. Our business model is characterized by a high percentage of recurring revenues, excellent margins, and the ability to generate consistent, healthy cash flows, which are critical for maintaining organizational health and effectiveness. We have a strong business model with low capital expenditure requirements, which supports our operational continuity and resilience strategies. The planned separation of our dealer services business is expected to allow both companies to focus on their respective businesses and strategic opportunities, thereby enhancing our adaptability and future orientation. Our fiscal 2014 results include incremental costs directly attributable to this planned separation, which reflects our proactive measures to manage organizational change processes. We have consistently maintained the required level of client funds assets to satisfy all of our obligations, demonstrating our commitment to risk management and operational resilience. Our investment strategy is structured to allow us to average our way through an interest rate cycle, which is essential for maintaining liquidity and managing financial resources effectively. We believe we have significantly reduced the risk of not having sufficient funds to satisfy our client funds obligations by consistently maintaining access to other sources of liquidity, including our corporate cash balances and available borrowings. Our strategic response to market volatility includes leveraging our global presence to offer clients solutions where they do business, which enhances our competitive advantage. The increase in cash flows provided by operating activities from fiscal 2013 to fiscal 2014 was due to higher net earnings, favorable changes in working capital, and lower pension contributions, indicating our capacity for recovery and performance maintenance under challenging conditions. Overall, our organizational practices reflect a multifaceted approach to resilience, encompassing strategic initiatives, resource allocation, and a commitment to continuous improvement and innovation in response to environmental disruptions.

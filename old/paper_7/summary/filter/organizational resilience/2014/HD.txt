In fiscal 2014, we reported net earnings of $6.3 billion, reflecting our ability to maintain operational performance despite challenges, including a significant data breach that potentially impacted customer trust and operational integrity. Our investigation revealed that the breach involved unauthorized access to our payment data systems, prompting us to enhance our cybersecurity measures, including the rollout of advanced encryption technologies and EMV chip-and-pin technology to mitigate future risks. The expenses related to the breach included costs for investigation, identity protection services, and legal fees, which were strategically managed to limit their impact on our overall financial condition. We believe that our proactive measures and investments in security infrastructure will bolster our resilience against future disruptions. Our key initiatives, such as customer service enhancements and product innovation, were designed to adapt to changing market conditions and customer needs, contributing to a 5.5% increase in net sales. The interconnected retail strategy, which integrates online and in-store operations, has proven effective in enhancing customer engagement and operational flexibility, with online sales increasing by 36.9% compared to the previous fiscal year. Our disciplined capital allocation and focus on operational efficiency have further strengthened our financial position, enabling us to navigate external pressures and maintain a competitive advantage. We are committed to continuous improvement in our operational practices and resource management to ensure long-term sustainability and organizational health. The ongoing evaluation of our risk management strategies and the establishment of robust response mechanisms are critical components of our organizational resilience framework.

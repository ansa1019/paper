General operating expenses decreased in 2014 compared to 2013, primarily due to efficiencies from organizational realignment initiatives, which reflect a strategic response to enhance operational flexibility and maintain performance under pressure. We recognize that climate change has implications for insurance industry exposure to natural catastrophe risk, indicating an awareness of external pressures that could disrupt organizational functioning. With multiple levels of risk management processes in place, we actively analyze the latest climate science and policy to anticipate potential changes to our risk profile, pricing models, and strategic planning, demonstrating a proactive approach to risk assessment and adaptation strategies. For example, we continually consider changes in climate and weather patterns as an integral part of the underwriting process, which aligns with the concept of maintaining organizational health amid environmental perturbations. In addition, we are committed to providing innovative insurance products and services to help our clients be proactive against the threat of climate change, including expanding natural disaster resilience, promoting adaptation, and reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Our internal product development, underwriting, modeling, and sustainability practices will continue to adapt to and evolve with the developing risk exposures attributed to climate change, showcasing our organizational capabilities to reconfigure and respond effectively to disruptive events. This multifaceted approach reflects our understanding of the need for organizational resilience, as we strive to foresee, confront, and benefit from sudden disruptive change to survive and grow in a turbulent market environment.

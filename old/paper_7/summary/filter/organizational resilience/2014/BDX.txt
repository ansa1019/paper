Effective October 1, 2014, BD's organizational structure was realigned to better complement its customer-focused solutions strategy, which reflects an adaptation to enhance operational efficiency and organizational effectiveness. The company continues to invest in research and development, geographic expansion, and new product promotions to drive further revenue and profit growth, indicating a proactive approach to sustaining long-term growth amid external pressures. While the economic environment for the healthcare industry has stabilized, pricing pressures continue for some products, and any destabilization could adversely impact U.S. businesses, highlighting the need for resilience in response to environmental perturbations. Additionally, macroeconomic challenges in Europe continue to constrain healthcare utilization, although the environment is currently viewed as stable, suggesting a focus on maintaining operational continuity under varying conditions. The realignment of BD's organizational structure from a three-segment to a two-segment structure did not change the reporting units identified for goodwill impairment testing, which reflects an ongoing assessment of organizational capabilities to manage internal and external variations. The companyâ€™s growth in emerging markets is dependent on government funding for healthcare systems, emphasizing the importance of external knowledge and collaboration networks in navigating complex situations. The commentary on financial results indicates a structured approach to resource allocation and management, which is essential for maintaining performance under pressure and ensuring organizational survival in turbulent markets. The assessment of goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level, defined as an operating segment or one level below, demonstrates a systematic perspective on risk management and operational flexibility. BD's ability to sustain its long-term growth will depend on factors such as expanding its core business, developing innovative new products, and improving operational efficiency, which are critical components of organizational resilience. The previously discussed realignment is indicative of a strategic response to enhance the company's adaptability and operational management in the face of challenges. Overall, BD's organizational practices reflect a commitment to maintaining integrity and performance while navigating pressures and constraints, thereby reinforcing its resilience in the healthcare industry.

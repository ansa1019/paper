During 2014, nee and its subsidiaries implemented initiatives determined during a 2013 enterprise-wide process focused mainly on improving productivity and reducing o&m expenses, which reflects an adaptive strategy to enhance organizational resilience. The transition costs associated with the cost savings initiative recorded by nee in 2013 amounted to approximately $72 million, indicating resource allocation towards resilience-building measures. FPL's increase in net income in 2014 was primarily driven by continued investments in plant in service, which demonstrates operational flexibility and a commitment to maintaining performance under pressure. FPL placed in service the 1,212 MW natural gas-fired combined-cycle Riviera Beach power plant and began construction on the modernization project at the Port Everglades power plant, showcasing a proactive approach to business continuity and service innovation. The FPSC approved FPL's petition to invest in long-term natural gas supplies, reflecting strategic initiatives aimed at enhancing organizational health and sustainability. NEER's results increased in 2014, reflecting higher results from new investments and the absence of significant after-tax charges from prior years, which demonstrates the importance of resource generation and effective risk management in maintaining operational continuity. NEER added approximately 1,217 MW of wind capacity in the U.S. and Canada, net of sales and dismantlements, which contributes to organizational strength and competitive advantage in a turbulent market. The increase in cash flows from operating activities for 2014 reflects operating cash generated from additional wind and solar facilities, indicating resilience through diversification and adaptation to environmental perturbations. The ability of nee, FPL, and NEER to maintain their current credit ratings is crucial for accessing capital markets, which is essential for supporting and growing their businesses, thereby ensuring organizational survival. The reliance on cash flow from operations and access to credit and capital markets highlights the interconnectedness of financial resources and organizational resilience. The implementation of risk management policies to monitor and manage market risks, as well as credit risks, is indicative of a systemic perspective on resilience. The discussion of regulatory assets and liabilities illustrates the importance of strategic management in navigating external pressures and maintaining operational integrity. The focus on maintaining a capital structure that supports a strong investment-grade credit rating is a reflection of strategic foresight and organizational coherence. Overall, the operational results and strategic initiatives undertaken by nee and its subsidiaries demonstrate a multifaceted approach to fostering organizational resilience in the face of challenges and uncertainties in the energy sector.

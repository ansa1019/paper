Servicenow is a leading provider of cloud-based solutions that define, structure, manage, and automate services across the global enterprise, helping the modern enterprise operate faster and be more scalable than ever before. We continue to invest in the development of our services, infrastructure, and sales and marketing to drive long-term growth. Our upsell rate, which is important for generating additional sales from existing customers, was 36% for the year ended December 31, 2014. Our renewal rate was 97% for the same period, indicating strong customer retention and organizational health. We believe our total customer count is a key indicator of our market penetration, growth, and future revenues, which increased to 2,725 as of December 31, 2014. The increase in revenues from our direct sales organization and channel partners represented 87% and 13%, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2014, reflecting our resource allocation towards enhancing customer relationships and service innovation. Our subscription revenues increased significantly, driven by upsells, renewals, and an increase in our customer count, demonstrating our ability to adapt and respond effectively to market demands and customer needs. 

We have historically experienced seasonality in customer agreements, with a significant percentage signed in the quarter ended December 31, which reflects our operational flexibility and strategic initiatives to align sales efforts with customer buying patterns. Our operating expenses have increased primarily due to headcount growth to support our expanding customer base, which is essential for maintaining performance under pressure and ensuring operational continuity. The increase in professional services revenues is attributed to the growing services provided to our customer base, indicating our capacity for knowledge absorption and resource generation. 

We expect our cost of subscription revenues to increase in absolute dollar terms as we provide subscription services to more customers, but we anticipate this increase to be at a slower rate than the increase in our subscription revenue, leading to improved gross profit margins. Our investments in research and development are aimed at enhancing the existing functionality of our services and developing new applications to meet market needs, which is critical for our organizational transformation and strategic adaptation in a competitive landscape. 

The expansion of our data centers and investments in our cloud-based infrastructure are vital for supporting our growth and ensuring resilience against environmental disruptions. We are also evaluating the costs and benefits of hedging foreign currency transactions to mitigate risks associated with our expanding international operations. Our liquidity position, supported by cash and cash equivalents, is expected to meet our operational needs and facilitate future growth initiatives. We continue to monitor our performance and adjust our strategies to ensure we can confront challenges and capitalize on opportunities in a turbulent market environment.

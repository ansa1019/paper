In connection with our continued strategic transformation, we realigned our organizational structure, resulting in two reportable segments: the computing and graphics segment and the enterprise, embedded and semi-custom segment. This organizational change reflects our adaptability to market conditions and our commitment to maintaining operational flexibility. We believe the pace of the decline in the PC market is slowing, and our annual computing and graphics segment results reflect the ongoing challenges of a competitive consumer PC market. During 2014, we continued to focus on introducing a more diverse product portfolio, which is essential for our resilience strategy in high-growth adjacent markets. We derived approximately 40% of our annual revenues from these markets, demonstrating our ability to reconfigure our business in response to external pressures. Our restructuring plan, designed to improve operating efficiencies, involved a reduction of global headcount by approximately 6%, indicating our proactive measures to enhance organizational health and performance maintenance. We recorded a restructuring charge which included severance and costs related to the continuation of certain employee benefits, reflecting our commitment to support systems during periods of change. The improvement in operating results in our enterprise, embedded, and semi-custom segment was primarily due to increased net revenue, which underscores our capability to adapt and respond to market demands. We also experienced strong demand for our semi-custom system-on-chip products, which highlights our focus on service innovation and resource allocation to meet customer needs. Our strategic initiatives include the development of differentiated products, which are critical for maintaining competitive advantage in turbulent markets. The financial condition as of December 27, 2014, shows a decrease in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities, which is partially attributed to the timing of sales and related collections, emphasizing the importance of effective resource management. Our total debt increased slightly, and we believe that our cash balance, along with the savings from our restructuring plan, will be sufficient to fund operations over the next twelve months, demonstrating our operational continuity. The ongoing challenges in the semiconductor industry necessitate a focus on risk management and strategic adaptation to ensure organizational survival. Our governance changes and the deconsolidation of GlobalFoundries reflect our ability to navigate complex situations and maintain system integrity. We are currently negotiating a fifth amendment to our wafer supply agreement, which is crucial for our operational management and future planning. The formation of collaborative networks and inter-organizational collaboration is essential for enhancing our resilience against external disturbances. The strategic foresight and proactive measures we implement are vital for sustaining our organizational capabilities and ensuring long-term growth.

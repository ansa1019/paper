Effective January 1, 2014, we changed the organizational structure of the internal financial information reviewed by our chief executive officer, and determined this resulted in a change in the composition of our operating segments. The primary effects of this reporting reorganization were not specified in the provided text, but the change in organizational structure may imply a response to internal variations and pressures that could affect operational flexibility and overall organizational performance. Such adjustments can be seen as part of a broader strategy to enhance resilience by improving the ability to adapt to environmental perturbations and maintain effective functioning under challenging conditions. The reorganization may facilitate better resource allocation and knowledge management, which are critical for sustaining organizational health and effectiveness in the face of disruptive events. By reconfiguring our operating segments, we may also be positioning ourselves to better confront future uncertainties and enhance our capacity for recovery and transformation during adverse situations. This strategic initiative reflects an understanding of the need for operational continuity and the importance of maintaining integrity and performance amidst external disturbances. The organizational changes undertaken could serve as a mechanism for fostering resilience, enabling us to absorb strain and improve our adaptability in a dynamic business environment.

We design, make and sell semiconductors to electronics designers and manufacturers all over the world. Our business model is carefully constructed around several advantages that are unique to TI, including the industry's broadest portfolio of differentiated analog and embedded processing semiconductors. This breadth allows us to solve more customer needs than our competitors, providing access to more customers and opportunities to generate more revenue per system. We invest more than $1 billion each year to develop new products, ensuring our ability to adapt to changing market demands. Our strong foundation of manufacturing technology and low-cost production enables us to maintain operational flexibility and a consistent supply of products for our customers, which is crucial for business continuity. By producing billions of semiconductors each year using a mixture of wafer sizes, we can keep costs low and enhance our competitive advantage. Our global sales force and the breadth of our portfolio attract significant customer engagement, which supports our resilience in diverse markets. We are not dependent on any single product or application, which strengthens our organizational health and positions us to confront market challenges effectively. Our focus on analog and embedded processing semiconductors serves highly diverse markets with thousands of applications, contributing to dependable long-term growth opportunities. In 2014, we experienced revenue growth in these segments, reflecting our adaptability and ability to respond to customer needs. Our gross margin of 56.9 percent underscores the efficiency of our manufacturing strategy and the longevity of our product portfolio. We believe that our business model allows us to generate strong cash flow from operations, which is vital for sustaining performance under pressure and ensuring operational continuity. The allocation of corporate-level expenses among product lines, while affecting segment profitability, does not impact operating expense or profitability trends at the consolidated level, indicating our resilience in managing resource constraints. Our financial condition at the end of 2014, with total cash of $3.54 billion, demonstrates our capability to manage liquidity and capital resources effectively. We have the necessary financial resources and operating plans to fund our working capital needs, capital expenditures, dividend and debt-related payments, and other business requirements for at least the next 12 months. We recognize the importance of proactive measures and strategic foresight in navigating uncertainties and environmental disruptions. Our ability to absorb strain and preserve functioning despite adversity is reflected in our consistent share gains and free cash flow growth, positioning us uniquely among companies capable of thriving in turbulent markets. We continue to focus on strategic initiatives that enhance our operational management and foster organizational learning, ensuring that we remain resilient in the face of complex situations and external pressures.

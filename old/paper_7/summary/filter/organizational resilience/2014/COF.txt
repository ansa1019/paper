The results of our individual businesses reflect the manner in which management evaluates performance and makes decisions about funding our operations and allocating resources. We may periodically change our business segments or reclassify business segment results based on modifications to our management reporting methodologies and changes in organizational alignment. Our internal management and reporting process employs various allocation methodologies, including funds transfer pricing, to assign certain balance sheet assets, deposits, and other liabilities and their related revenue and expenses directly or indirectly attributable to each business segment. Underwriting decisions are generally based on an applicant's income, estimated debt-to-income ratio, and credit bureau information, along with collateral characteristics such as loan-to-value ratio. The underwriting criteria are customized for individual products and marketing programs and based on analysis of net present value of expected revenues, expenses, and losses, subject to maintaining resilience under a variety of stress conditions. We generally retain all of our auto loans, though we have securitized and sold auto loans in the past and may do so in the future. This approach reflects our capacity to absorb strain and preserve functioning despite the presence of adversity, demonstrating our ability to respond effectively to environmental disruptions and transform ourselves to emerge stronger from challenging situations. The internal management and reporting process is designed to ensure operational continuity and adaptability, allowing us to confront unexpected situations and maintain performance under pressure. Our strategic initiatives aim to enhance organizational capabilities and resilience, enabling us to navigate complex situations and external pressures while ensuring resource allocation aligns with our major objectives. The focus on maintaining resilience and operational flexibility is critical in our response strategies, allowing us to manage risks and adapt to environmental perturbations effectively. By employing a multifaceted approach to resource management and operational strategies, we strive to enhance our organizational health and effectiveness, ensuring we can withstand adverse conditions and sustain performance. This commitment to resilience is reflected in our ongoing evaluation of business segment results and the strategic alignment of our operations, which positions us to thrive in turbulent markets and maintain a competitive advantage.

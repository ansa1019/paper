We are a leading benchmarks & ratings, analytics, data and research provider serving the global capital, commodities and commercial markets. Our operations consist of four reportable segments: standard & poor's ratings services, s&p capital iq, s&p dow jones indices, and commodities & commercial. We strive to drive global growth by focusing on customers and innovation, while also promoting sustainable growth in the global capital, commodities and commercial markets by providing customers with essential intelligence and superior service. We are aligning our efforts against two key strategic priorities, creating growth and driving performance, which includes boosting operational excellence, productivity, risk management, and compliance; and attracting and developing the finest talent. Our strategic initiatives are designed to enhance our organizational capabilities and resilience in the face of external pressures and environmental disruptions. 

In 2014, we continued to execute our strategy of exiting non-core assets while investing for growth in markets that have size and scale. We streamlined our infrastructure by reducing our real estate footprint and consolidating our corporate headquarters, which reflects our adaptability and operational flexibility in response to changing market conditions. Our focus on investments in targeted financial assets and selective acquisitions demonstrates our commitment to resource allocation that supports organizational health and competitive advantage.

We have returned $3.3 billion to our shareholders through a combination of share repurchases and dividends, indicating our financial resilience and ability to maintain performance under pressure. Our revenue growth was driven by strong demand for our proprietary content and analytics, which underscores our organizational strength and ability to meet customer needs in a turbulent market environment. The revenue increase was partially offset by legal and regulatory settlements, which highlight the importance of risk management and crisis response strategies in maintaining operational continuity.

Our segment operating profit margins were impacted by legal and regulatory settlements, but we achieved strong revenue growth across our segments, demonstrating our resilience strategies in navigating complex situations. We are committed to enhancing our organizational intelligence and absorptive capacity to better respond to future challenges and opportunities. 

We recognize the need for ongoing adaptation and transformation to sustain our competitive position in the market. Our proactive measures include investing in technology and customer engagement activities to drive additional revenue growth across all commodity sectors. We aim to leverage our capabilities and content from recent acquisitions to expand into adjacent markets, further enhancing our organizational resilience. 

The financial services industry is subject to potential increased regulation, and we are continuously assessing the implications of new laws and regulations on our operations. Our commitment to compliance and strategic foresight positions us to confront challenges and capitalize on opportunities, ensuring our long-term sustainability and success in a dynamic business environment.

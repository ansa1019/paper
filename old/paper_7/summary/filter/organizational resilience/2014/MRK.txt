Merck & Co., Inc. is committed to evaluating, adapting, and improving the organization and its business practices to better meet customer needs and believes that it is well positioned to respond to the evolving health care environment and market forces. The company has undertaken multi-year initiatives to sharpen its commercial and research and development focus, redesign its operating model, and reduce its cost base while remaining focused on innovation. Merck's portfolio assessment process is ongoing, with future divestitures possible, as the company reviews its assets to determine whether they can provide the best short- and longer-term value. The company remains committed to augmenting its key growth drivers, such as its animal health business, and has made strong progress in redesigning its operating model and reducing its cost base, which has enabled better targeting of resources to key priorities across the enterprise. The company has also engaged in public policy advocacy to demonstrate that its medicines provide value to patients and to those who pay for health care, encouraging a long-term approach to sustainable health care financing that ensures access to innovative medicines. Merck's focus on emerging markets has increased, with governments in many of these markets enacting price controls and related measures that put pressure on the price of pharmaceuticals and constrain market access. The company anticipates that pricing pressures and market access challenges will continue in 2015 to varying degrees in emerging markets. Merck's operations may be adversely affected by competitive pressures, technological advances, and regulatory and legislative issues, which exert pressure on product pricing and market access. The company is well positioned to compete in the search for technological innovations, with a long-standing emphasis on research and development. Merck has also focused on acquiring and marketing products through external alliances, refining its sales and marketing efforts to address changing industry conditions. The company has made significant investments in its research and development pipeline, targeting therapeutic areas that can make the most impact on addressing critical areas of unmet medical need. The company’s restructuring programs are designed to reduce costs, increase efficiency, and enhance competitiveness, with significant workforce reductions planned. The actions under these restructuring programs are expected to result in substantial annual net cost savings, enabling the company to maintain operational flexibility and resilience in the face of external pressures. Merck’s financial profile allows it to fully fund research and development, support in-line products, and maximize upcoming launches while providing significant cash returns to shareholders. The company’s strategic initiatives include a focus on collaboration networks and inter-organizational collaboration to enhance its resilience strategies. Merck’s commitment to innovation and adaptability is reflected in its ongoing assessment of its portfolio and the strategic reconfiguration of its resources to respond effectively to environmental disruptions and market challenges.

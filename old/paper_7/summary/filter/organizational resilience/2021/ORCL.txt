We begin management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations with an overview of our businesses and significant trends. The impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on Oracle's business have introduced various challenges, affecting our operational flexibility and requiring us to adapt to unexpected situations. Our cloud and license business, which represented 84% and 83% of our total revenues in fiscal 2021 and 2020, respectively, has seen increased demand for our applications and infrastructure technologies delivered through various deployment models. This demand necessitates a strategic response to maintain our competitive advantage and ensure business continuity. We have introduced programs for customers to pivot their applications and infrastructure licenses to the Oracle cloud, reflecting our adaptability and resource allocation strategies in response to external pressures. The historical upward trend of our cloud and license business' revenues is primarily due to the addition of new cloud services and license support contracts, which are essential for maintaining operational continuity and performance under pressure. Our services business, which represented 8% of our total revenues, has been differentiated based on our focus on Oracle technologies and extensive experience, highlighting the importance of organizational health and capabilities in maximizing performance. The restructuring expenses incurred during fiscal 2021 were part of our strategic initiatives to improve our cost structure and operational efficiency, demonstrating our commitment to resilience strategies that address the complexities of market volatility. We expect to continue investing in research and development to enhance our offerings, which is crucial for sustaining organizational effectiveness and responding to environmental disruptions. The restructuring plan initiated in 2019 aimed to improve efficiencies and further develop our cloud-based offerings, showcasing our proactive measures to confront challenges and enhance organizational strength. Our ability to manage Oracle cloud capacity requirements is vital for meeting existing and prospective customer demand, indicating our focus on operational management and resource generation. The financial impact of potential acquisitions is assessed with regard to our strategic foresight and the implications for our operational resources. We believe that our current cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities will be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditure requirements, reflecting our organizational resilience in navigating financial constraints. The ongoing assessment of our financial condition and results of operations is crucial for understanding the assumptions and judgments that underpin our reported financial results, which are influenced by various internal and external factors. Our commitment to maintaining a positive adjustment under challenging conditions is evident in our strategic planning and operational responses, which are essential for ensuring long-term organizational survival and success.

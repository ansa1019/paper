Management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations indicates that the company is subject to various macroeconomic and industry risks that may adversely affect the markets and operating conditions of customers, which in turn can affect demand for products and services and results of operations. The aerospace business is impacted by customer buying patterns, supplier stability, and global supply chain capacity constraints that may lead to shortages of crucial components, while operating results may also be adversely affected by downturns in global demand for air travel, which may impact new aircraft production or result in delays or cancellations of new aircraft orders. The company continues to monitor the activities in corporate and all other to determine the need for further reportable business segment disaggregation. The global COVID-19 pandemic has created significant volatility, uncertainty, and economic disruption that have impacted business operations and financial results. The extent to which the pandemic will continue to impact operations will depend on numerous evolving factors, including the duration and severity of the pandemic, the pace of vaccine deployment, and the impact on economic activity. The company has taken significant cost actions, including reducing discretionary expenses and staffing levels, to mitigate the adverse effects of the pandemic. However, the effectiveness of these mitigation efforts is not currently ascertainable. The company also faces risks related to supply chain disruptions, including labor shortages and material price fluctuations, which could adversely affect the ability to meet commitments to customers and result in significant liabilities. The company’s ability to manage inventory and meet delivery requirements may be constrained by suppliers' inability to scale production during times of volatile demand. The company’s future growth is largely dependent upon its ability to develop new technologies and introduce new products that achieve market acceptance in increasingly competitive markets. The company is subject to unique risks as a supplier to the U.S. government, including the right of the government to terminate contracts for convenience and compliance risks. The company continues to assess the relative strength of each business in its portfolio to identify target investment and acquisition opportunities, as well as businesses that do not fit into its long-term strategic plan for potential divestiture or restructuring. The company’s operations and the prior operations of predecessor companies expose it to the risk of material environmental liabilities, and it continues to incur remedial response and voluntary cleanup costs for site contamination. The company believes that its policies, practices, and procedures are designed to prevent unreasonable risk of environmental damage and personal injury, although additional lawsuits and claims involving environmental matters are likely to arise in the future. The company’s management maintains disclosure controls and procedures designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting, and there have been no changes that materially affected internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended December 31, 2021. The company’s focus on managing and mitigating the impacts of COVID-19 may cause a diversion of resources from new initiatives or investments, potentially impacting future results of operations.

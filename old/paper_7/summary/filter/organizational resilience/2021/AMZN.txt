This annual report on Form 10-K includes forward-looking statements reflecting management's current expectations, which are inherently uncertain and could differ materially due to various factors, including fluctuations in global economic conditions and supply chain constraints. The ongoing impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic have varying effects on results of operations, making it difficult to isolate costs directly attributable to the pandemic, including increased wage rates and fulfillment network inefficiencies. Our financial focus is on long-term, sustainable growth in free cash flows, driven by increasing operating income and efficient management of accounts receivable, inventory, and cash capital expenditures. We seek to improve all aspects of the customer experience, including lowering prices and improving availability, which are fundamental to our future success. To minimize unnecessary growth in fixed costs, we aim to improve process efficiencies and maintain a lean culture. We expect variability in inventory turnover over time, influenced by factors such as product mix and sales by third-party sellers. Our technology and content investments support a variety of product and service offerings, reflecting our commitment to enhancing customer experience and improving process efficiencies. We anticipate increased spending in technology and content as we add employees and infrastructure, which is crucial for adapting to changing market conditions. Our operational flexibility is critical in managing fulfillment costs, which have risen due to increased product and service sales volume, labor market constraints, and supply chain disruptions. We regularly evaluate our facility requirements to accommodate anticipated shipment volumes and maintain in-stock inventory levels. The ability to foresee and confront sudden disruptive changes is essential for survival and growth, as we continue to invest in innovative software and electronic devices. We believe that our increasing diversification beyond the U.S. economy through our growing international businesses will benefit our shareholders in the long term. Our ability to manage risks associated with foreign exchange rates and economic fluctuations is vital for maintaining operational continuity and performance under pressure. We continually evaluate opportunities to strengthen our financial position through various strategic initiatives, including potential acquisitions and investments in complementary businesses. The complexity of our operations necessitates a multifaceted approach to resilience, ensuring that we can adapt and thrive in turbulent markets while maintaining a focus on customer needs and operational effectiveness.

We report our results in four reportable segments: U.S. pharmaceutical, prescription technology solutions ("RXT"), medical-surgical solutions, and international. Our organizational structure also includes corporate, which consists of income and expenses associated with administrative functions and projects, and the results of certain investments. The factors for determining the reportable segments include the manner in which management evaluates the performance of the company combined with the nature of individual business activities. We evaluate the performance of our operating segments on a number of measures, including revenues and operating profit before interest expense and income taxes. The evaluation of performance reflects our ability to maintain operational continuity and adapt to the demands of the business environment, which is essential for organizational resilience. The management's assessment of performance incorporates a systemic perspective, recognizing the need for flexibility and adaptability in response to external pressures and environmental disruptions. By focusing on the operational resources and strategic initiatives, we aim to enhance our organizational capabilities and ensure effective resource allocation, which is critical for sustaining performance under pressure. Our approach to performance evaluation emphasizes the importance of resilience strategies and mechanisms that enable us to confront unexpected situations and reconfigure our operations in the face of adversity. The integration of knowledge management practices supports our ability to absorb strain and maintain organizational health, thereby contributing to our overall resilience. The organizational structure facilitates inter-organizational collaboration and enhances our capacity for innovation, which is vital for navigating complex situations and achieving major objectives. Through continuous assessment and adjustment of our strategic response, we strive to uphold our performance and operational effectiveness, ensuring that we can thrive even in turbulent markets. The focus on learning processes and stakeholder engagement further strengthens our organizational identity and fosters a culture of resilience, enabling us to foresee and respond to disruptive changes effectively. Our commitment to proactive measures and strategic foresight underpins our resilience framework, allowing us to manage risks and capitalize on opportunities for growth and flourishing in a competitive landscape.

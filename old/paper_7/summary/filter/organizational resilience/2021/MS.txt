Management's discussion and analysis for resolution and recovery planning emphasizes the importance of effective risk management as vital to business success. The enterprise risk management (ERM) framework integrates diverse roles of risk management into a holistic structure, facilitating risk assessment in decision-making processes across the firm. The framework is underpinned by principles of integrity, comprehensiveness, independence, accountability, and transparency, ensuring that risk management is an essential component of the firm's reputation. The fast-paced and complex nature of global financial markets necessitates a risk management culture that is incisive and knowledgeable, subject to ongoing review and enhancement. The firm maintains a risk appetite that defines the aggregate level and types of risk it is willing to accept to achieve its business objectives, ensuring alignment with strategic, capital, and financial plans. The board oversees the ERM framework, ensuring risks are managed soundly and that major risk exposures are monitored and controlled effectively. The operations and technology committee oversees business continuity and resilience, including cybersecurity risks and the steps management has taken to monitor and control such exposures. The firm risk committee, co-chaired by the chief executive officer and chief risk officer, oversees risk management principles, procedures, and limits, monitoring capital levels and material risks. The governance process includes independent oversight and accountability across business divisions, ensuring effective communication of risk matters. The internal audit department independently assesses risk management processes and controls, reinforcing the firm's commitment to maintaining operational continuity and resilience. The firmâ€™s culture, values, and conduct program emphasizes accountability and adherence to core values, which are integral to fostering an environment conducive to resilience. The risk management framework includes comprehensive practices to evaluate, monitor, and control credit risk, ensuring timely communication of material risks and compliance with established limits. Stress tests are conducted to assess the impact of adverse scenarios on credit and market exposures, enabling proactive measures to mitigate risks. The firm actively manages country risk exposure through a comprehensive framework that combines credit and market fundamentals, allowing for effective identification, monitoring, and limitation of risks. This multifaceted approach to risk management reflects the firm's ability to foresee and confront challenges, thereby enhancing its organizational resilience in the face of environmental disruptions and uncertainties. The emphasis on strategic initiatives and risk mitigation strategies supports the firm's adaptability and operational flexibility, ensuring it can respond effectively to unexpected situations and maintain performance under pressure.

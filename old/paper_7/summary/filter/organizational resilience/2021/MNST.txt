The transaction allows us to enter the alcohol beverage sector and brings the cigar city family of brands, the oskar blues family of brands, the deep ellum family of brands, the perrin brewing family of brands, the squatters family of brands, and the wasatch family of brands to our beverage portfolio. Our organizational structure for our existing energy beverage business will remain unchanged. Canarchy will function independently, retaining its own organizational structure and team. This independent operation may enhance our organizational resilience by allowing for adaptability and operational flexibility within the new segment while maintaining the integrity and performance of our existing business. The provisions in our organizational documents and/or control by insiders may prevent changes in control even if such changes would be beneficial to other stockholders, which could impact our strategic response to external pressures and risks. The ability to absorb strain and preserve functioning despite adversity is critical as we navigate the complexities of integrating Canarchy into our portfolio while ensuring that our organizational health and performance are not compromised. This approach reflects our commitment to maintaining positive adjustment under challenging conditions, thereby reinforcing our resilience strategies in the face of market volatility and environmental disruptions. The integration process will require careful resource allocation and management to ensure that we can effectively respond to any unforeseen challenges that may arise during this transition. By focusing on inter-organizational collaboration and leveraging the strengths of both our existing and new brands, we aim to enhance our competitive advantage and foster an environment conducive to innovation and growth. The emphasis on maintaining operational continuity and organizational effectiveness will be paramount as we strive to achieve our major objectives and navigate the turbulent markets associated with the beverage industry.

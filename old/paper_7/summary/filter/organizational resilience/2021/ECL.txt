During 2018, we formally commenced a restructuring plan to leverage technology and system investments and organizational changes. The goal of the plan is to further simplify and automate processes and tasks, reduce complexity and management layers, consolidate facilities, and focus on key long-term growth areas by further leveraging technology and structural improvements. This restructuring plan reflects our strategic initiatives aimed at enhancing organizational effectiveness and operational flexibility in response to external pressures and the need for adaptation in a turbulent business environment. During 2020, we expanded the plan for additional costs and savings to further leverage the technology and structural improvements, indicating a proactive approach to resource allocation and risk management. Following the establishment of the separate institutional plan, we now expect that the restructuring activities will be completed by the end of 2022, with total anticipated costs of $255 million ($195 million after tax), or $0.67 per diluted share, over this period of time, when revised for continuing operations. The costs are expected to be primarily cash expenditures for severance costs and some facility closure costs relating to team reorganizations, which underscores our commitment to maintaining operational continuity and addressing potential performance impairments. Actual costs may vary from these estimates depending on actions taken, highlighting the need for ongoing assessment and adjustment in our organizational response to unforeseen circumstances.

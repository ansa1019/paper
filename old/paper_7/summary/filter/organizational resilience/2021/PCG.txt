The California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) initiated a formal investigation into PG&E Corporation's organizational culture and governance to assess whether they prioritize safety and adequately direct resources to promote accountability and achieve safety goals and standards. This investigation, referred to as the "safety culture oii," includes an evaluation of the utility's organizational culture, governance, policies, practices, and accountability metrics in relation to its operational record, including safety incidents. The focus on organizational culture implies a need for resilience in the face of operational challenges, as it reflects the organization's ability to adapt and maintain performance under pressures and constraints. The assessment of governance and resource allocation is critical to understanding how PG&E Corporation can effectively respond to external pressures and ensure operational continuity, thereby enhancing its resilience strategies. The investigation aims to identify mechanisms that can facilitate recovery and adaptation in response to safety incidents, which are indicative of the organization's capacity to confront adversity and maintain integrity. By evaluating the utility's practices and accountability, the CPUC seeks to understand the interplay between organizational effectiveness and resilience, particularly in how PG&E Corporation manages risks and navigates complex situations. The findings from this investigation may provide insights into the organizational dynamics that contribute to resilience, including the deployment of resources, strategic initiatives, and the overall health of the organization in the face of environmental disruptions. This inquiry into PG&E Corporation's safety culture serves as a critical examination of how organizational practices can influence resilience and the ability to sustain performance amid challenges, ultimately impacting the utility's long-term viability and success in a turbulent business environment.

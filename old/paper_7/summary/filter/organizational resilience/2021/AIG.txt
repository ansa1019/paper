This annual report on Form 10-K may include statements that relate to future actions, prospective services or products, and the anticipated organizational, business, or regulatory changes, such as the separation of the life and retirement business, which can impact organizational resilience. The effect of catastrophes, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, and macroeconomic events are also considered as factors that influence the organizationâ€™s ability to adapt and maintain performance under pressure. General operating and other expenses increased primarily due to costs associated with organizational simplification, operational efficiency, and business rationalization, which are indicative of efforts to enhance organizational capabilities and resilience. The restructuring and other costs primarily comprised employee severance charges and other costs related to these initiatives, reflecting a strategic response to internal pressures and the need for operational flexibility. The management's focus on achieving operational efficiency and business rationalization suggests an awareness of the need to reconfigure resources and practices to confront external disturbances and maintain organizational health. These efforts are aligned with the overarching goal of sustaining performance and ensuring the organization can navigate complex situations and environmental disruptions effectively. The anticipated outcomes from these strategic initiatives underscore the importance of resilience strategies in fostering adaptability and ensuring the organization can thrive despite adversity.

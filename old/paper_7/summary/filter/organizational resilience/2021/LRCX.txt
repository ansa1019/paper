Throughout the 2021 fiscal year, we experienced higher costs of goods sold related to freight and logistics, which were partially driven by disruptions from the COVID-19 pandemic. We believe that maintaining sufficient liquidity reserves is important to support sustaining levels of investment in research and development and capital infrastructure, especially given the semiconductor industry's highly competitive nature and historical rapid changes in demand. Our customer support business group focuses attention on delivering solutions that meet our customers' technical requirements and productivity needs during the equipment lifecycle. We aim to increase our strategic relevance with our customers by contributing more to their continued success, which is essential for organizational health and resilience. The anticipated cash flows from operations, combined with our current levels of cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments, are expected to be sufficient to support our anticipated levels of operations, investments, and capital expenditures through at least the next twelve months. However, uncertainty in the global economy and the semiconductor industry, as well as disruptions in credit markets, have the potential to impact customer demand for our products and our ability to manage normal commercial relationships with our customers, suppliers, and creditors. We have built a strong global presence with core competencies in areas like nanoscale applications enablement and advanced systems engineering, which contribute to our operational flexibility and competitive advantage. Our focus on research and development, along with our collaborative focus with ecosystem partners, enhances our ability to absorb strain and preserve functioning despite the presence of adversity. The increase in wafer fabrication equipment spending by semiconductor manufacturers during the fiscal year reflects stronger customer demand, which is integral to our performance maintenance and recovery strategies. We believe we are in a strong position to facilitate significant innovations in semiconductor device manufacturing, which is critical for our organizational resilience. Our liquidity will depend on our future revenues and our ability to appropriately manage our costs based on demand for our products and services. While we have substantial cash balances, we may require additional funding and need or choose to raise the required funds through borrowings or public or private sales of debt or equity securities. The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has previously caused disruption in the capital markets, and similar future disruptions could make financing more challenging. Our critical accounting policies reflect the significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements, which are essential for maintaining organizational coherence and effectiveness. We continuously evaluate uncertain tax positions and the realizability of deferred tax assets, which are vital for our financial health and operational continuity. Our expansion of the global production footprint, including the construction of a manufacturing facility in Malaysia, is expected to enhance our capabilities and support our long-term strategic objectives.

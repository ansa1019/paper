In fiscal 2021, we introduced the fico® resilience index, a complement to fico scores that identifies consumers who are more resilient to economic stress relative to other consumers within the same fico score bands. This initiative reflects our commitment to developing scores that utilize alternative data to enhance conventional credit bureau data and generate scores for otherwise un-scorable consumers. The focus on resilience in our scoring solutions underscores our understanding of the importance of adaptability and performance maintenance under challenging conditions. By identifying consumers who exhibit resilience, we are acknowledging the multifaceted nature of resilience, which encompasses the ability to confront and benefit from sudden disruptive changes. Our efforts in creating predictive scores and the fico® resilience index demonstrate a strategic initiative aimed at enhancing organizational health and operational flexibility in response to external pressures. The development of these tools is indicative of our commitment to fostering organizational capabilities that support positive adjustment and recovery in the face of adversity, thereby contributing to our overall business continuity and performance.

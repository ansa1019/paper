Abbvie's strategy has focused on delivering strong financial results, maximizing the benefits of the Allergan acquisition, and ensuring a strong, sustainable growth business over the long term. The company continues to invest in and expand its pipeline, supporting opportunities in immunology, oncology, aesthetics, neuroscience, and eye care. In response to the ongoing public health crisis posed by COVID-19, Abbvie has implemented safety measures for employees returning to the workplace and closely managed manufacturing and supply chain resources to ensure an uninterrupted supply of medicines. The company has experienced lower new patient starts in certain products and markets due to the pandemic, which could continue to negatively impact its results of operations. Abbvie remains committed to driving continued expansion of operating margins and expects to achieve this objective through the realization of expense synergies from the Allergan acquisition, revenue growth, productivity initiatives in supply chain, and ongoing efficiency programs. The integration plan following the Allergan acquisition is expected to realize approximately $2.5 billion of annual cost synergies in 2022, which will involve resource allocation towards achieving integration objectives. Abbvie's mission is to discover and develop innovative medicines that address serious health issues while achieving top-tier financial performance through outstanding execution. The company anticipates several regulatory submissions and data readouts from key clinical trials in the next 12 months, which are crucial for maintaining operational flexibility and adapting to market demands. Abbvie's financial performance reflects growth across its product portfolios, indicating a positive adjustment under challenging conditions. The company has also established a framework to monitor economic conditions, creditworthiness of customers, and government regulations, which are essential for risk management and ensuring organizational health. Abbvie's ability to generate cash flows from operations and attract long-term capital on acceptable terms is critical for supporting growth objectives, particularly in the face of external pressures and market volatility. The company has demonstrated resilience through strategic initiatives that leverage its commercial strength and international infrastructure, ensuring strong commercial execution of new product launches. Abbvie's focus on research and innovation is a cornerstone of its business, with a pipeline that includes approximately 90 compounds in development, reflecting the company's commitment to organizational resilience and adaptability in a complex and dynamic market environment. The ability to foresee and confront sudden disruptive changes is integral to Abbvie's operational strategy, enabling the organization to survive, grow, and flourish despite adversity.

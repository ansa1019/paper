We operate in the highly competitive omni-channel retail industry in all of the markets we serve, facing strong sales competition from various sectors. We are influenced by factors including catastrophic events, weather and other risks related to climate change, global health epidemics, competitive pressures, supply chain disruptions, and consumer preferences. The ongoing uncertainty in our business and the global economy due to the duration and intensity of the COVID-19 pandemic may impact our results. We have taken certain strategic actions to strengthen our portfolio for the long term, which includes divestitures that reflect our ability to adapt to changing market conditions. Our objective of prioritizing strong, efficient growth means we will focus on the most productive growth opportunities while adjusting our business strategies to maintain and strengthen our competitive positions. We invest in technology and process improvements to increase productivity, manage inventory, and reduce costs, which are essential for operational flexibility and resilience. 

We define our financial framework as strong, efficient growth, consistent operating discipline, and strategic capital allocation. As we execute on this financial framework, we believe our returns on capital will improve over time. Our strategic capital allocation includes improving customer-facing initiatives in stores and clubs and creating a seamless omni-channel experience, which is vital for maintaining operational continuity and organizational effectiveness. The increase in comparable sales was driven by growth in average ticket and transactions, indicating our ability to respond effectively to consumer needs and market demands. 

Operating expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased, benefiting from growth in comparable sales and lower incremental COVID-19 related costs, which demonstrates our capability to manage resources effectively under pressure. Our liquidity and capital resources are supported by strong cash flows from operations, which have historically provided a significant source of liquidity. We believe our sources of liquidity will continue to be sufficient to fund operations, finance global investment activities, and support our strategic initiatives. 

We also maintain access to various credit facilities to support our international operations as needed, reflecting our organizational resilience in navigating financial challenges. Our approach to risk management includes assessing the impact of external disturbances and adapting our strategies accordingly, which is crucial for sustaining performance under pressure. The strategic decisions we make, including capital expenditures focused on supply chain and technology, are designed to enhance our operational management and adaptability in the face of environmental disruptions. 

Overall, our commitment to operational flexibility, resource management, and strategic foresight positions us to confront challenges effectively and maintain positive adjustments under adverse conditions, thereby supporting our long-term organizational resilience and success.

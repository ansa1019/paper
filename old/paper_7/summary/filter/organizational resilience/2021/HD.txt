The organizationâ€™s ability to absorb strain and preserve or improve functioning despite the presence of adversity is critical to its operational continuity. We assess our sales performance by evaluating both net sales and comparable sales, which reflect our strategic efforts to drive an enhanced interconnected experience in both the physical and digital worlds. The increase in comparable sales reflected a number of factors, including strong home improvement demand and benefits from our strategic initiatives. Our operating expenses were primarily driven by leverage resulting from a positive comparable sales environment, which indicates operational flexibility in response to external pressures. The disciplined approach to capital allocation prioritizes investing in the business, which supports long-term strategic positioning and adaptability in the face of economic challenges. We believe that our current cash position, cash flow generated from operations, and access to the long-term debt capital markets should be sufficient to enable us to invest in the business, fund dividend payments, and satisfy other contractual obligations through the next several fiscal years. Our cash flow generated from operations provides us with a significant source of liquidity, which is essential for maintaining organizational health and resilience. The evaluation of long-lived assets for potential impairment reflects our commitment to maintaining performance under pressure and adapting to changes in market conditions. The increase in online sales was driven by customers leveraging our digital platforms, demonstrating our ability to innovate and respond to customer needs effectively. We recognize that the timing of cash receipts and payments, vendor payment terms, and fluctuations in foreign exchange rates can impact working capital, which is a critical component of our operational management. The strategic response to environmental disruptions includes a focus on maintaining integrity and performance while navigating complex situations. We have the ability to obtain alternative sources of financing if necessary, which enhances our resilience strategies. The assessment of uncertain tax positions requires significant judgment, reflecting the complexities of our operational environment. Our approach to capital expenditures may be adjusted to support the operations of the business, which is indicative of our proactive measures in response to external disturbances. The increase in gross profit margin was impacted by higher product and transportation costs, which we managed through strategic tools and resource allocation. The performance maintenance of our organization is evident in our ability to navigate challenges while continuing to grow and flourish. The multifaceted nature of resilience is reflected in our organizational practices and the collaborative networks we have established to enhance our adaptability and response mechanisms. The financial resources available to us, along with our operational resources, support our strategic adaptation and transformation efforts, ensuring we remain competitive in a turbulent market environment.

As of the end of 2021, our achievement of revenue synergies from the Worldpay acquisition have exceeded our targets, driven by successful cross-sell of our heritage FIS solutions into heritage Worldpay clients and leveraging our heritage Worldpay sales and distribution teams, expanding on our existing relationships with financial institutions to establish merchant referral agreements and optimizing our network routing capabilities. We have also exceeded our original target for expense synergies, as we have successfully integrated organizational structures, reduced corporate overhead and achieved cost savings within our operating environment. This integration reflects our capacity for operational flexibility and adaptation in response to the challenges presented by the acquisition, which can be seen as a form of organizational resilience. The successful integration of organizational structures and the optimization of our network routing capabilities indicate our ability to maintain performance and achieve major objectives despite the complexities and pressures associated with such a significant organizational change. The ability to confront and benefit from the disruptive change brought about by the acquisition illustrates our commitment to resilience strategies that enhance our organizational health and operational continuity. By effectively managing our resources and reconfiguring our operational practices, we have demonstrated a proactive approach to mitigating risks and addressing potential challenges, thereby ensuring our performance under pressure. The achievement of cost savings and the establishment of new relationships with financial institutions further exemplify our strategic initiatives aimed at enhancing our competitive advantage and sustaining our growth trajectory. Through these efforts, we have not only preserved our functioning but have also positioned ourselves to flourish in a turbulent business environment, showcasing our organizational capabilities and commitment to resilience in the face of adversity.

We are leveraging the Raytheon merger to undertake various strategic initiatives to transform the company and increase our existing focus on operational excellence. These initiatives include significant investments in digital technologies across our business to enhance our products and services, as well as structural cost reduction initiatives. Our operations can be affected by industrial, economic, and political factors on both a regional and global level, which necessitates a focus on business continuity and operational flexibility. The COVID-19 pandemic has continued to negatively affect the global economy, our business and operations, supply chains, and the industries in which we operate. While we believe that the long-term outlook for the aerospace industry remains positive, there continues to be uncertainty with respect to the recovery of commercial air traffic capacity to pre-COVID-19 levels. We continue to monitor for any further government guidance related to COVID-19 that may be issued, as well as the implications of government-imposed travel restrictions and safety regulations on our operations. The impact of potential sanctions or other actions by foreign governments could disrupt our business operations, highlighting the need for adaptability and resilience strategies. We are continuously evaluating our cost structure and have implemented restructuring actions in an effort to keep our cost structure competitive, which reflects our commitment to organizational health and performance maintenance. Our focus on program execution and the prudent management of capital and investments is critical to maximizing operating income and cash. We believe that total backlog is an important measure of future performance, representing the aggregate dollar value of firm orders for which products have not been provided or service has not been performed. Our defense operations consist primarily of our Raytheon Intelligence & Space and Raytheon Missiles & Defense businesses, which are affected by U.S. Department of Defense budget and spending levels, changes in demand, and the global political environment. The successful navigation of these external pressures is essential for maintaining competitive advantage and ensuring organizational survival. We have seen increases in certain employee-related and discretionary costs, which had decreased in the aftermath of COVID-19 due to one-time cost reduction actions. As our commercial aerospace business recovers, we expect to incur additional costs related to labor and operational continuity. The ability to absorb strain and preserve functioning despite adversity is central to our operational management strategy. We continue to assess our financial performance through various metrics, including organic change in net sales and operating profit, which provide transparency to the underlying performance of our business. The ongoing evaluation of our organizational capabilities, including risk assessment and resource allocation, is crucial for sustaining operational effectiveness and responding to complex situations. We are committed to fostering a learning organization that can adapt to environmental disruptions and enhance our resilience through strategic foresight and proactive measures.

The results of our individual businesses reflect the manner in which management evaluates performance and makes decisions about funding our operations and allocating resources. We may periodically change our business segments or reclassify business segment results based on modifications to our management reporting methodologies and changes in organizational alignment. Our internal management and reporting process employs various allocation methodologies to assign certain balance sheet assets, deposits, and other liabilities and their related revenue and expenses directly or indirectly attributable to each business segment. We regularly assess the assumptions, methodologies, and major categories of risk compliance, including the risk to current or anticipated earnings or capital arising from violations of laws, rules, or regulations. Compliance risk can arise from nonconformance with prescribed practices, internal policies and procedures, contractual obligations, or ethical standards. The risk to current or projected financial condition and resilience arises from an obligor's failure to meet the terms of any contract with the company or otherwise perform as agreed. We also address the risk that the company will not be able to meet its future financial obligations or invest in future asset growth due to an inability to obtain funds at a reasonable price within a reasonable time. Operational risk includes the potential for loss, capital impairment, adverse customer experience, or reputational impact resulting from failure to comply with policies and procedures, failed internal processes or systems, or from external events. The strategic risk involves a material impact on current or anticipated earnings, capital, franchise, or enterprise value arising from the company's competitive and market position and evolving forces in the industry. Our underwriting decisions are generally based on an applicant's income, estimated net disposable income, and credit bureau information, along with collateral characteristics. We maintain resilience under a variety of stress conditions, and our auto loans are designed to withstand fluctuations in market conditions. The allocation process is unique to each business segment and acquired business, ensuring that we adapt to internal and external variations while maintaining operational continuity. Our approach to risk management emphasizes the importance of strategic initiatives and the ability to respond effectively to environmental disruptions, thereby enhancing our organizational capabilities and ensuring performance maintenance under pressure. The multifaceted nature of resilience is reflected in our ability to foresee, confront, and benefit from sudden disruptive change, which is essential for our survival and growth in a turbulent market environment.

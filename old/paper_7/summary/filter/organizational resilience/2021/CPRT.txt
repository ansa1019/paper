We believe we contribute to disaster recovery and resilience in the communities we serve. For example, we mobilized our people, entered into emergency leases, and engaged with a multitude of service providers to timely retrieve, store, and remarket tens of thousands of flood-damaged vehicles in the Houston, Texas metropolitan area in the wake of Hurricane Harvey in the summer of 2017. This response illustrates our ability to adapt and reconfigure our operations in the face of disruptive events, thereby maintaining operational continuity and supporting community resilience. Additionally, we enable more affordable access to mobility around the world, which contributes to economic development and well-being, particularly in developing countries where transportation is essential for education, health care, and overall well-being. Our actions reflect a commitment to organizational resilience by addressing external pressures and facilitating recovery in exceptional conditions, demonstrating our capacity to function effectively under adversity while enhancing our organizational strength and operational flexibility.

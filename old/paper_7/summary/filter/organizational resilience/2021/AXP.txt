We are a globally integrated payments company with a strategy of investing in our customers, brand, and talent, which is helping in our effort to drive share, scale, and relevance. Our results reflect the strong growth momentum we have seen throughout 2021, with net income more than doubling versus the prior year, contributing to this increase was a credit reserve release and sizeable net gains on equity investments. As certain pandemic-related restrictions were lifted and macroeconomic conditions improved, we saw a steady recovery in our business, with certain key areas growing beyond pre-pandemic levels. The year-over-year growth in billed business was led by the U.S., where spend increased significantly, primarily driven by U.S. consumers and small and mid-sized enterprises. Our ongoing investments in differentiated value propositions and expansion of our digital capabilities are helping to drive increased card member engagement and strong retention rates. We believe that continuing our strategy of investing at high levels will position us well as we seek to deliver sustainable and profitable long-term growth. 

Our balance sheet management objectives aim to maintain a solid and flexible equity capital profile, a broad set of funding sources, and liquidity programs that enable us to meet expected future financing obligations during economic downturns. The global macroeconomic outlook remains uncertain due to various factors, including labor shortages and supply chain disruptions. We monitor the changing macroeconomic environment and manage our balance sheet to reflect evolving circumstances. Our capital strategy is to retain sufficient levels of capital generated through net income and other sources to maintain a strong balance sheet and support future business growth. 

We utilize a comprehensive enterprise-wide risk management program to identify, aggregate, monitor, and manage risks, with oversight provided by our board of directors. This program defines our risk appetite, governance, culture, and capabilities. The risk committee reviews our risk profile against specified tolerances, including significant risk exposures and trends. We consider operational risk to be the risk of loss due to inadequate or failed processes, people, or information systems, and we have implemented a comprehensive operational risk framework to measure and manage these risks. 

Our funding and liquidity risk management process ensures we maintain access to a diverse set of liquidity sources to meet our obligations. We seek to maintain a balanced debt maturity profile and monitor our financial exposure to both sovereign and non-sovereign customers. We define climate-related risk as risks related to the transition to a low-carbon economy and the physical impacts of climate change, which can have broad impacts on our customers and operations. 

We are committed to enhancing our focus on climate-related risk within our risk governance framework. Our operational risk management process includes assessing operational risk events to determine root causes and impacts, ensuring we can adapt and respond effectively to potential disruptions. The implementation of our risk management strategies is crucial for maintaining organizational resilience in the face of external pressures and uncertainties.

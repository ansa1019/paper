The climate report details the work underway across our global business to enhance our resilience to future climate-related risks. This includes efforts to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, improve energy efficiency, and advance the use of renewable energy. The updated climate report reflects our continued progress towards alignment with the current recommendations of the task force on climate-related financial disclosures. It emphasizes the importance of organizational capabilities in responding effectively to environmental disruptions and transforming operations to emerge stronger from challenging situations. The report also indicates that we are actively addressing climate-related risks, which are discussed in item 1a. "risk factors" contained in part I of our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021. This aligns with the concept of organizational resilience, which is the ability to absorb strain and preserve functioning despite adversity, thereby maintaining integrity and performance under varying pressures and constraints.

The markets for software, devices, and cloud-based services are dynamic and highly competitive, requiring us to continue to evolve and adapt over an extended time in pace with this changing environment. As the world continues to respond to COVID-19, we are working to ensure the safety of our employees and protect the health and well-being of the communities in which we operate. Our cloud usage and demand benefited as customers accelerated their digital transformation priorities. The COVID-19 pandemic may continue to impact our business operations and financial results, and there is uncertainty in the nature and degree of its continued effects over time. Our success is highly dependent on our ability to attract and retain qualified employees, and we compete for talented individuals globally by offering an exceptional working environment and competitive compensation and benefits. We must navigate pressures related to global macroeconomic and geopolitical factors, which remain dynamic and can significantly affect our revenue and expenses. Extended disruptions at suppliers could lead to a similar disruption in our ability to manufacture devices on time to meet consumer demand. Our investments in infrastructure and devices will continue to increase our operating costs and may decrease our operating margins. We have seen improvement in customer advertising spend and savings in operating expenses related to COVID-19, but experienced weakness in transactional licensing. Our commercial metrics allow management and investors to assess the overall health of our commercial business and include leading indicators of future performance. The investments we are making in cloud engineering and commercial sales reflect our commitment to maintaining operational flexibility and resilience. Our research and development expenses increased as we continue to invest in cloud engineering, which is vital for adapting to changing demands of customers and users. We are also focused on strategic initiatives that enhance our organizational capabilities and resilience strategies, enabling us to confront and benefit from sudden disruptive change. Our financial performance is assessed through metrics that reflect our cloud and on-premises product strategies and trends, which are essential for maintaining performance under pressure. The dynamic nature of our industry presents both challenges and opportunities, requiring us to leverage our organizational intelligence and adaptability to thrive in turbulent markets. Our ability to reconfigure resources and respond effectively to environmental disruptions is critical for ensuring operational continuity and achieving our major objectives. The ongoing transformation in our business environment necessitates a multifaceted approach to risk management and strategic adaptation, ensuring that we remain resilient in the face of adversity and can sustain our growth trajectory. We are committed to fostering a culture of learning and innovation, which is essential for enhancing our organizational resilience and effectiveness in navigating complex situations.

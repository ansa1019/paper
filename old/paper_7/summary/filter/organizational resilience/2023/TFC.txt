In September 2023, the company unveiled an organizational simplification and cost savings plan aimed at limiting expenses in 2024 and beyond and simplifying the organization to gain efficiencies that will improve the client experience. The transformation is centered on improving efficiency as an organization and realigning certain aspects of leadership and the operating model within operating segments to increase efficiency and drive revenue opportunities. Strong progress on this plan was made in the second half of 2023, evidenced by a reduction in headcount and the consolidation of several key business lines. The cybersecurity framework is designed to help oversee, identify, and mitigate cybersecurity risks associated with the use of third-party service providers. Following an initial assessment of the level of enterprise risk potentially posed by third-party use, the service provider is then subject to further risk-based assessments on its operational resilience and cybersecurity practices, including disaster recovery and business continuity plans that specify the time frame to resume activities and recover data. In its agreements with third-party service providers, the company requires adherence to relevant cybersecurity and operational resilience standards, subject to certain exceptions managed on a case-by-case basis. The company continues to strengthen its cross-functional, holistic approach to enterprise resilience by addressing potential amplification of risks from significant technology, cybersecurity, and data incidents. As part of these efforts, capabilities for both disaster recovery and restoration are being deepened, along with the implementation of other resilience measures. The company is committed to operating in a manner that reflects its stated purpose, mission, and values, seeking to protect its reputation, public confidence, and resilience by identifying and evaluating associated risks that conflict with the expectations of internal and external stakeholders, including clients, teammates, investors, regulators, and communities.

The NCUC recognized the value of an "all of the above" approach to achieving CO2 emission reductions and established a set of near-term procurement and development activities needed to continue progress towards the targeted CO2 reductions, along with the schedule for the future biennial updates to the carbon plan. The NCUC approved a near-term action plan including stakeholder engagement activities for onshore wind generation and certain procurement and development activities to strengthen the grid, improve resilience for customers and interconnect new generation and storage, subject to any further applicable regulatory processes. Additionally, the NCUC approved early development activities for long lead-time resources, affirmed the ownership structure required in HB 951, and provided an orderly transition out of coal generation by 2035. These initiatives reflect a strategic response to enhance operational flexibility and resilience in the face of environmental perturbations and external pressures, thereby ensuring organizational effectiveness and continuity in service delivery. The focus on stakeholder engagement and interconnectivity among resources indicates a commitment to fostering collaboration networks that can adapt to complex situations and support organizational survival amidst disruptive change. The actions taken under the carbon plan illustrate a proactive approach to resource management and strategic adaptation, aiming to maintain performance and integrity while navigating the challenges posed by regulatory and environmental demands. The emphasis on improving resilience for customers aligns with the broader objective of organizational health and sustainability, showcasing the organization's capability to foresee and confront adversity while reconfiguring its operational strategies to emerge stronger from such challenges.

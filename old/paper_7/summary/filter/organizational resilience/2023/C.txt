Citi demonstrated substantial progress across the franchise during 2023, despite the impact of several notable items in the fourth quarter. The increase in revenues reflected strength across services and U.S. personal banking, partially offset by declines in markets, banking, and wealth. The company continued to make progress with the wind-downs of its consumer banking businesses in Korea, China, and Russia, as well as the planned initial public offering of its consumer banking and small business and middle-market banking operations in Mexico. Citi's efforts include continued investments in its transformation, including the remediation of its consent orders, which aim to strengthen risk and controls while improving value to customers, clients, and shareholders. The CEO has made the strengthening of Citi's risk and control environment a strategic priority, establishing a chief operating officer organization to centralize program management. The boards of directors formed a transformation oversight committee to provide oversight of management's remediation efforts. Citi's multiyear transformation targets the simultaneous strengthening of risk and controls and the enhancement of its operational models to adapt to external pressures and market volatility. The company expects to incur additional costs related to its organizational simplification initiatives, reflecting its commitment to reconfiguring its operational framework to maintain performance under challenging conditions. The increase in provisions for credit losses was driven by higher net credit losses in branded cards and retail services, reflecting normalization from historically low levels. The net allowance for credit losses included significant builds related to increases in transfer risk associated with exposures in Russia and Argentina, driven by safety and soundness considerations under U.S. banking law. The higher expenses were partially offset by productivity savings and expense reductions from exited markets and continued wind-downs in legacy franchises. Citi's CET1 capital ratio increased, driven by net income and beneficial movements in accumulated other comprehensive income, despite the payment of common dividends and share repurchases. The company continues to assess common share repurchases on a quarter-by-quarter basis, given uncertainty regarding regulatory capital requirements. The organizational simplification initiatives and the focus on risk management are indicative of Citi's strategic resilience and adaptability in navigating complex situations and external disturbances. The firmâ€™s operational flexibility and commitment to future planning are essential components of its strategy to confront and benefit from sudden disruptive changes, ensuring organizational health and effectiveness in a turbulent market environment. The ongoing investments in technology and other risk controls reflect a proactive approach to enhancing organizational capabilities and maintaining performance under pressure.

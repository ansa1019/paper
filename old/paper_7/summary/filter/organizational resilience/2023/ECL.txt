During 2018, we formally commenced a restructuring plan accelerate 2020 ("the a2020 plan"), to leverage technology and system investments and organizational changes. The goals of the a2020 plan were to further simplify and automate processes and tasks, reduce complexity and management layers, consolidate facilities and focus on key long-term growth areas by further leveraging technology and structural improvements. The restructuring activities were completed at the end of 2022, with total costs of $254.4 million ($198.4 million after tax), or $0.69 per diluted share. The restructuring plan reflects the organization's ability to adapt to internal and external pressures, aiming to enhance operational flexibility and maintain performance under challenging conditions. By focusing on reducing complexity and consolidating resources, the organization demonstrates a proactive approach to managing potential disruptions and ensuring business continuity. The investment in technology and structural improvements indicates a strategic response to environmental disruptions, aligning with the organization's objectives to preserve and enhance functioning despite adversity. The restructuring charges recorded in 2022 and 2021 further illustrate the commitment to reconfiguring organizational practices to support resilience strategies and mechanisms that facilitate recovery and adaptation in the face of operational challenges.

The preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses, and the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements. Actual results may differ from these estimates and such differences could be material to the financial statements. We report our results in seven segments and evaluate financial performance in each business segment, using segment gross margin and segment operating profit as factors. Our primary business is the leasing of space on communications sites, which accounted for 99% of our total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2023. We manage rooftop and tower sites for property owners under various contractual arrangements, which provides us with opportunities to generate recurring revenue. The majority of our tenant leases have initial non-cancellable terms with multiple renewal terms, ensuring a consistent revenue stream. We expect to generate over $60 billion of non-cancellable customer lease revenue over future periods. Variability and uncertainty in collections, particularly in markets like India, have necessitated a strategic review of our business, which included evaluating our exposure to the India market and assessing opportunities to repurpose capital for sustained growth. This review led to the conclusion that certain fixed and intangible assets had been impaired, resulting in significant impairment charges. We continue to monitor the status of developments in India, as changes in estimated cash flows could have further negative effects on previously recorded assets. Our ability to generate cash flow from operating activities is influenced by maintaining recurring revenue and minimizing operating costs, which is essential for operational flexibility and performance maintenance. We believe that consistent carrier network investments across our international markets will position us to generate meaningful organic revenue growth. Our strategic initiatives include selectively developing or acquiring new sites in existing and new markets, which is crucial for adapting to market demands and ensuring long-term sustainability. We focus on increasing the utilization and return on investment from our sites, which is a function of the rate at which wireless carriers deploy capital to improve and expand their networks. Our operational management strategies are designed to enhance our organizational capabilities and resilience, allowing us to confront external pressures and adapt to environmental disruptions. We also emphasize the importance of stakeholder engagement and inter-organizational collaboration to strengthen our competitive advantage. As we navigate challenges such as market volatility and rising interest rates, our liquidity and capital resources are critical for funding future growth and expansion initiatives. We continuously assess our global operations to ensure our portfolio is positioned to drive sustained growth and achieve our risk-adjusted return objectives, which may involve divesting certain assets and reallocating resources to prioritize strategic opportunities.

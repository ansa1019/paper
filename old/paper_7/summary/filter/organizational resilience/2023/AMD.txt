During 2023, we successfully launched multiple leadership products across our business and made important progress on our artificial intelligence (AI) strategy, demonstrating our adaptability to changing market conditions. Our AI strategy is focused on delivering a broad portfolio of leadership CPUs, GPUs, and adaptive computing solutions for AI inference and training, which reflects our commitment to innovation and operational flexibility. We expanded our embedded processor portfolio with scalable offerings for various applications, indicating our resource generation capabilities in response to customer needs. The demand for our data center GPUs was strong, driven by large hyperscaler customers, showcasing our ability to confront external pressures and maintain performance under competitive landscapes. Our strategic initiatives included strengthening our AI software capabilities through acquisitions, which enhances our organizational intelligence and prepares us for future disruptions. Despite facing a mixed demand environment, we achieved a net revenue of $22.7 billion, reflecting our resilience in navigating economic challenges. The decrease in client segment revenue was primarily due to lower processor sales, which highlights the need for ongoing adaptation and resource allocation to sustain operational continuity. Our gross margin improved to 46%, driven by higher embedded segment revenue, demonstrating our ability to maintain performance amidst varying market conditions. We believe our cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments will be sufficient to fund operations, including capital expenditures and purchase commitments, over the next 12 months, indicating our strategic foresight and financial resilience. Our working capital management involved cash collections from customers and payments for inventory purchases, which are critical for maintaining operational effectiveness. The increase in accounts receivable and inventories reflects our proactive measures to support the ramp of new products, showcasing our organizational capabilities in resource management. We continue to evaluate the impact of proposed legislative changes on our effective tax rate and cash flows, which is essential for our strategic planning and risk management. Our operational activities are designed to ensure we can respond effectively to environmental disruptions and transform challenges into opportunities for growth. The expansion of our AI engagements and the introduction of new products illustrate our commitment to resilience strategies that enhance our competitive advantage. Overall, our ability to absorb strain and preserve functioning despite adversity is evident in our strategic responses to market dynamics and our focus on innovation and collaboration across ecosystems.

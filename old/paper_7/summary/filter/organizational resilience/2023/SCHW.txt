Throughout 2023, the company navigated an uneven environment characterized by shifting views on the trajectory of the U.S. economy, persistent geopolitical unrest, and turmoil within the banking sector. The company's financial performance reflected the challenges of navigating a market environment shaped by the Federal Reserve's interest rate tightening policy and the follow-on effects stemming from the regional banking crisis beginning in March. The company maintained a diligent approach to balance sheet management, prioritizing flexibility and ensuring adequate capital and liquidity to support client activity. Schwab's operations remained consistent with its enterprise risk management framework, which incorporates a comprehensive approach to managing risks encountered in its business activities. The company has established a system of internal controls and risk management practices designed to keep operational risk and operational losses within its risk appetite. Schwab's operations are highly dependent on the integrity and resilience of critical business functions and technology systems, with measures in place to minimize business interruptions and ensure operational continuity during incidents. The company has maintained a backup and recovery infrastructure, including facilities for backup and communications, a geographically dispersed workforce, and routine testing of business continuity and disaster recovery plans. The integration of TD Ameritrade involved aligning risk management practices with Schwab's risk appetite, evaluating new or changed risks impacting the combined company, and taking action through various means. The company anticipates achieving annualized cost synergies from the integration while also streamlining operations to prepare for post-integration. The company’s risk management process includes risk identification and assessment, risk response, risk measurement and monitoring, and risk reporting and escalation, with a fundamental commitment to strong and effective risk management as core to Schwab's business strategy. The company has developed a comprehensive capital contingency plan to provide action plans for low probability/high impact capital events, ensuring the ability to absorb unanticipated losses or declines in asset values. Schwab's liquidity policies support the successful execution of business strategies while ensuring ongoing and sufficient liquidity to meet operational needs and satisfy applicable regulatory requirements. The company conducts regular liquidity stress testing to develop a view of liquidity risk exposures and to ensure its ability to maintain sufficient liquidity during market-related or company-specific liquidity stress events. Schwab's risk governance structure includes designated committees of the board and management risk committees that oversee the execution of the risk management process. The company’s proactive measures include maintaining liquidity and diversity of funding sources to meet obligations, with established limits and contingency funding plans to support liquidity levels during both normal and stressed conditions. The company’s approach to risk management emphasizes the importance of adaptability and operational flexibility in responding to environmental perturbations and unexpected situations.

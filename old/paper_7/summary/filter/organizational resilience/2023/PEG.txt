We are focused on investing to modernize our energy infrastructure, improve reliability and resilience, increase energy efficiency, and deliver cleaner energy to meet customer expectations and be well aligned with public policy objectives. Our business plan focuses on achieving growth by allocating capital primarily toward regulated investments in an effort to continue to improve the sustainability and predictability of our business. In furtherance of these goals, our investments in PSE&G have adjusted our business mix to reflect a higher percentage of earnings contribution by PSE&G. The passage of the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 established a production tax credit for existing nuclear facilities from 2024 through 2032, which is expected to provide downside price protection for our nuclear generation fleet as the tax credit value is directly linked to a nuclear facility's gross receipts. We seek approval of and execute on our utility capital investment program to modernize our infrastructure, improve the reliability and resilience of the service we provide to our customers, and align our sustainability and climate goals with New Jersey's energy policy.

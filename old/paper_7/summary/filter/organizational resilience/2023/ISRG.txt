Open surgery remains the predominant form of surgery; however, the large incisions required create trauma to patients, resulting in longer hospitalization and recovery times. Minimally invasive surgery (MIS) has reduced trauma by allowing selected surgeries to be performed through small ports. The da Vinci surgical systems enable surgeons to extend the benefits of MIS to many patients who would otherwise undergo more invasive surgery, using computational, robotic, and imaging technologies to overcome limitations of traditional methods. Our technology aims to provide surgeons with operational flexibility and a range of articulation of surgical instruments, filtering out inherent tremors. We focus on decreasing variability in surgery by offering actionable insights and digital solutions that improve outcomes, personalize learning, and optimize efficiency. We have commercialized several da Vinci surgical systems, with a focus on maintaining operational continuity and adapting to market demands. The success of these systems is dependent on positive experiences and improved clinical outcomes, which are critical for organizational resilience. We are actively engaged in mitigating supply chain disruptions, which could impact our operations. Supply chain constraints have shown improvement, yet inflationary pressures and labor shortages continue to pose risks. We are also highly dependent on our management and scientific staff, and the loss of critical team members could significantly harm our operations. Hospitals face challenges with staffing and financial pressures, which could affect their ability to provide patient care and impact our business. The COVID-19 pandemic has affected procedure volumes, but we have seen recovery as hospital resources have improved. Our business model generates revenue from the placement of da Vinci surgical systems and recurring revenue from instruments, accessories, and services. We utilize metrics such as the installed base and utilization of systems to evaluate performance and future revenue. Our strategy includes entering into flexible leasing arrangements to enhance customer adoption of robotic-assisted programs. We expect future placements of da Vinci surgical systems to be influenced by various factors, including supply chain risks, economic conditions, and hospital responses to the evolving healthcare environment. We continue to invest in research and development to support our product offerings and maintain competitive advantages. Our capital expenditures are increasing as we build capabilities to supply customers with differentiated products. We anticipate that our cash and investments will be sufficient to meet liquidity requirements, although macroeconomic challenges may reduce cash flow from operations. We are committed to adapting our strategies to ensure resilience in the face of environmental disruptions and to maintain our organizational health and effectiveness.

In the first quarter of fiscal 2023, we realigned our organizational structure to evaluate the results of our design IP business separately. Our chief operating decision maker, our chief executive officer, now regularly reviews disaggregated segment information, assesses performance against our key growth strategies, and allocates resources based on this new organizational structure. This strategic initiative reflects our adaptability in response to internal and external pressures, allowing us to maintain operational flexibility and enhance our organizational effectiveness. As a result, effective in the first quarter of fiscal 2023, we changed our reportable segments from two reportable segments to three reportable segments: (1) design automation, which includes our advanced silicon design, verification products and services, system integration products and services, digital, custom and FPGA IC design software, verification software and hardware products, manufacturing software products and other; (2) design IP, which includes our design IP products; and (3) software integrity, which includes solutions that test software code for security vulnerabilities and quality defects, as well as professional and managed services. This reconfiguration of reportable segments demonstrates our capacity to respond effectively to environmental disruptions and to reconstitute our operational focus in light of changing market dynamics. As such, prior period reportable segment results and related disclosures have been reclassified to reflect our current reportable segments, illustrating our commitment to maintaining organizational coherence and performance under pressure.

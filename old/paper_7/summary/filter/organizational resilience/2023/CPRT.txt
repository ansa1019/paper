We believe we contribute to disaster recovery and resilience in the communities we serve. For example, we mobilized our people, entered into emergency leases, and engaged with a multitude of service providers to timely retrieve, store, and remarket tens of thousands of flood-damaged vehicles in South Florida in the wake of Hurricane Ian in the fall of 2022. This response reflects our organizational capabilities in adapting to environmental disruptions and highlights our operational flexibility in managing unexpected situations. By enabling more affordable access to mobility around the world, we support economic development and well-being, which are essential for maintaining positive adjustment under challenging conditions. The role we play in responding to catastrophic weather events underscores our commitment to organizational resilience, as we work to reconstitute our operations and ensure continuity in service delivery during crises. Our actions demonstrate an understanding of the complexities involved in disaster recovery and the need for effective resource allocation and collaboration with external partners to enhance community resilience. Through these initiatives, we aim to preserve and improve functioning despite the presence of adversity, showcasing our strategic response mechanisms and the importance of preparedness in facing environmental perturbations.

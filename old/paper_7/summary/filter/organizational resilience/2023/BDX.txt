Becton, Dickinson and Company ("BD") is a global medical technology company engaged in the development, manufacture, and sale of a broad range of medical supplies, devices, laboratory equipment, and diagnostic products used by healthcare institutions, physicians, life science researchers, clinical laboratories, the pharmaceutical industry, and the general public. The company's organizational structure is based upon three principal business segments, BD Medical, BD Life Sciences, and BD Interventional. Driving sustainability initiatives within our organizational units supports enterprise-wide collaboration towards our sustainability strategy. We continue to invest in research and development, strategic tuck-in acquisitions, geographic expansion, and new product programs to drive further revenue and profit growth. Our ability to sustain our long-term growth will depend on a number of factors, including our ability to expand our core business, develop innovative new products, and continue to improve operating efficiency and organizational effectiveness. Our agreements with customers within certain organizational units, including medication management solutions, integrated diagnostic solutions, and biosciences, contain multiple performance obligations including both products and certain services. Determining whether products and services are considered distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately may require judgment. The transaction price for these agreements is allocated to each performance obligation based upon its relative standalone selling price. Standalone selling price is the amount at which we would sell a promised good or service separately to a customer. We generally estimate standalone selling prices using list prices and a consideration of typical discounts offered to customers. The use of alternative estimates could result in a different amount of revenue deferral. The company's focus on operational flexibility and organizational effectiveness is essential for maintaining performance under pressure and adapting to environmental disruptions. The emphasis on strategic initiatives and resource allocation reflects an understanding of the need for resilience in the face of external pressures and challenges. The ability to foresee and respond to disruptive events is critical for organizational survival and growth, highlighting the importance of resilience strategies and mechanisms in navigating complex situations. The commitment to innovation and continuous improvement in operational management supports the company's resilience and adaptability in a turbulent market environment.

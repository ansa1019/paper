In the fourth quarter of 2023, we announced one fedex, a consolidation plan to ultimately bring fedex express, fedex ground, fedex services, and other fedex operating companies into federal express corporation, becoming a single company operating a unified, fully integrated air-ground network under the respected fedex brand. The organizational redesign will be implemented in phases with full implementation expected in June 2024. One fedex will help facilitate our drive transformation program to improve long-term profitability. During the implementation process in fiscal 2024, each of our current reportable segments will continue to have discrete financial information that will be regularly reviewed when evaluating performance and making resource allocation decisions, and aligns with our management reporting structure and our internal financial reporting. In the first quarter of fiscal 2025, when the consolidation plan has been completed, we expect to begin reporting a resegmented structure that will align with an updated management reporting structure and how management will evaluate performance and make resource allocation decisions under one fedex. This approach reflects our commitment to maintaining operational flexibility and adapting to environmental perturbations while ensuring effective resource deployment. The consolidation plan is designed to enhance our organizational capabilities and resilience in the face of external pressures and disruptive events, thereby supporting our strategic initiatives and long-term objectives. By reconstituting our operational framework, we aim to improve our performance under pressure and ensure continuity of service, which is essential for sustaining organizational health and effectiveness. The phased implementation of the organizational redesign is intended to facilitate a smooth transition, allowing us to absorb strain and preserve functioning despite the challenges posed by the consolidation. This strategic response is aligned with our focus on enhancing organizational agility and resilience, ensuring that we can confront and benefit from sudden disruptive changes. The integration of our operating companies into a single entity is expected to strengthen our competitive advantage and enhance our capacity for innovation, ultimately contributing to our overall organizational success and sustainability in a turbulent market environment.

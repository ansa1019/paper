The results of our efforts to use technology and resilience initiatives, including artificial intelligence and machine learning, are aimed at driving efficiencies, better outcomes, and an enhanced patient experience, which are critical components of maintaining organizational health and operational flexibility. Current plans, anticipated actions, and future financial position and results of operations may differ from those expressed in any forward-looking statements made by or on behalf of HCA, indicating the necessity for organizations to adapt and respond effectively to environmental disruptions. This adaptability is essential for preserving or improving functioning despite the presence of adversity. The forward-looking statements reflect management's views only as of the date of this report, underscoring the importance of strategic foresight and preparedness in navigating unexpected situations. We undertake no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise, which emphasizes the dynamic nature of organizational resilience in the face of changing circumstances. The multifaceted nature of resilience draws attention to the need for organizations to foresee, confront, and benefit from sudden disruptive change to survive, grow, and flourish, highlighting the critical role of resilience strategies and mechanisms in ensuring operational continuity and performance maintenance.

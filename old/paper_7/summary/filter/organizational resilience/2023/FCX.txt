In September 2023, we published our annual climate report detailing our ongoing progress to advance our climate strategy focused on enhancing our resilience to climate risks. This strategy includes reducing our greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and contributing responsibly produced copper to the global economy. We have four 2030 GHG emissions reduction targets that collectively cover nearly 100% of our scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions. The emphasis on enhancing resilience to climate risks indicates our commitment to maintaining operational continuity and adapting to environmental disruptions. By addressing climate risks, we aim to ensure our organizational health and effectiveness in the face of external pressures and challenges. This proactive approach reflects our understanding of the need for strategic initiatives that bolster our organizational capabilities and resource allocation in response to potential adversities. The focus on reducing GHG emissions aligns with our broader objectives of sustainability and operational flexibility, which are essential for thriving in a turbulent market environment. Our climate strategy not only addresses immediate operational needs but also positions us to confront future challenges, thereby supporting our organizational resilience. By integrating resilience strategies into our core business practices, we are better equipped to manage risks and uncertainties, ensuring that we can sustain performance and adapt to changing conditions. This multifaceted approach to resilience encompasses the need for effective resource management, knowledge absorption, and the development of collaborative networks that enhance our ability to respond to disruptive events. Through these efforts, we aim to foster an organizational culture that prioritizes adaptability and continuous improvement, thereby reinforcing our competitive advantage in the global economy. The commitment to enhancing resilience is integral to our long-term strategy, as it enables us to navigate complex situations and maintain our trajectory of growth and success.

In 2023, we initiated several measures to pursue greater efficiency and to realign our business and strategic priorities, completing data center initiatives and employee layoffs, and substantially completing facilities consolidation initiatives. Our mission is to give people the power to build community and bring the world closer together, which reflects our commitment to organizational health and adaptability in response to external pressures. We recognize that our advertising revenue has been adversely affected by reduced marketer spending due to limitations on our ad targeting and measurement tools arising from changes to the regulatory environment and third-party mobile operating systems and browsers. In response to these environmental disruptions, we have implemented changes to our products and user data practices, demonstrating our operational flexibility and strategic response to maintain performance under pressure. We are continually working to evolve our advertising systems to improve the performance of our ad products, which includes developing privacy-enhancing technologies to deliver relevant ads while reducing the amount of personal information we process. Our investments in artificial intelligence are aimed at improving our delivery, targeting, and measurement capabilities, which are critical for sustaining competitive advantage in a turbulent market. We also continue to innovate our advertising tools to help marketers prepare campaigns and connect with consumers, indicating our focus on service innovation and strategic initiatives to adapt to changing market dynamics. The ongoing improvements to ad targeting and measurement are expected to drive improved results for advertisers, although we anticipate that some of these efforts will be long-term initiatives. We believe that our ability to foresee and confront sudden disruptive changes is essential for survival and growth, as evidenced by our engagement with regulators and the adaptation of our consent model for behavioral advertising. The macroeconomic environment, including inflation and rising interest rates, has pressured advertising budgets, which we believe will continue to impact our financial results. Our restructuring efforts and focus on operational continuity are designed to enhance our organizational resilience, allowing us to navigate complex situations and maintain our performance despite external disturbances. We are also investing in our metaverse efforts, which represent a long-term initiative that requires significant resources and strategic foresight. Our ability to support these efforts is dependent on generating sufficient profits from other areas of our business, reflecting the interconnectedness of our organizational capabilities and resource management strategies. As we continue to evaluate our liquidity and capital resources, we remain committed to ensuring we can finance our future capital requirements while adapting to the evolving business environment.

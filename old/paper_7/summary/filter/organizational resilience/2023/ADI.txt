During fiscal 2023, we invested to enhance our global resiliency, reflecting our commitment to maintaining operational continuity and adapting to changing market demands. The Q4 2023 plan, consisting of voluntary and involuntary reductions-in-force and other cost-savings initiatives, was implemented to adjust our cost structure and business activities to better align with weaker market demand and continued economic uncertainty in our end markets. We believe that a continued commitment to research and development is essential to maintain product leadership with our existing products as well as to provide innovative new product offerings, which are critical to our future growth. Our liquidity management involves reviewing available funds held by our foreign subsidiaries and the cost-effectiveness of accessing those funds, ensuring that we can respond effectively to environmental disruptions. We expect that our existing sources of liquidity and cash generated from future operations will be sufficient to fund operations, capital expenditures, and research and development efforts in the immediate future. The increase in cash provided by operating activities during fiscal 2023 was primarily a result of higher net income adjusted for noncash items, indicating our ability to maintain performance under pressure. Our inventory levels are impacted by our need to support forecasted sales demand and variations between those forecasts and actual demand, demonstrating our operational flexibility in managing resources. The establishment of a commercial paper program allows us to issue short-term, unsecured commercial paper notes to fund general corporate purposes, including working capital and acquisitions, thereby enhancing our financial resilience. We maintain a diversified investment strategy to minimize credit risk, which is vital for sustaining organizational health. The assessment of goodwill for impairment involves evaluating several factors, including current forecasts and changes in market conditions, which reflects our strategic foresight in managing risks. Our ongoing evaluation of long-lived assets for impairment requires estimates of future operating results, emphasizing the importance of adaptability in our organizational processes. We also recognize that changes in tax law and market conditions could impact our financial position, necessitating proactive measures to mitigate risks. The management of uncertain tax positions involves assessing the likelihood of sustaining tax positions, which is integral to our overall risk management strategy. The ability to foresee and confront sudden disruptive changes is essential for our organizational survival and success, as we strive to maintain a trajectory of positive adjustment under challenging conditions. Our strategic initiatives focus on enhancing operational management and ensuring that we can effectively respond to external pressures and environmental perturbations. The collaborative networks we engage in are crucial for knowledge creation and resource generation, supporting our resilience strategies in a volatile business environment.

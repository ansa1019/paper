Selling, general and administrative expenses increased 13%, primarily driven by volume-related expenses in Cigna Healthcare due to business growth, as well as increased investments to support the onboarding of new clients and continued advancement of our digital capabilities and care solutions in Evernorth Health Services. Increased expenses were also driven by costs reported in 2023 for an organizational efficiency plan and litigation settlements. During the fourth quarter of 2023, the company approved a strategic realignment to drive greater operating effectiveness and efficiency. This plan positions us to be more efficient and focused to deliver differentiated value and services to our clients and customers. The company recognized a charge in selling, general and administrative expenses of $252 million, pre-tax ($193 million, after-tax). We expect substantially all of the accrued liability to be paid by the end of 2024. We expect to realize annualized after-tax savings of approximately $280 million, with a significant portion of the savings expected to be recognized in 2024. The organizational efficiency plan reflects the company's ability to adapt and respond to internal and external pressures while maintaining operational continuity and effectiveness. This strategic initiative is aimed at enhancing organizational resilience by reconfiguring resources and processes to better meet client needs and navigate environmental disruptions. The focus on operational effectiveness and efficiency indicates a commitment to sustaining performance under challenging conditions and ensuring the organization can flourish despite adversity.

Our results provided another proof point of the strength and resilience of our value creation model, which supported another year of strong free cash flow and adjusted net earnings per diluted share growth, excluding the 53rd week in fiscal year 2023 (the "extra week"). This was the result of continued momentum across several margin expansion initiatives, strong brand performance, and strong growth in alternative profit businesses. Our ability to effectively manage product cost through strong sourcing practices, lower supply chain costs, and a lower year-over-year lifo charge contributed to our operational flexibility. During the year, we continued to invest in wages and the associate experience as a way to support the delivery of a full, fresh, and friendly customer experience. In 2023, we increased associate wages resulting in an average hourly rate of nearly $19, and a rate of nearly $25 with comprehensive benefits factored in, which is a 33% increase in rate in the last five years. This investment in human capital reflects our commitment to organizational health and adaptability, ensuring that we maintain performance under pressure and respond effectively to external pressures. The focus on associate experience and wage increases demonstrates our strategic initiatives aimed at enhancing organizational resilience and operational continuity, enabling us to confront challenges and sustain growth in a turbulent market.

Our operating results were strong in 2023, and we believe we are well positioned to organically grow revenues over the long-term given the cumulative growth in market rents over the last several years. While uncertainties remain in the economic and geopolitical environment, our results are representative of the prospects we see for our business. We generated net proceeds and realized net gains principally from the contribution of properties to our unconsolidated co-investment ventures and the sale of a U.S. portfolio of assets to a third-party. Our financing activities included amending and restating our global senior credit facility, increasing its borrowing capacity and extending the initial maturity date. We also entered into term loans and issued senior notes, which reflect our strategic response to maintain operational flexibility and ensure liquidity. Our total available liquidity was $6.0 billion, which includes borrowing capacity on our credit facilities and unrestricted cash balances. 

We evaluate our business operations based on the net operating income of our two operating segments: real estate and strategic capital. Our real estate segment is impacted by our development, acquisition, and disposition activities, which are essential for maintaining performance under pressure. The change in net operating income was influenced by acquisition activity and positive rental rate growth. We experienced significant rent change during both periods, which continues to be a key driver in increasing rental income. Our development portfolio is expected to be completed before July 2026, and we plan to continue allocating capital to renovate and improve our operating portfolio, including sustainable building features.

We manage our business and review our operating fundamentals on an owned and managed basis, which allows us to understand performance more broadly. Our same store metrics are presented on both a net effective and cash basis, and we evaluate the performance of the operating properties we own and manage using a "same store" analysis to ensure consistency. This analysis is crucial for assessing our ability to adapt to changing market conditions and maintain operational continuity.

Our ability to generate cash from operating activities and distributions from our co-investment ventures is considered adequate to meet our anticipated future development, acquisition, and operating requirements. We expect our primary cash needs to consist of completing the development and leasing of properties, acquiring other real estate investments, and investing in energy assets. Our financing activities are driven by proceeds from credit facilities and the issuance of debt, which support our cash needs for development and acquisition activities.

We are engaged in various stages of negotiations for the acquisition or disposition of properties, reflecting our proactive measures to respond to market dynamics. Our credit ratings allow us to borrow at advantageous interest rates, and we maintain compliance with our financial debt covenants. The management of our co-investment ventures focuses on maintaining sufficient liquidity and refinancing maturing debt, which is vital for our organizational resilience in the face of external pressures and economic uncertainties.

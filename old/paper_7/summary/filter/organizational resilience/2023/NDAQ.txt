Our organizational structure aligns our businesses with the foundational shifts that are driving the evolution of the global financial system. Following the acquisition of Adenza, we further refined the divisional structure into capital access platforms, financial technology, and market services reportable segments. We perform our goodwill impairment test at the reporting unit level. For 2023, we performed the goodwill impairment test under our previous organizational structure which included three reporting units: market platforms, capital access platforms, and anti-financial crime segments and under our current organization structure, which includes the following three reporting units: capital access platforms, financial technology, and market services segments. This restructuring reflects our strategic initiatives to enhance operational flexibility and resource allocation in response to evolving market demands and external pressures. The management of these businesses as three separate segments allows for a more focused approach to performance assessment and resource deployment, which is essential for maintaining organizational health and resilience in a turbulent business environment. The adjustments made in our organizational structure are indicative of our commitment to adapt to complex situations and ensure continuity of operations under varying conditions. By aligning our resources and capabilities with the changing landscape, we aim to preserve and improve our functioning despite the presence of adversity. The emphasis on refining our divisional structure demonstrates our proactive measures to confront challenges and leverage opportunities for growth and innovation. This strategic response is crucial for sustaining performance under pressure and enhancing our competitive advantage in the financial sector. The ability to reconfigure our organizational practices and maintain coherence across segments is vital for navigating disruptions and ensuring long-term survival. Our focus on inter-organizational collaboration and knowledge management further supports our resilience strategies, enabling us to absorb strain and respond effectively to environmental disruptions. The integration of these elements into our operational framework underscores our recognition of the multifaceted nature of organizational resilience and our commitment to fostering an agile and adaptive organizational culture. As we continue to evolve, our trajectory model of organizational resilience will guide our responses to disruptive events and inform our future planning, ensuring that we remain well-positioned to thrive in an increasingly complex and volatile market landscape.

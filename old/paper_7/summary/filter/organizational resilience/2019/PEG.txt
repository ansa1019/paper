PSEG's focus is on enhancing reliability and resiliency of its transmission and distribution (T&D) system, meeting customer expectations and supporting public policy objectives by investing capital in T&D infrastructure and clean energy programs. For the five-year period ending December 31, 2024, PSEG expects to invest between $11.5 billion to $15 billion, resulting in an expected compound annual rate base growth of 6.5% to 8%. This includes investments in programs aimed at improving the resiliency of electric and gas distribution systems. PSEG commenced its BPU-approved Gas System Modernization Program II, an expanded five-year program to invest $1.9 billion to replace approximately 875 miles of cast iron and unprotected steel mains, which is part of its strategy to enhance operational flexibility and resilience. The Energy Strong II program, approved in 2019, is designed to harden and modernize the electric and gas distribution systems, reflecting a commitment to operational continuity and resilience against environmental perturbations. PSEG's investments in infrastructure modernization are aimed at addressing aging systems, leveraging technology to improve operations, and enhancing grid reliability and security. The company emphasizes operational performance while developing opportunities in both competitive and regulated businesses, which contributes to its organizational strength and adaptability in a rapidly evolving market. PSEG's financial strength is predicated on a solid balance sheet and positive operating cash flow, which supports its ability to fund planned capital requirements and manage risks associated with regulatory changes and fluctuating commodity prices. The company continually assesses strategic options to maximize long-term stockholder value, including investments in capital improvements that enhance system resiliency and operational management. PSEG's approach to risk management includes engaging with stakeholders on significant regulatory and legislative developments, advocating for policies that promote fair and efficient electricity markets, and ensuring compliance with environmental regulations. The company's strategic initiatives reflect a multifaceted approach to organizational resilience, focusing on maintaining strong operational and financial performance while responding to external pressures and uncertainties in the energy market. PSEG's future success will depend on its ability to effectively manage energy obligations, control costs, and execute its utility capital investment program, which includes enhancing the resiliency of its infrastructure and maintaining reliability of service. The execution of strategic plans may not always yield expected benefits, highlighting the importance of organizational foresight and adaptability in navigating complex situations and potential disruptions.

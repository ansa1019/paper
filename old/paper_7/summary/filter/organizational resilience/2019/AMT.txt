During the fourth quarter of 2019, we reviewed and changed our reportable segments to better align our reporting with management's current approach of allocating costs and resources, managing growth and profitability, and assessing the operating performance of our business segments. We believe this change provides more visibility into these operating segments, which is essential for maintaining operational flexibility and adapting to external pressures. Our primary business is the leasing of space on communications sites, which accounted for 98% of our total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2019, indicating a strong reliance on recurring revenue that we expect to continue receiving in future periods. The majority of our tenant leases have initial non-cancellable terms of five to ten years with multiple renewal terms, which supports our operational continuity and resilience against disruptions. 

We have experienced challenges such as carrier consolidation events in India, which increased revenue lost from cancellations or non-renewals, impacting our gross margin and operating profit. However, we anticipate that our churn rate will move closer to historical levels over time, which will result in reduced impacts on our property revenue. Our diversified communications site portfolio allows us to adapt to varying tenant lease rates and demands, which is crucial for maintaining performance under pressure. 

We continue to evaluate opportunities for acquisitions and new site development to enhance our operational capabilities and resource generation. Our strategy includes adding new tenants and equipment for existing tenants, which is influenced by the growth of wireless services and the financial performance of our tenants. This strategic response to market demands is essential for sustaining our competitive advantage and ensuring organizational resilience. 

We have established operations in many emerging markets, allowing us to participate in the deployment of initial voice and data networks. The ongoing transition from 2G to 4G technology in India has resulted in a more conducive industry structure for sustained growth and profitability. Our relationships with large multinational carriers further position us to benefit from various wireless technology deployments over the long term. 

Our ability to generate cash flow from operating activities is critical for funding capital expenditures and satisfying distribution requirements. We believe that maintaining our recurring revenue and converting it into operating profit by minimizing operating costs is vital for our organizational health. The financial flexibility we have achieved through significant financing transactions enhances our capacity to confront unexpected situations and manage resource constraints effectively. 

In summary, our operational practices, strategic initiatives, and focus on inter-organizational collaboration are designed to enhance our resilience and adaptability in a rapidly changing business environment. We continue to monitor external disturbances and adjust our strategies accordingly to ensure long-term sustainability and organizational success.

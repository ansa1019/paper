The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the other sections of this annual report on Form 10-K, including the consolidated financial statements and related notes contained in Item 8, and the discussion of risk factors that may affect future results in Item 1A. Altria's reportable segments are smokeable products, smokeless products, and wine. The financial services and the innovative tobacco products businesses are included in an all other category due to the continued reduction of the lease portfolio of PMCC and the relative financial contribution of Altria's innovative tobacco products businesses to Altria's consolidated results. The changes in Altria's net earnings (losses) and diluted EPS attributable to Altria for the year ended December 31, 2019, from the year ended December 31, 2018, were due primarily to various adjustments and costs associated with asset impairment, exit, implementation, and acquisition-related activities, which reflect the company's ability to adapt to changing conditions. The increase of $421 million in operations was due primarily to lower spending as a result of Altria's decision in 2018 to refocus its innovative product efforts, indicating a strategic response to environmental pressures. Altria forecasts that its 2020 full-year adjusted diluted EPS growth rate is expected to be in the range of 4% to 7% over its 2019 full-year adjusted diluted EPS base, which reflects increased investments related to PM USA's commercialization efforts for IQOS and Helix's plans to manufacture and expand U.S. distribution of on!. This forecasted growth rate excludes estimated per share charges for tax expense, representing a partial reversal of the tax basis benefit recorded in 2017 attributable to Altria's investment in ABI. The operational adjustments and strategic initiatives undertaken by Altria demonstrate its efforts to maintain organizational health and performance under varying conditions, highlighting the importance of resilience strategies in navigating complex market dynamics. The discussion of events affecting the comparability of statement of earnings (losses) amounts in the consolidated operating results section further illustrates the company's focus on risk assessment and management in the face of external disturbances. Altria's operational continuity and flexibility in resource allocation are critical as it confronts challenges in the evolving business environment. The company's ability to reconfigure its operational strategies and engage in inter-organizational collaboration is essential for sustaining performance and achieving major objectives amidst adversity. The financial results and operational strategies presented indicate a multifaceted approach to resilience, emphasizing the need for adaptability and foresight in response to disruptive changes and pressures within the industry.

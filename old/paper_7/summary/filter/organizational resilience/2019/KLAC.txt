Subsequent to the Orbotech acquisition, we changed our organizational structure resulting in four reportable segments: semiconductor process control, specialty semiconductor process, PCB, display and component inspection, and other. We assess goodwill for impairment annually as well as whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Long-lived purchased intangible assets are tested for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable. We performed our annual qualitative assessment of the goodwill by reporting unit during the third quarter of the fiscal year ended June 30, 2019 and concluded that there was no impairment. In addition, as a result of the Orbotech acquisition, we updated our organizational structure and performed a qualitative assessment of the goodwill for our reporting units, which were impacted by the organizational change, and concluded that there were no impairment indicators affecting the valuation of goodwill subsequent to our annual impairment test. The changes in our organizational structure reflect our adaptability and response to the evolving business environment, which is essential for maintaining operational continuity and organizational resilience. The next annual evaluation of the goodwill by reporting unit will be performed in the third quarter of the fiscal year ending June 30, 2020.

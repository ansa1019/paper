In 2020, we expect our recently implemented organizational realignment will benefit our expenses, contributing to our operational flexibility and overall organizational effectiveness. Selling, general, and administrative expenses decreased primarily due to the absence of severance-related, organizational realignment, and financial repositioning costs incurred in 2017, reflecting our capacity to absorb strain and maintain performance under challenging conditions. This decrease is partially offset by a charitable contribution of preferred stock to the Williams Companies Foundation, Inc. and fees associated with the WPZ merger, indicating our strategic response to external pressures while managing resource allocation effectively. Additionally, we anticipate increases in our operating results from Transco's recent expansion projects placed in-service and general rate settlement, which demonstrates our ability to adapt and respond to environmental disruptions. The northeast results are expected to increase from higher gathering and processing volumes, showcasing our organizational capabilities in enhancing performance amidst varying operational conditions. We expect decreases in the west primarily due to lower deferred revenue amortization in the Barnett Shale and lower revenues from our Haynesville operations; however, these are partially offset by increased results from our DJ Basin and Eagle Ford operations, illustrating our resilience in navigating complex situations and maintaining operational continuity. Distributions from equity-method investees are generally required to distribute available cash to their members on a quarterly basis, which reflects our commitment to stakeholder engagement and resource management. In each case, available cash is reduced, in part, by reserves appropriate for operating their respective businesses, highlighting our strategic initiatives to ensure financial stability and operational integrity. Overall, our organizational practices and strategic management efforts are aligned with maintaining positive adjustment under challenging conditions, thereby reinforcing our resilience and adaptability in a turbulent market environment.

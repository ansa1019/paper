In 2019, our sales and revenues were $53.800 billion, a 2 percent decrease from 2018, primarily due to lower sales volume driven by changes in dealer inventories, partially offset by higher end-user demand. The decline in sales volume was primarily due to changes in dealer inventories, as dealers increased inventories more during 2018 than in 2019. We expect dealer inventories to decline about $1.0 to $1.5 billion during 2020. The decrease in sales volume was primarily due to changes in dealer inventories, which reflects the adaptability and responsiveness of our operations to market conditions. The unfavorable currency impacts were mostly offset by favorable price realization, demonstrating our operational flexibility in managing external pressures. 

Operating profit was about flat as favorable price realization and lower selling, general and administrative expenses were offset by higher manufacturing costs and lower sales volume. The operating profit margin was 15.4 percent in 2019, compared with 15.2 percent in 2018, indicating our ability to maintain performance under pressure. Our management's strategic initiatives included investments aligned with the company's growth objectives, reflecting our commitment to organizational health and resilience. 

The enterprise operating cash flow for 2019 was about $6.9 billion, compared with about $6.6 billion in 2018, highlighting our capacity for resource generation in a turbulent market environment. We experienced favorable liquidity conditions globally in both our machinery, energy & transportation and financial products operations, which is essential for sustaining operational continuity and resilience strategies. 

We have also undertaken restructuring actions to improve our operational efficiency, which are expected to result in an incremental benefit to operating costs. The restructuring costs incurred were primarily related to actions across the company, reflecting our proactive measures to adapt to changing market dynamics. 

Our financial products segment revenues were $3.434 billion, an increase of $155 million, primarily due to higher average financing rates and an increase in earned premiums from insurance services across all regions. This segment's profit was $832 million in 2019, compared with $505 million in 2018, indicating a positive adjustment in response to market conditions. 

We have maintained a strong cash and liquidity position, with consolidated cash at $8.28 billion at year-end 2019, which supports our strategic planning and future orientation. Our focus on maintaining a strong financial position allows us to navigate uncertainties and environmental disruptions effectively. 

Overall, our performance reflects the multifaceted nature of organizational resilience, characterized by our ability to foresee, confront, and benefit from sudden disruptive changes, ensuring our survival and growth in a competitive landscape.

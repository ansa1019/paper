While not immune to the impact of a weak industrial environment as was experienced in the latter half of 2019, our non-fastener business did demonstrate greater relative resilience when compared to our fastener business and to the distribution industry in general. Non-fastener growth slowed, but remained above the growth of the fastener business. The strong relative performance of the non-fastener business when compared to the fastener business and to the distribution industry in general was also evident during the strong 2018 and 2017 periods. We believe this is due to both the growth of our vending business and our lower penetration of the non-fastener marketplace relative to our penetration of the fastener marketplace.

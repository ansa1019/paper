For 2019, while 3M experienced sales growth in its consumer and health care segments, this was more than offset by declines in 3M's safety and industrial and transportation and electronics segments. These two businesses were impacted by softness in certain end markets (China, automotive and electronics) and channel inventory adjustments, particularly within Asia Pacific and the United States. Earnings were also impacted by second quarter restructuring actions taken to address lower sales volumes, as well as inventory reductions to drive improved cash flow. Further restructuring actions were taken in the fourth quarter to realign 3M's organizational structure and operating model to improve growth and operational efficiency. During the second quarter of 2019, in light of slower than expected 2019 sales, management approved and committed to undertake certain restructuring actions. The company recorded a fourth quarter 2019 pre-tax charge of $282 million, of which $148 million was recorded in the second quarter, with $35 million associated with a voluntary retirement incentive program that impacted second quarter other expense (income), and an additional $134 million recorded in the fourth quarter. The restructuring actions reflect an organizational response to external pressures and a strategic initiative to enhance operational flexibility and efficiency in the face of declining sales. These measures are indicative of the company's approach to maintain performance and adapt to challenging market conditions, demonstrating a commitment to organizational resilience through restructuring and realignment of resources.

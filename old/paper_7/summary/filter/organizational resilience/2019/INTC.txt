During the third quarter of 2018, we made an organizational change to combine our AI investments in edge computing with IoTG; accordingly, approximately $480 million of goodwill was reallocated from "all other" to the IoTG operating segment. This reallocation reflects our strategic response to internal knowledge and resource deployment aimed at enhancing operational flexibility and adaptability in the face of environmental disruptions. The decision to consolidate these investments demonstrates our commitment to maintaining organizational health and performance under challenging conditions. By reconfiguring our resources, we aim to confront external pressures and improve our resilience against disruptive events. This change is part of our broader strategy to ensure business continuity and operational management, allowing us to absorb strain and preserve functioning despite the presence of adversity. The integration of AI and IoT technologies is expected to enhance our capabilities and foster innovation, thereby contributing to our organizational strength and competitive advantage in a turbulent market. This proactive measure illustrates our focus on strategic initiatives that promote organizational survival and success, ensuring that we are well-positioned to respond effectively to future challenges.

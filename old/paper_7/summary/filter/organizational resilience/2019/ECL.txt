During the third quarter of 2018, we formally commenced a restructuring plan to leverage technology and system investments and organizational changes. In 2019, we raised our goals for the plan to further simplify and automate processes and tasks, reduce complexity and management layers, consolidate facilities, and focus on key long-term growth areas by further leveraging technology and structural improvements. Our global footprint and broad business portfolio within the global energy segment, as well as our strong execution capabilities, are expected to provide the required resilience to perform well in the current market. We expect that the restructuring activities will be completed by the end of 2020, with total anticipated costs of $260 million ($200 million after tax), or an estimated $0.68 per diluted share, over this period of time. Costs are expected to be primarily cash expenditures for severance costs and some facility closure costs relating to team reorganizations. Actual costs may vary from these estimates depending on actions taken. As such, we continue to remain confident in the long-term growth prospects of the segment. The restructuring plan is designed to enhance organizational flexibility and adaptability in response to external pressures and market conditions, thereby supporting our organizational health and performance maintenance. This approach reflects our commitment to operational continuity and the ability to absorb strain while preserving functioning despite the presence of adversity.

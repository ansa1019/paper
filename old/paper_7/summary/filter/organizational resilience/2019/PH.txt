The business realignment charges consist primarily of severance and plant closure costs related to actions taken under the company's simplification initiative aimed at reducing organizational and process complexity, which is being implemented by its operating units throughout the world. The company anticipates that cost savings realized from the workforce reduction measures taken during 2019 will increase 2020 operating income by approximately two percent in both the diversified industrial North American and diversified industrial international operations. In 2020, the company expects to continue to take actions necessary to structure appropriately the operations of the diversified industrial segment. These actions are expected to result in approximately $20 million in charges in 2020. The simplification initiative reflects the company's strategic response to internal and external pressures, aiming to enhance operational flexibility and maintain performance under challenging conditions. By addressing organizational complexity, the company seeks to improve its resilience and adaptability in a turbulent business environment, thereby ensuring continuity and effectiveness in its operations. The anticipated cost savings and restructuring efforts are indicative of the company's proactive measures to confront and mitigate risks associated with disruptive changes, ultimately supporting its organizational health and long-term sustainability.

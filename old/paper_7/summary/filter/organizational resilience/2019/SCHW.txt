The company has a comprehensive risk management program to identify and manage risks and their associated potential for financial and reputational impact. Despite efforts to identify areas of risk and implement risk management policies and procedures, there can be no assurance that the company will not suffer unexpected losses due to these risks. The risk management process includes risk identification and assessment, risk measurement, risk monitoring and reporting, and risk mitigation controls. Schwab's operations are highly dependent on the integrity and resilience of critical business functions and technology systems. To minimize business interruptions and ensure the capacity to continue operations during an incident, Schwab maintains a backup and recovery infrastructure, a geographically dispersed workforce, and routine testing of business continuity and disaster recovery plans. The company has established policies and procedures to identify and manage operational risk, using control testing programs and internal audit reviews to evaluate the effectiveness of these internal controls. Schwab's commitment to balancing long-term profitability with reinvesting for growth reflects its strategic response to external pressures and operational flexibility. The company seeks to maintain client confidence in its balance sheet and the safety of client assets by ensuring ongoing and sufficient liquidity to meet operational needs and satisfy applicable regulatory requirements under both normal and stressed conditions. Schwab conducts regular liquidity stress testing to develop a consolidated view of liquidity risk exposures and to ensure its ability to maintain sufficient liquidity during market-related or company-specific liquidity stress events. The capital management strategy includes preparations for closing acquisitions, ensuring capital levels are in line with strategy and regulatory requirements, and conducting regular capital stress testing to assess potential financial impacts of adverse macroeconomic events. The company has a comprehensive capital contingency plan to provide action plans for low probability/high impact capital events. The results of stress testing indicate scenarios that could stress the company's capital, including inflows of balance sheet cash during low interest rates and outflows of cash when other sources of financing are unavailable. Schwab's risk governance framework incorporates its purpose, vision, and values, enabling a comprehensive approach to managing risks encountered in business activities. The global risk committee oversees risk management, identifying emerging risks and assessing risk management practices. Schwab's operational risk management includes policies to manage risks arising from inadequacies or failures related to people, processes, and systems. The company has established a policy to ensure that obligations to clients are discharged faithfully and in compliance with applicable legal and regulatory requirements. Schwab's approach to risk management is designed to support organizational resilience, enabling the company to adapt to unexpected situations and maintain operational continuity.

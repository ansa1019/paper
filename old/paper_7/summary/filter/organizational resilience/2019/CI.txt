During the fourth quarter of 2019, the company committed to a plan to increase our organizational alignment and operational efficiency and reduce costs. As a result, we recognized a charge in selling, general and administrative expenses of $207 million, pre-tax ($162 million, after-tax). We expect to realize annualized after-tax savings of approximately $180 million, with a substantial portion of the savings expected to be realized in 2020. This initiative reflects a strategic response to enhance organizational efficiency, which is a critical aspect of maintaining operational flexibility and resilience under challenging conditions. The focus on organizational alignment and operational efficiency indicates a proactive measure to address external pressures and optimize resource allocation, thereby contributing to the company's ability to adapt and thrive amidst environmental disruptions. The anticipated savings and improved alignment are expected to bolster the company's performance and support its long-term objectives, demonstrating a commitment to resilience strategies that facilitate recovery and transformation in response to adverse conditions.

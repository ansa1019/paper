This annual report on Form 10-K includes forward-looking statements reflecting management's current expectations and the inherent uncertainties associated with them. The global economic climate amplifies many risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ significantly from management's expectations. We seek to increase unit sales across our stores through improved product selection and customer experience, which includes lowering prices and improving availability. Our financial focus is on long-term, sustainable growth in free cash flows, driven primarily by increasing operating income and efficiently managing working capital. We aim to reduce variable costs per unit and leverage fixed costs by improving process efficiencies and maintaining a lean culture. Our technology and content investments support a variety of product and service offerings, enhancing customer experience and process efficiencies. We believe that advances in technology will continue to improve the consumer experience and increase its ubiquity in people's lives. We seek to invest efficiently in technology and content, including AWS, to enhance customer experience and improve operational management. Our operational flexibility is reflected in our ability to turn inventory quickly and manage cash flows effectively. We expect variability in inventory turnover and accounts payable days, influenced by factors such as product mix and seasonal changes. We continually evaluate opportunities to strengthen our financial position through various strategic initiatives, including potential acquisitions and investments in complementary businesses. The preparation of financial statements requires estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts, and actual results may differ significantly from these estimates under different conditions. We regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes from tax controversies, which could materially affect our operating results. Our liquidity is affected by cash flows generated from operations and our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities balances. We believe that cash flows generated from operations will be sufficient to meet our anticipated operating cash needs. Our model allows us to manage working capital effectively, and we expect to continue investing in technology and content to support business growth. We recognize the importance of maintaining operational continuity and adapting to environmental disruptions to ensure organizational resilience. Our commitment to improving customer experience and operational efficiency is fundamental to our future success. We seek to mitigate costs over time through higher sales volumes and optimized fulfillment networks. The increase in operating income is primarily due to increased customer usage and cost structure productivity, reflecting our adaptability to changing market conditions. We also anticipate that our investments in technology and content will support our long-term strategic objectives and enhance our organizational capabilities.

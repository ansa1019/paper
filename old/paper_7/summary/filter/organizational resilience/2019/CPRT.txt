We believe we contribute to disaster recovery and resilience in the communities we serve. For example, we mobilized our people, entered into emergency leases, and engaged with a multitude of service providers to timely retrieve, store, and remarket tens of thousands of flood-damaged vehicles in the Houston, Texas metropolitan area in the wake of Hurricane Harvey in the summer of 2017. Additionally, we contribute to economic development and well-being by enabling more affordable access to mobility around the world. Many of the automobiles sold through our auction platform are purchased for use in developing countries where affordable transportation is a critical enabler of education, health care, and well-being more generally. The special role we play in responding to catastrophic weather events highlights our organizational capabilities in crisis management and operational flexibility, which are essential for maintaining performance under pressure and adapting to unexpected situations. Our actions reflect a commitment to supporting community resilience and enhancing organizational effectiveness through strategic initiatives that address environmental disruptions and operational continuity.

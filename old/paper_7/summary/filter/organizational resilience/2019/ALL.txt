We are continuing to implement new technology and process improvements that provide continued loss cost accuracy, efficient processing, and enhanced customer experiences that are simple, fast, and produce high degrees of satisfaction. We use digital operating centers to handle auto physical damage claims countrywide utilizing our virtual estimation capabilities, which includes estimating damage with photos and video through the use of quickfoto claim® and virtual assist®. We are also leveraging virtual capabilities to handle property claims by estimating damage through video with virtual assist and aerial imagery using satellites, airplanes, and drones. These organizational and process changes impact frequency and severity statistics as changes in claim opening and closing practices and shifts in timing, if any, can impact comparisons to prior periods. Prior year reserve reestimates are developed based on factors that are calculated quarterly and periodically throughout the year for data elements such as claims reported and settled, paid losses, and paid losses combined with case reserves. We use significant judgment and these data elements to make revisions to loss development factors that predict how losses are likely to develop from the end of a reporting period until all claims have been paid. When actual development of these data elements is different than the historical development pattern used in a prior period reserve estimate, reserves are revised as actuarial studies validate new trends based on the indications of updated development factor calculations. Ongoing claims organizational and process changes that are occurring are considered within our estimation process.

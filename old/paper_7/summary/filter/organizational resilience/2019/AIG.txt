This annual report on Form 10-K and other publicly available documents may include projections, goals, assumptions, and statements that may constitute "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These projections, goals, assumptions, and statements may relate to future actions, prospective services or products, future performance or results of current and anticipated services or products, sales efforts, expenses, the outcome of contingencies such as legal proceedings, anticipated organizational, business or regulatory changes, anticipated sales, monetization and/or acquisitions of businesses or assets, or successful integration of acquired businesses, management succession and retention plans, exposure to risk, trends in operations and financial results. In keeping with our broad and ongoing efforts to transform for long-term competitiveness, general operating and other expenses for 2019, 2018, and 2017 included approximately $218 million, $395 million, and $413 million, respectively, of pre-tax restructuring and other costs which were primarily comprised of employee severance charges and other exit costs related to organizational simplification, operational efficiency, and business rationalization. General operating and other expenses declined in 2019 compared to 2018 primarily due to lower employee-related expenses and professional fee reductions pertaining to expense reduction initiatives. The declines were partially offset by an increase in expenses caused by the acquisitions of Validus and Glatfelter in the third and fourth quarters of 2018, respectively. General operating and other expenses increased in 2018 compared to 2017 due to the acquisition of Validus, business growth, and continued investments in business platforms. These efforts reflect the organization's ability to absorb strain and preserve or improve functioning despite the presence of adversity, demonstrating a commitment to maintaining operational flexibility and adapting to environmental perturbations. The ongoing transformation initiatives indicate a focus on resilience strategies that enhance organizational capabilities and ensure performance maintenance under challenging conditions. The integration of acquired businesses and management succession plans further exemplify the organization's approach to navigating disruptive events and fostering a culture of adaptability and continuous improvement.

item 7.  management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of sysco's financial condition, results of operations and liquidity and capital resources for the fiscal years ended july 1, 2023 and july 2, 2022 should be read as a supplement to our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes contained in item 8 of this report, and in conjunction with the "forward-looking statements" section set forth in part ii and the "risk factors" section set forth in item 1a of part i. all discussion of changes in our results of operations from fiscal 2022 to fiscal 2021 has been omitted from this form 10-k, but may be found in item 7, "management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations" of our form 10-k for the year ended july 2, 2022, filed with the securities and exchange commission on august 26, 2022.
overview sysco distributes food and related products to restaurants, healthcare and educational facilities, lodging establishments and other foodservice customers. our primary operations are in north america and europe. under the accounting provisions related to disclosures about segments of an enterprise, we have combined certain operations into three reportable segments. "other" financial information is attributable to our other operations that do not meet the quantitative disclosure thresholds.
•u.s. foodservice operations - primarily includes (a) our u.s. broadline operations, which distribute a full line of food products, including custom-cut meat, seafood, produce, specialty italian, specialty imports and a wide variety of non-food products and (b) our u.s. specialty operations, which include our freshpoint fresh produce distribution business, our specialty meats and seafood group specialty protein operations, our growing italian specialty platform anchored by greco & sons, our asian specialty distribution company and a number of other small specialty businesses that are not material to the operations of sysco;
•international foodservice operations - includes operations outside of the united states (u.s.), which distribute a full line of food products and a wide variety of non-food products. the americas primarily consists of operations in canada, bahamas, mexico, costa rica and panama, as well as our export operations that distribute to international customers. our european operations primarily consist of operations in the united kingdom (u.k.), france, ireland and sweden;
•sygma - our u.s. customized distribution operations serving quick-service chain restaurant customer locations; and
we estimate that we serve about 17% of an approximately $350 billion annual foodservice market in the u.s. based on industry data obtained from technomic, inc. (technomic) as of the end of calendar year 2022. technomic projects the market size to increase to approximately $370 billion by the end of calendar year 2023. from time to time, technomic may revise the methodology used to calculate the size of the foodservice market and, as a result, our percentage can change not only from our sales results, but also from such revisions. we also serve certain international geographies that vary in size and amount of market share.
according to industry sources, the foodservice, or food-away-from-home, market represents approximately 53% of the total dollars spent on food purchases made at the consumer level in the u.s. as of the end of calendar year 2022.
highlights our fiscal 2023 results were strong, reflecting growth in volumes and market share. our market share gains in the u.s. segments continued to accelerate through the fiscal year. this demonstrates the favorable impact of our recipe for growth strategy on our business, now in its third year. this strategy is helping us advance our capabilities in supply chain and sales. as a result, sysco achieved an all-time record for annual sales and operating income. we made significant improvements in operating expense leverage, resulting in improved productivity that drove profitable growth. see below for a comparison of our fiscal 2023 results to our fiscal 2022 results, both including and excluding certain items (as defined below).
below is a comparison of results from fiscal 2023 to fiscal 2022:
•operating income:
◦adjusted operating income increased 21.7%, or $572.0 million, to $3.2 billion;
◦increased 31.2%, or $0.83, to $3.49 from the comparable prior year amount of $2.66 per share;
◦increased 31.4%, or $0.83, to $3.47 from the comparable prior year amount of $2.64 per share;
◦adjusted diluted earnings per share were $4.01 in fiscal 2023, a $0.76 increase from the comparable prior year amount of $3.25 per share.
the discussion of our results includes certain non-gaap financial measures, including ebitda and adjusted ebitda, that we believe provide important perspective with respect to underlying business trends. other than free cash flow, any non-gaap financial measures will be denoted as adjusted measures to remove the impact of restructuring and transformational project costs consisting of: (1) restructuring charges, (2) expenses associated with our various transformation initiatives and (3) severance charges; acquisition-related costs consisting of: (a) intangible amortization expense and (b) acquisition costs and due diligence costs related to our acquisitions; and the reduction of bad debt expense previously recognized in fiscal 2020 due to the impact of the covid-19 pandemic on the collectability of our pre-pandemic trade receivable balances. our results for fiscal 2023 were also impacted by adjustments to a product return allowance pertaining to covid-related personal protection equipment inventory, a pension settlement charge that resulted from the purchase of a nonparticipating single premium group annuity contract that transferred defined benefit plan obligations to an insurer, and a litigation financing agreement. our results for fiscal 2022 were also impacted by a write-down of covid-related personal protection equipment inventory due to the reduction in the net realizable value of inventory, losses on the extinguishment of long-term debt and an increase in reserves for uncertain tax positions.
the fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2022 items discussed above are collectively referred to as "certain items." the results of our operations can be impacted by changes in exchange rates applicable to converting from local currencies to u.s. dollars. we measure our results on a constant currency basis. our discussion below of our results includes certain non-gaap financial measures that we believe provide important perspective with respect to underlying business trends. other than free cash flow, any non-gaap financial measures will be denoted as adjusted measures and exclude the impact from certain items, and certain metrics are stated on a constant currency basis.
management believes that adjusting its operating expenses, operating income, interest expense, other (income) expense, net earnings and diluted earnings per share to remove these certain items, provides an important perspective with respect to our underlying business trends and results. additionally, it provides meaningful supplemental information to both management and investors that (1) is indicative of the performance of the company's underlying operations, (2) facilitates comparisons on a year-over-year basis and (3) removes those items that are difficult to predict and are often unanticipated and that, as a result, are difficult to include in analysts' financial models and our investors' expectations with any degree of specificity.
the company uses these non-gaap measures when evaluating its financial results as well as for internal planning and forecasting purposes. these financial measures should not be used as a substitute for gaap measures in assessing the company's results of operations for periods presented. an analysis of any non-gaap financial measure should be used in conjunction with results presented in accordance with gaap. any metric within this section referred to as "adjusted" will reflect the applicable impact of certain items. more information on the rationale for the use of these measures and reconciliations to gaap numbers can be found under "non-gaap reconciliations."
key performance indicators sysco seeks to meet its strategic goals by continually measuring its success in its key performance metrics that drive stakeholder value through sales growth and capital allocation and deployment. we believe the following are our most significant performance metrics in our current business environment:
•adjusted operating income growth (non-gaap);
•adjusted diluted earnings per share growth (non-gaap);
•case volume growth by customer type for u.s. foodservice operations;
•adjusted return on invested capital (non-gaap).
we use these financial metrics and related computations, as well as sales and gross profit growth, to evaluate our business and to plan for near and long-term operating and strategic decisions. we believe it is useful to provide investors with the same financial information that we use internally to make comparisons of our historical operating results, identify trends in our underlying operating results and evaluate our business.
key financial definitions
•sales - sales is equal to gross sales subtracted by, (1) sales returns and (2) sales incentives that we offer to certain customers, such as upfront monies and discounts. our sales are driven by changes in case volumes, product inflation that is reflected in the pricing of our products and mix of products sold.
•gross profit - gross profit is equal to our net sales subtracted by our cost of goods sold. cost of goods sold primarily includes inventory costs (net of supplier consideration) and inbound freight. cost of goods sold generally changes as we incur higher or lower costs from our suppliers and as our customer and product mix changes.
adjusted operating income and adjusted diluted earnings per share growth adjusted operating income represents our consolidated operating income, adjusted for the impact of certain items that we do not consider representative of our underlying performance. adjusted diluted earnings per share represents our consolidated diluted earnings per share, adjusted for the impact of certain items that we do not consider representative of our underlying performance. sysco's management considers growth in these metrics to be useful measures of operating efficiency and profitability as they facilitate comparison of performance on a consistent basis from period to period by providing a measurement of recurring factors and trends affecting our business.
adjusted ebitda ebitda represents net earnings plus: (1) interest expense, (2) income tax expense and benefit, (3) depreciation and (4) amortization. the net earnings component of our ebitda calculation is impacted by certain items that we do not consider representative of our underlying performance. as a result, in the non-gaap reconciliations below for each period presented, adjusted ebitda is computed as ebitda plus the impact of certain items, excluding certain items related to interest expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization. sysco's management considers growth in this metric to be a measure of overall financial performance that provides useful information to management and investors about the profitability of the business. it facilitates comparison of performance on a consistent basis from period to period by providing a measurement of recurring factors and trends affecting our business. additionally, it is a commonly used component metric used to inform on capital structure decisions.
case volume growth by customer type for u.s. foodservice operations case volume represents the volume of product sold to customers during a period of time and improvements in this metric are a primary driver of sysco's top line performance. we define a case, specifically for our u.s. foodservice operations, as the lowest level of packaged products that are sold from our warehouses, with one case potentially containing several pieces of a product packaged in bulk. case size does not generally vary by location or from period to period due to the design of our warehouses. case volume growth is calculated by dividing the change in the volume of cases sold year-over-year by the volume of cases sold in the prior year. sysco management considers case volume growth within its u.s. foodservice operations to be a measure that provides useful information to management and investors in evaluating sales performance and as an indicator of gross margin performance. management monitors case volume growth by customer type, with bifurcation between local customers and national customers, as this provides a measure of gross profit performance due to the pricing strategies attached to each customer type. local customers are primarily street customers, such as independent restaurants that do not have long-term contracts, or locally managed customers, such as local chain restaurants, while national customers are the multi-unit customers requiring national coverage from a customer-centric view and are managed centrally from our global shared center. sysco management seeks to drive higher case volume growth to local customers, which allows more favorable pricing terms for our u.s. foodservice operations and generates higher gross margins as a result. national customers benefit from purchasing power as they are able to negotiate pricing agreements across multiple businesses reducing our gross profit potential, but reducing our overall cost per case, as national customers have bigger drop sizes. while overall case volume growth reflects a key component of sales growth, local customer case growth provides additional context around gross profit performance.
sysco brand penetration for u.s. broadline operations sysco management considers sysco brand penetration to be a measure that provides useful information to management and investors in evaluating the gross profit performance of the company's u.s. broadline operations. sysco offers an assortment of sysco-branded products which are differentiated from privately branded products. these sysco branded products enable us to achieve higher gross margin by administering and leveraging a consolidated product procurement program for quality food and non-food products. due to cost efficiencies, sysco-branded products generate a higher gross margin than sales from other privately branded products. we define sysco brand penetration as the percentage of sysco-branded case volume sold to u.s. broadline customers over all cases sold to u.s. broadline customers. it is calculated by dividing sysco-branded case volume sold to u.s. broadline customers by total cases sold to u.s. broadline customers. this performance indicator, also measured at the customer type level, including local and national customers, is driven by growth in the distribution of sysco branded products to more customers and more geographies, as well as increasing sysco branded offerings through innovation and the launch of new products.
free cash flow free cash flow represents net cash provided from operating activities, subtracted by purchases of plant and equipment, added to proceeds from sales of plant and equipment. sysco management considers free cash flow to be a non-gaap liquidity measure that provides useful information to management and investors about the amount of cash generated by the business after the purchases and sales of buildings, fleet, equipment and technology, which may potentially be used to pay for, among other things, strategic uses of cash, including dividend payments, share repurchases and acquisitions. however, free cash flow may not be available for discretionary expenditures as it may be necessary that we use it to make mandatory debt service or other payments. free cash flow should be considered in addition to, rather than as a substitute for, consolidated net income as a measure of our performance and net cash provided by operating activities as a measure of our liquidity. see "liquidity and capital resources" for discussions of gaap metrics, including net cash provided by operating activities and our reconciliation of this non-gaap financial measure.
adjusted return on invested capital although adjusted return on invested capital (roic) is considered a non-gaap financial measure, sysco management considers adjusted roic to be a measure that provides useful information to management and investors in evaluating the efficiency and effectiveness of the company's long-term capital investments and it has been reintroduced as a component of long-term incentive compensation for fiscal 2024. we calculate adjusted roic as adjusted net earnings divided by the sum of: (1) stockholders' equity, computed as the average of adjusted stockholders' equity at the beginning of the year and at the end of each fiscal quarter during the year; and (2) long-term debt, computed as the average of the long-term debt at the beginning of the year and at the end of each fiscal quarter during the year. trends in roic can fluctuate over time as management balances long-term strategic initiatives with possible short-term impacts.
trends economic and industry trends sysco continues to outperform the foodservice market due to the success of the recipe for growth strategy. the food-away-from-home sector is a healthy long-term market. sysco is diversified and well positioned as a market leader in food service. we expect the foodservice market to grow at a lower rate in fiscal 2024 as compared to fiscal 2023.
sales and gross profit trends our sales and gross profit performance are influenced by multiple factors including price, volume, inflation, customer mix and product mix. the most significant factor affecting performance in fiscal 2023 was volume growth, as we experienced a 5.2% improvement in u.s. foodservice case volume and a 3.3% improvement in local case volume within our u.s. segment in each instance as compared to fiscal 2022. this volume reflects our broadline and specialty businesses, except for our specialty meats business, which measures its volume in pounds. this growth enabled us to gain market share during fiscal 2023 and contributed to sysco achieving an all-time record for annual sales.
product cost inflation has also been a driver of our sales and gross profit performance. we experienced inflation at a rate of 2.1% and 6.1% in the fourth quarter and fiscal 2023, respectively, at the total enterprise level, primarily driven by inflation in the dairy, frozen, and canned and dry categories. the rate of inflation, as compared to the prior year, declined at an accelerated rate during the fourth quarter. we have been successful in managing inflation, resulting in an increase in gross profit dollars. gross margin increased 51 basis points in the fourth quarter and increased 33 basis points for fiscal 2023, as compared to the corresponding prior year periods, primarily driven by higher volumes, the effective management of inflation and progress with our partnership growth management initiatives.
we expect the rate of inflation for fiscal 2024 to be below historical trends. we expect deflation within our u.s. broadline operations for the first half of fiscal 2024, followed by minimal inflation in the second half of fiscal 2024. our international foodservice operations are expected to remain inflationary during fiscal 2024 given the unique marketplace conditions present in those operations. at the total enterprise level, inflation is expected to be slightly positive for fiscal 2024.
given our expectation for slower market growth and inflation as noted previously, we expect sales growth to increase in the mid-single digits in fiscal 2024 as compared to fiscal 2023, as we reach approximately $80 billion in annual sales.
operating expense trends total operating expenses increased 9.4% during fiscal 2023, as compared to fiscal 2022, driven by increased volumes, cost inflation, continued operational cost pressures from the operating environment and our planned investments to drive our transformation initiatives under our recipe for growth strategy. we continued to improve our supply chain efficiency, while investing in associate retention and best-in-class training, primarily for transportation and warehouse colleagues. these efficiency efforts are expected to continue to improve in fiscal 2024. our sysco driver academy and industry leading training programs are contributing to improved retention and productivity, and we expect to see this trend improve as the percentage of drivers and warehouse colleagues trained from within sysco continues to grow. we believe the advancements we are making in our physical capabilities, and the investments we are making in improved training, will provide higher service levels to our customers and strengthen sysco's ability to profitably win market share.
non-routine gains and losses in fiscal 2023, we completed two transactions that created non-routine gains and losses, both of which were treated as certain items. first, the sysco corporation retirement plan (the plan) executed a commitment agreement to purchase a nonparticipating single premium group annuity contract that transferred $695.0 million of the plan's defined benefit pension obligations related to certain pension benefits. as a result of this transaction, we recognized a one-time, non-cash pre-tax pension settlement charge of $315.4 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2023. second, sysco had been pursuing claims against a variety of vendors from which the company purchased products. to mitigate the risk of incurring significant legal fees on these claims without any ultimate gain, in calendar 2019 and 2020, we entered into agreements with a third party whereby the company secured a minimum amount of cash proceeds from the third party in exchange for assigning to the third party the rights to a portion of the future litigation proceeds. at the time of receipt of these cash proceeds, the amounts were deferred in "other long-term liabilities." in june 2023, an agreement was reached in which the company assigned all its remaining claims against these vendors to the third party. as a result, sysco is no longer obligated to pursue litigation against these vendors; therefore, previous deferred proceeds were recognized within "other expense (income), net." in total, this agreement resulted in $122.0 million being recognized in "other expense (income), net" in june 2023. we do not expect similar transactions to these in fiscal 2024.
income tax trends our provision for income taxes primarily reflects a combination of income earned and taxed in the various u.s. federal and state as well as foreign jurisdictions. tax law changes, increases or decreases in book versus tax basis differences, accruals or adjustments of accruals for unrecognized tax benefits or valuation allowances, and our change in the mix of earnings from these taxing jurisdictions all affect the overall effective tax rate. our effective tax rate for fiscal 2023 was 22.55% and is expected to increase to approximately 24.50% in fiscal 2024 due to geographic mix, strong international growth and increases in state tax rates.
mergers and acquisitions we continue to focus on mergers and acquisitions as a part of our growth strategy. we plan to reinforce our existing businesses, while cultivating new channels, new segments and new capabilities. in the first and second quarters of fiscal 2023, we acquired a total of three small u.s.-based independent italian food distributors as part of our plan to meaningfully scale our growing italian platform. the results of these acquisitions were not material to the consolidated results of the company for fiscal 2023. in august 2023, we acquired bix produce, a leading produce specialty distributor based in minnesota. this acquisition is expected to provide a strategic opportunity for specialty produce operations to expand its geographic footprint in an area of the country where it does not currently have operations.
strategy our purpose is "connecting the world to share food and care for one another." purpose driven companies are believed to perform better, and we believe our purpose will assist us to grow substantially faster than the foodservice distribution industry and deliver profitable growth through our "recipe for growth" transformation. this growth transformation is supported by strategic pillars that we believe will continue to enable us to better serve our customers, including:
•digital - we have and will continue to enrich the customer experience through personalized digital tools that reduce friction in the purchase experience and introduce innovation to our customers. we continue to invest in our personalization engine and upgraded our digital shopping platform with more than 100 new feature enhancements, including spanish language capability, implemented in fiscal 2023. we successfully leveraged our centralized pricing tool in the u.s. in fiscal 2023 that gave us the ability to be right on price at the region, customer, and item level even during periods of rapid inflation, dis-inflation, and even deflation.
•products and solutions - we are providing customer-focused marketing and merchandising solutions that inspire increased sales of our broad assortment of fair priced products and services. we continue to improve our merchandising strategies globally to secure the best possible cost for our customers and in fiscal 2023, we stood up a sysco brand team to accelerate progress within our owned-brands.
•supply chain - we are efficiently and consistently serving customers with the products they need, when and how they need them, through a flexible delivery framework. we are developing a more nimble, accessible and productive supply chain that is better positioned to support our customers. in fiscal 2023, our work on deploying strengthened engineered labor standards allowed us to consistently improve supply chain efficiency quarter over quarter. we also completed the roll out of our driver academy nationally. our strategic initiatives to enable omni-channel inventory fulfillment are being piloted.
•customer teams - our greatest strength is our people, people who are passionate about food and food service. our diverse team delivers expertise and differentiated services designed to help our customers grow their businesses. we intend to improve the effectiveness of our sales organization by leveraging data to increase the yield of the sales process. in fiscal 2023, we meaningfully advanced our total team selling model that brings together our broadline and specialty businesses in shared geography to best meet the needs of our customers.
•future horizons - we are committed to responsible growth. we will cultivate new channels, new segments, and new capabilities while being stewards of our company and our planet for the long-term. we will fund our journey through cost-out and efficiency improvements. in august 2023, we acquired bix produce - a leading produce specialty distributor based in minnesota that allows us to expand our geographic footprint and continue to add new capabilities, including fresh cut produce, grab-and-go sandwiches, and value-added products.

in fiscal 2023, u.s. foodservice operations and international foodservice operations represented approximately 70.3% and 17.8%, respectively, of sysco's overall sales, compared to 70.7% and 17.2%, respectively, in fiscal 2022. in fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2022, u.s. foodservice operations represented approximately 89.4% and 96.5%, respectively, of the total segment operating income. this illustrates that these segments represent a substantial majority of our total segment results when compared to other reportable segments. see note 21, "business segment information," in the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8.
cost of sales primarily includes our product costs, net of vendor consideration, and includes in-bound freight. operating expenses include the costs of facilities, product handling, delivery, selling and general and administrative activities. fuel surcharges are reflected within sales and gross profit; fuel costs are reflected within operating expenses. along with sales, operating income is the most relevant measure for evaluating segment performance and allocating resources, as operating income includes cost of goods sold in addition to the costs to warehouse and deliver goods, which are significant and relevant costs when evaluating a distribution business.
results of u.s. foodservice operations in fiscal 2023, the u.s. foodservice operations operating results represented approximately 70.3% of sysco's overall sales and 89.4% of the aggregated operating income of sysco's reporting segments. several factors contributed to these higher operating results as compared to the other operating segments. we invested substantial amounts in assets, operating methods, technology and management expertise in this segment. the breadth of its sales force, geographic reach of its distribution area and its purchasing power enable this segment to generate its relatively stronger results of operations.

(1)                                                                                        case volumes increased 5.2% compared to fiscal 2022. this volume increase resulted in a 4.5% increase in the dollar value of sales compared to fiscal 2022.
(2)        case volume reflects our broadline and specialty businesses, with the exception of our specialty meats business, which measures its volume in pounds. any impact in volumes from our specialty meats operations is included within "other."
the sales growth in our u.s. foodservice operations was fueled by three factors: inflation, market growth, and strong market share gains. case volumes from our u.s. foodservice operations increased 5.2%, as compared to fiscal 2022. this included a 3.3% increase in local customer case volume as compared to fiscal 2022.
operating income the increase in operating income for fiscal 2023, as compared to fiscal 2022, was driven by gross profit dollar growth and partially offset by an increase in operating expenses.
gross profit dollar growth was driven primarily by higher volumes as well as continued progress with effective management of product cost inflation and our strategic sourcing initiatives. the estimated change in product costs, an internal measure of inflation or deflation, increased in fiscal 2023. for fiscal 2023, this change in product costs was primarily driven by inflation in the dairy, frozen, and canned and dry categories. sysco brand penetration for u.s. broadline improved by 36 basis points to 37.0% for fiscal 2023, as compared to fiscal 2022. specific to local customers, sysco brand penetration for u.s. broadline improved by 118 basis points to 46.8% for fiscal 2023, as compared to fiscal 2022.
gross margin, which is gross profit as a percentage of sales, was 19.3% in fiscal 2023. this was an increase of 35 basis points compared to gross margin of 19.0% in fiscal 2022 due to the effective management of inflation, along with specific efforts to optimize our gross profit dollars.
the increase in operating expenses for fiscal 2023, as compared to fiscal 2022, was primarily driven by increased volumes, operational pressures from the operating environment, cost inflation and our planned investments to drive our transformation initiatives. we also experienced an increase in operating expenses due to investments for our recipe for growth strategy in fiscal 2023.
results of international foodservice operations in fiscal 2023, the international foodservice operations operating results represented approximately 17.8% of sysco's overall sales.

(1)         the impact of volumes as a component of sales growth from international operations are included within "other." volume in our foreign operations includes volume metrics that differ from country to country and cannot be aggregated on a consistent comparable basis.
sales in fiscal 2023 were higher primarily due to inflation, along with an increase in volume, some of which was attributable to our recipe for growth initiatives. partially offsetting these increases was the negative impact of foreign currency translation.
operating income the $213.4 million increase in operating income for fiscal 2023, as compared to fiscal 2022, was primarily a result of the continuing increase in sales volumes along with specific efforts to optimize our gross profit while managing our operating expenses.
the increase in gross profit dollars in fiscal 2023, as compared to fiscal 2022, was attributable to the increase in sales volume and the management of inflation along with specific efforts to optimize our gross profit dollars.
the increase in operating expenses for fiscal 2023, as compared to fiscal 2022, was primarily due to increased volume and inflation.
results of sygma and other segment for sygma, sales were 8.2% higher in fiscal 2023, as compared to fiscal 2022, primarily from inflation and fee increases to customers. operating income increased by $59.7 million in fiscal 2023, as compared to fiscal 2022, primarily due to fee increases to customers.
for the operations that are grouped within our other segment, operating income increased $39.5 million in fiscal 2023, as compared to fiscal 2022, primarily due to the recovery of our hospitality business, guest worldwide. volume for this business has improved as hospitality occupancy rates have grown from prior year levels.
global support center expenses our global support center generally includes all expenses of the corporate office and sysco's shared service operations. these expenses increased $101.2 million in fiscal 2023, or 11.6% as compared to fiscal 2022, primarily due to increases in self-insurance costs, technology expense and employee-related expenses, partially offset by reduced acquisition-related costs.
included in global support center expenses are certain items that totaled $44.9 million in fiscal 2023, as compared to $146.8 million in fiscal 2022. certain items impacting fiscal 2023 were primarily expenses associated with our business technology transformation initiatives. in fiscal 2022, certain items that impacted the year were primarily expenses associated with our business technology transformation initiatives and acquisitions, as well as a write-down of covid-related personal protection equipment inventory due to the reduction in the net realizable value of inventory.
other income and expense other income decreased $250.4 million for fiscal 2023, as compared to fiscal 2022, primarily due to a pension settlement charge partially offset by a gain on a litigation financing agreement.
net earnings net earnings increased 30.3% in fiscal 2023, as compared to fiscal 2022, due primarily to the items noted previously for operating income and interest expense, as well as items impacting our income taxes that are discussed in note 19, "income taxes," in the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8. adjusted net earnings, excluding certain items, increased 22.2% in fiscal 2023, primarily due to an increase in sales volume.
earnings per share basic earnings per share in fiscal 2023 were $3.49, a 31.2% increase from the comparable prior year period amount of $2.66 per share. diluted earnings per share in fiscal 2023 were $3.47, a 31.4% increase from the comparable prior year period amount of $2.64 per share. adjusted diluted earnings per share, excluding certain items (which is a non-gaap financial measure for which a reconciliation is provided in "non-gaap reconciliations" on the subsequent page), in fiscal 2023 were $4.01, a 23.4% increase from the comparable prior year period amount of $3.25 per share. these results were primarily attributable to the factors discussed previously related to net earnings in fiscal 2023.
non-gaap reconciliations the discussion of our results includes certain non-gaap financial measures, including ebitda and adjusted ebitda, that we believe provide important perspective with respect to underlying business trends. other than free cash flow, any non-gaap financial measures will be denoted as adjusted measures to remove the impact of restructuring and transformational project costs consisting of: (1) restructuring charges, (2) expenses associated with our various transformation initiatives and (3) severance charges; acquisition-related costs consisting of: (a) intangible amortization expense and (b) acquisition costs and due diligence costs related to our acquisitions; and the reduction of bad debt expense previously recognized in fiscal 2020 due to the impact of the covid-19 pandemic on the collectability of our pre-pandemic trade receivable balances. our results for fiscal 2023 were also impacted by adjustments to a product return allowance pertaining to covid-related personal protection equipment inventory, a pension settlement charge that resulted from the purchase of a nonparticipating single premium group annuity contract that transferred defined benefit plan obligations to an insurer, and a litigation financing agreement. our results for fiscal 2022 were also impacted by a write-down of covid-related personal protection equipment inventory due to the reduction in the net realizable value of inventory, losses on the extinguishment of long-term debt and an increase in reserves for uncertain tax positions.
the results of our operations can be impacted due to changes in exchange rates applicable in converting local currencies to u.s. dollars. we measure our results on a constant currency basis. constant currency operating results are calculated by translating current-period local currency operating results with the currency exchange rates used to translate the financial statements in the comparable prior-year period to determine what the current-period u.s. dollar operating results would have been if the currency exchange rate had not changed from the comparable prior-year period.
management believes that adjusting its operating expenses, operating income, net earnings and diluted earnings per share to remove these certain items and presenting its results on a constant currency basis, provides an important perspective with respect to our underlying business trends and results. it provides meaningful supplemental information to both management and investors that (1) is indicative of the performance of the company's underlying operations and (2) facilitates comparisons on a year-over-year basis.
sysco has a history of growth through acquisitions and excludes from its non-gaap financial measures the impact of acquisition-related intangible amortization, acquisition costs and due-diligence costs for those acquisitions. we believe this approach significantly enhances the comparability of sysco's results for fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2022.
set forth on the following page is a reconciliation of sales, operating expenses, operating income, other (income) expense, net earnings and diluted earnings per share to adjusted results for these measures for the periods presented. individual components of diluted earnings per share may not be equal to the total presented when added due to rounding. adjusted diluted earnings per share is calculated using adjusted net earnings divided by diluted shares outstanding.

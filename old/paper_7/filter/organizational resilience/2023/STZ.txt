item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction we have elected to omit discussion on the earliest of the three years covered by the consolidated financial statements presented. refer to item 7. "management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations" and "liquidity and capital resources" located in our form 10-k for the fiscal year ended february 28, 2023, filed on april 20, 2023, for reference to discussion of the fiscal year ended february 28, 2022, the earliest of the three fiscal years presented. this md&a, which should be read in conjunction with our financial statements, is organized as follows:
overview.    this section provides a general description of our business, which we believe is important in understanding the results of our operations, financial condition, and potential future trends.
strategy.    this section provides a description of our strategy and a discussion of a recent development, and significant divestitures, acquisitions, and investments.

liquidity and capital resources.    this section provides an analysis of our cash flows, outstanding debt, liquidity position, and commitments. included in the analysis of outstanding debt is a discussion of the financial capacity available to fund our ongoing operations and future commitments, as well as a discussion of other financing arrangements.
critical accounting policies and estimates.    this section identifies accounting policies that are considered important to our results of operations and financial condition, require significant judgment, and involve significant management estimates. our significant accounting policies, including those considered to be critical accounting policies, are summarized in note 1.
overview effective may 31, 2023, we changed our internal management financial reporting to consist of two business divisions: (i) beer and (ii) wine and spirits and we now report our operating results in three segments: (i) beer, (ii) wine and spirits, and (iii) corporate operations and other following the removal of the canopy operating segment. for additional information, refer to note 22.
in the beer segment, our portfolio consists of high-end imported beer brands and abas. we have an exclusive perpetual brand license to produce our mexican beer portfolio and to import, market, and sell such portfolio in the u.s. in the wine and spirits segment, we sell a portfolio that includes higher-end wine brands complemented by certain higher-end spirits brands. amounts included in the corporate operations and other segment consist of costs of corporate development, corporate finance, corporate strategy, executive management, growth, human resources, internal audit, investor relations, it, legal, and public relations, as well as our canopy investment and investments made through our corporate venture capital function. all costs included in the corporate operations and other segment are general costs that are applicable to the consolidated group and are, therefore, not allocated to the other reportable segments. all costs reported within the corporate operations and other segment are not included in our codm's evaluation of the operating income (loss) performance of the other reportable segments. the business segments reflect how our operations are managed, how resources are allocated, how operating performance is evaluated by senior management, and the structure of our internal financial reporting.
strategy our business strategy for the beer segment focuses on upholding our leadership position in the u.s. beer market, including the high-end segment, and continuing to grow our high-end imported beer brands through constellation brands, inc. fy 2024 form 10-k       #worthreachingfor i 34
part ii        item 7. md&amp;a        table of contents maintenance of leading margins, enhancements to our results of operations and operating cash flow, and exploring new avenues for growth. this includes continued focus on growing our beer portfolio in the u.s. through expanding distribution for key brands, including within the 3-tier ecommerce channel, as well as investing in the next increment of modular capacity additions required to sustain our momentum. we continue to focus on consumer-led innovation by creating new line extensions behind celebrated, trusted brands and package formats, as well as new to world brands, that are intended to meet emerging needs.
expansion, optimization, and/or construction activities continue under our mexico beer projects to align with our anticipated future growth expectations, and we expect to spend approximately $3 billion over fiscal 2025 through fiscal 2028 on these activities. see "capital expenditures" below. additionally, we are pursuing the sale of the remaining assets at the canceled mexicali brewery after exploring various options; however, we may not be successful in completing any such sale or obtaining other forms of recovery.
our business strategy for the wine and spirits segment continues to focus on higher-end brands, improving margins, and creating operating efficiencies. we have reshaped our portfolio primarily through an enhanced focus on higher-margin, higher-growth wine and spirits brands. our business is organized into two distinct commercial teams, one focused on our fine wine and craft spirits brands and the other focused on our mainstream and premium brands. while each team has its own distinct strategy, both remain aligned to the goal of accelerating performance by growing organic net sales and expanding margins. in addition, we are advancing our aim to become a global, omni-channel competitor in line with consumer preferences. our business continues to progressively expand into dtc channels (including hospitality), 3-tier ecommerce, and international markets, while remaining a major supplier in u.s. 3-tier brick-and-mortar distribution. in markets where it is feasible, we entered into a contractual arrangement with southern glazer's wine and spirits to consolidate our u.s. distribution in order to obtain dedicated distributor selling resources which focus on our u.s. wine and spirits portfolio to drive organic growth. this distributor currently represents about 70% of our branded wine and spirits volume in the u.s.
marketing, sales, and distribution of our products are primarily managed on a geographic basis allowing us to leverage leading market positions. in addition, market dynamics and consumer trends vary across each of our markets. within our primary market in the u.s., we offer a range of beverage alcohol products across the imported beer, aba, and branded wine and spirits categories, with generally separate distribution networks utilized for (i) our beer portfolio and (ii) our wine and spirits portfolio. the environment for our products is competitive in each of our markets.
we remain committed to our long-term financial model of: growing sales, expanding margins, and increasing cash flow in order to achieve earnings per share growth as well as our target net leverage ratio and dividend payout ratio; investing to support the growth of our business; and delivering additional returns to stockholders through periodic share repurchases. our results of operations and financial condition have been affected by inflation, changing prices, reductions in discretionary income of consumers available to purchase our products, and shifting consumer behaviors, as well as other unfavorable global and regional economic conditions, global supply chain disruptions and constraints, and geopolitical events. we expect some or all of these impacts to continue into fiscal 2025 which could have a material impact on our results of operations. we intend to continue to monitor the inflationary environment and the impact on the consumer when we consider passing along rising costs through further selling price increases, subject to normal competitive conditions. in addition, we are continuing our commodity and foreign exchange hedging programs while also seeking to identify additional cost savings initiatives. however, there can be no assurance that we will be able to fully mitigate rising costs through increased selling prices and/or cost savings initiatives. furthermore, to the extent climate-related severe weather events, such as droughts, floods, wildfires, extreme heat, and/or late frosts, continue to occur or accelerate in future periods, it could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial condition.
recent development conversion of canopy common stock ownership and exchange of investment into exchangeable shares in april 2024, the canopy amendment was approved by canopy's shareholders. we subsequently elected to convert our 17.1 million canopy common shares into exchangeable shares on a one-for-one basis. additionally, constellation brands, inc. fy 2024 form 10-k       #worthreachingfor i 35
part ii        item 7. md&amp;a        table of contents we exchanged our 2023 canopy promissory note for 9.1 million exchangeable shares and forgave all accrued but unpaid interest together with the remaining principal amount of the note. for additional information, refer to note 10.
divestitures, acquisitions, and investments beer segment craft beer divestitures in june 2023, we completed the craft beer divestitures. accordingly, our consolidated results of operations include the results of operations of such craft beer brands through the dates of these divestitures. the craft beer divestitures are consistent with our strategic focus on continuing to grow our high-end imported beer brands through maintenance of leading margins and enhancements to our results of operations.
daleville facility in may 2023, we sold the daleville facility in connection with our decision to exit the craft beer business.
wine and spirits segment wine divestiture in october 2022, we sold certain of our mainstream and premium wine brands and related inventory. accordingly, our consolidated results of operations include the results of operations of such mainstream and premium wine brands through the date of divestiture. we received cash proceeds of $96.7 million from the wine divestiture that were utilized primarily to reduce outstanding borrowings. we recognized a $15.0 million net gain on the sale of business for fiscal 2023. this gain was included in selling, general, and administrative expenses within our consolidated results.
austin cocktails acquisition in april 2022, we acquired the remaining 73% ownership interest in austin cocktails, which included a portfolio of small batch, rtd cocktails. this transaction primarily included the acquisition of goodwill and a trademark. the results of operations of austin cocktails are reported in the wine and spirits segment and have been included in our consolidated results of operations from the date of acquisition.
lingua franca acquisition in march 2022, we acquired the lingua franca business, including a collection of oregon-based luxury wines, a vineyard, and a production facility. this transaction also included the acquisition of a trademark and inventory. the results of operations of lingua franca are reported in the wine and spirits segment and have been included in our consolidated results of operations from the date of acquisition.
our wine and spirits segment divestiture and acquisitions support our strategic focus on consumer-led premiumization trends and meeting the evolving needs of our consumers.
corporate operations and other segment corporate ventures as of august 31, 2023, we evaluated certain equity method investments, made through our corporate venture capital function, and determined there were other-than-temporary impairments due to business underperformance. investments with a carrying value of $14.9 million were written down to an estimated fair value of $2.6 million, resulting in an impairment of $12.3 million. this loss from impairment was included in income (loss) from unconsolidated investments within our consolidated results for fiscal 2024. in october 2023, we exited one of these equity method investments in exchange for a note receivable.
part ii        item 7. md&amp;a        table of contents canopy equity method investment -
we evaluated the canopy equity method investment as of may 31, 2023, and determined there was an other-than-temporary impairment. our conclusion was based primarily on several contributing factors, including: (i) the fair value being less than the carrying value and the uncertainty surrounding canopy's stock price recovering in the near-term, (ii) canopy recorded significant costs in its fourth quarter of fiscal 2023 results designed to align its canadian cannabis operations and resources in response to continued unfavorable market trends, (iii) the substantial doubt about canopy's ability to continue as a going concern, as disclosed by canopy, and (iv) canopy's identification of material misstatements in certain of its previously reported financial results related to sales in its biosteel reporting unit that were accounted for incorrectly, including the recording of a goodwill impairment during its restated second quarter of fiscal 2023. as a result, the canopy equity method investment with a carrying value of $266.2 million was written down to its estimated fair value of $142.7 million, resulting in an impairment of $123.5 million. this loss from impairment was included in income (loss) from unconsolidated investments within our consolidated results for fiscal 2024.
additionally, we evaluated the canopy equity method investment as of august 31, 2022, and determined that there was an other-than-temporary impairment. our conclusion was based on several contributing factors, including: (i) the period of time for which the fair value had been less than the carrying value and the uncertainty surrounding canopy's stock price recovering in the near-term, (ii) canopy recording a significant impairment of goodwill related to its cannabis operations during its first quarter of fiscal 2023, and (iii) the uncertainty of u.s. federal cannabis permissibility. as a result, the canopy equity method investment with a carrying value of $1,695.1 million was written down to its estimated fair value of $634.8 million, resulting in an impairment of $1,060.3 million. this loss from impairment was included in income (loss) from unconsolidated investments within our consolidated results for fiscal 2023.
in july 2022, we received 29.2 million common shares of canopy following the exchange of c$100.0 million principal amount of our canopy debt securities. in april 2023, we extended the maturity of the remaining c$100.0 million principal amount of our canopy debt securities by exchanging them for the 2023 canopy promissory note. the fair value of the canopy debt securities was $69.6 million as of february 28, 2023. as of may 31, 2023, we determined that the 2023 canopy promissory note did not have future economic value and, accordingly, the fair value was reduced to zero. additionally, on november 1, 2023, the initial tranche of the november 2018 canopy warrants expired in accordance with its terms. the remaining tranches of the november 2018 canopy warrants were conditioned on the exercise, in full, of the expired warrants. as such, there are no longer any outstanding november 2018 canopy warrants.
for additional information on these divestitures, acquisitions, and investments, refer to notes 2, 5, 7, and 10.
results of operations financial highlights references to organic throughout the following discussion exclude the impact of the wine divestiture, as appropriate.
•our results of operations were primarily impacted by (i) lower impairment and other losses related to our investment in canopy as compared with fiscal 2023 and (ii) improvements within the beer segment driven by 7.4% shipment volume growth and our successful execution of cost savings initiatives, partially offset by a decline in performance within the wine and spirits segment.
part ii        item 7. md&amp;a        table of contents
•net sales increased 5% largely due to an increase in beer net sales driven primarily by shipment volume growth and favorable impact from pricing, partially offset by a decline in wine and spirits net sales driven primarily by a decrease in branded shipment volume.
•operating income increased 11% largely due to the improvements within (i) the beer segment as shipment volume outpaced the growth of cost of product sold, driven by the successful execution of cost savings initiatives, (ii) the wine and spirits segment driven by lower transportation and warehousing costs, and (iii) the corporate operations and other segment from lower digital business acceleration investments as compared to fiscal 2023, partially offset by the decline in branded wine and spirits shipment volume.
comparable adjustments management excludes items that affect comparability from its evaluation of the results of each operating segment as these comparable adjustments are not reflective of core operations of the segments. segment operating performance and the incentive compensation of segment management are evaluated based on core segment operating income (loss) which does not include the impact of these comparable adjustments.

flow through of inventory step-up in connection with acquisitions, the allocation of purchase price in excess of book value for certain inventories on hand at the date of acquisition is referred to as inventory step-up. inventory step-up represents an assumed manufacturing profit attributable to the acquired business prior to acquisition.
strategic business development costs we recognized costs in connection with certain activities which are intended to streamline, increase efficiencies, and reduce our cost structure within the wine and spirits segment.
net flow through of reserved inventory we sold reserved inventory previously written down following the 2020 u.s. west coast wildfires.
recovery of (loss on) inventory write-down we recognized a gain from a change in estimate on reserved bulk wine inventory and certain grapes as a result of smoke damage sustained during the 2020 u.s. west coast wildfires.
selling, general, and administrative expenses restructuring and other strategic business development costs we recognized costs primarily in connection with certain activities which are intended to streamline, increase efficiencies, and reduce our cost structure.

(1)includes adjustments to remove volumes associated with the wine divestiture for the period march 1, 2022, through october 5, 2022.
the decrease in wine and spirits net sales is due to a $149.9 million decrease in organic net sales and $38.5 million from the wine divestiture. the decrease in organic net sales is driven by a $175.2 million decrease in branded wine and spirits shipment volume, partially offset by (i) $21.4 million of favorable impact from pricing and (ii) $4.3 million of favorable product mix, driven by consumer-led premiumization. the decrease in branded wine and spirits shipment volume is primarily attributable to our u.s. wholesale market, driven by declines in both the overall wine market and in our mainstream and premium brands. the favorable impact from pricing was driven by price increases, partially offset by lower contractual distributor payments as compared to fiscal 2023. while we expect the unfavorable u.s. wholesale wine market trends to continue in fiscal 2025, we have identified key actions to improve marketing execution and sales performance.

the increase in beer gross profit is primarily due to (i) $299.9 million of shipment volume growth and (ii) the $147.6 million of favorable impact from pricing, partially offset by (i) $163.7 million of higher cost of product sold and (ii) $12.0 million of unfavorable product mix. the higher cost of product sold is primarily due to (i) $113.8 million of higher material costs, including malt, aluminum, glass, and starch, driven by inflation and global supply chain constraints, (ii) $28.4 million of higher depreciation resulting from the mexico beer projects, (iii) $21.6 million of costs related to the write-off of a value-added tax receivable, (iv) $13.7 million of costs related to a voluntary product recall of select kegs for quality assurance, and (v) a $9.6 million increase in brewery costs, including compensation and benefits and it expenses, partially offset by (i) $21.0 million of decreased transportation costs and (ii) $15.3 million of favorable fixed cost absorption related to increased production levels as compared to fiscal 2023. to partially offset the increases in cost of product sold we executed efficiency initiatives focused largely on logistics and procurement that resulted in nearly $205 million of net cost savings for fiscal 2024.
part ii        item 7. md&amp;a        table of contents the decrease in wine and spirits gross profit is due to a $68.4 million decrease in organic gross profit and $22.7 million from the wine divestiture. the decrease in organic gross profit is attributable to (i) an $88.0 million decrease in branded wine and spirits shipment volume, (ii) $31.7 million of unfavorable channel mix led by lower-margin, non-branded net sales, and (iii) an $11.2 million decrease in non-branded gross profit on net sales, partially offset by (i) $39.9 million of lower cost of product sold and (ii) the $21.4 million favorable impact from pricing. the decrease in cost of product sold was largely attributable to (i) $31.3 million of decreased transportation and warehousing costs, including ocean freight shipping, (ii) $13.1 million of cost savings initiatives, primarily resulting in lower grape costs, as well as lower materials and packaging costs, driven by our sustainable packaging projects, and (iii) a decrease in production costs, including lower compensation and benefits.
gross profit as a percent of net sales remained relatively flat at 50.4% for fiscal 2024 compared with 50.5% for fiscal 2023. this was driven by (i) 135 basis points of rate decline from higher cost of product sold within the beer segment, driven by the increase in material costs, and (ii) approximately 30 basis points of rate decline resulting from unfavorable channel mix within the wine and spirits segment, offset by (i) approximately 60 basis points of favorable impact from beer pricing in select markets, (ii) a favorable change of approximately 50 basis points in comparable adjustments, and (iii) approximately 35 basis points of rate growth from lower cost of product sold within the wine and spirits segment.

the increase in beer selling, general, and administrative expenses is largely driven by $31.1 million and $11.8 million of increased general and administrative expenses and marketing spend, respectively. the increase in general and administrative expenses was driven primarily by (i) unfavorable foreign currency impact and (ii) higher compensation and benefits, primarily related to incremental headcount to support the demand for our beer portfolio, partially offset by (i) the craft beer divestitures, (ii) favorability from strategic asset relocation in fiscal 2023, and (iii) decreased legal expenses as compared to fiscal 2023. the increase in marketing spend is primarily driven by ongoing media investments to build awareness of our high-end imported beer brands, partially offset by decreased spend as a result of the craft beer divestitures. marketing as a percentage of net sales was 8.4% for fiscal 2024 as compared to 9.1% for fiscal 2023.
the decrease in wine and spirits selling, general, and administrative expenses is largely due to $19.0 million and $17.0 million of decreased marketing spend and general and administrative expenses, respectively. the decrease in marketing spend is primarily driven by less planned media investments for our mainstream and premium brands as compared to fiscal 2023. the decrease in general and administrative expenses is primarily due to lower incentive accruals and decreased consulting services both as compared to fiscal 2023, partially offset by higher litigation expenses.
the decrease in corporate operations and other selling, general, and administrative expenses is largely due to an approximately $44 million reduction in third-party services, driven by lower digital business acceleration investments, partially offset by an approximate $7 million increase in it project expenses as compared to fiscal 2023. compensation and benefits remained relatively flat as incremental headcount to support the digital business acceleration initiative was largely offset by favorability from the november 2022 reclassification.
part ii        item 7. md&amp;a        table of contents selling, general, and administrative expenses as a percent of net sales decreased to 18.5% for fiscal 2024 as compared with 20.4% for fiscal 2023. the decrease is driven largely by (i) approximately 95 basis points of rate decline as the increase in beer net sales exceeded the increase in selling, general, and administrative expenses, (ii) a favorable change in comparable adjustments, contributing approximately 60 basis points of rate decline, and (iii) approximately 30 basis points of rate decline from a decrease in the corporate operations and other segment's selling, general, and administrative expenses.

the increase in beer operating income is largely attributable to the shipment volume growth for our beer portfolio, the cost savings initiatives, and the favorable pricing impact, partially offset by higher material costs.
the decrease in wine and spirits operating income is largely attributable to the decline in branded wine and spirits shipment volume, unfavorable channel mix, and the wine divestiture, partially offset by the lower transportation and warehousing costs, the favorable pricing impact, decreased selling, general, and administrative expenses, and the cost savings initiatives, as described above.
as previously discussed, the corporate operations and other decrease in operating loss is largely due to the lower third-party digital business acceleration investments.

interest expense interest expense increased to $435.4 million for fiscal 2024 as compared to $398.7 million for fiscal 2023. this increase of $36.7 million, or 9%, is due to approximately $675 million of higher average borrowings and approximately 20 basis points of higher weighted average interest rates, partially offset by an increase in capitalized interest in connection with the mexico beer projects. the higher average borrowings and weighted average interest rates are largely attributable to funding the aggregate cash payment to holders of class b stock in connection with the reclassification. for additional information, refer to notes 12 and 17.
part ii        item 7. md&amp;a        table of contents loss on extinguishment of debt loss on extinguishment of debt primarily consists of a premium payment and the write-off of debt issuance costs in connection with the tender offers of our 3.20% february 2018 senior notes and 4.25% may 2013 senior notes and make-whole payments in connection with the early redemption of those notes (fiscal 2023).
(provision for) benefit from income taxes the provision for income taxes increased to $456.6 million for fiscal 2024 from $422.1 million for fiscal 2023. our effective tax rate for fiscal 2024 was 20.6% as compared with 110.0% for fiscal 2023. in comparison to prior year, our income taxes were impacted primarily by:
•an increase in the valuation allowance related to our investment in canopy, driven by the canopy equity method investment impairment recognized in fiscal 2023; offset by
•a net income tax benefit recognized from the realization of tax losses related to a prior period divestiture recognized in fiscal 2023; and
•the effective tax rates applicable to our foreign businesses.
for additional information, refer to note 13.
the oecd introduced a framework under pillar two which includes a global minimum tax rate of 15%. many jurisdictions in which we do business have started to enact laws implementing pillar two. we are monitoring these developments and currently do not believe these rules will have a material impact on our financial condition and/or consolidated results for fiscal 2025.
we expect our reported effective tax rate for fiscal 2025 to be in the range of 17.5% to 19.5%. this range does not reflect any tax impact associated with our canopy investment and related activities.
net income (loss) attributable to cbi net income (loss) attributable to cbi increased to $1,727.4 million for fiscal 2024 from $(71.0) million for fiscal 2023. this increase of $1,798.4 million, is primarily attributable to (i) lower impairment and other losses related to our investment in canopy and (ii) the fiscal 2024 improvements within the beer segment as shipment volume growth exceeded the growth of cost of product sold, driven by the successful execution of cost savings initiatives, partially offset by the decline in performance within the wine and spirits segment.
liquidity and capital resources general our primary source of liquidity has been cash flow from operating activities. our ability to consistently generate robust cash flow from our operations is one of our most significant financial strengths; it enables us to invest in our people and our brands, make capital investments and strategic acquisitions, provide a cash dividend program, and from time-to-time, repurchase shares of our common stock. our largest use of cash in our operations is for purchasing and carrying inventories and carrying seasonal accounts receivable. historically, we have used this cash flow to repay our short-term borrowings and fund capital expenditures. additionally, our commercial paper program is used to fund our short-term borrowing requirements and to maintain our access to the capital markets. we use our short-term borrowings, including our commercial paper program, to support our working capital requirements and capital expenditures, among other things.
we seek to maintain adequate liquidity to meet working capital requirements, fund capital expenditures, and repay scheduled principal and interest payments on debt. absent deterioration of market conditions, we believe that cash flows from operating and financing activities will provide adequate resources to satisfy our working capital, scheduled principal and interest payments on debt, anticipated dividend payments, periodic share repurchases, and anticipated capital expenditure requirements for both our short-term and long-term capital needs.
part ii        item 7. md&amp;a        table of contents we have an agreement with a financial institution for payment services and to facilitate a voluntary supply chain finance program through this participating financial institution. the program is available to certain of our suppliers allowing them the option to manage their cash flow. we are not a party to the agreements between the participating financial institution and the suppliers in connection with the program. our rights and obligations to our suppliers, including amounts due and scheduled payment terms, are not impacted. for additional information, refer to note 16.

the $13.3 million net change in operating assets and liabilities was driven by an increase in accounts payable for both the beer and wine and spirits segments largely due to the timing of payments. these changes were largely offset by operating cash flow increases for the beer segment in both (i) inventory levels and (ii) accounts receivable primarily attributable to the timing of collections. additionally, net cash provided by operating activities was negatively impacted by higher income tax payments in fiscal 2024 as compared to fiscal 2023.
investing activities net cash used in investing activities increased to $1,285.9 million for fiscal 2024 from $999.4 million for fiscal 2023. this increase of $286.5 million, or 29%, was primarily due to (i) $233.7 million of additional capital expenditures for fiscal 2024 largely related to the mexico beer projects and (ii) $91.3 million of reduced proceeds from the sale of business, driven by the wine divestiture in fiscal 2023. the increase in net cash used in investing activities was partially offset by a $29.6 million decrease in business acquisitions for fiscal 2024.

part ii        item 7. md&amp;a        table of contents bank facilities in may 2023, we repaid the outstanding three-year term loan facility borrowings under the august 2022 term credit agreement with proceeds from the may 2023 senior notes (see "senior notes" below). in august 2023, we repaid the outstanding five-year term loan facility borrowings under the april 2022 term credit agreement with proceeds from commercial paper borrowings.
senior notes in may 2023, we issued the may 2023 senior notes. proceeds from this offering, net of discount and debt issuance costs, of $739.8 million were used for general corporate purposes, including the repayment of outstanding borrowings under the august 2022 term credit agreement and to reduce outstanding commercial paper borrowings.
in january 2024, we issued the january 2024 senior notes. proceeds from this offering, net of discount and debt issuance costs, of $397.2 million were used for general corporate purposes, including working capital, funding capital expenditures, repayment of indebtedness, and other business opportunities.
general the majority of our outstanding borrowings as of february 29, 2024, consisted of fixed-rate senior unsecured notes, with maturities ranging from calendar 2024 to calendar 2050, as follows:
additionally, we have a commercial paper program which provides for the issuance of up to an aggregate principal amount of $2.25 billion of commercial paper. our commercial paper program is backed by unused commitments under our revolving credit facility under our 2022 credit agreement. accordingly, outstanding borrowings under our commercial paper program reduce the amount available under our revolving credit facility.
we do not have purchase commitments from buyers for our commercial paper and, therefore, our ability to issue commercial paper is subject to market demand. if the commercial paper market is not available to us for any reason when commercial paper borrowings mature, we will utilize unused commitments under our revolving credit facility under our 2022 credit agreement to repay commercial paper borrowings. we do not expect that fluctuations in demand for commercial paper will affect our liquidity given our borrowing capacity available under our revolving credit facility.
part ii        item 7. md&amp;a        table of contents we had the following remaining borrowing capacity available under our 2022 credit agreement:
(1)net of outstanding revolving credit facility borrowings and outstanding letters of credit under our 2022 credit agreement and outstanding borrowings under our commercial paper program (excluding unamortized discount) of $241.5 million and $78.7 million as of february 29, 2024, and april 16, 2024, respectively.
the financial institutions participating in our 2022 credit agreement have complied with prior funding requests and we believe they will comply with any future funding requests. however, there can be no assurances that any particular financial institution will continue to do so.
as of february 29, 2024, we and our subsidiaries were subject to covenants that are contained in our 2022 credit agreement, including those restricting the incurrence of additional subsidiary indebtedness, additional liens, mergers and consolidations, transactions with affiliates, and sale and leaseback transactions, in each case subject to numerous conditions, exceptions, and thresholds. the financial covenants are limited to a minimum interest coverage ratio and a maximum net leverage ratio, both as defined in our 2022 credit agreement. as of february 29, 2024, under our 2022 credit agreement, the minimum interest coverage ratio was 2.5x and the maximum net leverage ratio was 4.0x. in april 2024, the october 2022 credit agreement amendment, which revised certain defined terms and covenants in the 2022 credit agreement, became effective.
our indentures relating to our outstanding senior notes contain certain covenants, including, but not limited to: (i) a limitation on liens on certain assets, (ii) a limitation on certain sale and leaseback transactions, and (iii) restrictions on mergers, consolidations, and the transfer of all or substantially all of our assets to another person.
as of february 29, 2024, we were in compliance with our covenants under our 2022 credit agreement and our indentures, and have met all debt payment obligations.
for further discussion and presentation of our borrowings and available sources of borrowing, refer to note 12.
common stock dividends on april 10, 2024, our board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $1.01 per share of class a stock and $0.91 per share of class 1 stock payable on may 17, 2024, to stockholders of record of each class as of the close of business on may 3, 2024. we expect to return approximately $740 million to stockholders in fiscal 2025 through cash dividends.
we currently expect to continue to pay a regular quarterly cash dividend to stockholders of our common stock in the future, but such payments are subject to approval of our board of directors and are dependent upon our financial condition, results of operations, capital requirements, and other factors, including those set forth under item 1a. "risk factors" of this form 10-k.
share repurchase program our board of directors authorized the repurchase of our publicly traded common stock of up to $2.0 billion under the 2021 authorization and an additional repurchase of up to $2.0 billion under the 2023 authorization.
during fiscal 2024, we repurchased 1,043,366 shares of class a stock pursuant to the 2021 authorization through open market transactions at an aggregate cost of $249.7 million, excluding the impact of federal excise constellation brands, inc. fy 2024 form 10-k       #worthreachingfor i 48

class a stock repurchase authorization   dollar value of shares repurchased                    number of shares repurchased
share repurchases under the 2021 authorization and the 2023 authorization may be accomplished at management's discretion from time to time based on market conditions, our cash and debt position, and other factors as determined by management. shares may be repurchased through open market or privately negotiated transactions. we may fund future share repurchases with cash generated from operations and/or proceeds from borrowings. any repurchased shares will become treasury shares.
we currently expect to continue to repurchase shares in the future, but such repurchases are dependent upon our financial condition, results of operations, capital requirements, and other factors, including those set forth under item 1a. "risk factors" of this form 10-k.
for additional information, refer to note 17.
capital resources we have maintained adequate liquidity to meet working capital requirements, fund capital expenditures, and repay scheduled principal and interest payments on debt. absent deterioration of market conditions, we believe that cash flows from operating and financing activities will provide adequate resources to satisfy our working capital, scheduled principal and interest payments on debt, anticipated dividend payments, periodic share repurchases, and anticipated capital expenditure requirements for both our short-term and long-term capital needs.
the following sets forth information about our outstanding obligations at february 29, 2024. for a detailed discussion of the items noted in the following table, refer to notes 11 through 16.

(2)other long-term liabilities do not include payments for unrecognized tax benefit liabilities of $321.4 million due to the uncertainty of the timing of future cash flows associated with these unrecognized tax benefit liabilities. in addition, other long-term liabilities do not include expected payments for interest and penalties associated with unrecognized tax benefit liabilities as amounts are not material. for a detailed discussion of these items, refer to note 13.
(3)contracts to purchase equipment and services primarily related to the mexico beer projects. for further information about these purchase obligations, refer to "capital expenditures" below.
(4)publicly announced intent to invest (i) $100 million in female-founded or -led companies through our focus on female founders program over a 10-year period concluding in fiscal 2029 and (ii) $100 million to support minority-founded or -owned companies in the beverage alcohol space and related categories through our focus on minority founder venture program over a 10-year period concluding in fiscal 2031. we have invested a total of $111.5 million through fiscal 2024 in female-founded or -led and minority-founded or -owned companies.
capital expenditures during fiscal 2024, we incurred $1,269.1 million for capital expenditures, including $947.9 million for the beer segment primarily for the mexico beer projects. we plan to spend from $1.4 billion to $1.5 billion for capital expenditures in fiscal 2025, including approximately $1.2 billion for the beer segment associated primarily with the mexico beer projects. the remaining planned fiscal 2025 capital expenditures consist of improvements to existing operating facilities and replacements of existing equipment and/or buildings. management reviews the capital expenditure program periodically and modifies it as required to meet current and projected future business needs.
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in accordance with gaap requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements. estimates are based on historical experience, observance of trends in the industry, information provided by our customers, and information available from other outside sources, as appropriate. we review estimates to ensure that they appropriately reflect changes in our business on an ongoing basis. certain policies are particularly important to the portrayal of our financial position and results of operations and require the application of significant judgment by management to determine appropriate assumptions to be used in certain estimates; as a result, they are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty. see note 1 for a description of our significant accounting policies. our critical accounting estimates include:
•equity method investments. we monitor our equity method investments for factors indicating other-than-temporary impairment. we consider several factors when evaluating our investments, including, constellation brands, inc. fy 2024 form 10-k       #worthreachingfor i 50
part ii        item 7. md&amp;a        table of contents but not limited to, (i) the period of time for which the fair value has been less than the carrying value, (ii) operating and financial performance of the investee, (iii) the investee's future business plans and projections, (iv) recent transactions and market valuations of publicly traded companies, where available, (v) discussions with their management, and (vi) our ability and intent to hold the investment until it recovers in value.
canopy equity method investment - monitored for other-than-temporary impairment at each reporting date, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the investment may not be recoverable. following the completion of the canopy transaction in april 2024 and the conversion of our canopy common shares to exchangeable shares, we no longer apply the equity method to our investment in canopy.
we evaluated the canopy equity method investment as of may 31, 2023, and determined there was an other-than-temporary impairment. our conclusion was based on several contributing factors, including: (i) the fair value being less than the carrying value and the uncertainty surrounding canopy's stock price recovering in the near-term, (ii) canopy recorded significant costs in its fourth quarter of fiscal 2023 results designed to align its canadian cannabis operations and resources in response to continued unfavorable market trends, (iii) the substantial doubt about canopy's ability to continue as a going concern, as disclosed by canopy, and (iv) canopy's identification of material misstatements in certain of its previously reported financial results related to sales in its biosteel reporting unit that were accounted for incorrectly, including the recording of a goodwill impairment during its restated second quarter of fiscal 2023. as a result, the canopy equity method investment with a carrying value of $266.2 million was written down to its estimated fair value of $142.7 million, resulting in an impairment of $123.5 million. the estimated fair value was determined based on the closing price of the underlying equity security as of may 31, 2023.
as of august 31, 2022, we evaluated the canopy equity method investment and determined there was an other-than-temporary impairment based on several contributing factors, including: (i) the period of time for which the fair value had been less than the carrying value and the uncertainty surrounding canopy's stock price recovering in the near-term, (ii) canopy recording a significant impairment of goodwill related to its cannabis operations during its first quarter of fiscal 2023, and (iii) the uncertainty of u.s. federal cannabis permissibility. as a result, the canopy equity method investment with a carrying value of $1,695.1 million was written down to its estimated fair value of $634.8 million, resulting in an impairment of $1,060.3 million. the estimated fair value was determined based on the closing price of the underlying equity security as of august 31, 2022.
•goodwill and other intangible assets. goodwill and other intangible assets are classified into three categories: (i) goodwill, (ii) intangible assets with definite lives subject to amortization, and (iii) intangible assets with indefinite lives not subject to amortization. for intangible assets with definite lives, impairment testing is required if conditions exist that indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. for intangible assets with indefinite lives and for goodwill, impairment testing is required at least annually or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that these assets might be impaired. we may perform a qualitative evaluation prior to a quantitative test to determine if an impairment exists. however, if the results of the qualitative evaluation are inconclusive or suggest an impairment may exist, we must proceed to the quantitative test. the qualitative evaluation is an assessment of factors, including market conditions, industry changes, actual results as compared to forecasted results, or the timing of recent acquisitions and/or divestitures. the quantitative test estimates the fair value utilizing assumptions and projections regarding items such as future cash flows, revenues, earnings, and other factors. the factors and assumptions used reflect our estimates and are based on historical trends, projections, and assumptions, including expectations of future economic and competitive conditions that are used in current strategic operating plans; however, these are subject to change as a result of changing market conditions. if these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future, we may be required to recognize an impairment loss for these assets. the recognition of any resulting impairment loss could have a material adverse impact on our financial statements.
part ii        item 7. md&amp;a        table of contents we perform annual impairment tests and re-evaluate the useful lives of other intangible assets with indefinite lives at the annual impairment test measurement date of january 1 or when circumstances arise that indicate a possible impairment or change in useful life might exist.
goodwill - our reporting units with goodwill include the beer segment and the wine and spirits segment. in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024, we performed our annual goodwill impairment analysis using the quantitative assessment. no indication of impairment was noted for either of our reporting units, as the estimated fair value of each of our reporting units with goodwill exceeded their carrying value. based on this analysis, the reporting unit with the lowest amount of estimated fair value in excess of its carrying value was the wine and spirits reporting unit with approximately 11% excess fair value. for fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2022, as a result of our annual goodwill impairment analyses, we concluded that there were no indications of impairment for either of our reporting units.
the most significant assumptions used in the discounted cash flow calculation to determine the estimated fair value of our reporting units in connection with the impairment testing are: (i) the discount rate, (ii) the expected long-term growth rate, and (iii) the annual cash flow projections. as of january 1, 2024, we performed sensitivities in our impairment testing of goodwill by (i) increasing the discount rate 50 basis points, (ii) decreasing the expected long-term growth rate 50 basis points, and (iii) decreasing the annual cash flow projections 100 basis points. none of these sensitivities individually would have resulted in a conclusion that the goodwill of our reporting units was impaired.
other intangible assets - our intangible assets consist primarily of customer relationships and trademarks obtained through business acquisitions. customer relationships are amortized over their estimated useful lives. the trademarks that were determined to have indefinite useful lives are not amortized. using the quantitative assessment, our trademarks are evaluated for impairment by comparing the carrying value of the trademarks to their estimated fair value. the estimated fair value of trademarks is calculated based on an income approach using the relief from royalty method.
in connection with our annual trademark analysis, we performed a quantitative assessment for the imported beer, wine, and spirits trademarks and concluded that there were no indications of impairment for any of these trademark units. in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023, certain continued negative trends within our funky buddha and four corners craft beer portfolios, including ongoing negative cash flows, resulted in our decision to revise our long-term financial forecasts for these portfolios. accordingly, the beer segment's funky buddha and four corners craft beer businesses recognized $9.0 million and $4.0 million impairment losses, respectively, in connection with the write-off of their trademark assets. in fiscal 2024, we completed the craft beer divestitures. refer to notes 2 and 7 for further discussion. there were no indications of impairment for any of our trademark units for fiscal 2022.
the most significant assumptions used in the relief from royalty method to determine the estimated fair value of intangible assets with indefinite lives in connection with impairment testing are: (i) the estimated royalty rate, (ii) the discount rate, (iii) the expected long-term growth rate, and (iv) the annual revenue projections. as of january 1, 2024, we performed sensitivities in our impairment testing of trademarks by (i) decreasing the royalty rate 50 basis points, (ii) increasing the discount rate 50 basis points, (iii) decreasing the expected long-term growth rate 50 basis points, and (iv) decreasing the annual revenue projections 100 basis points. none of these sensitivities individually would have resulted in a conclusion that the trademarks of our reporting units were impaired.
divestitures - when some, but not all of a reporting unit that constitutes a business is disposed of, some of the goodwill of the reporting unit should be allocated to the portion of the reporting unit being disposed of. the allocation of goodwill is based on the relative fair values of the portion of the reporting unit being disposed of and the portion of the reporting unit remaining. this approach requires a determination of the fair value of both the business being disposed and the constellation brands, inc. fy 2024 form 10-k       #worthreachingfor i 52
part ii        item 7. md&amp;a        table of contents businesses retained within the reporting unit.
for fiscal 2023, our estimate of fair value for the wine divestiture was determined based on the expected proceeds from the transaction. the components sold were a part of the wine and spirits segment and were included in that reporting unit through the date of divestiture. goodwill was allocated to the assets based on the relative fair value of the business being sold compared to the relative fair value of the reporting unit. goodwill not allocated to assets associated with the divestiture remained in the wine and spirits reporting unit.

•accounting for income taxes. we estimate our deferred tax assets and liabilities, income taxes payable, provision for income taxes, and unrecognized tax benefit liabilities based upon various factors including, but not limited to, historical pretax operating income, future estimates of pretax operating income, differences between book and tax treatment of various items of income and expense, interpretation of tax laws, and tax planning strategies. we are subject to income taxes in canada, mexico, switzerland, the u.s., and other jurisdictions. we are regularly audited by federal, state, and foreign tax authorities, but a number of years may elapse before an uncertain tax position is audited and finally resolved.
we believe all tax positions are fully supported. we recognize tax assets and liabilities in accordance with the fasb guidance for income tax accounting. accordingly, we recognize a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position when it is more likely than not the position will be sustained upon examination based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the unrecognized tax benefit liabilities. in addition, changes in existing tax laws or rates could significantly change our current estimate of our unrecognized tax benefit liabilities. these differences will be reflected as increases or decreases to income tax expense in the period in which they are determined. changes in current estimates, if significant, could have a material adverse impact on our financial statements.
we recognize our deferred tax assets and liabilities based upon the expected future tax outcome of amounts recognized in our results of operations. if necessary, we recognize a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not they will not be realized. we evaluate our ability to realize the tax benefits associated with deferred tax assets by assessing the adequacy of future expected taxable income, historical and projected operating results, and the availability of prudent and feasible tax planning strategies. the realization of deferred tax assets is evaluated by jurisdiction and the realizability of these assets can vary based on the character of the tax attribute and the carryforward periods specific to each jurisdiction. we believe it is more likely than not the results of future operations will generate sufficient taxable income to realize our existing deferred tax assets, net of valuation allowances. changes in the realizability of our deferred tax assets will be reflected in our effective tax rate in the period in which they are determined.
change in accounting guidance accounting guidance adopted for fiscal 2024 did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. for information regarding recent accounting pronouncements, not yet adopted, see note 1.

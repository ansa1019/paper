our business general the coca-cola company is a total beverage company, and beverage products bearing our trademarks, sold in the united states since 1886, are now sold in more than 200 countries and territories. we own or license and market numerous beverage brands, which we group into the following categories: trademark coca-cola; sparkling flavors; water, sports, coffee and tea; juice, value-added dairy and plant-based beverages; and emerging beverages. we own and market several of the world's largest nonalcoholic sparkling soft drink brands, including coca-cola, sprite, fanta, coca-cola zero sugar and diet coke/coca-cola light.
we make our branded beverage products available to consumers throughout the world through our network of independent bottling partners, distributors, wholesalers and retailers as well as the company's consolidated bottling and distribution operations. beverages bearing trademarks owned by or licensed to us account for 2.2 billion of the estimated 64 billion servings of all beverages consumed worldwide every day.
we believe our success depends on our ability to connect with consumers by providing them with a wide variety of beverage options to meet their desires, needs and lifestyles. our success further depends on the ability of our people to execute effectively, every day.
our company operates in two lines of business: concentrate operations and finished product operations.
our concentrate operations typically generate net operating revenues by selling beverage concentrates, sometimes referred to as "beverage bases," syrups, including fountain syrups, and certain finished beverages to authorized bottling operations (to which we typically refer as our "bottlers" or our "bottling partners"). our bottling partners either combine concentrates with still or sparkling water and sweeteners (depending on the product), or combine syrups with still or sparkling water, to produce finished beverages. the finished beverages are packaged in authorized containers, such as cans and refillable and nonrefillable glass and plastic bottles, bearing our trademarks or trademarks licensed to us and are then sold to retailers directly or, in some cases, through wholesalers or other bottlers. in addition, outside the united states, our bottling partners are typically authorized to manufacture fountain syrups, using our concentrates, which they sell to fountain retailers for use in producing beverages for immediate consumption, or to authorized fountain wholesalers who in turn sell and distribute the fountain syrups to fountain retailers. our concentrate operations are included in our geographic operating segments and our global ventures operating segment.
our finished product operations generate net operating revenues by selling sparkling soft drinks and a variety of other finished beverages to retailers, or to distributors and wholesalers who in turn sell the beverages to retailers. generally, finished product operations generate higher net operating revenues but lower gross profit margins than concentrate operations. these operations consist primarily of our consolidated bottling and distribution operations, which are included in our bottling investments operating segment. in certain markets, the company also operates non-bottling finished product operations in which we sell finished beverages to distributors and wholesalers that are generally not one of the company's bottling partners. these operations are generally included in one of our geographic operating segments or our global ventures operating segment. additionally, we sell directly to consumers through retail stores operated by costa. these sales are included in our global ventures operating segment. in the united states, we manufacture fountain syrups and sell them to fountain retailers, who use the fountain syrups to produce beverages for immediate consumption, or to authorized fountain wholesalers or bottling partners who in turn sell and distribute the fountain syrups to fountain retailers. these fountain syrup sales are included in our north america operating segment.
the following table sets forth the percentage of total net operating revenues attributable to concentrate operations and finished product operations:
the following table sets forth the percentage of total worldwide unit case volume attributable to concentrate operations and finished product operations:
we operate in the highly competitive commercial beverage industry. we face strong competition from numerous other general and specialty beverage companies. we, along with other beverage companies, are affected by a number of factors, including, but not limited to, the cost to manufacture and distribute products, consumer spending, economic conditions, availability and quality of water, consumer preferences, inflation, geopolitical conditions including international conflicts, local and national laws and regulations, foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, fuel prices, weather patterns and health crises.
despite the dynamic world in which we are currently operating, we believe we are well positioned to create value for our company and our stakeholders. in an effort to support our future growth, we are continuing to invest in our portfolio of brands, our strategic capabilities and our people. we are focused on the following strategic priorities: unlocking the potential of our portfolio of strong global, regional and scaled local brands; developing a robust innovation pipeline focusing on scalable initiatives; increasing consumer-centric marketing effectiveness and efficiency; winning in the marketplace with aligned data-driven revenue growth management and execution capabilities; and further embedding sustainability goals into our operations.
challenges and risks being a global enterprise provides unique opportunities for our company. challenges and risks accompany those opportunities. our management has identified certain challenges and risks that demand the attention of our company and the commercial beverage industry. of these, six key strategic business challenges and risks are discussed below.
obesity obesity continues to impact individuals, communities and countries worldwide. there is concern among consumers, public health professionals and governments about the health problems associated with obesity. this concern represents a significant challenge to our industry. we understand that obesity is a complex public health challenge, and we are committed to being a part of the solution.
we recognize the uniqueness of consumers' lifestyles and dietary choices. therefore, we continue to:
•offer an expanded portfolio of beverage choices, including reduced-, low- and no-calorie beverage options;
•provide transparent nutrition information, featuring calories on the front of most of our packages;
•provide our beverages in a range of packaging sizes, including small sizes to enable portion control; and
•market responsibly, including no advertising targeted to children under 13.
the heritage of our company is to lead, and innovation is critical for leadership. as such, we are resolute in continuing to innovate and are committed to partnering with suppliers to invest in research and development of new noncaloric sweeteners and flavors that help us create the best tasting beverages, including options with low or no calories. we want to be a helpful and credible partner in the fight against obesity. across the coca-cola system, we are mobilizing our assets in marketing and in community outreach to increase awareness and spur action.
evolving consumer product preferences we are impacted by shifting consumer demographics and needs, on-the-go lifestyles and consumers who are empowered with more information than ever. as a consequence of these changes, many consumers want more beverage choices, personalization, a focus on sustainability, and transparency related to our products and packaging. we are committed to meeting changing consumer needs and to generating growth through our evolving portfolio of beverage brands and products (including numerous low- and no-calorie products); selectively expanding into other profitable categories of the commercial beverage industry; investing in innovative and sustainable packaging; and including easy-to-access information about our beverages on our website.
evolving competitive landscape and competing in the digital marketplace our company faces strong competition from well-established global companies as well as numerous regional and local companies. additionally, the rapidly evolving digital landscape and growth of e-commerce in many markets has led to dramatic shifts in consumer shopping habits and patterns. consumers are rapidly embracing shopping via mobile device applications, e-commerce retailers and e-commerce websites or platforms, which presents new challenges to maintain the competitiveness and relevancy of our brands. as a result, we must continuously strengthen our capabilities in marketing and innovation to compete in a digital environment and maintain brand loyalty and market share. in addition, we are increasing our investments in e-commerce to support retail and meal delivery services, offering more package sizes that are fit-for-purpose for online sales and shifting more consumer and trade promotions to digital.
product safety and quality we strive to meet the highest standards in both product safety and product quality. we are aware that some consumers have concerns and negative viewpoints regarding certain ingredients used in our products. we only use ingredients that are authorized for use by regulatory authorities in each of the markets in which we operate. the coca-cola system works every day to produce high-quality, safe and refreshing beverages for consumers around the world. we have rigorous product and ingredient safety and quality standards designed to ensure safety and quality in each of our products, and we drive innovation that provides new beverage options to satisfy consumers' evolving needs and preferences.
we work to ensure consistent safety and quality through strong governance and compliance with applicable regulations and standards. we stay current with new regulations, industry best practices and marketplace conditions, and we engage with standard-setting and industry organizations. additionally, we manufacture and distribute our products according to strict policies, requirements and specifications set forth in an integrated quality management program that continually measures all operations within the coca-cola system against the same stringent standards. our quality management program also identifies and mitigates risks and drives improvement. in our quality laboratories, we stringently measure the quality attributes of ingredients as well as samples of finished products collected from the marketplace.
we perform due diligence to ensure that product and ingredient safety and quality standards are maintained in the more than 200 countries and territories where our products are sold. we regularly assess the relevance of our requirements and standards and continually work to improve and refine them across our entire supply chain.
sustainability matters investors and stakeholders increasingly focus on sustainability matters. we acknowledge that we have a role to play in developing and implementing solutions that help build resilience across our business. we report our sustainability progress in the following areas: circular economy of packaging; water stewardship; climate; portfolio; sustainable agriculture; human and workplace rights and diversity, equity and inclusion. our ability to achieve our sustainability goals is dependent on many factors, including, but not limited to, our actions along with the actions of various stakeholders, such as our bottling partners, suppliers, governments, nongovernmental organizations, communities, and other third parties, some of which are outside of our control.
talent acquisition and retention competition for existing and prospective personnel has increased, especially in light of changing worker expectations and talent marketplace variability regarding flexible work models. in addition, the broader labor market is experiencing a shortage of qualified workers, which has further increased competition for qualified employees that we want and may require for our future business needs.
our people and our culture are critical business priorities, and we strive to be a global employer of choice that attracts and retains high-performing talent with the passion, skills and mindsets to drive us on our purpose to refresh the world and make a difference. we are committed to building an equitable and inclusive culture that inspires and supports the growth of our employees, serves our communities and shapes a strong and more sustainable business.
see "item 1a. risk factors" in part i of this report for additional information about risks and uncertainties facing our company.
critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states ("u.s. gaap"), which require management to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. we believe our most critical accounting policies and estimates relate to the following:
•principles of consolidation
•recoverability of equity method investments and indefinite-lived intangible assets
•revenue recognition
•income taxes management has discussed the development, selection and disclosure of critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of our company's board of directors. while our estimates and assumptions are based on our knowledge of current events and on actions we may undertake in the future, actual results may ultimately differ from these estimates and assumptions. for a discussion of the company's significant accounting policies, refer to note 1 of notes to consolidated financial statements.
principles of consolidation our company consolidates all entities that we control by ownership of a majority voting interest. additionally, there are situations in which consolidation is required even though the usual condition of consolidation (i.e., ownership of a majority voting interest) does not apply. generally, this occurs when an entity holds an interest in another business enterprise that was achieved through arrangements that do not involve voting interests, which results in a disproportionate relationship between such entity's voting interests in, and its exposure to the economic risks and potential rewards of, the other business enterprise. this disproportionate relationship results in what is known as a variable interest, and the entity in which another entity holds a variable interest is referred to as a "vie." an enterprise must consolidate a vie if it is determined to be the primary beneficiary of the vie. the primary beneficiary has both (1) the power to direct the activities of the vie that most significantly impact the entity's economic performance and (2) the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits from the vie that could potentially be significant to the vie.
our company holds interests in certain vies, primarily bottling operations, for which we were not determined to be the primary beneficiary. our variable interests in these vies primarily relate to equity investments, profit guarantees or subordinated financial support. refer to note 12 of notes to consolidated financial statements. although these financial arrangements resulted in our holding variable interests in these entities, they did not empower us to direct the activities of the vies that most significantly impact the vies' economic performance. creditors of our vies do not have recourse against the general credit of the company, regardless of whether the vies are accounted for as consolidated entities.
we use the equity method to account for investments in companies if our investment provides us with the ability to exercise significant influence over the operating and financial policies of the investee. our consolidated net income includes our company's proportionate share of the net income or loss of these companies. our judgment regarding the level of influence over each equity method investee includes considering key factors, such as our ownership interest, representation on the board of directors, participation in policy-making decisions, other commercial arrangements and material intercompany transactions.
we eliminate from our financial results all significant intercompany transactions, including the intercompany transactions with consolidated vies and the intercompany portion of transactions with equity method investees.
recoverability of equity method investments and indefinite-lived intangible assets our company faces many uncertainties and risks related to various economic, political and regulatory environments in the countries and territories in which we operate, particularly in developing and emerging markets. refer to the heading "our business - challenges and risks" above and "item 1a. risk factors" in part i of this report as well as the heading "operations review" below for additional information related to our present business environment. as a result, management must make numerous assumptions, which involve a significant amount of judgment, when performing impairment tests of equity method investments and indefinite-lived intangible assets in various regions around the world. the performance of impairment tests involves critical accounting estimates. these estimates require significant management judgment and include inherent uncertainties. factors that management must estimate include, among others, the economic lives of the assets, sales volume, pricing, royalty rates, cost of raw materials, delivery costs, long-term growth rates, discount rates, marketing spending, foreign currency exchange rates, tax rates, capital spending and proceeds from the sale of assets. the variability of these factors depends on a number of conditions, and thus our accounting estimates may change from period to period. these factors are even more difficult to estimate when global financial markets are highly volatile. as these factors are often interdependent and may not change in isolation, we do not believe it is practicable or meaningful to present the impact of changing a single factor. if we had used other assumptions and estimates when impairment tests were performed, impairment charges could have resulted. furthermore, if management uses different assumptions in future periods, or if different conditions exist in future periods, impairment charges could result. the total future impairment charges we may be required to record could be material.
equity method investments equity method investments are reviewed for impairment whenever significant events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the investment might not be recoverable. when such events or changes occur, we evaluate the fair value compared to our cost basis in the investment. the fair values of most of our company's investments in publicly traded companies are readily available based on quoted market prices. for investments in nonpublicly traded companies, management's assessment of fair value is based on various valuation methodologies, including discounted cash flows, estimates of sales proceeds, and appraisals, as appropriate. we consider the assumptions that we believe a market participant would use in evaluating estimated future cash flows when employing the discounted cash flow or estimates of sales proceeds valuation methodologies. the ability to accurately predict future cash flows, especially in emerging and developing markets, may impact the determination of fair value. in the event the fair value of an investment declines below our cost basis, management is required to determine if the decline in fair value is other than temporary. if management determines the decline is other than temporary, an impairment charge is recorded. management's assessment as to the nature of a decline in fair value is based on, among other things, the length of time and the extent to which the market value has been less than our cost basis; the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer; and our intent and ability to retain the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value. refer to note 17 of notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion of impairment charges, if applicable.
indefinite-lived intangible assets impairment tests for indefinite-lived intangible assets must be performed at least annually, or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that an asset may be impaired. our company performs the annual impairment tests as of the first day of our third fiscal quarter. we perform impairment tests using various valuation methodologies, including discounted cash flow models and a market approach, to determine the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset or the reporting unit, as applicable. the ability to accurately predict future cash flows, especially in emerging and developing markets, may impact the determination of fair value. when performing these impairment tests, we estimate the fair values of the assets using management's best assumptions, which we believe are consistent with those a market participant would use. the estimates and assumptions used in these tests are evaluated and updated as appropriate.
for indefinite-lived intangible assets, other than goodwill, if the carrying amount exceeds the fair value, an impairment charge is recognized in an amount equal to that excess. the company has the option to perform a qualitative assessment of indefinite-lived intangible assets, other than goodwill, rather than completing the impairment test. the company must assess whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the intangible asset is less than its carrying amount. if the company concludes that this is the case, it must perform the impairment testing described above.
we perform impairment tests of goodwill at our reporting unit level, which is generally one level below our operating segments. our operating segments are primarily based on geographic responsibility, which is consistent with the way management runs our business. our geographic operating segments are generally subdivided into smaller geographic regions. these geographic regions are our reporting units. our global ventures operating segment includes the results of our costa, innocent and doğadan businesses, as well as fees earned pursuant to distribution coordination agreements between the company and monster, each of which is its own reporting unit. the bottling investments operating segment includes all of our consolidated bottling operations, regardless of geographic location. generally, each consolidated bottling operation within our bottling investments operating segment is its own reporting unit. goodwill is assigned to the reporting unit or units that benefit from the synergies arising from each business combination.
in order to test for goodwill impairment, the company compares the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value, including goodwill. if the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, goodwill is written down for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit's fair value. however, the impairment charge recognized cannot exceed the carrying amount of goodwill. the assumptions used in our impairment testing models are consistent with those we believe a market participant would use. the company has the option to perform a qualitative assessment of goodwill rather than completing the impairment test. the company must assess whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. if the company concludes that this is the case, it must perform the impairment testing discussed above. otherwise, the company does not need to perform any further assessment.
intangible assets acquired in recent transactions are naturally more susceptible to impairment, because they are recorded at fair value based on recent operating plans and macroeconomic conditions present at the time of acquisition. consequently, if operating results and/or macroeconomic conditions deteriorate shortly after an acquisition, it could result in the impairment of the acquired assets. a deterioration of macroeconomic conditions may not only negatively impact the estimated operating cash flows used in our cash flow models but may also negatively impact other assumptions used in our analyses, including, but not limited to, the discount rates. if the discount rates change, our company may recognize an impairment of an intangible asset in spite of realizing actual cash flows that are equal to, or greater than, our previously forecasted amounts. refer to note 2 of notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion of recent acquisitions, if applicable.
in november 2021, the company acquired the remaining 85% ownership interest in, and now owns 100% of bodyarmor, which offers a line of sports performance and hydration beverages. the company allocated $4.2 billion of the purchase price to the bodyarmor trademark. as of december 31, 2023, the fair value of this trademark approximates its carrying value. if the near-term operating results of this trademark do not achieve our current financial projections, or if the macroeconomic conditions change causing the discount rate to increase without an offsetting increase in the operating results, it is likely that we would be required to recognize an impairment charge. management will continue to monitor the fair value of this trademark in future periods.
management is required to make certain critical estimates related to the actuarial assumptions used to determine our pension obligations and our net periodic pension cost or income. we believe the two most critical assumptions are the discount rate and the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets. our actuarial assumptions are reviewed annually, or more frequently to the extent that a settlement or curtailment occurs. changes in these assumptions could have a material impact on the measurement of our pension obligations and our net periodic pension cost or income.
the discount rate assumption used to account for pension plans reflects the rate at which the benefit obligations could be effectively settled. the discount rate for u.s. and certain non-u.s. plans is determined using a matching technique whereby the rates of a yield curve, developed from high-quality debt securities, are applied to projected benefit cash flows to determine the appropriate effective discount rate. for other non-u.s. plans, we base the discount rate assumption on comparable indices within each of the respective countries. the company measures the service cost and interest cost components of net periodic pension cost or income by applying the specific spot rates along the yield curve to the plans' projected cash flows.
the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets is based upon the long-term outlook of our investment strategy as well as our historical returns and volatilities for each asset class. we also review current levels of interest rates and inflation to assess the reasonableness of our expected long-term rate of return on plan assets. our investment objective for our pension assets is to ensure all funded pension plans have sufficient assets to meet their benefit obligations when they become due. as a result, the company periodically revises asset allocations, where appropriate, to seek to improve returns and manage risk.
in 2023, the company's total cost related to pension plans was $120 million, which included $38 million of net periodic pension cost and net charges of $82 million, primarily due to settlements and special termination benefits. in 2024, we expect our net periodic pension cost to be approximately $51 million. the increase in net periodic pension cost is primarily due to the net impact of the decrease in the weighted-average discount rate at december 31, 2023 compared to december 31, 2022.
as of december 31, 2023, the u.s. qualified pension plan represented 63% and 56% of the company's consolidated projected benefit obligation and pension plan assets, respectively. for this plan, we estimate that a 50 basis-point decrease in the discount rate would result in an $8 million increase in our 2024 net periodic pension cost, and we estimate that a 50 basis-point decrease in the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets would result in a $19 million increase in our 2024 net periodic pension cost.
refer to note 14 of notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information about our pension plans and related actuarial assumptions.
revenue recognition revenue is recognized when performance obligations under the terms of the contracts with our customers are satisfied. our performance obligation generally consists of the promise to sell concentrates, syrups or finished products to our bottling partners, wholesalers, distributors or retailers. control of the concentrates, syrups or finished products is transferred upon shipment to, or receipt at, our customers' locations, as determined by the specific terms of the contract. upon transfer of control to the customer, which completes our performance obligation, revenue is recognized. our sales terms generally do not allow for a right of return except for matters related to any manufacturing defects on our part. after completion of our performance obligation, we have an unconditional right to consideration as outlined in the contract. our receivables will generally be collected in less than six months, in accordance with the underlying payment terms. all of our performance obligations under the terms of contracts with our customers have an original duration of one year or less.
in most markets, in an effort to allow our company and our bottling partners to grow together through shared value, aligned financial objectives and the flexibility necessary to meet consumers' always changing needs and tastes, we have implemented an incidence-based concentrate pricing model. under this model, the concentrate price we charge is impacted by a number of factors, including, but not limited to, bottler pricing, the channels in which the finished products produced from the concentrates are sold, and package mix. the amounts associated with the arrangements described above represent variable consideration, an estimate of which is included in the transaction price as a component of net operating revenues in our consolidated statement of income upon completion of our performance obligations. the total revenue recorded, including any variable consideration, cannot exceed the amount for which it is probable that a significant reversal will not occur when uncertainties related to variability are resolved. as a result, we are recognizing revenue based on our faithful depiction of the consideration that we expect to receive. in making our estimates of variable consideration, we consider past results and make significant assumptions related to: (1) customer sales volumes; (2) customer ending inventories; (3) customer selling price per unit; (4) selling channels; and (5) discount rates, rebates and other pricing allowances, as applicable. in gathering data to estimate our variable consideration, we generally calculate our estimates using a portfolio approach at the country and product line level rather than at the individual contract level. the result of making these estimates will impact the line items trade accounts receivable or accounts payable and accrued expenses in our consolidated balance sheet, as applicable. the actual amounts ultimately paid and/or received may be different from our estimates.
income taxes our annual effective tax rate is based on our income and the tax laws in the various jurisdictions in which we operate. significant judgment is required in determining our annual income tax expense and in evaluating our tax positions. we establish reserves to remove some or all of the tax benefit of any of our tax positions at the time we determine that the position becomes uncertain based upon one of the following conditions: (1) the tax position is not "more likely than not" to be sustained; (2) the tax position is "more likely than not" to be sustained, but for a lesser amount; or (3) the tax position is "more likely than not" to be sustained, but not in the financial period in which the tax position was originally taken. for purposes of evaluating whether or not a tax position is uncertain, (1) we presume the tax position will be examined by the relevant taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information; (2) the technical merits of a tax position are derived from authorities such as legislation and statutes, legislative intent, regulations, rulings and caselaw and their applicability to the facts and circumstances of the tax position; and (3) each tax position is evaluated without consideration of the possibility of offset or aggregation with other tax positions taken. we adjust these reserves, including any impact on the related interest and penalties, in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the progress of a tax audit. refer to the heading "operations review - income taxes" below and note 15 of notes to consolidated financial statements.
a number of years may elapse before a particular uncertain tax position is audited and finally resolved. the number of years subject to tax audits or tax assessments varies depending on the tax jurisdiction. the tax benefit that has been previously reserved because of a failure to meet the "more likely than not" recognition threshold would be recognized in income tax expense in the first interim period when the uncertainty disappears under any one of the following conditions: (1) the tax position is "more likely than not" to be sustained; (2) the tax position, amount and/or timing is ultimately settled through negotiation or litigation; or (3) the statute of limitations for the tax position has expired. settlement of any particular issue would usually require the use of cash. refer to note 12 of notes to consolidated financial statements.
tax laws require certain items to be included in the tax return at different times than when these items are reflected in the consolidated financial statements. as a result, the annual effective tax rate reflected in our consolidated financial statements is different from that reported in our tax return (our cash tax rate). some of these differences are permanent, such as expenses that are not deductible in our tax return, and some differences reverse over time, such as depreciation expense. deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on temporary differences between the book basis and tax basis of assets and liabilities. the tax rates used to determine deferred tax assets or liabilities are the enacted tax rates in effect for the year and for the manner in which the differences are expected to reverse. based on the evaluation of all available information, the company recognizes future tax benefits, such as net operating loss carryforwards, to the extent that realizing these benefits is considered more likely than not.
we evaluate our ability to realize the tax benefits associated with deferred tax assets by analyzing our forecasted taxable income using both historical and projected future operating results; the reversal of existing taxable temporary differences; taxable income in prior carryback years (if permitted); and the availability of tax planning strategies. a valuation allowance is required to be established unless management determines that it is more likely than not that the company will ultimately realize the tax benefit associated with a deferred tax asset.
the company does not record a u.s. deferred tax liability for the excess of the book basis over the tax basis of its investments in foreign subsidiaries to the extent that the basis difference meets the indefinite reversal criteria. these criteria are met if the foreign subsidiary has invested, or will invest, the undistributed earnings indefinitely. the decision as to the amount of undistributed earnings that the company intends to maintain in non-u.s. subsidiaries takes into account various items, including, but not limited to, forecasts and budgets of financial needs of cash for working capital, liquidity plans, capital improvement programs, merger and acquisition plans, and planned loans to other non-u.s. subsidiaries. the company also evaluates its expected cash requirements in the united states. other factors that can influence that determination are local restrictions on remittances (for example, in some countries a central bank application and approval are required in order for the company's local country subsidiary to pay a dividend), economic stability and asset risk. refer to note 15 of notes to consolidated financial statements.
operations review our organizational structure consists of the following operating segments: europe, middle east and africa; latin america; north america; asia pacific; global ventures; and bottling investments. our operating structure also includes corporate, which consists of a center and a platform services organization. for additional information regarding our operating segments and corporate, refer to note 20 of notes to consolidated financial statements.
structural changes, acquired brands and newly licensed brands in order to continually improve upon the company's operating performance, from time to time, we engage in buying and selling ownership interests in bottling partners and other manufacturing operations. in addition, we periodically acquire brands and their related operations or enter into license agreements for certain brands to supplement our beverage offerings. these items impact our operating results and certain key metrics used by management in assessing the company's performance.
unit case volume growth is a key metric used by management to evaluate the company's performance because it measures demand for our products at the consumer level. the company's unit case volume represents the number of unit cases (or unit case equivalents) of company beverage products directly or indirectly sold by the company and its bottling partners to customers or consumers and, therefore, reflects unit case volume for both consolidated and unconsolidated bottlers. refer to the heading "beverage volume" below.
concentrate sales volume represents the amount of concentrates, syrups, source waters and powders/minerals (in all instances expressed in unit case equivalents) sold by, or used in finished products sold by, the company to its bottling partners or other customers. for costa non-ready-to-drink beverage products, concentrate sales volume represents the amount of beverages, primarily measured in number of transactions (in all instances expressed in unit case equivalents), sold by the company to customers or consumers. refer to the heading "beverage volume" below.
when we analyze our net operating revenues, we generally consider the following factors: (1) volume growth (concentrate sales volume or unit case volume, as applicable); (2) changes in price, product and geographic mix; (3) foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations; and (4) acquisitions and divestitures (including structural changes as defined below), as applicable. refer to the heading "net operating revenues" below. the company sells concentrates and syrups to both consolidated and unconsolidated bottling partners. the ownership structure of our bottling partners impacts the timing of recognizing concentrate revenue and concentrate sales volume. when we sell concentrates or syrups to our consolidated bottling partners, we do not recognize the concentrate revenue or concentrate sales volume until the bottling partner has sold finished products manufactured from the concentrates or syrups to a third party. when we sell concentrates or syrups to our unconsolidated bottling partners, we recognize the concentrate revenue and concentrate sales volume when the concentrates or syrups are sold to the bottling partner. the subsequent sale of the finished products manufactured from the concentrates or syrups to a third party does not impact the timing of recognizing the concentrate revenue or concentrate sales volume. when we account for an unconsolidated bottling partner as an equity method investment, we eliminate the intercompany profit related to concentrate sales to the extent of our ownership interest, until the equity method investee has sold finished products manufactured from the concentrates or syrups to a third party. we typically report unit case volume when finished products manufactured from the concentrates or syrups are sold to a third party, regardless of our ownership interest in the bottling partner, if any.
we generally refer to acquisitions and divestitures of bottling operations as "structural changes," which are a component of acquisitions and divestitures. typically, structural changes do not impact the company's unit case volume or concentrate sales volume on a consolidated basis or at the geographic operating segment level. we recognize unit case volume for all sales of company beverage products, regardless of our ownership interest in the bottling partner, if any. however, the unit case volume reported by our bottling investments operating segment is generally impacted by structural changes because it only includes the unit case volume of our consolidated bottling operations. refer to note 2 of notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information on the company's acquisitions and divestitures.
"acquired brands" refers to brands acquired during the past 12 months. typically, the company has not reported unit case volume or recognized concentrate sales volume related to acquired brands in periods prior to the closing of a transaction. therefore, the unit case volume and concentrate sales volume related to an acquired brand are incremental to prior year volume. we generally do not consider the acquisition of a brand to be a structural change.
"licensed brands" refers to brands not owned by the company but for which we hold certain rights, generally including, but not limited to, distribution rights, and from which we derive an economic benefit when the related products are sold. typically, the company has not reported unit case volume or recognized concentrate sales volume related to a licensed brand in periods prior to the beginning of the term of a license agreement. therefore, in the year that a license agreement is entered into, the unit case volume and concentrate sales volume related to a licensed brand are incremental to prior year volume. we generally do not consider the licensing of a brand to be a structural change.
in august 2022, the company acquired a controlling interest in a bottling operation in malawi. the impact of this acquisition has been included as a structural change in our analysis of net operating revenues on a consolidated basis as well as for the bottling investments and europe, middle east and africa operating segments. additionally, the company refranchised our bottling operations in cambodia and vietnam in november 2022 and january 2023, respectively, the impact of which has been included as a structural change in our analysis of net operating revenues on a consolidated basis as well as for the bottling investments and asia pacific operating segments.
in may 2023 and july 2022, the company acquired certain brands in asia pacific. the impact of acquiring these brands has been included in acquisitions and divestitures in our analysis of net revenues on a consolidated basis as well as for the asia pacific operating segment.
beverage volume we measure the volume of company beverage products sold in two ways: (1) unit cases of finished products and (2) concentrate sales. as used in this report, "unit case" means a unit of measurement equal to 192 u.s. fluid ounces of finished beverage (24 eight-ounce servings), with the exception of unit case equivalents for costa non-ready-to-drink beverage products, which are primarily measured in number of transactions; and "unit case volume" means the number of unit cases (or unit case equivalents) of company beverage products directly or indirectly sold by the company and its bottling partners to customers or consumers. unit case volume consists primarily of beverage products bearing company trademarks. also included in unit case volume are certain brands licensed to, or distributed by, our company, and brands owned by coca-cola system bottlers for which our company provides marketing support and from the sale of which we derive an economic benefit. in addition, unit case volume includes sales by certain joint ventures in which the company has an ownership interest. we believe unit case volume is one of the indicators of the underlying strength of the coca-cola system because it measures demand for our products at the consumer level. the unit case volume numbers used in this report are derived based on estimates received by the company from its bottling partners and distributors. concentrate sales volume represents the amount of concentrates, syrups, source waters and powders/minerals (in all instances expressed in unit case equivalents) sold by, or used in finished beverages sold by, the company to its bottling partners or other customers. for costa non-ready-to-drink beverage products, concentrate sales volume represents the amount of beverages, primarily measured in number of transactions (in all instances expressed in unit case equivalents), sold by the company to customers or consumers. unit case volume and concentrate sales volume growth rates are not necessarily equal during any given period. factors such as seasonality, bottlers' inventory practices, supply point changes, timing of price increases, new product introductions and changes in product mix can create differences between unit case volume and concentrate sales volume growth rates. in addition to these items, the impact of unit case volume from certain joint ventures in which the company has an ownership interest, but to which the company does not sell concentrates, syrups, source waters or powders/minerals, may give rise to differences between unit case volume and concentrate sales volume growth rates.
information about our volume growth worldwide and by operating segment is as follows:
percent change 2023 versus 2022
bottling investments                         (1)                       3                     n/a bottling investments operating segment data reflects unit case volume growth for consolidated bottlers only.
geographic and global ventures operating segment data reflect unit case volume growth for all bottlers, both consolidated and unconsolidated, and distributors in the applicable geographic areas. global ventures operating segment data also reflects unit case volume growth for costa retail stores.
after considering the impact of structural changes, unit case volume for bottling investments grew 6%.
unit case volume the coca-cola system sold 33.3 billion and 32.7 billion unit cases of our products in 2023 and 2022, respectively.
unit case volume in europe, middle east and africa decreased 2%, which included a 3% decline in sparkling flavors, a 14% decline in juice, value-added dairy and plant-based beverages, a 1% decline in trademark coca-cola, and a 2% decline in water, sports, coffee and tea. the operating segment reported declines in unit case volume of 6% in the europe operating unit and 1% in the eurasia and middle east operating unit, partially offset by growth in unit case volume of 3% in the africa operating unit. the decline in unit case volume in europe, middle east and africa was primarily due to the suspension of the company's business in russia in march 2022.
in latin america, unit case volume increased 5%, which included 5% growth in trademark coca-cola, 9% growth in water, sports, coffee and tea, 2% growth in sparkling flavors and 3% growth in juice, value-added dairy and plant-based beverages. the operating segment's volume performance included 5% growth in both mexico and brazil.
unit case volume in north america decreased 1%, which included a 5% decline in water, sports, coffee and tea, partially offset by 3% growth in juice, value-added dairy and plant-based beverages and 1% growth in sparkling flavors. trademark coca-cola performance was even.
in asia pacific, unit case volume increased 3%, which included 4% growth in both sparkling flavors and trademark coca-cola, 10% growth in juice, value-added dairy and plant-based beverages, and 1% growth in water, sports, coffee and tea. the operating segment reported growth in unit case volume of 11% in the india and southwest asia operating unit, 2% in the greater china and mongolia operating unit, and 1% in both the asean and south pacific and the japan and south korea operating units.
unit case volume for global ventures increased 4%, driven by growth in energy drinks, partially offset by a 1% decline in both water, sports, coffee and tea as well as juice, value-added dairy and plant-based beverages.
unit case volume for bottling investments decreased 1%, which primarily reflects the impact of refranchising our bottling operations in vietnam and cambodia, partially offset by growth in india and south africa.
concentrate sales volume in 2023, worldwide concentrate sales volume and unit case volume both grew 2% compared to 2022. the differences between concentrate sales volume and unit case volume growth rates for the operating segments were primarily due to the timing of concentrate shipments and the impact of unit case volume from certain joint ventures in which the company has an ownership interest, but to which the company does not sell concentrates, syrups, source waters or powders/minerals.
net operating revenues net operating revenues were $45,754 million in 2023, compared to $43,004 million in 2022, an increase of $2,750 million, or 6%.
the following table illustrates, on a percentage basis, the estimated impact of the factors resulting in the increase (decrease) in net operating revenues on a consolidated basis and for each of our operating segments:
percent change 2023 versus 2022
volume       price, product &amp; geographic mix        foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations        acquisitions &amp; divestitures   total consolidated                                 2    %                          10             %                               (4)                %                       (1)   %                      %
represents the percent change in net operating revenues attributable to the increase (decrease) in concentrate sales volume for our geographic operating segments and our global ventures operating segment (expressed in unit case equivalents) after considering the impact of acquisitions and divestitures, if any. for our bottling investments operating segment, this represents the percent change in net operating revenues attributable to the increase (decrease) in unit case volume after considering the impact of structural changes, if any. our bottling investments operating segment data reflects unit case volume growth for consolidated bottlers only after considering the impact of structural changes, if any. refer to the heading "beverage volume" above.
includes structural changes, if any. refer to the heading "structural changes, acquired brands and newly licensed brands" above.
refer to the heading "beverage volume" above for additional information related to changes in our unit case and concentrate sales volumes.
"price, product and geographic mix" refers to the change in net operating revenues caused by factors such as price changes, the mix of products and packages sold, and the mix of channels and geographic territories where the sales occurred. the impact of price, product and geographic mix is calculated by subtracting the change in net operating revenues resulting from volume increases or decreases, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, and acquisitions and divestitures from the total change in net operating revenues. management believes that providing investors with price, product and geographic mix enhances their understanding about the combined impact that the following items had on the company's net operating revenues: (1) pricing actions taken by the company and, where applicable, our bottling partners; (2) changes in the mix of products and packages sold; (3) changes in the mix of channels where products were sold; and (4) changes in the mix of geographic territories where products were sold. management uses this measure in making financial, operating and planning decisions and in evaluating the company's performance.
price, product and geographic mix had a 10% favorable impact on our consolidated net operating revenues. price, product and geographic mix was impacted by a variety of factors and events, including, but not limited to, the following:
•europe, middle east and africa - favorable pricing initiatives, including inflationary pricing in türkiye and zimbabwe, partially offset by unfavorable geographic mix;
•latin america - favorable pricing initiatives, including inflationary pricing in argentina, along with favorable channel and product mix, partially offset by increased funding for promotional and marketing support;
•north america - favorable pricing initiatives and favorable channel, package and product mix;
•asia pacific - favorable pricing initiatives, partially offset by unfavorable geographic mix and increased funding for promotional and marketing support;
•global ventures - favorable pricing initiatives and favorable channel mix, primarily due to the favorable performance of costa in the united kingdom, offset by unfavorable product mix and the impact of no longer receiving covid-related incentives in the current year; and
•bottling investments - favorable pricing initiatives across most markets, partially offset by unfavorable geographic mix.
the favorable pricing initiatives for the year ended december 31, 2023 in all operating segments included carryover pricing increases from the prior year.
fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates decreased our consolidated net operating revenues by 4%. this unfavorable impact was primarily due to a stronger u.s. dollar compared to certain foreign currencies, including the argentine peso, zimbabwean dollar, south african rand, nigerian naira, turkish lira, japanese yen, indian rupee and chinese yuan, which had an unfavorable impact on our latin america; europe, middle east and africa; asia pacific; and bottling investments operating segments. the unfavorable impact of a stronger u.s. dollar compared to the currencies listed above was partially offset by the impact of a weaker u.s. dollar compared to certain other foreign currencies, including the mexican peso, which had a favorable impact on our latin america operating segment. refer to the heading "liquidity, capital resources and financial position - foreign exchange" below for additional information about the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations.
"acquisitions and divestitures" generally refers to acquisitions and divestitures of brands or businesses, some of which the company considers to be structural changes. the impact of acquisitions and divestitures is the difference between the change in net operating revenues and the change in what our net operating revenues would have been if we removed the net operating revenues associated with an acquisition or a divestiture from either the current year or the prior year, as applicable. management believes that quantifying the impact that acquisitions and divestitures had on the company's net operating revenues provides investors with useful information to enhance their understanding of the company's net operating revenue performance by improving their ability to compare our year-to-year results. management considers the impact of acquisitions and divestitures when evaluating the company's performance. refer to the heading "structural changes, acquired brands and newly licensed brands" above for additional information related to acquisitions and divestitures.
net operating revenue growth rates are impacted by sales volume; price, product and geographic mix; foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations; and acquisitions and divestitures. the size and timing of acquisitions and divestitures are not consistent from period to period. based on current spot rates and our hedging coverage in place, we expect foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations will have an unfavorable impact on our full year 2024 net operating revenues.
information about our net operating revenues by operating segment and corporate as a percentage of company net operating revenues is as follows:
the percentage contribution of each operating segment fluctuates over time due to net operating revenues in some operating segments growing at a faster rate compared to other operating segments. in addition, foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations impact the percentage contribution of each operating segment. for additional information about the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, refer to the heading "liquidity, capital resources and financial position - foreign exchange" below.
gross profit margin gross profit margin is a ratio calculated by dividing gross profit by net operating revenues. management believes gross profit margin provides investors with useful information related to the profitability of our business prior to considering all of the selling, general and administrative expenses and other operating charges incurred. management uses this measure in making financial, operating and planning decisions and in evaluating the company's performance.
our gross profit margin increased to 59.5% in 2023 from 58.1% in 2022. this increase was primarily due to the impact of favorable pricing initiatives, favorable channel and package mix, and structural changes. the impact of these items was partially offset by the unfavorable impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and increased commodity costs.
selling, general and administrative expenses the following table sets forth the components of selling, general and administrative expenses (in millions):
other operating expenses                               6,109           5,438
selling, general and administrative expenses increased $1,092 million, or 8%, in 2023. this increase was primarily due to higher advertising and other operating expenses, partially offset by decreases in selling and distribution expenses and stock-based compensation expense. the increase in other operating expenses was primarily due to higher other marketing expenses and increased charitable donations, as well as higher annual incentive expense and other employee benefit costs. the decrease in selling and distribution expenses was primarily a result of the refranchising of our bottling operations in vietnam and cambodia. the decrease in stock-based compensation expense was primarily due to the cumulative expense that was recorded in 2022 resulting from the impact a more favorable financial outlook had on the outstanding nonvested performance share units. in 2023, foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations decreased selling, general and administrative expenses by 3%.
as of december 31, 2023, we had $267 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to nonvested stock-based compensation awards granted under our plans, which we expect to recognize over a weighted-average period of 1.7 years as stock-based compensation expense. this expected cost does not include the impact of any future stock-based compensation awards. refer to note 13 of notes to consolidated financial statements.
other operating charges other operating charges incurred by operating segment and corporate were as follows (in millions):
in 2023, the company recorded other operating charges of $1,951 million. these charges consisted of $1,702 million related to the remeasurement of our contingent consideration liability to fair value in conjunction with our acquisition of fairlife in 2020, $164 million related to the company's productivity and reinvestment program and $35 million related to the discontinuation of certain manufacturing operations in asia pacific. in addition, other operating charges included $27 million related to the restructuring of our north america operating unit, $15 million for the amortization of noncompete agreements related to the bodyarmor acquisition in 2021 and $8 million related to tax litigation expense.
in 2022, the company recorded other operating charges of $1,215 million. these charges primarily consisted of $1,000 million related to the remeasurement of our contingent consideration liability to fair value in conjunction with the fairlife acquisition, $85 million related to the company's productivity and reinvestment program and $57 million related to the impairment of a trademark in asia pacific. in addition, other operating charges included $38 million related to the restructuring of our north america operating unit and $38 million related to the bodyarmor acquisition, which included various transition and transaction costs, employee retention costs and the amortization of noncompete agreements, net of the reimbursement of distributor termination fees recorded in 2021. these charges were partially offset by a net gain of $6 million due to revisions of management's estimates related to the company's strategic realignment initiatives.
refer to note 2 of notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information on the bodyarmor acquisition. refer to note 12 of notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information related to the tax litigation. refer to note 17 of notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information on the fairlife contingent consideration and the impairment charge. refer to note 19 of notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information on the company's restructuring initiatives. refer to note 20 of notes to consolidated financial statements for the impact these charges had on our operating segments and corporate.
operating income and operating margin information about our operating income contribution by operating segment and corporate on a percentage basis is as follows:
operating margin is a ratio calculated by dividing operating income by net operating revenues. management believes operating margin provides investors with useful information related to the profitability of our business after considering selling, general and administrative expenses and other operating charges. management uses this measure in making financial, operating and planning decisions and in evaluating the company's performance.
information about our operating margin on a consolidated basis and by operating segment and corporate is as follows:
operating income was $11,311 million in 2023, compared to $10,909 million in 2022, an increase of $402 million, or 4%. the increase in operating income was primarily driven by concentrate sales volume growth of 2% and favorable pricing initiatives. these items were partially offset by higher commodity costs; higher selling, general and administrative expenses; higher other operating charges; and an unfavorable foreign currency exchange rate impact.
the decrease in our operating margin on a consolidated basis was primarily due to higher commodity costs, increased marketing spending, higher other operating charges and the unfavorable impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. the impact of these items was partially offset by favorable pricing initiatives.
in 2023, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates unfavorably impacted consolidated operating income by 8% due to a stronger u.s. dollar compared to certain foreign currencies, including the argentine peso, zimbabwean dollar, turkish lira, euro, south african rand, and japanese yen, which had an unfavorable impact on our latin america; europe, middle east and africa; bottling investments; and asia pacific operating segments. the unfavorable impact of a stronger u.s. dollar compared to the currencies listed above was partially offset by the impact of a weaker u.s. dollar compared to certain other foreign currencies, including the mexican peso, which had a favorable impact on our latin america operating segment. refer to the heading "liquidity, capital resources and financial position - foreign exchange" below.
the company's europe, middle east and africa operating segment reported operating income of $4,202 million and $3,958 million for the years ended december 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. the increase in operating income was primarily driven by favorable pricing initiatives, partially offset by higher commodity costs, increased marketing spending, higher operating expenses and an unfavorable foreign currency exchange rate impact of 14%.
latin america reported operating income of $3,432 million and $2,870 million for the years ended december 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. the increase in operating income was primarily driven by concentrate sales volume growth of 6% and favorable pricing initiatives, partially offset by higher commodity costs, increased marketing spending, higher operating expenses and an unfavorable foreign currency exchange rate impact of 5%.
operating income for north america for the years ended december 31, 2023 and 2022 was $4,435 million and $3,742 million, respectively. the increase in operating income was primarily driven by favorable pricing initiatives, partially offset by a decline in concentrate sales volume of 1%, higher commodity costs, increased marketing spending, higher operating expenses and higher other operating charges.
asia pacific's operating income for the years ended december 31, 2023 and 2022 was $2,040 million and $2,303 million, respectively. the decrease in operating income was primarily driven by higher commodity costs, increased marketing spending and an unfavorable foreign currency exchange rate impact of 7%, partially offset by favorable pricing initiatives, lower other operating charges and the impact of acquired brands.
global ventures' operating income for the years ended december 31, 2023 and 2022 was $329 million and $185 million, respectively. the increase in operating income was primarily driven by concentrate sales volume growth of 5%, favorable pricing initiatives, decreased marketing spending and a favorable foreign currency exchange rate impact of 3%, partially offset by higher operating expenses and the impact of no longer receiving covid-related incentives in the current year.
bottling investments' operating income for the years ended december 31, 2023 and 2022 was $578 million and $487 million, respectively. the increase in operating income was primarily driven by unit case volume growth of 6% and favorable pricing initiatives, partially offset by higher commodity costs, higher operating expenses, an unfavorable foreign currency exchange rate impact of 7% and the refranchising of our bottling operations in vietnam and cambodia.
corporate's operating loss for the years ended december 31, 2023 and 2022 was $3,705 million and $2,636 million, respectively. operating loss in 2023 increased primarily as a result of higher other operating charges due to the remeasurement of our contingent consideration liability to fair value in conjunction with the fairlife acquisition, higher operating expenses and increased marketing spending. refer to note 17 of notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information on the fairlife contingent consideration.
interest income interest income was $907 million in 2023, compared to $449 million in 2022, an increase of $458 million, or 102%. this increase was primarily driven by higher returns on our corporate and certain international investments and higher average investment balances.
interest expense interest expense was $1,527 million in 2023, compared to $882 million in 2022, an increase of $645 million, or 73%. this increase was primarily due to the impact of higher interest rates on short-term borrowings and derivative instruments compared to the prior year. refer to note 11 of notes to consolidated financial statements.
equity income (loss) - net equity income (loss) - net represents our company's proportionate share of net income or loss from each of our equity method investees. in 2023, equity income was $1,691 million, compared to equity income of $1,472 million in 2022, an increase of $219 million, or 15%. the increase reflects, among other items, the impact of more favorable operating results reported by some of our equity method investees in the current year and a favorable foreign currency exchange rate impact. these favorable impacts were partially offset by a $125 million increase in net charges resulting from the company's proportionate share of significant operating and nonoperating items recorded by certain of our equity method investees.
other income (loss) - net in 2023, other income (loss) - net was income of $570 million. the company recorded a net gain of $439 million related to the refranchising of our bottling operations in vietnam, a net gain of $289 million related to realized and unrealized gains and losses on equity securities and trading debt securities as well as realized gains and losses on available-for-sale debt securities, and dividend income of $208 million. other income (loss) - net also included a net gain of $94 million related to the sale of our ownership interests in our equity method investees in pakistan and indonesia and net income of $51 million related to the non-service cost components of net periodic benefit cost. the company also recorded net foreign currency exchange losses of $312 million, $83 million of costs related to our trade accounts receivable factoring program and $67 million due to pension and other postretirement benefit plan settlement charges. additionally, the company recorded an other-than-temporary impairment charge of $39 million related to an equity method investee in latin america and charges of $32 million related to the restructuring of our manufacturing operations in the united states.

income taxes our effective tax rate reflects the tax benefits of having significant operations outside the united states, which are generally taxed at rates lower than the statutory u.s. federal tax rate. as a result of employment actions and capital investments made by the company, certain tax jurisdictions provide income tax incentive grants, including brazil, costa rica, singapore and eswatini. the terms of these grants expire from 2025 to 2036. we anticipate that we will be able to extend or renew the grants in these locations. tax incentive grants favorably impacted our income tax expense by $332 million and $406 million for the years ended december 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. in addition, our effective tax rate reflects the benefits of having significant earnings generated in investments accounted for under the equity method.
a reconciliation of the statutory u.s. federal tax rate and our effective tax rate is as follows:
state and local income taxes - net of federal benefit                                                  1.1           1.4
excess tax benefits on stock-based compensation                                                      (0.3)         (0.7)
on november 18, 2020, the tax court issued the opinion regarding the company's 2015 litigation with the irs involving transfer pricing tax adjustments in which the court predominantly sided with the irs. on november 8, 2023, the tax court issued a supplemental opinion, siding with the irs in concluding both that the blocked-income regulations apply to the company's operations and that the tax court opinion in 3m co. & subs. v. commissioner (february 9, 2023) controlled as to the validity of those regulations. the company strongly disagrees with the opinions and intends to vigorously defend its position. refer to note 12 of notes to consolidated financial statements.
as of december 31, 2023, the gross amount of unrecognized tax benefits was $929 million. if the company were to prevail on all uncertain tax positions, the net effect would be a benefit of $632 million, exclusive of any benefits related to interest and penalties. the remaining $297 million primarily represents tax benefits that would be received in different tax jurisdictions in the event the company did not prevail on all uncertain tax positions.
a reconciliation of the changes in the gross amount of unrecognized tax benefits is as follows (in millions):
balance of unrecognized tax benefits at beginning of year               $926          $906
decrease due to lapse of the applicable statute of limitations           (2)             -
effect of foreign currency translation                                   (4)          (22)
balance of unrecognized tax benefits at end of year                     $929          $926
the company recognizes interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in the line item income taxes in our consolidated statement of income. the company had $544 million and $496 million in interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits accrued as of december 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. of these amounts, expense of $48 million and $43 million was recognized in 2023 and 2022, respectively. if the company were to prevail on all uncertain tax positions, the reversal of this accrual would be a benefit to the company's effective tax rate.
based on current tax laws, the company's effective tax rate in 2024 is expected to be approximately 19.2% before considering the potential impact of any significant operating and nonoperating items that may affect our effective tax rate. this rate does not include the impact of the ongoing tax litigation with the irs, if the company were not to prevail.
many jurisdictions have enacted legislation and adopted policies resulting from the oecd's anti-base erosion and profit shifting project. the oecd is currently coordinating a two pillared project on behalf of the g20 and other participating countries which would grant additional taxing rights over profits earned by multinational enterprises to the countries in which their products are sold and services rendered. pillar one would allow countries to reallocate a portion of profits earned by multinational businesses with an annual global revenue exceeding €20 billion and a profit margin of over 10% to applicable market jurisdictions. while the oecd issued draft language for the international implementation of pillar one in october 2023, both the substantive rules and implementation process remain under discussion at the oecd so the timetable for any implementation remains uncertain.
in december 2021, the oecd issued pillar two model rules which would establish a global per-country minimum tax of 15%, and the european union has approved a directive requiring member states to incorporate similar provisions into their respective domestic laws. the directive requires the rules to initially become effective for fiscal years starting on or after december 31, 2023. while it is uncertain whether the united states will enact legislation to adopt pillar two, numerous countries have enacted legislation, or have indicated their intent to adopt legislation, to implement certain aspects of pillar two effective january 1, 2024, with general implementation of the remaining global minimum tax rules by january 1, 2025. the oecd and implementing countries are expected to continue to make further revisions to their legislation and release additional guidance. the company will continue to monitor developments to determine any potential impact in the countries in which we operate.
liquidity, capital resources and financial position we believe our ability to generate cash flows from operating activities is one of the fundamental strengths of our business. refer to the heading "cash flows from operating activities" below. the company does not typically raise capital through the issuance of stock. instead, we use debt financing to lower our overall cost of capital and increase our return on shareowners' equity. refer to the heading "cash flows from financing activities" below. we have a history of borrowing funds both domestically and internationally at reasonable interest rates, and we expect to be able to continue to borrow funds at reasonable rates over the long term. our debt financing also includes the use of a commercial paper program. we currently have the ability to borrow funds in this market at levels that are consistent with our debt financing strategy, and we expect to continue to be able to do so in the future. the company regularly reviews its optimal mix of short-term and long-term debt.
the company's cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments and marketable securities totaled $13.7 billion as of december 31, 2023. in addition to these funds, our commercial paper program and our ability to issue long-term debt, we had $4.6 billion in unused backup lines of credit for general corporate purposes as of december 31, 2023. these backup lines of credit expire at various times through 2028.
our current payment terms with the majority of our suppliers are 120 days. two global financial institutions offer a voluntary supply chain finance program which enables our suppliers, at their sole discretion, to sell their receivables from the company to these financial institutions on a non-recourse basis at a rate that leverages our credit rating and thus may be more beneficial to them. we do not believe there is a risk that our payment terms will be shortened in the near future. refer to note 9 of notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information.
the company has a trade accounts receivable factoring program in certain countries. under this program, we can elect to sell trade accounts receivables to unaffiliated financial institutions at a discount. in these factoring arrangements, for ease of administration, the company collects customer payments related to the factored receivables and remits those payments to the financial institutions. the company sold $17,704 million and $10,709 million of trade accounts receivables under this program during the years ended december 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. the costs of factoring such receivables were $83 million and $27 million for the years ended december 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. the cash received from the financial institutions is classified within the operating activities section in our consolidated statement of cash flows.
our current capital allocation priorities are as follows: investing wisely to support our business operations, continuing to grow our dividend payment, enhancing our beverage portfolio and capabilities through consumer-centric acquisitions, and using excess cash to repurchase shares over time. we currently expect 2024 capital expenditures to be approximately $2.2 billion. during 2024, we also expect to repurchase shares to offset dilution resulting from employee stock-based compensation plans.
we are currently in litigation with the irs for tax years 2007 through 2009. on november 18, 2020, the tax court issued the opinion in which it predominantly sided with the irs. on november 8, 2023, the tax court issued a supplemental opinion, siding with the irs in concluding both that the blocked-income regulations apply to the company's operations and that the tax court opinion in 3m co. & subs. v. commissioner (february 9, 2023) controlled as to the validity of those regulations. the company strongly disagrees with the irs' positions and the portions of the opinions affirming such positions and intends to vigorously defend our positions utilizing every available avenue of appeal. while the company believes that it is more likely than not that we will ultimately prevail in this litigation upon appeal, it is possible that all, or some portion of, the adjustments proposed by the irs and sustained by the tax court could ultimately be upheld. in the event that all of the adjustments proposed by the irs were to be ultimately upheld for tax years 2007 through 2009 and the irs, with the consent of the federal courts, were to decide to apply the tax court methodology to the subsequent years up to and including 2023, the company currently estimates that the potential aggregate incremental tax and interest liability could be approximately $16 billion as of december 31, 2023. additional income tax and interest would continue to accrue until the time any such potential liability, or portion thereof, were to be paid. the company and the irs are now in the process of agreeing on the tax impacts of the opinions. subsequent to the completion of this process, the tax court will render a decision in the case. the company will have 90 days thereafter to file a notice of appeal to the u.s. court of appeals for the eleventh circuit. the irs can then seek to collect, and the company expects to pay, any additional tax related to the 2007 through 2009 tax years reflected in the tax court decision (and interest thereon). the company currently estimates that the payment to be made at that time related to the 2007 through 2009 tax years, which is included in the above estimate of the potential aggregate incremental tax and interest liability, would be approximately $5.8 billion (including interest accrued through december 31, 2023), plus any additional interest accrued through the time of payment. some or all of this amount, plus accrued interest, would be refunded if the company were to prevail on appeal. refer to note 12 of notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information on the tax litigation.
while we believe it is more likely than not that we will prevail in the tax litigation discussed above, we are confident that, between our ability to generate cash flows from operating activities and our ability to borrow funds at reasonable interest rates, we can manage the range of possible outcomes in the final resolution of the matter.
based on all of the aforementioned factors, the company believes its current liquidity position is strong and will continue to be sufficient to fund our operating activities and cash commitments for investing and financing activities for the foreseeable future.
cash flows from operating activities net cash provided by operating activities for the years ended december 31, 2023 and 2022 was $11,599 million and $11,018 million, respectively, an increase of $581 million, or 5%. this increase was primarily driven by strong operating results and lower marketing payments resulting from year-end accruals. these items were partially offset by an unfavorable impact due to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, higher interest and tax payments in the current year, the unfavorable impact from the extension of certain vendor payment terms in the prior year, payments resulting from the buildup of inventory in the prior year to manage potential supply chain disruptions, payments related to our restructuring initiatives and $167 million of the $275 million milestone payment for fairlife. refer to note 17 of notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information on the milestone payment for fairlife.
purchases of investments and proceeds from disposals of investments in 2023, purchases of investments were $6,698 million and proceeds from disposals of investments were $4,354 million, resulting in a net cash outflow of $2,344 million. in 2022, purchases of investments were $3,751 million and proceeds from disposals of investments were $4,771 million, resulting in a net cash inflow of $1,020 million. this activity primarily represents the purchases of, and proceeds from the disposals of, investments in marketable securities and short-term investments that were made as part of the company's overall cash management strategy. also included in this activity are purchases of, and proceeds from the disposals of, investments held by our captive insurance companies.
acquisitions of businesses, equity method investments and nonmarketable securities in 2023 and 2022, the company's acquisitions of businesses, equity method investments and nonmarketable securities totaled $62 million and $73 million, respectively.

loans, notes payable and long-term debt our company maintains debt levels we consider prudent based on our cash flows, interest coverage ratio and percentage of debt to capital. we use debt financing to lower our overall cost of capital, which increases our return on shareowners' equity. this exposes us to adverse changes in interest rates. our interest expense may also be affected by our credit ratings.
as of december 31, 2023, our long-term debt was rated "a+" by standard & poor's and "a1" by moody's. our commercial paper program was rated "a-1" by standard & poor's and "p-1" by moody's. in assessing our credit strength, both rating agencies consider our capital structure (including the amount and maturity dates of our debt) and financial policies as well as the consolidated balance sheet and other financial information of the company. in addition, certain rating agencies also consider the financial information of certain bottlers, including ccep, coca-cola consolidated, inc., coca-cola femsa and coca-cola hellenic. while the company has no legal obligation for the debt of these bottlers, the rating agencies believe the strategic importance of the bottlers to the company's business model provides the company with an incentive to keep these bottlers viable. it is our expectation that these rating agencies will continue using this methodology. if our credit ratings were to be downgraded as a result of changes in our capital structure, our major bottlers' financial performance, changes in the credit rating agencies' methodology in assessing our credit strength, or for any other reason, our cost of borrowing could increase. additionally, if certain bottlers' credit ratings were to decline, the company's equity income could be reduced as a result of the potential increase in interest expense for those bottlers.
we monitor our financial ratios and, as indicated above, the rating agencies consider these ratios in assessing our credit ratings. each rating agency employs a different aggregation methodology and has different thresholds for the various financial ratios. these thresholds are not necessarily permanent, nor are they always fully disclosed to our company.
our global presence and strong capital position give us access to key financial markets around the world, enabling us to borrow funds at a low effective cost. this posture, coupled with active management of our mix of short-term and long-term debt as well as our mix of fixed-rate and variable-rate debt, results in a lower overall cost of borrowing. our debt management policies, in conjunction with our share repurchase program and investment activity, can result in current liabilities exceeding current assets.
during 2023, the company had issuances of debt of $6,891 million, which included $6,436 million of issuances of commercial paper and short-term debt with maturities greater than 90 days, $222 million of net issuances of commercial paper and short-term debt with maturities of 90 days or less, and long-term debt issuances of $233 million, net of related discounts and issuance costs.

during 2022, the total cash outflow for treasury stock purchases was $1,418 million. the company repurchased 21.3 million shares of common stock under the share repurchase plans authorized by our board of directors. these shares were repurchased at an average price per share of $62.67, for a total cost of $1,336 million. the net impact of the company's issuances of stock and treasury stock purchases during 2022 resulted in a net cash outflow of $581 million.
since the inception of our share repurchase program in 1984, we have repurchased 3.6 billion shares of our common stock at an average price per share of $17.96. in addition to shares repurchased under the share repurchase plans authorized by our board of directors, the company's treasury stock activity also includes shares surrendered to the company to pay the exercise price and/or to satisfy tax withholding obligations in connection with so-called stock swap exercises of employee stock options and/or the vesting of restricted stock issued to employees.

lines of credit and other short-term borrowings             348             348               -                 -                 -
current maturities of long-term debt                      1,960           1,960               -                 -                 -
long-term debt, net of current maturities                36,694               -           2,936             7,579            26,179
marketing obligations                                     4,076           2,563             756               403               354
refer to note 11 of notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding loans and notes payable. upon payment of outstanding commercial paper, we typically issue new commercial paper. lines of credit and other short-term borrowings are expected to fluctuate depending upon current liquidity needs, especially at international subsidiaries.
refer to note 11 of notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding long-term debt. we will consider several alternatives for settling this long-term debt, including the use of cash flows from operating activities, issuance of commercial paper or issuance of other long-term debt. the table above shows expected cash payments to be made by the company and excludes the noncash portion of debt, including any fair value adjustments, unamortized discounts and premiums.
we calculated estimated interest payments for our long-term debt based on the applicable rates and payment dates. for our variable-rate debt, we have assumed the december 31, 2023 rate for all periods presented. we expect to fund such interest payments with cash flows from operating activities and/or short-term borrowings.
refer to note 15 of notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding income taxes. accrued income taxes include $2,029 million related to the one-time transition tax required by the tax reform act. liabilities of $1,476 million for unrecognized tax benefits plus accrued interest and penalties are not included in the total above. currently, the settlement period for the unrecognized tax benefits cannot be determined. in addition, any payments related to unrecognized tax benefits may be partially or fully offset by reductions in payments in other jurisdictions.
purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms. these agreements include long-term contractual obligations, open purchase orders, accounts payable and certain accrued liabilities. we expect to fund these purchase obligations with cash flows from operating activities.
we expect to fund these marketing obligations with cash flows from operating activities.
primarily represents our contingent consideration liability related to our acquisition of fairlife. refer to note 17 of notes to consolidated financial statements.
represents liabilities and contractual obligations that were classified as held for sale related to the company's bottling operations in the philippines and bangladesh and certain bottling operations in india. refer to note 2 of notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information.
the total accrued liability for pension and other postretirement benefit plans recognized as of december 31, 2023 was $948 million. refer to note 14 of notes to consolidated financial statements. this amount is impacted by, among other items, net periodic benefit cost or income, plan funding levels, plan amendments, changes in plan demographics and assumptions, and the investment return on plan assets. because the accrued liability does not represent expected liquidity needs, we did not include this amount in the table above.
we expect to make all contributions to our pension trusts with cash flows from operating activities. our pension plans are generally funded in accordance with local laws and tax regulations. the company expects to contribute approximately $47 million in 2024 to our pension trusts, all of which will be allocated to our international plans. refer to note 14 of notes to consolidated financial statements. we did not include our estimated contributions to our pension trusts in the table above.
as of december 31, 2023, the projected benefit obligation of the u.s. qualified pension plan was $4,094 million, and the fair value of the plan assets was $4,056 million. the projected benefit obligation of all pension plans other than the u.s. qualified pension plan was $2,450 million, and the fair value of the plans' assets was $3,204 million. the company sponsors various unfunded pension plans outside the united states as well as unfunded nonqualified pension plans covering certain u.s. employees. these u.s. nonqualified pension plans provide benefits that are not permitted to be funded through a qualified plan because of limits imposed by the internal revenue code of 1986. the expected benefit payments for these unfunded pension plans are not included in the table above. however, we anticipate benefit payments for these unfunded pension plans will be approximately $64 million annually for 2024 and 2025. thereafter, the expected annual benefit payments will gradually decline. refer to note 14 of notes to consolidated financial statements.
in general, we are self-insured for large portions of many different types of claims; however, we do use commercial insurance above our self-insured retentions to reduce the company's risk of catastrophic loss. our reserves for the company's self-insured losses are estimated using actuarial methods and assumptions of the insurance industry, adjusted for our specific expectations based on our claims history. as of december 31, 2023, our self-insurance reserves totaled $197 million. refer to note 12 of notes to consolidated financial statements. we did not include estimated payments related to our self-insurance reserves in the table above.
deferred income tax liabilities as of december 31, 2023 were $2,639 million. refer to note 15 of notes to consolidated financial statements. this amount is not included in the table above because we believe that presentation would not be meaningful. deferred income tax liabilities are calculated based on temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their respective book bases, which will result in taxable amounts in future years when the underlying assets or liabilities are settled at their reported financial statement amounts. the results of these calculations do not have a direct connection with the amount of cash taxes to be paid in any future years. as a result, scheduling deferred income tax liabilities as payments due by period could be misleading, because this scheduling would not relate to liquidity needs.
as of december 31, 2023, we were contingently liable for guarantees of indebtedness owed by third parties of $633 million, of which $87 million was related to vies. our guarantees are primarily related to third-party customers, bottlers and vendors and arose through the normal course of business. these guarantees have various terms, and none of these guarantees is individually significant. these amounts represent the maximum potential future payments that we could be required to make under the guarantees. however, management has concluded that the likelihood of any significant amounts being paid by our company under these guarantees is remote. as of december 31, 2023, we were not directly liable for the debt of any unconsolidated entity.
foreign exchange our international operations are subject to certain opportunities and risks, including currency fluctuations and governmental actions. we closely monitor our operations in each country and seek to adopt appropriate strategies that are responsive to changing economic and political environments as well as to fluctuations in currencies. due to the geographic diversity of our operations, weakness in some currencies may be offset by strength in other currencies over time.
in 2023 and 2022, the weighted-average exchange rates for foreign currencies in which the company conducted operations (all operating currencies), and for certain individual currencies, strengthened (weakened) against the u.s. dollar as follows:
all operating currencies             (2)   %       (8)   %
the percentages in the table above do not include the effects of our hedging activities and, therefore, do not reflect the actual impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates on our operating results. our hedging activities are designed to mitigate, over time, a portion of the potentially unfavorable impact of exchange rate fluctuations on our net income.
the total impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on net operating revenues, including the effect of our hedging activities, was a decrease of 4% and 7% in 2023 and 2022, respectively. the total impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on income before income taxes, including the effect of our hedging activities, was a decrease of 8% and 6% in 2023 and 2022, respectively.
foreign currency exchange gains and losses are primarily the result of the remeasurement of monetary assets and liabilities from certain currencies into functional currencies. the effects of the remeasurement of these assets and liabilities are partially offset by the impact of our economic hedging program for certain exposures on our consolidated balance sheet. refer to note 5 of notes to consolidated financial statements. foreign currency exchange gains and losses are recorded in the line item other income (loss) - net in our consolidated statement of income. refer to the heading "operations review - other income (loss) - net" above. the company recorded net foreign currency exchange losses of $312 million and $236 million during the years ended december 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.
impact of inflation and changing prices inflation affects the way we operate in many markets around the world. in general, we believe that, over time, we will be able to increase prices to counteract the majority of the inflationary effects of increasing costs and to generate sufficient cash flows to maintain our productive capability.

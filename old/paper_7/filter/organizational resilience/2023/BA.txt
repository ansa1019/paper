item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations consolidated results of operations and financial condition overview we are a global market leader in the design, development, manufacture, sale, service and support of commercial jetliners, military aircraft, satellites, missile defense, human space flight and launch systems and services. we are one of the two major manufacturers of 100+ seat airplanes for the worldwide commercial airline industry and one of the largest defense contractors in the u.s. while our principal operations are in the u.s., we conduct operations in an expanding number of countries and rely on an extensive network of non-u.s. partners, key suppliers and subcontractors.
our strategy is centered on successful execution in healthy core businesses - commercial airplanes (bca), defense, space & security (bds) and global services (bgs). bca is committed to being the leader in commercial aviation by offering airplanes and services that deliver superior design, safety, quality, efficiency and value to customers around the world. bds integrates its resources in defense, intelligence, communications, security, space and services to deliver capability-driven solutions to customers at reduced costs. our bds strategy is to leverage our core businesses to capture key next-generation programs while expanding our presence in adjacent and international markets. bgs provides support for commercial and defense through innovative, comprehensive and cost-competitive product and service solutions.
business environment and trends in 2023, global air traffic largely recovered to 2019 levels with domestic travel continuing to be the most robust and the single-aisle market following closely. international travel has mostly recovered and the wide-body market continues to be paced by the international travel recovery. the transition in the international commercial market from recovery to normal market conditions is progressing slowly as china international travel remains below 2019 levels. we are experiencing strong demand from our airline customers globally.
we and our suppliers are experiencing supply chain disruptions as a result of production quality issues, global supply chain constraints, and labor instability. we and our suppliers are also experiencing inflationary pressures. we continue to monitor the health and stability of the supply chain. these factors have reduced overall productivity and adversely impacted our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.
airline financial performance, which influences demand for new capacity, has benefited from the resilient demand for travel. the international air transport association (iata) is estimating 2023 industry-wide profit of $23.3 billion, up from its forecast of $4.6 billion a year ago, primarily driven by north america, europe and the middle east. for 2024, iata is forecasting $25.7 billion in profits for the industry globally. the overall outlook continues to stabilize as we face uncertainties in the environment in the near- to medium-term as airlines are facing persistently high and volatile cost of fuel and tight labor conditions. the global economy is expecting an easing of inflation and interest rates, with regional economic and geopolitical difficulties adding uncertainty to the outlook and the financial viability of some airlines and regions.
the long-term outlook for the industry remains positive due to the fundamental drivers of air travel demand: economic growth, increasing propensity to travel due to increased trade, globalization and improved airline services driven by liberalization of air traffic rights between countries. our commercial market outlook forecast projects a 3.5% growth rate in the global fleet over a 20-year period. based on long-term global economic growth projections of 2.6% in average annual gross domestic product, we project demand for approximately 42,595 new airplanes over the next 20 years. the industry remains vulnerable to exogenous developments including fuel price spikes, credit market shocks, acts of terrorism, natural disasters, conflicts, epidemics, pandemics and increased global environmental regulations.
at bds, we continue to see stable demand reflecting the important role our products and services have in ensuring our national security. outside of the u.s., we are seeing similar solid demand as governments prioritize security, defense technology and global cooperation given evolving threats. we continue to experience production disruptions and inefficiencies due to technical challenges, supplier disruption and factory performance. these factors have contributed to significant earnings charges on fixed-price development programs as well as on a number of mature programs which are continuing to adversely affect margins and cash flows.
at bgs, we expect commercial revenues to remain strong in future quarters as the commercial airline industry has largely recovered and transitions to growth. the demand outlook for our government services business remains stable.

(1)these measures exclude certain components of pension and other postretirement benefit expense. see pages 43 - 45 for important information about these non-gaap measures and reconciliations to the most directly comparable gaap measures.
global services                                    19,127                   17,611                  16,328
revenues increased by $11,186 million in 2023 compared with 2022 driven by higher revenues at all three operating segments. bca revenues increased by $7,875 million primarily driven by higher 787 deliveries. bds revenues increased by $1,771 million primarily due to higher revenues on fixed-price development programs. bgs revenues increased by $1,516 million primarily due to higher commercial services revenue driven by market recovery across the commercial portfolio.
revenues increased by $4,322 million in 2022 compared with 2021 driven by higher revenues at bca and bgs, partially offset by lower revenues at bds. bca revenues increased by $6,312 million primarily driven by higher 737 and 787 deliveries. bgs revenues increased by $1,283 million primarily due to higher commercial services volume, partially offset by lower government services volume and performance. bds revenues decreased by $3,378 million primarily due to charges on fixed-price development programs, unfavorable performance across other defense programs, and lower p-8 and weapons volume.
revenues will continue to be significantly impacted until the global supply chain stabilizes, labor instability diminishes, and deliveries ramp up.

loss from operations decreased by $2,746 million in 2023 compared with 2022. bds loss from operations decreased by $1,780 million compared to the same period in 2022, primarily due to a reduction in net unfavorable cumulative contract catch-up adjustments, which were $2,328 million better than the net unfavorable impact in the prior year. bca loss from operations decreased by $706 million reflecting higher deliveries and lower period expenses including lower abnormal production costs, partially offset by higher spending on research and development. bgs earnings from operations increased by $602 million in 2023 compared with 2022 primarily due to higher commercial services revenue. loss from operations on unallocated items, eliminations and other increased by $255 million in 2023 primarily due to higher deferred compensation expense.
loss from operations increased by $649 million in 2022 compared with 2021. bds had a loss from operations of $3,544 million compared with earnings of $1,544 million during 2021, primarily due to charges on development programs. bca loss from operations decreased by $4,036 million primarily due to the absence in 2022 of the $3,460 million reach-forward loss taken on the 787 program in 2021, higher 737 deliveries and lower abnormal production costs, partially offset by higher research and development spending, charges related to the war in ukraine and other period expenses. bgs earnings from operations increased by $710 million in 2022 compared with 2021 primarily due to higher commercial services volume and favorable mix, partially offset by lower government services performance.
core operating loss decreased by $2,833 million in 2023 compared with 2022 and increased by $619 million in 2022 compared with 2021 primarily due to changes in segment operating loss as described above.
amortization of previously capitalized interest              (95)                       (95)                     (107)

share-based plans expense decreased by $176 million in 2023 and $60 million in 2022, primarily due to fewer share-based grants and the timing of corporate allocations in 2023. the lower expense in 2022 compared to 2021 was due to decreased grants of restricted stock units (rsus) and other share-based compensation.
deferred compensation expense increased by $305 million in 2023, and decreased by $243 million in 2022, primarily driven by changes in broad stock market conditions.
research and development expense increased by $37 million in 2023 and increased by $94 million in 2022 primarily due to spending on enterprise product development.
eliminations and other unallocated items was largely unchanged in 2023. eliminations and other unallocated expense increased by $498 million in 2022 primarily due to a $200 million settlement with the securities and exchange commission related to the 737 max accidents, lower income from operating investments and an increase in environmental remediation expense.
net periodic pension benefit costs included in loss from operations were as follows:
allocated to business segments                                             ($801)                      ($852)                  ($885)

non-operating pension income included in other income, net was $529 million in 2023, $881 million in 2022 and $528 million in 2021. the decreased income in 2023 compared to 2022 was primarily due to higher interest cost and lower expected return on plan assets, partially offset by lower amortization of net actuarial losses. the increased income in 2022 compared to 2021 was primarily due to lower amortization of net actuarial losses in 2022 and a settlement loss recorded in 2021.
non-operating postretirement income included in other income, net was $58 million in 2023 and 2022, and $1 million in 2021. the increased income in 2022 was due to lower amortization of net actuarial losses.
for additional discussion related to income taxes, see note 4 to our consolidated financial statements.
total costs and expenses ("cost of sales")
cost of sales, for both products and services, consists primarily of raw materials, parts, sub-assemblies, labor, overhead and subcontracting costs. our bca segment predominantly uses program accounting to account for cost of sales. under program accounting, cost of sales for each commercial aircraft program equals the product of (i) revenue recognized in connection with customer deliveries and (ii) the
estimated cost of sales percentage applicable to the total remaining program. for long-term contracts, the amount reported as cost of sales is recognized as incurred. substantially all contracts at our bds segment and certain contracts at our bgs segment are long-term contracts with the u.s. government and other customers that generally extend over several years. cost of sales for commercial spare parts is recorded at average cost.
the following table summarizes cost of sales:
years ended december 31                         2023                     2022           change                     2022                     2021           change cost of sales                            $70,070                  $63,078          $6,992                   $63,078                  $59,237          $3,841
cost of sales as a % of revenues            90.1   %                 94.7   %       (4.6)    %                 94.7   %                 95.1   %       (0.4)    %
cost of sales increased by $6,992 million in 2023 compared with 2022, primarily due to higher revenues at bca and bgs, partially offset by lower development charges at bds. cost of sales as a percentage of revenues decreased in 2023 compared to 2022 primarily due to lower charges on bds development programs.
cost of sales increased by $3,841 million in 2022 compared with 2021, primarily due to charges recorded at bds and higher revenues at bca. cost of sales as a percentage of revenues remained largely consistent in 2022 compared to 2021.
research and development the following table summarizes our research and development expense:
global services                           107                      119                     107
research and development expense increased by $525 million in 2023 compared with 2022 primarily due to higher research and development expenditures on the 777x program as well as other bca and enterprise investments in product development.
research and development expense increased by $603 million in 2022 compared with 2021 primarily due to higher research and development expenditures on 777x, 737 max, as well as bca and enterprise investments in product development.
global services                                      19,869                     19,338
contractual backlog of unfilled orders excludes purchase options, announced orders for which definitive contracts have not been executed, orders where customers have the unilateral right to terminate, and unobligated u.s. and non-u.s. government contract funding. the increase in contractual backlog during 2023 was primarily due to increases in bca and bds backlog. if we are unable to deliver aircraft to customers in china consistent with our assumptions, and/or entry into service of the 777x, 737-7 and/or 737-10 is further delayed, we may experience reductions to backlog and/or significant order cancellations.
unobligated backlog includes u.s. and non-u.s. government definitive contracts for which funding has not been authorized. unobligated backlog was largely unchanged in 2023.
additional considerations u.s. government funding the continuing resolution enacted on january 19, 2024, continues federal funding at fiscal year 2023 appropriated levels through march 1, 2024, for selected departments and agencies, including the department of transportation, and through march 8, 2024, for the remaining departments and agencies, including the united states department of defense (u.s. dod) and the national aeronautics and space administration (nasa). congress and the president must enact either full-year fiscal year 2024 (fy24) appropriations bills or an additional continuing resolution to fund government departments and agencies after these dates, or a partial or full government shutdown could result. u.s. government discretionary spending in fy24 and 2025 (fy25), including defense spending, was capped by the fiscal responsibility act of 2023 (fra). additionally, a continuing resolution for fy24 or fy25 in place on april 30 of the relevant fiscal year, would trigger a sequester under the fra.
global trade we continually monitor the global trade environment in response to geopolitical economic developments, as well as changes in tariffs, trade agreements or sanctions that may impact the company.
the current state of u.s.-china relations remains an ongoing watch item. since 2018, the u.s. and china have imposed tariffs on each other's imports. certain aircraft parts and components that boeing procures are subject to these tariffs. we are mitigating import costs through duty drawback customs procedures. china is a significant market for commercial aircraft and we have long-standing relationships with our chinese customers, who represent a key component of our commercial aircraft backlog. overall, the u.s.-china trade relationship remains stalled as economic and national security concerns continue to be a challenge.
beginning in june 2018, the u.s. government imposed tariffs on steel and aluminum imports. in response to these tariffs, several major u.s. trading partners have imposed, or announced their intention to impose, tariffs on u.s. goods. the u.s. has subsequently reached agreements with mexico, canada, japan, the united kingdom, and the european union, to ease or remove tariffs on steel and/or aluminum. we continue to monitor the potential for any extra costs that may result from the remaining global tariffs.
we are complying with all u.s. and other government export control restrictions and sanctions imposed on certain businesses and individuals in russia. we continue to monitor and evaluate additional sanctions and export restrictions that may be imposed by the u.s. government or other governments, as well as any responses from russia that could affect our supply chain, business partners or customers, for any additional impacts to our business.
supply chain we and our suppliers are experiencing supply chain disruptions as a result of global supply chain constraints and labor instability. we and our suppliers are also experiencing inflationary pressures. we continue to monitor the health and stability of the supply chain. these factors have reduced overall productivity and adversely impacted our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.
the current conflict in israel and the gaza strip has the potential to impact certain of our suppliers, and has impacted some operations for our airline and lessor customers. we are closely monitoring developments, supporting our employees and customers, and will take mitigating actions as appropriate.
segment results of operations and financial condition commercial airplanes business environment and trends airline industry environment see overview to management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for a discussion of the airline industry environment.
industry competitiveness the commercial aircraft market and the airline industry both remain extremely competitive. continued access to global markets remains vital to our ability to fully realize our sales potential and long-term investment returns. approximately 78% of bca's total backlog, in dollar terms, is with non-u.s. airlines. we face aggressive international competitors who are intent on increasing their market share. they offer competitive products and have access to most of the same customers and suppliers. with government support, airbus has historically invested heavily to create a family of products to compete with ours. after the acquisition of a majority share of bombardier's c series (now a220) in 2018, airbus continues to expand in the 100-150 seat transcontinental market. other competitors are also in different phases of developing commercial jet aircraft, including commercial aircraft corporation of china, ltd. (comac), which delivered its first c919 aircraft in 2022. some of these competitors have historically enjoyed access to government-provided financial support, including "launch aid," which greatly reduces the cost and commercial risks associated with airplane development activities. this has enabled the development of airplanes without broad commercial viability; others to be brought to market more quickly than otherwise possible; and many offered for sale below market-based prices. competitors continue to make improvements in efficiency, which may result in funding product development, gaining market share and improving earnings. this market environment has resulted in intense pressures on pricing and other competitive factors, and we expect these pressures to continue or intensify in the coming years.

bca deliveries, including intercompany deliveries, as of december 31 were as follows:
* intercompany deliveries identified by parentheses loss from operations bca loss from operations was $1,635 million in 2023 compared with $2,341 million in 2022 reflecting higher deliveries and lower period expenses including lower abnormal production costs, partially offset by higher spending on research and development. abnormal production costs in 2023 were $1,527 million, including $1,014 million related to the 787 program and $513 million related to the 777x program. abnormal production costs in 2022 were $1,753 million, including $1,240 million related to the 787 program, $325 million related to the 777x program, and $188 million related to the 737 program.
bca loss from operations was $2,341 million in 2022 compared with $6,377 million in 2021. the 2021 loss includes a reach-forward loss on the 787 program of $3,460 million. the improved performance in 2022 also reflects higher 737 deliveries and lower abnormal production costs, partially offset by higher research and development spending, charges related to the war in ukraine and other period expenses. abnormal production costs in 2021 were $2,355 million, including $1,887 million related to the 737 program and $468 million related to the 787 program.
backlog our total backlog represents the estimated transaction prices on unsatisfied and partially satisfied performance obligations to our customers where we believe it is probable that we will collect the consideration due and where no contingencies remain before we and the customer are required to perform. backlog does not include prospective orders where customer-controlled contingencies remain, such as the customer receiving approval from its board of directors, shareholders or government or completing financing arrangements. all such contingencies must be satisfied or have expired prior to recording a new firm order even if satisfying such conditions is highly probable. backlog excludes options and boeing customer financing orders as well as orders where customers have the unilateral right to terminate. a number of our customers may have contractual remedies, including rights to reject individual airplane deliveries if the actual delivery date is significantly later than the contractual delivery date. we address customer claims and requests for other contractual relief as they arise. the value of orders in backlog is adjusted as changes to price and schedule are agreed to with customers and is reported in accordance with the requirements of accounting standards codification (asc) 606.
bca total backlog of $440,507 million at december 31, 2023 increased from $329,824 million at december 31, 2022, reflecting new orders in excess of deliveries and a decrease in the value of existing orders that in our assessment do not meet the accounting requirements of asc 606 for inclusion in backlog, partially offset by order cancellations. aircraft order cancellations during the year ended december 31, 2023 totaled $12,925 million and primarily relate to 737 and 777x aircraft. the net asc 606 adjustments for the year ended december 31, 2023 resulted in an increase to backlog of $20,605 million primarily due to a net decrease of 777x and 737 aircraft. asc 606 adjustments include consideration of aircraft orders where a customer-controlled contingency may exist, as well as an assessment of whether the customer is committed to perform, impacts of geopolitical events or related sanctions, or whether it is probable that the customer will pay the full amount of consideration when it is due. if we are unable to deliver aircraft to customers in china consistent with our assumptions, and/or entry into service of the 777x, 737-7 and/or 737-10 is further delayed, we may experience reductions to backlog and/or significant order cancellations.
accounting quantity the accounting quantity is our estimate of the quantity of airplanes that will be produced for delivery under existing and anticipated contracts. the determination of the accounting quantity is limited by the ability to make reasonably dependable estimates of the revenue and cost of existing and anticipated contracts. it is a key determinant of the gross margins we recognize on sales of individual airplanes throughout a program's life. estimation of each program's accounting quantity takes into account several factors that are indicative of the demand for that program, including firm orders, letters of intent from prospective customers and market studies. we review our program accounting quantities quarterly.
the accounting quantity for each program may include units that have been delivered, undelivered units under contract and units anticipated to be under contract in the reasonable future (anticipated orders). in developing total program estimates, all of these items within the accounting quantity must be considered.
the following table provides details of the accounting quantities and firm orders by program as of december 31. cumulative firm orders represent the cumulative number of commercial jet aircraft deliveries plus undelivered firm orders. firm orders include military derivative aircraft that are not included in program accounting quantities. all revenues and costs associated with military derivative aircraft production are reported in the bds segment.
undelivered units under firm orders              4,332                                       104                   48                  416                  726           (8)

† boeing customer financing aircraft orders are identified in parentheses.
737 program the accounting quantity for the 737 program increased by 800 units during 2023 due to the program's normal progress of obtaining additional orders and delivering airplanes. we are currently producing at a rate of 38 per month.
on january 5, 2024, an alaska airlines 737-9 flight made an emergency landing after a mid-exit door plug detached in flight. following the accident, the federal aviation administration (faa) grounded and required inspections of all 737-9 aircraft with a mid-exit door plug, which constitute the large majority of the approximately 220 737-9 aircraft in the in-service fleet. on january 24, 2024, the faa approved an enhanced maintenance and inspection process that must be performed on each of the grounded 737-9 aircraft. our 737-9 operators have begun returning their fleets to service, and many 737-9s have completed inspections and resumed revenue flights. all 737-9 aircraft in production will undergo this same enhanced inspection process prior to delivery.
on january 10, 2024, the faa notified boeing that the faa has initiated an investigation into boeing's quality control system. this was followed by the faa announcing actions to increase its oversight of boeing, including conducting:
2.increased monitoring of boeing's 737-9 in-service events, and
3.an assessment of safety risks around delegated authority and quality oversight, and examination of options to move these functions under independent third parties.
we are following the lead of the faa as we work through the certification process of the 737-7 and 737-10 models. we continue to work with the faa on open actions to support 737-7 certification. during the fourth quarter of 2023, the 737-10 program received approval from the faa to begin the first phase of faa certification flight testing. at december 31, 2023, we had approximately 35 737-7 and 737-10 aircraft in inventory. we are now planning to incorporate engineering solutions to the de-icing systems on the 737-7 and 737-10, which will delay certification and first deliveries.
we are currently unable to reasonably estimate what impact the accident, the related faa actions and certification delays will have on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.
during the third quarter of 2023, we discovered non-conforming holes in the aft pressure dome of certain 737-7, 737-8 and 737 military derivative aircraft. rework on non-conforming fuselages with our supplier is complete and newly built aircraft meet our specifications. we do not expect inspection of completed aircraft in inventory to result in significant rework or production disruption.
as of december 31, 2023, we had approximately 140 737-8 aircraft in inventory that were produced prior to 2023, including 85 aircraft for customers in china. return-to-service of the china 737 max fleet is complete. while there continues to be uncertainty, we are continuing to work with airlines and government officials on delivery timing and expect to deliver most of the aircraft in inventory by the end of 2024. in the event that we are unable to deliver aircraft consistent with our assumptions, our financial position, results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected.
see further discussion of the 737 max in note 7, note 13 and note 23 to our consolidated financial statements.
747 program we completed production of the 747 in the fourth quarter of 2022 and delivery of the last aircraft occurred in february 2023. ending production of the 747 did not have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
767 program the accounting quantity for the 767 program increased by 12 units during 2023 due to the program's normal progress of obtaining additional orders and delivering airplanes. the 767 assembly line includes the commercial program and a derivative to support the kc-46a tanker program. the commercial program has near break-even gross margins. we are currently producing at a combined rate of 3 aircraft per month.
777 and 777x programs the accounting quantity for the 777x program increased by 100 units during the year ended december 31, 2023 due to obtaining additional orders for the 777-9 and 777-8. we are currently producing at a combined production rate of 4 per month for the 777/777x programs.
we are following the lead of the faa as we work through the certification process including obtaining approval from the faa to begin certification flight testing. we expect the first delivery of the 777-9 to occur in 2025 and the 777-8 freighter to occur in 2027. first delivery of the 777-8 passenger aircraft is not expected to occur before 2030.
in april 2022, we decided to pause production of the 777-9 during 2022 and 2023, which resulted in cumulative abnormal production costs of $0.8 billion. in the fourth quarter of 2023, the 777x program resumed production.
the level of profitability on the 777x program will be subject to a number of factors. these factors include aircraft certification requirements and timing, change incorporation on completed aircraft, production disruption due to labor instability and supply chain disruption, customer negotiations, further production rate adjustments for the 777x or other commercial aircraft programs, and contraction of the accounting quantity. one or more of these factors could result in reach-forward losses in future periods.
787 program the accounting quantity for the 787 program increased by 100 units during 2023 due to the program's normal progress of obtaining additional orders and delivering airplanes.
during 2023, we delivered 73 aircraft and increased the production rate to 5 per month beginning in october 2023. at december 31, 2023 and 2022, we had approximately 50 and 90 aircraft in inventory that require rework which we expect to complete by the end of 2024.
beginning in 2021, the 787 program lowered production rates and paused deliveries in order to improve production quality and implement changes in the production process designed to ensure that newly-built aircraft meet our specifications. in the third quarter of 2021, we determined that production rates below 5 per month represented abnormally low production rates. this resulted in abnormal production costs, which we expensed as incurred through the third quarter of 2023. we also determined that the inspections and rework costs on inventoried aircraft are excessive and should also be accounted for as abnormal production costs. cumulative abnormal costs recorded through december 31, 2023 totaled $2.7 billion. the costs associated with the remaining rework are not expected to be significant.
fleet support we provide the operators of our commercial aircraft with assistance and services to facilitate efficient and safe airplane operation. collectively known as fleet support services, these activities and services begin prior to airplane delivery and continue throughout the operational life of the airplane. they include flight and maintenance training, field service support, engineering services, information services and systems and technical data and documents. the costs for fleet support are expensed as incurred and have historically been approximately 1% of total consolidated costs of products and services.
additional considerations the development and ongoing production of commercial aircraft is extremely complex, involving extensive coordination and integration with suppliers and highly-skilled labor from employees and other partners. meeting or exceeding our performance and reliability standards, as well as those of customers and regulators, can be costly and technologically challenging. in addition, the introduction of new aircraft and derivatives, such as the 777x, 737-7 and 737-10, involves increased risks associated with meeting development, production and certification schedules. these challenges include significant global regulatory scrutiny of all development aircraft. as a result, our ability to deliver aircraft on time, satisfy performance and reliability standards and achieve or maintain, as applicable, program profitability is subject to significant risks. factors that could result in lower margins (or a material charge if an airplane program has or is determined to have reach-forward losses) include: changes to the program accounting quantity, customer and model mix, production costs and rates, changes to price escalation factors due to changes in the inflation rate or other economic indicators, performance or reliability issues involving completed aircraft, capital expenditures and other costs associated with increasing or adding new production capacity, learning curve, additional change incorporation, rework or safety enhancements, operational and supply chain challenges, achieving anticipated cost reductions, additional regulatory requirements in connection with certification in one or more jurisdictions, flight test and certification schedules, costs, schedule and demand for new airplanes and derivatives and status of customer claims, supplier claims or assertions and other contractual negotiations. while we believe the cost and revenue estimates incorporated in the consolidated financial statements are appropriate, the technical complexity of our airplane programs creates financial risk as additional completion costs may become necessary or scheduled delivery dates could be extended, which could trigger termination provisions, order cancellations or other financially significant exposure.
defense, space & security business environment and trends united states government defense environment overview in march 2023, the u.s. government released the president's budget request for fy24, which requested $842 billion in funding for the u.s. dod and $27 billion for nasa. the president's budget request does not request funding for f/a-18, v-22, or p-8 production aircraft. the p-8 program continues to pursue u.s. and non-u.s. sales opportunities. in addition, there is ongoing uncertainty with respect to program-level appropriations for the u.s. dod, nasa and other government agencies for fy24 and beyond.
future budget cuts or investment priority changes, including changes associated with the authorizations and appropriations process, could result in reductions, cancellations and/or delays of existing contracts or programs. any of these impacts could have a material effect on our results of operations, financial position, and/or cash flows.
non-u.s. defense environment overview the non-u.s. market continues to be driven by complex and evolving security challenges and the need to modernize aging equipment and inventories. bds expects that it will continue to have a wide range of opportunities across asia, europe and the middle east given the diverse regional threats. at the end of 2023, 29% of bds backlog was attributable to non-u.s. customers.

since our operating cycle is long-term and involves many different types of development and production contracts with varying delivery and milestone schedules, the operating results of a particular period may not be indicative of future operating results. in addition, depending on the customer and their funding sources, our orders might be structured as annual follow-on contracts, or as one large multi-year order or long-term award. as a result, period-to-period comparisons of backlog are not necessarily indicative of future workloads. the following discussions of comparative results among periods should be viewed in this context.
deliveries of new-build production units, including remanufactures and modifications, were as follows:
revenues bds revenues in 2023 increased by $1,771 million compared with 2022. this increase is not indicative of future projected revenue trends. revenues related to bds' five major fixed-price development programs increased by $1,767 million in 2023 compared with 2022. this increase reflects lower unfavorable net cumulative contract catch-up adjustments in 2023 as well as higher costs incurred in 2023 to complete these contracts. net unfavorable cumulative contract catch-up adjustments in 2023 were $648 million better than in 2022 largely due to lower charges on development programs in 2023, partially offset by unfavorable performance on other programs.
bds revenues in 2022 decreased by $3,378 million compared with 2021 primarily due to charges on development programs. unfavorable performance across other defense programs and lower p-8 and weapons volume also contributed to the decrease in revenue. cumulative contract catch-up adjustments in 2022 were $1,858 million more unfavorable than the prior year largely due to charges on development programs.
(loss)/earnings from operations bds loss from operations in 2023 of $1,764 million decreased by $1,780 million compared with $3,544 million in 2022. the decrease is primarily due to $2,863 million of lower charges in 2023 on fixed-price development programs that were partially offset by lower earnings across other programs including satellites and f-15, as well as higher period expenses. during 2023, losses incurred on the five fixed-price development programs totaled $1,585 million compared with $4,448 million in 2022. charges on fixed-price development programs in 2023 included vc-25b ($482 million), kc-46a tanker ($309 million), commercial crew ($288 million), t-7a red hawk ($275 million) and mq-25 ($231 million). loss from operations in 2023 includes a $315 million impact from an agreement with one of our satellite customers which includes customer considerations as well as increased costs to enhance the constellation and meet lifecycle commitments. net unfavorable cumulative contract catch-up adjustments were $2,328 million better than in 2022.
bds loss from operations in 2022 of $3,544 million decreased by $5,088 million compared with earnings from operations of $1,544 million in 2021 primarily due to unfavorable impacts of cumulative contract catch-up adjustments ($4,284 million more unfavorable in 2022 than 2021). volume and mix and higher research and development also contributed to the year over year earnings decline. charges on fixed-price development programs in 2022 included vc-25b ($1,452 million), kc-46a tanker ($1,374 million), mq-25 ($579 million), t-7a red hawk production options ($552 million), t-7a red hawk engineering and manufacturing development (emd) ($203 million), and commercial crew ($288 million). these were partially offset by charges on the kc-46a tanker ($402 million), vc-25b ($318 million), and commercial crew ($214 million) recognized in 2021. the net unfavorable cumulative contract catch-up adjustments represent losses incurred on these development and other programs. see further discussion of fixed-price contracts in note 13 to our consolidated financial statements.
bds (loss)/earnings from operations includes our share of income from equity method investments of $44 million, $13 million and $53 million primarily from our united launch alliance and other joint ventures in 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively.
backlog total backlog of $59,012 million at december 31, 2023 was $4,639 million higher than december 31, 2022 due to the timing of awards and revenue recognized on contracts awarded in prior years.
additional considerations our bds business includes a variety of development programs which have complex design and technical challenges. some of these programs have cost-type contracting arrangements. in these cases, the associated financial risks are primarily reduced award or incentive fees, lower profit rates, or program cancellation if cost, schedule or technical performance issues arise. examples of these programs include ground-based midcourse defense, proprietary and space launch system programs.
some of our development programs are contracted on a fixed-price basis. examples of fixed-price development programs include commercial crew, kc-46a tanker, mq-25, t-7a red hawk, vc-25b, and commercial and military satellites. a number of our ongoing fixed-price development programs have reach-forward losses. new programs could also have risk for reach-forward loss upon contract award and during the period of contract performance. many development programs have highly complex designs. as technical or quality issues arise during development, we may experience schedule delays and cost impacts, which could increase our estimated cost to perform the work or reduce our estimated price, either of which could result in a material charge or otherwise adversely affect our financial condition. these programs are ongoing, and while we believe the cost and fee estimates incorporated in the financial statements are appropriate, the technical complexity of these programs creates financial risk as additional completion costs may become necessary or scheduled delivery dates could be extended, which could trigger termination provisions or other financially significant exposure. risk remains that we may be required to record additional reach-forward losses in future periods.
global services business environment and trends the aerospace markets we serve include parts distribution, logistics and other inventory services; maintenance, engineering and upgrades; training and professional services; and data analytics and digital services. in 2023, commercial services volume at bgs exceeded pre-pandemic levels. we expect bgs commercial revenues to remain strong in future quarters as the commercial airline industry transitions from recovery to growth.
over the long-term, as the size of the worldwide commercial airline fleet continues to grow, so does demand for aftermarket services designed to increase efficiency and extend the economic lives of aircraft. airlines are using data analytics to plan flight operations and predictive maintenance to improve their productivity and efficiency. airlines continue to look for opportunities to reduce the size and cost of their spare parts inventory, frequently outsourcing spares management to third parties.
the demand outlook for our government services business has remained stable in 2023. government services market segments are growing on pace with related fleets, but vary based on the utilization and age of the aircraft. the u.s. government services market is the single largest individual market, comprising over 50 percent of the government services markets served. over the next decade, we expect u.s. growth to remain flat and non-u.s. fleets, led by middle east and asia pacific customers, to add rotorcraft and commercial derivative aircraft at faster rates. we expect approximately 30 percent of the worldwide fleet of military aircraft to be retired and replaced over the next ten years, driving increased demand for services to maintain aging aircraft and enhance aircraft capability.
bgs' major customer, the u.s. government, remains subject to the spending limits and uncertainty, which could restrict the execution of certain program activities and delay new programs or competitions.
industry competitiveness aviation services is a competitive market with many domestic and international competitors. this market environment has resulted in intense pressures on pricing, and we expect these pressures to continue or intensify in the coming years. continued access to global markets remains vital to our ability to fully realize our sales growth potential and long-term investment returns.

revenues bgs revenues in 2023 increased by $1,516 million compared with 2022 primarily due to higher commercial services revenue driven by market recovery across the commercial portfolio. the net unfavorable impact of cumulative contract catch-up adjustments in 2023 was $16 million worse than the net favorable impact in the prior year comparable period.
bgs revenues in 2022 increased by $1,283 million compared with 2021 primarily due to higher commercial services volume, partially offset by lower government services volume and performance. the decrease in government services volume is partly driven by the discontinuation of an engine distribution agreement in the second quarter of 2022. the net favorable impact of cumulative contract catch-up adjustments in 2022 was $137 million lower than the prior year.
earnings from operations bgs earnings from operations in 2023 increased by $602 million compared with 2022, primarily due to higher commercial services revenue. the net unfavorable impact of cumulative contract catch-up adjustments in 2023 was $9 million higher than the prior year.
bgs earnings from operations in 2022 increased by $710 million compared with 2021, primarily due to higher commercial services volume and favorable mix, partially offset by lower government services performance. the net unfavorable impact of cumulative contract catch-up adjustments in 2022 was $148 million worse than the net favorable impact in the prior year.
backlog bgs total backlog of $19,869 million at december 31, 2023 increased by 3% from $19,338 million at december 31, 2022, primarily due to the timing of awards, partially offset by revenue recognized on contracts awarded in prior years.

operating activities net cash provided by operating activities was $6.0 billion during 2023 compared with $3.5 billion during 2022. net cash provided by operating activities in 2022 included a $1.5 billion income tax refund. the year-over-year improvement in cash provided by operating activities reflects increases in revenues at bca and bgs, higher advances and progress billings ($3.3 billion) and lower payments to 737 max customers ($0.6 billion), partially offset by increased inventories ($2.1 billion). increases in accrued liabilities in both years primarily reflects accrued reach-forward losses on bds programs. changes in assets and liabilities for 2023 decreased by $0.1 billion compared to 2022 primarily driven by unfavorable changes in inventories ($2.1 billion) and accrued liabilities ($2.2 billion), partially offset by increases in advances and progress billings ($3.3 billion). the change in inventories was primarily driven by increased production on the 737 and 777x programs, partially offset by increased deliveries for the 787 program in 2023. the change in accrued liabilities was primarily driven by higher accrued losses on bds fixed-price development programs recorded in the prior year. cash provided by advances and progress billings was $3.4 billion in 2023 as compared with $0.1 billion in 2022. concessions paid to 737 max customers totaled $0.4 billion in 2023 and $1.0 billion in 2022.
the $6.9 billion improvement in cash provided by operating activities in 2022 was primarily driven by improved changes in assets and liabilities of $11.1 billion, partially offset by lower non-cash items of $3.4 billion and higher net loss of $0.8 billion. changes in assets and liabilities for 2022 improved by $11.1 billion compared with 2021 primarily driven by favorable changes in accrued liabilities ($6.6 billion), accounts payable ($4.6 billion) and inventories ($1.5 billion), partially offset by a decrease in advances and progress billings ($2.4 billion) in 2022. the increase in accrued liabilities was primarily driven by the accrued losses on bds fixed-price development programs, lower payments to 737 max customers in 2022, and a $0.7 billion payment in 2021 consistent with the terms of the deferred prosecution agreement between boeing and the u.s. department of justice. concessions paid to 737 max customers totaled $1.0 billion and $2.5 billion during 2022 and 2021. growth in accounts payable in 2022 was a source of cash while reductions in accounts payable in 2021 was a use of cash, generally reflecting increases in production rates. inventory improvements were driven by higher 737 max deliveries and resumption of 787 deliveries in 2022. additionally, in 2022 and 2021 we received income tax refunds of $1.5 billion and $1.7 billion. cash provided by advances and progress billings was $0.1 billion in 2022 as compared with $2.5 billion in 2021. the $3.4 billion reduction in non-cash items in 2022 was primarily driven by the $3.5 billion reach-forward loss on the 787 program that was recorded in 2021. net loss for 2022 was $5.1 billion compared with net loss of $4.3 billion in 2021. the $0.8 billion year-over-year increase in the net loss was primarily driven by the absence of an income tax benefit in 2022.
investing activities cash used by investing activities during 2023 was $2.4 billion, compared with cash provided of $4.4 billion during 2022 and $9.3 billion during 2021. the increase in use of cash in 2023 compared to 2022 was primarily due to net contributions to investments of $0.7 billion in 2023 compared to net proceeds from investments of $5.6 billion in 2022. the decrease in cash inflows in 2022 compared to 2021 was primarily due to $4.2 billion of higher net proceeds from investments in 2021. capital expenditures totaled $1.5 billion in 2023, compared with $1.2 billion in 2022 and $1.0 billion in 2021. we expect capital expenditures to grow in 2024 compared with 2023.
financing activities cash used by financing activities was $5.5 billion during 2023, compared with $1.3 billion during 2022, and $5.6 billion in 2021. the increase of $4.2 billion compared with 2022 primarily reflects higher net debt repayments in 2023. during 2023, debt repayments net of new borrowings were $5.1 billion compared with $1.3 billion in 2022 and $5.6 billion in 2021.
at december 31, 2023 and 2022 debt balances totaled $52.3 billion and $57.0 billion, of which $5.2 billion were classified as short-term for both periods.
we had 1.7 million, 0.2 million and 0.3 million shares transferred to us from employee tax withholdings in 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. the increase in 2023 was primarily due to the vesting of a one-time rsu grant awarded to most employees in december 2020. in 2020, we announced the suspension of our dividend until further notice. as a result, we did not pay any dividends in 2023, 2022 and 2021.
capital resources the following table summarizes certain cash requirements for known contractual and other obligations as of december 31, 2023, and the estimated timing thereof. see note 12 for future operating lease payments.
we expect to be able to fund our cash requirements through cash and short-term investments and cash provided by operations, as well as continued access to capital markets. at december 31, 2023, we had $12.7 billion of cash, $3.3 billion of short-term investments, and $10.0 billion of unused borrowing capacity on revolving credit line agreements. in the third quarter of 2023, we entered into a $3.0 billion five-year revolving credit agreement expiring in august 2028 and a $0.8 billion 364-day revolving credit agreement expiring in august 2024. the 364-day credit facility has a one-year term out option which allows us to extend the maturity of any borrowings until august 2025. the legacy three-year revolving credit agreement expiring in august 2025, which consists of $3.0 billion of total commitments, and the legacy five-year revolving credit agreement expiring in october 2024, as amended, which consists of $3.2 billion of total commitments, each remain in effect. we anticipate that these credit lines will remain undrawn and primarily serve as back-up liquidity to support our general corporate borrowing needs.
our credit ratings were downgraded in 2020 and remained unchanged as of december 31, 2023. during the fourth quarter of 2023, fitch upgraded our credit rating outlook from stable to positive driven by declining inventory levels, improving production and delivery profile, growing backlog, and forecasted positive free cash flow. during the third quarter of 2023, s&p upgraded the outlook on our credit rating from negative to stable primarily driven by improving deliveries and expected increases in production. during the first quarter of 2023, moody's upgraded the outlook on our credit rating from negative to stable primarily driven by an improvement in operating cash flow and a reduction of 737 and 787 aircraft in inventory.
we expect to be able to access capital markets when we require additional funding in order to pay off existing debt, address further impacts to our business related to market developments, fund outstanding financing commitments or meet other business requirements. a number of factors could cause us to incur increased borrowing costs and to have greater difficulty accessing public and private markets for debt. these factors include disruptions or declines in the global capital markets and/or a decline in our financial performance, outlook or credit ratings, and/or associated changes in demand for our products and services. these risks will be particularly acute if we are subject to further credit rating downgrades such as those we experienced in 2020. the occurrence of any or all of these events may adversely affect our ability to fund our operations and financing or contractual commitments.
any future borrowings may affect our credit ratings and are subject to various debt covenants. at december 31, 2023, we were in compliance with the covenants for our debt and credit facilities. the most restrictive covenants include a limitation on mortgage debt and sale and leaseback transactions as a percentage of consolidated net tangible assets (as defined in the credit agreements) and a limitation on consolidated debt as a percentage of total capital (as defined in the credit agreements). when considering debt covenants, we continue to have substantial borrowing capacity.
pension and other postretirement benefits pension cash requirements are based on an estimate of our minimum funding requirements, pursuant to employee retirement income security act (erisa) regulations, although we may make additional discretionary contributions. estimates of other postretirement benefits are based on both our estimated future benefit payments and the estimated contributions to plans that are funded through trusts.
at december 31, 2023 and 2022, our pension plans were $5.4 billion and $5.3 billion underfunded as measured under u.s. generally accepted accounting principles (gaap). on an erisa basis, our plans are more than 100% funded at december 31, 2023. we do not expect to make significant contributions to our pension plans in 2024. we may be required to make higher contributions to our pension plans in future years.
for the foreseeable future, we are using common stock in lieu of cash to fund company contributions to our 401(k) plans.
purchase obligations purchase obligations represent contractual agreements to purchase goods or services that are legally binding; specify a fixed, minimum or range of quantities; specify a fixed, minimum, variable or indexed price provision; and specify approximate timing of the transaction. purchase obligations include amounts recorded as well as amounts that are not recorded on the consolidated statements of financial position.
purchase obligations not recorded on the consolidated statements of financial position include agreements for inventory procurement, tooling costs, electricity and natural gas contracts, property, plant and equipment, information technology software and hardware, and other miscellaneous production related obligations. the most significant obligation relates to inventory procurement contracts. we have entered into certain significant inventory procurement contracts that specify determinable prices and quantities, and long-term delivery timeframes. in addition, we purchase raw materials on behalf of our suppliers. these agreements require suppliers and vendors to be prepared to build and deliver items in sufficient time to meet our production schedules. the need for such arrangements with suppliers and vendors arises from the extended production planning horizon for many of our products. a significant portion of these inventory commitments is supported by firm contracts with customers and/or has historically resulted in settlement through reimbursement from customers for penalty payments to the supplier should the customer not take delivery. these amounts are also included in our forecasts of costs for program and contract accounting. some inventory procurement contracts may include escalation adjustments. in these limited cases, we have included our best estimate of the effect of the escalation adjustment in the amounts disclosed in the table above.
purchase obligations recorded on the consolidated statements of financial position primarily include accounts payable and certain other current and long-term liabilities, including accrued compensation.
we have entered into various industrial participation agreements with certain customers outside of the u.s. to facilitate economic flow back and/or technology or skills transfer to their businesses or government agencies as the result of their procurement of goods and/or services from us. these commitments may be satisfied by our local operations there, placement of direct work or vendor orders for supplies, opportunities to bid on supply contracts, transfer of technology or other forms of assistance. however, in some instances, our commitments may be satisfied through other parties (such as our vendors) who purchase supplies from our non-u.s. customers. in certain cases, penalties could be imposed if we do not meet our industrial participation commitments. during 2023, we incurred no such penalties. as of december 31, 2023, we had outstanding industrial participation agreements totaling $24.5 billion that extend through 2034. purchase order commitments associated with industrial participation agreements are included in purchase obligations. to be eligible for such a purchase order commitment from us, a non-u.s. supplier must have sufficient capability to meet our requirements and must be competitive in cost, quality and schedule.
off-balance sheet arrangements we are a party to certain off-balance sheet arrangements including certain guarantees. for discussion of these arrangements, see note 14 to our consolidated financial statements.
commercial commitments the following table summarizes our commercial commitments outstanding as of december 31, 2023.
committed/maximum            1 year           years           years            years amount of loss standby letters of credit and surety bonds                $4,548              $3,150            $1,210             $25            $163
commercial aircraft financing commitments include commitments to provide financing related to aircraft on order, under option for deliveries or proposed as part of sales campaigns or refinancing with respect to delivered aircraft, based on estimated earliest potential funding dates. customer financing commitments totaled $17.0 billion and $16.1 billion at december 31, 2023 and 2022. the increase relates to new financing commitments. we anticipate that we will not be required to fund a significant portion of our financing commitments as we continue to work with third party financiers to provide alternative financing to customers. historically, we have not been required to fund significant amounts of outstanding commitments. however, there can be no assurances that we will not be required to fund greater amounts than historically required. see note 13 to our consolidated financial statements.
contingent obligations we have significant contingent obligations that arise in the ordinary course of business, which include the following:
legal various legal proceedings, claims and investigations are pending against us. legal contingencies are discussed in note 21 to our consolidated financial statements.
environmental remediation we are involved with various environmental remediation activities and have recorded a liability of $844 million at december 31, 2023. for additional information, see note 13 to our consolidated financial statements.
non-gaap measures core operating earnings/(loss), core operating margin and core earnings/(loss) per share our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with gaap which we supplement with certain non-gaap financial information. these non-gaap measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the related gaap measures, and other companies may define such measures differently. we encourage investors to review our financial statements and publicly-filed reports in their entirety and not to rely on any single financial measure. core operating earnings/(loss), core operating margin and core earnings/(loss) per share exclude the fas/cas service cost adjustment. the fas/cas service cost adjustment represents the difference between the financial accounting standards (fas) pension and postretirement service costs calculated under gaap and costs allocated to the business segments. core earnings/(loss) per share excludes both the fas/cas service cost adjustment and non-operating pension and postretirement expenses. non-operating pension and postretirement expenses represent the components of net periodic benefit costs other than service cost. pension costs, comprising service and prior service costs computed in accordance with gaap are allocated to bca and certain bgs businesses supporting commercial customers. pension costs allocated to bds and bgs businesses supporting government customers are computed in accordance with u.s. government cost accounting standards (cas), which employ different actuarial assumptions and accounting conventions than gaap. cas costs are allocable to government contracts. other postretirement benefit costs are allocated to all business segments based on cas, which is generally based on benefits paid.
the pension fas/cas service cost adjustments recognized in loss from operations were benefits of $799 million in 2023, $849 million in 2022 and $882 million in 2021. the lower benefits in 2023 and 2022 were primarily due to reductions in allocated pension cost year over year. the non-operating pension expense included in other income, net was a benefit of $529 million in 2023, $881 million in 2022 and $528 million in 2021. the lower benefits in 2023 were primarily due to higher interest cost and lower expected return on plan assets, offset by lower amortization of net actuarial losses. the higher benefits in 2022 were primarily due to lower amortization of net actuarial losses and a settlement loss that was recorded in 2021. for further discussion of pension and other postretirement costs, see the management's discussion and analysis on page 26 of this form 10-k and see note 22 to our consolidated financial statements.
management uses core operating earnings/(loss), core operating margin and core earnings/(loss) per share for purposes of evaluating and forecasting underlying business performance. management believes these core earnings measures provide investors additional insights into operational performance as unallocated pension and other postretirement benefit cost primarily represent costs driven by market factors and costs not allocable to u.s. government contracts.
reconciliation of non-gaap measures to gaap measures the table below reconciles the non-gaap financial measures of core operating earnings/(loss), core operating margins and core earnings/(loss) per share with the most directly comparable gaap financial measures of earnings/(loss) from operations, operating margins and diluted earnings/(loss) per share.

critical accounting estimates accounting for long-term contracts substantially all contracts at bds and certain contracts at bgs are long-term contracts. our long-term contracts typically represent a single distinct performance obligation due to the highly interdependent and interrelated nature of the underlying goods and/or services and the significant service of integration that we provide.
accounting for long-term contracts involves a judgmental process of estimating the total revenue, costs, and profit for each performance obligation. cost of sales is recognized as incurred, and revenue is determined by adding a proportionate amount of the estimated profit to the amount reported as cost of sales.
due to the size, duration and nature of many of our long-term contracts, the estimation of total revenues and costs through completion is complicated and subject to many variables. total revenue estimates are based on negotiated contract prices and quantities, modified by our assumptions regarding contract options, change orders, incentive and award fee provisions associated with technical performance, and price adjustment clauses (such as inflation or index-based clauses). the majority of these long-term contracts are with the u.s. government where the price is generally based on the estimated cost to produce the product or service plus profit. federal acquisition regulations provide guidance on the types of cost that will be reimbursed in establishing contract price. total cost estimates are largely based on negotiated or estimated purchase contract terms, historical performance trends, business base and other economic projections. factors that influence these estimates include inflationary trends, technical and schedule risk, internal and supplier performance trends, production quality, labor instability, global supply chain constraints, business volume assumptions, asset utilization, and anticipated labor agreements.
revenue and cost estimates for all significant long-term contract performance obligations are reviewed and reassessed quarterly. changes in these estimates could result in recognition of cumulative catch-up adjustments to the contract's inception to date revenues, cost of sales and profit in the period in which such changes are made. changes in revenue and cost estimates could also result in a reach-forward loss or an adjustment to a reach-forward loss which would be recorded immediately in earnings. net cumulative catch-up adjustments for changes in estimated revenues and costs at completion across all long-term contracts, including the impact of estimated losses on unexercised options, increased loss from operations by $2,943 million, $5,253 million and $880 million in 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively, and were primarily due to losses recognized on the vc-25b, kc-46a tanker, commercial crew, t-7a red hawk and mq-25 programs. these are all fixed-price development programs, and there is ongoing risk that similar losses may have to be recognized in future periods on these and/or other programs.
due to the significance of judgment in the estimation process described above, it is likely that materially different earnings could be recorded if we used different assumptions or if the underlying circumstances were to change. changes in underlying assumptions/estimates, internal and supplier performance, inflationary trends, or other circumstances may adversely or positively affect financial performance in future periods. if the combined gross margins for our profitable long-term contracts had been estimated to be higher or lower by 1% during 2023, it would have increased or decreased pre-tax income for the year by approximately $300 million.
program accounting program accounting requires the demonstrated ability to reliably estimate revenues, costs and gross profit margin for the defined program accounting quantity. a program consists of the estimated number of units (accounting quantity) of a product to be produced in a continuing, long-term production effort for delivery under existing and anticipated contracts. the determination of the accounting quantity is limited by the ability to make reasonably dependable estimates.
factors that must be estimated include program accounting quantity, sales price, production rates, labor and employee benefit costs, material costs, procured part costs, major component costs, overhead costs, program tooling and other non-recurring costs, and warranty costs. estimation of the accounting quantity for each program takes into account several factors that are indicative of the demand for the particular program, such as firm orders, letters of intent from prospective customers and market studies. total estimated program sales are determined by estimating the model mix and sales price for all unsold units within the accounting quantity, added together with the sales prices for all undelivered units under contract. the sales prices for all undelivered units within the accounting quantity include an escalation adjustment for inflation that is updated quarterly. cost estimates are based largely on negotiated and anticipated contracts with suppliers, historical performance trends, and business base and other economic projections. factors that influence these estimates include production rates, internal and supplier performance trends, production quality, labor instability, global supply chain constraints, learning curve, change incorporation, rework or safety enhancements, regulatory requirements, flight test and certification requirements and schedules, performance or reliability issues involving completed aircraft, customer and/or supplier claims or assertions, asset utilization, anticipated labor agreements, and inflationary or deflationary trends.
the introduction of new aircraft and derivatives, such as the 777x, 737-7 and 737-10, involves increased risks associated with meeting development, certification, and production schedules. these challenges include significant global regulatory scrutiny of all development aircraft. as a result, our ability to deliver aircraft on time, satisfy performance and reliability standards and achieve or maintain, as applicable, program profitability is subject to significant risks.
to ensure reliability in our estimates, we employ a rigorous estimating process that is reviewed and updated on a quarterly basis. this includes reassessing the accounting quantity. changes in estimates of program gross profit margins are normally recognized on a prospective basis; however, when estimated costs to complete a program plus costs already included in inventory exceed estimated revenues from the program, a loss is recorded in the current period. reductions to the estimated loss are included in the gross profit margin for undelivered units in the accounting quantity whereas increases to the estimated loss are recorded as an earnings charge in the period in which the loss is determined.
the 767, 777x, and 787 programs had near break-even or single digit margins at december 31, 2023. adverse changes to the revenue and/or cost estimates for these programs could result in earnings charges in future periods.
due to the significance of judgment in the estimation process described above, it is reasonably possible that changes in underlying circumstances or assumptions could have a material effect on program gross margins. if the combined gross margin percentages for our commercial airplane programs had been estimated to be 1% higher or lower it would have an approximately $330 million impact on operating earnings for the year ended december 31, 2023.
pension plans many of our employees have earned benefits under defined benefit pension plans. the majority of employees that had participated in defined benefit pension plans have transitioned to a company-funded defined contribution retirement savings plan. accounting rules require an annual measurement of our projected obligation and plan assets. these measurements are based upon several assumptions. future changes in assumptions or differences between actual and expected outcomes can significantly affect our future annual expense, projected benefit obligation and shareholders' equity.
the projected benefit obligation is sensitive to discount rates. the projected benefit obligation would decrease by $1,280 million or increase by $1,425 million if the discount rate increased or decreased by 25 basis points. a 25 basis point change in the discount rate would not have a significant impact on pension cost. however, net periodic pension cost is sensitive to changes in the expected long-term rate of asset return. a decrease or increase of 25 basis points in the expected long-term rate of asset return would have increased or decreased 2023 net periodic pension cost by $150 million. see note 16 of the notes to our consolidated financial statements, which includes the discount rate and expected long-term rate of asset return assumptions for the last three years.
deferred income taxes - valuation allowance the company had deferred income tax assets of $14,743 million at december 31, 2023 that can be used in future years to offset taxable income and reduce income taxes payable. the company had deferred income tax liabilities of $10,363 million at december 31, 2023 that will partially offset deferred income tax assets and result in higher taxable income in future years and increase income taxes payable. tax law determines whether future reversals of temporary differences will result in taxable and deductible amounts that offset each other in future years. the particular years in which temporary differences result in taxable or deductible amounts generally are determined by the timing of the recovery of the related asset or settlement of the related liability.
on a quarterly basis, we assess the likelihood that we will be able to recover our deferred tax assets against future sources of taxable income and reduce the carrying amounts of deferred tax assets by recording a valuation allowance if, based on the available evidence, it is more likely than not (defined as a likelihood of more than 50%) that all or a portion of such assets will not be realized.
this assessment takes into account both positive and negative evidence. a recent history of financial reporting losses is heavily weighted as a source of objectively verifiable negative evidence. due to our recent history of losses, we determined we could not include future projected earnings in our analysis. rather, we use systematic and logical methods to estimate when deferred tax liabilities will reverse and generate taxable income and when deferred tax assets will reverse and generate tax deductions. the selection of methodologies and assessment of when temporary differences will result in taxable or deductible amounts involves significant management judgment and is inherently complex and subjective. we believe that the methodologies we use are reasonable and can be replicated on a consistent basis in future periods.
deferred tax liabilities represent the assumed source of future taxable income and the majority are assumed to generate taxable amounts during the next five years. deferred tax assets include amounts related to pension and other postretirement benefits that are assumed to generate significant deductible amounts beyond five years. the company's valuation allowance of $4,550 million at december 31, 2023 primarily relates to pension and other postretirement benefit obligation deferred tax assets, tax net operating losses, tax credits and interest carryforwards that are assumed to reverse beyond the period in which reversals of deferred tax liabilities are assumed to occur. during 2023, the company increased the valuation allowance by $1,388 million primarily due to tax credits and other carryforwards generated in 2023 that cannot be realized in 2023. until the company generates sustained levels of profitability, additional valuation allowances may have to be recorded with corresponding adverse impacts on earnings and/or other comprehensive income.

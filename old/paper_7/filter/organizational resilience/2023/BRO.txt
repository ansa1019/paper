item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations.
general company overview the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes to those financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10-k, which are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america ("gaap"). in addition, see "information regarding non-gaap financial measures" below regarding important information on non-gaap financial measures contained in our discussion and analysis.
we are a diversified insurance agency, wholesale brokerage, insurance programs and services organization headquartered in daytona beach, florida. as an insurance intermediary, our principal sources of revenue are commissions paid by insurance companies and, to a lesser extent, fees paid directly by customers. commission revenues generally represent a percentage of the premium paid by an insured and are affected by fluctuations in both premium rate levels charged by insurance companies and the insureds' underlying "insurable exposure units," which are units that insurance companies use to measure or express insurance exposed to risk (such as property values, sales or payroll levels) to determine what premium to charge the insured. insurance companies establish these premium rates based upon many factors, including loss experience, risk profile and reinsurance rates paid by such insurance companies, none of which we control. we also participate in capitalized captive insurance facilities (the "captives") for the purpose of having additional capacity to place coverage, drive additional revenues and to participate in underwriting results. the captives focus on property insurance for earthquake and wind exposed properties underwritten by certain of our mgus and limit the company's exposure to claims expenses through reinsurance or by only participating in certain tranches of the underwriting.
we have increased revenues every year from 1993 to 2023, with the exception of 2009, when our revenues declined 1.0%. our revenues grew from $95.6 million in 1993 to $4.3 billion in 2023, reflecting a compound annual growth rate of 13.5%. in the same 30-year period, we increased net income from $8.1 million to $870.5 million in 2023, a 16.9% compound annual growth rate.
the volume of business from new and existing customers, fluctuations in insurable exposure units, changes in premium rate levels, changes in general economic and competitive conditions, a reduction of purchased limits or the occurrence of catastrophic weather events all affect our revenues. for example, higher levels of inflation, an increase the value of insurable exposure units, or a general decline in economic activity, could increase or decrease the value of insurable exposure units. conversely, increasing costs of litigation settlements and awards could cause some customers to seek higher levels of insurance coverage. historically, we have grown our revenues as a result of our focus on net new business and acquisitions. we foster a strong, decentralized sales and service culture, which enables responsiveness to changing business conditions and drives accountability for results.
the term "core commissions and fees" excludes profit-sharing contingent commissions, and therefore represents the revenues earned directly from specific insurance policies sold, and specific fee-based services rendered. the net change in core commissions and fees reflects the aggregate changes attributable to: (i) net new and lost accounts; (ii) net changes in our customers' exposure units, deductibles or insured limits; (iii) net changes in insurance premium rates or the commission rate paid to us by our carrier partners; (iv) the net change in fees paid to us by our customers; and (v) any businesses acquired or disposed of.
we also earn profit-sharing contingent commissions, which are commissions based primarily on underwriting results, but in select situations may reflect additional considerations for volume, growth and/or retention. these commissions, which are included in our commissions and fees in the consolidated statements of income, are estimated and accrued throughout the year based on actual premiums written and knowledge, to the extent it is available, of losses incurred. payments are primarily received in the first and second quarters of each subsequent year, based upon the aforementioned considerations for the prior year(s), but may differ from the amount estimated and accrued due to the lack of complete loss information until paid. over the last three years, profit-sharing contingent commissions have averaged approximately 3.3% of commissions and fees revenue.
fee revenues primarily relate to services other than securing coverage for our customers, and for fees negotiated in lieu of commissions. fee revenues are generated by: (i) our services segment, which is primarily a fee-based business that provides insurance-related services, including third-party claims administration and comprehensive medical utilization management services in both the workers' compensation and all-lines liability arenas, as well as medicare set-aside services, social security disability and medicare benefits advocacy services, and claims adjusting services; (ii) our national programs and wholesale brokerage segments, which earn fees primarily for the issuance of insurance policies on behalf of insurance companies; and (iii) our retail segment in our large-account customer base, where we primarily earn fees for securing insurance for our customers, and in our automobile dealer services ("f&i") businesses where we earn fees for assisting our customers with creating and selling warranty and service risk management programs. fee revenues as a percentage of our total commissions and fees, represented 23.9% in 2023 and 25.8% in 2022.
for the year ended december 31, 2023, our commissions and fees growth rate was 17.9% and our consolidated organic revenue growth rate was 10.2%.
historically, investment income has consisted primarily of interest earnings on operating cash and where permitted, on premiums and advance premiums collected and held in a fiduciary capacity before being remitted to insurance companies. our policy as it relates to the company's capital is to invest available funds in high-quality, short-term money-market funds and fixed income investment securities. investment income also includes gains and losses realized from the sale of investments. other income primarily reflects other miscellaneous revenues.
income before income taxes for the year ended december 31, 2023 increased by $270.0 million, or 30.8% over 2022, driven by net new business, growth from existing customers, acquisitions we completed in the last 12 months and an increase in the (gain)/loss on disposal primarily associated with the divestiture of certain businesses within the services segment during the fourth quarter of 2023, which were partially offset by incremental operating costs, increased amortization expense as a result of acquisitions, along with higher interest expense associated with an increase in the reference rate associated with the portion of our debt that carries a floating rate, and an increase in the change in estimated acquisition earn-out payables.
information regarding non-gaap financial measures in the discussion and analysis of our results of operations, in addition to reporting financial results in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles ("gaap"), we provide references to the following non-gaap financial measures as defined in regulation g of the sec rules: total revenues - adjusted, organic revenue, ebitdac, ebitdac margin, ebitdac - adjusted and ebitdac margin - adjusted. we present these measures because we believe such information is of interest to the investment community and because we believe it provides additional meaningful methods to evaluate the company's operating performance from period to period on a basis that may not be otherwise apparent on a gaap basis due to the impact of certain items that have a high degree of variability, that we believe are not indicative of ongoing performance and that are not easily comparable from period to period. this non-gaap financial information should be considered in addition to, not in lieu of, the company's consolidated income statements and balance sheets as of the relevant date. consistent with regulation g, a description of such information is provided below and tabular reconciliations of this supplemental non-gaap financial information to our most comparable gaap information are contained in this annual report on form 10-k under "results of operations - segment information.
we view organic revenue and organic revenue growth as important indicators when assessing and evaluating our performance on a consolidated basis and for each of our four segments, because they allow us to determine a comparable, but non-gaap, measurement of revenue growth that is associated with the revenue sources that were a part of our business in both the current and prior year and that are expected to continue in the future. we also view total revenues - adjusted, ebitdac, ebitdac - adjusted, ebitdac margin and ebitdac margin - adjusted as important indicators when assessing and evaluating our performance, as they present more comparable measurements of our operating margins in a meaningful and consistent manner. as disclosed in our most recent proxy statement, we use organic revenue growth, and ebitdac margin - adjusted as key performance metrics for our short-term and long-term incentive compensation plans for executive officers and other key employees.
non-gaap revenue measures
•organic revenue is our core commissions and fees less: (i) the core commissions and fees earned for the first 12 months by newly acquired operations; (ii) divested business (core commissions and fees generated from offices, books of business or niches sold or terminated during the comparable period); and (iii) foreign currency translation (as defined below). the term "core commissions and fees" excludes profit-sharing contingent commissions and therefore represents the revenues earned directly from specific insurance policies sold and specific fee-based services rendered. organic revenue can be expressed as a dollar amount or a percentage rate when describing organic revenue growth.
non-gaap earnings measures
•ebitdac is defined as income before interest, income taxes, depreciation, amortization and the change in estimated acquisition earn-out payables.
definitions related to certain components of non-gaap measures
•"acquisition/integration costs" means the acquisition and integration costs (e.g., costs associated with regulatory filings, legal/accounting services, due diligence and the costs of integrating our information technology systems) arising out of our acquisitions of grp (jersey) holdco limited and its business ("grp"), orchid underwriters agency and crosscover insurance services ("orchid"), and bdb limited companies ("bdb"), which are not considered to be normal, recurring or part of the ongoing operations.
•"foreign currency translation" means the period-over-period impact of foreign currency translation, which is calculated by applying current-year foreign exchange rates to the various functional currencies in our business to our reporting currency of u.s. dollars for the same period in the prior year.
•"1q23 nonrecurring cost" means approximately $11.0 million expensed and substantially paid in the first quarter of 2023 to resolve a business matter, which is not considered to be normal, recurring or part of the ongoing operations.
our industry peers may provide similar supplemental non-gaap information with respect to one or more of these measures, although they may not use the same or comparable terminology and may not make identical adjustments and, therefore, comparability may be limited. this supplemental non-gaap financial information should be considered in addition to, and not in lieu of, the company's consolidated financial statements.
acquisitions part of our business strategy is to attract high-quality insurance intermediaries and service organizations to join our operations. from 1993 through the fourth quarter of 2023, we acquired 644 insurance intermediary operations.
critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with gaap. the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. we continually evaluate our estimates, which are based upon a combination of historical experience and assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. these estimates form the basis for our judgments about the recognition of revenues, expenses, carrying values of our assets and liabilities, of which values are not readily apparent from other sources. actual results may differ from these estimates.
we believe that of our significant accounting and reporting policies, the more critical policies include our accounting for revenue recognition, business combinations and purchase price allocations, intangible asset impairments, non-cash stock-based compensation and reserves for litigation. in particular, the accounting for these areas is subject to uncertainty because it requires significant use of judgment to be made by management. different assumptions in the application of these policies could result in material changes in our consolidated financial position or consolidated results of operations.
revenue recognition the majority of our revenue is commissions derived from our performance as agents and brokers, acting on behalf of insurance carriers to sell products to customers that are seeking to transfer risk, and conversely, acting on behalf of those customers in negotiating with insurance carriers seeking to acquire risk in exchange for premiums. in the majority of these arrangements, our performance obligation is complete upon the effective date of the bound policy, as such, that is when the associated revenue is recognized. in some arrangements, where we are compensated through commissions, we also perform other services for our customer beyond binding of coverage. in those arrangements we apportion the commission between binding of coverage and other services based on their relative fair value and recognize the associated revenue as those performance obligations are satisfied. where the company's performance obligations have been completed, but the final amount of compensation is unknown due to variable factors, we estimate the amount of such compensation. we refine those estimates upon our receipt of additional information or final settlement, whichever occurs first.
to a lesser extent, the company earns revenues in the form of fees. like commissions, fees paid to us in lieu of commission, are recognized upon the effective date of the bound policy. when we are paid a fee for service, however, the associated revenue is recognized over a period of time that coincides with when the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefit of our work, which characterizes most of our claims processing arrangements and various services performed in our property and casualty, and employee benefits practices. other fees are typically recognized upon the completion of the delivery of the agreed-upon services to the customer.
to a much lesser extent, the company earns revenues in the form of net retained earned premiums in connection with the captives. these premiums are reported net of the ceded premiums for reinsurance and recognized evenly over the associated policy periods.
management determines a policy cancellation reserve based upon historical cancellation experience adjusted in accordance with known circumstances.
see note 2 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the nature and timing of our revenues.
business combinations and purchase price allocations we have acquired significant intangible assets through acquisitions of businesses. these assets generally consist of purchased customer accounts, non-compete agreements, and the excess of purchase prices over the fair value of identifiable net assets acquired (goodwill). the determination of estimated useful lives and the allocation of purchase price to intangible assets requires significant judgment and affects the amount of future amortization and possible impairment charges.
in connection with acquisitions, we record the estimated value of the net tangible assets purchased and the value of the identifiable intangible assets purchased, which typically consist of purchased customer accounts and non-compete agreements. purchased customer accounts include the right to represent insureds or claimants supported by the physical records and files obtained from acquired businesses that contain information about insurance policies, customers and other matters essential to policy renewals of delivery of services. their value primarily represents the present value of the underlying net cash flows expected to be received over the estimated future duration of the acquired customer relationships. the valuation of purchased customer accounts involves significant estimates and assumptions concerning matters such as cancellation frequency, expenses and discount rates. any change in these assumptions could affect the carrying value of purchased customer accounts. non-compete agreements are valued based upon their duration and any unique features of the particular agreements. purchased customer accounts and non-compete agreements are amortized on a straight-line basis over the related estimated lives and contract periods, which typically range from 3 to 15 years. the excess of the purchase price of an acquisition over the fair value of the identifiable tangible and intangible assets is assigned to goodwill and is not amortized.
the recorded purchase prices for all acquisitions include an estimation of the fair value of liabilities associated with any potential earn-out provisions, where an earn-out is part of the negotiated transaction. subsequent changes in the fair value of earn-out obligations are recorded in the consolidated statement of income as a result of updated expectations for the performance of the associated business.
the fair value of earn-out obligations is based upon the present value of the expected future payments to be made to the sellers of the acquired businesses in accordance with the provisions contained in the respective purchase agreements. in determining fair value, the acquired business's future performance is estimated using financial projections developed by management for the acquired business, and this estimate reflects market participant assumptions regarding revenue growth and/or profitability. the expected future payments are estimated based on the earn-out formula and performance targets specified in each purchase agreement compared to the associated financial projections. these estimates are then discounted to a present value using a risk-adjusted rate that takes into consideration the likelihood that the forecast earn-out payments will be made.
intangible assets impairment goodwill is subject to at least an annual assessment for impairment, measured by a fair-value-based test. amortizable intangible assets are amortized over their useful lives and are subject to an impairment review based upon an estimate of the undiscounted future cash flows resulting from the use of the assets. to determine if there is potential impairment of goodwill, we compare the fair value of each reporting unit with its carrying value. the company may elect to first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that a reporting unit is impaired. if the company does not perform a qualitative assessment, or as a result of the qualitative assessment, it is not determined that the fair value of the reporting unit more likely than not exceeds the carrying amount, the company will calculate the fair value of the reporting unit for comparison against the carrying value. if the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value, an impairment loss would be recorded to the extent that the fair value of the goodwill within the reporting unit is less than its carrying value. fair value is estimated based upon multiples of earnings, or on a discounted cash flow basis.
management assesses the recoverability of our goodwill and our amortizable intangibles and other long-lived assets annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable. any of the following factors, if present, may trigger an impairment review: (i) a significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results, (ii) a significant negative industry or economic trend, and (iii) a significant decline in our market capitalization. if the recoverability of these assets is unlikely because of the existence of one or more of the above-referenced factors, an impairment analysis is performed. management must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of these assets. if these estimates or related assumptions change in the future, we may be required to revise the assessment and, if appropriate, record an impairment charge. we completed our most recent evaluation of impairment for goodwill as of november 30, 2023 and determined that the fair value of goodwill exceeded the carrying value of such assets. additionally, there have been no impairments recorded for amortizable intangible assets for the years ended december 31, 2023 and 2022.
non-cash stock-based compensation we grant non-vested stock awards to our employees, with the related compensation expense recognized in the financial statements over the associated service period based upon the grant-date fair value of those awards, subject to any performance modification. during the performance measurement period, we review the probable outcome of the performance conditions associated with our performance awards quarterly and adjust the expense recognition accruals with the expected performance outcome.
during the first quarter of 2022, the performance conditions for approximately 1.3 million shares of the company's common stock granted under the company's 2010 sip and approximately 22,000 shares of the company's common stock granted under the company's 2019 sip were determined by the compensation committee to have been satisfied relative to the performance-based grants issued in 2019 and 2021.
these grants had a performance measurement period that concluded on december 31, 2021. the vesting condition for these grants requires continuous employment for a period of up to five years from the 2019 grant date and four years from the 2021 grant date in order for the awarded shares to become fully vested and nonforfeitable. as a result of the awarding of these shares, the grantees will be eligible to receive payments of dividends and exercise voting privileges. the awarded shares will be included as issued and outstanding common stock shares and included in the calculation of basic and diluted net income per share.
during the first quarter of 2023, the performance conditions for approximately 970,000 shares of the company's common stock granted under the under the company's 2019 sip were determined by the compensation committee to have been satisfied relative to the performance-based grants issued in 2020 and 2022. these grants had a performance measurement period that concluded on december 31, 2022. the vesting condition for these grants requires continuous employment for a period of up to five years from the 2020 grant date and four years from the 2022 grant date in order for the awarded shares to become fully vested and nonforfeitable. as a result of the awarding of these shares, the grantees will be eligible to receive payments of dividends and exercise voting privileges. the awarded shares will be included as issued and outstanding common stock shares and included in the calculation of basic and diluted net income per share.
during the first quarter of 2024, the performance conditions for approximately 1,200,000 shares of the company's common stock granted under the under the company's 2019 sip were determined by the compensation committee to have been satisfied relative to the performance-based grants issued in 2021 and 2023. these grants had a performance measurement period that concluded on december 31, 2023. the vesting condition for these grants requires continuous employment for a period of up to five years from the 2021 grant date and four years from the 2023 grant date in order for the awarded shares to become fully vested and nonforfeitable. as a result of the awarding of these shares, the grantees will be eligible to receive payments of dividends and exercise voting privileges. the awarded shares will be included as issued and outstanding common stock shares and included in the calculation of basic and diluted net income per share.
litigation and claims we are subject to numerous litigation claims that arise in the ordinary course of business. if it is probable that a liability has been incurred at the date of the financial statements and the amount of the loss is estimable, an accrual for the costs to resolve these claims is recorded in accrued expenses in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. professional fees related to these claims are included in other operating expenses in the accompanying consolidated statement of income as incurred. management, with the assistance of in-house and outside counsel, determines whether it is probable that a liability has been incurred and estimates the amount of loss based upon analysis of individual issues. new developments or changes in settlement strategy in dealing with these matters may significantly affect the required reserves and affect our net income.
results of operations for the years ended december 31, 2023 and 2022
the following discussion and analysis regarding results of operations and liquidity and capital resources should be considered in conjunction with the accompanying consolidated financial statements and related notes. for a comparison of our results of operations and liquidity and capital resources for the years ended december 31, 2022 and 2021, see part ii, item 7 of our annual report on form 10-k filed with the securities and exchange commission on february 27, 2023.
financial information relating to our consolidated financial results is as follows:

(2)a non-gaap financial measure nmf = not a meaningful figure commissions and fees commissions and fees, including profit-sharing contingent commissions and earned premiums for 2023, increased $636.2 million to $4,199.4 million, or 17.9% over 2022. core commissions and fees in 2023 increased $595.0 million, composed of (i) $351.1 million of net new and renewal business, which reflects an organic revenue growth rate of 10.2%; (ii) $285.0 million from acquisitions that had no comparable revenues in the same period of 2022; (iii) an increase from the impact from foreign currency translation of $9.9 million; and (iv) an offsetting decrease of $51.0 million related to commissions and fees revenue from business divested in the preceding 12 months. profit-sharing contingent commissions for 2023 increased by $41.2 million, or 46.4%, compared to the same period in 2022. this increase was the result of recent acquisitions and qualifying for certain profit-sharing contingent commissions in 2023 that we did not qualify for in the prior year, partially due to a quieter hurricane season in 2023 as compared to 2022.
other income, net other income for 2023 was $5.3 million, compared with $3.7 million in 2022. other income consists primarily of miscellaneous income and therefore can fluctuate between comparable periods.
employee compensation and benefits employee compensation and benefits expense as a percentage of total revenues was 51.4% for the year ended december 31, 2023 as compared to 50.8% for the year ended december 31, 2022, and increased 20.3%, or $369.7 million. this increase included $158.8 million of compensation costs related to stand-alone acquisitions that had no comparable costs in the same period of 2022. therefore, employee compensation and benefits expense attributable to those offices that existed in the same time periods of 2023 and 2022 increased by $210.9 million or 12.3%. this underlying employee compensation and benefits expense increase was primarily related to: (i) an increase in staff salaries and bonuses attributable to new hires; (ii) an increase in producer compensation associated with revenue growth; (iii) an increase in non-cash stock-based compensation driven by the strong financial performance of the company and (iv) the year-over-year increase of approximately $46.5 million in the value of deferred compensation liabilities driven by changes in the market prices of our employees' investment elections associated with our deferred compensation plan, with such amount substantially offset within other operating expenses as we hold assets to fund these liabilities that closely match the investment elections of our employees.
other operating expenses other operating expenses represented 15.3% of total revenues for 2023 as compared to 16.7% for the year ended december 31, 2022. other operating expenses for 2023 increased $53.1 million, or 8.9%, from the same period of 2022. the net increase included: (i) $54.3 million of other operating expenses related to stand-alone acquisitions that had no comparable costs in the same period of 2022; (ii) expenses of approximately $11.0 million to resolve a business matter during the first quarter of 2023 which is not considered to be normal, recurring or part of the ongoing operations; (iii) increased variable travel and entertainment costs, offset by (iv) the year-over-year increase of approximately $46.5 million in the value of assets held to fund the associated liabilities within our deferred compensation plan, which was substantially offset within employee compensation and benefits as noted above, and (v) prior year expenses of approximately $11.5 million recorded within our captives as a result of the estimated insured property claims associated with hurricane ian.
gain or loss on disposal the company recognized net gains on disposals of $143.3 million in 2023 and $4.5 million in 2022. the gains on disposal were due to activity associated with sales of businesses or book of business. although we do not routinely sell businesses or customer accounts, we periodically sell an office or a book of business (one or more customer accounts) that we believe does not produce reasonable margins or demonstrate a potential for growth, or because doing so is in the company's best interest. in 2023 we recorded a gain on disposal of $134.6 million in our services segment associated with the sale of certain third-party claims administration and adjusting services businesses in the fourth quarter of 2023.
amortization amortization expense for 2023 increased $19.4 million to $166.0 million, or 13.2% over 2022. this increase reflects the amortization of new intangibles from businesses acquired within the past 12 months, net of certain intangible assets becoming fully amortized or written off in the gain or loss on disposal.
depreciation depreciation expense for 2023 increased $0.8 million to $40.0 million, or 2.0% over 2022. changes in depreciation expense reflect net additions of fixed assets resulting from businesses acquired in the past 12 months and the addition of fixed assets resulting from business initiatives, net of the impact of fixed assets that became fully depreciated or written off in the gain or loss on disposal.
interest expense interest expense for 2023 increased $48.8 million to $190.0 million, or 34.6%, from 2022. the increase is due to higher average debt balances resulting from debt issuance and bank financing in the first quarter of 2022 to fund the acquisitions of orchid, grp, and bdb, as well as increases in the floating-rate benchmark associated with our adjustable-rate debt.
change in estimated acquisition earn-out payables accounting standards codification ("asc") topic 805-business combinations is the authoritative guidance requiring an acquirer to recognize 100% of the fair value of acquired assets, including goodwill and assumed liabilities (with only limited exceptions) upon initially obtaining control of an acquired entity. additionally, the fair value of contingent consideration arrangements (such as earn-out purchase price arrangements) at the acquisition date must be included in the purchase price consideration. the recorded purchase price for acquisitions includes an estimation of the fair value of liabilities associated with any potential earn-out provisions. subsequent changes in these earn-out obligations are required to be recorded in the consolidated statement of income when incurred or reasonably estimated. estimations of potential earn-out obligations are typically based upon future earnings of the acquired operations or entities, usually for periods ranging from one to three years.
the net charge or credit to the consolidated statements of income for the period is the combination of the net change in the estimated acquisition earn-out payables liability, and the accretion of the present value discount on those liabilities.
as of december 31, 2023, the fair values of the estimated acquisition earn-out payables were reevaluated and measured at fair value on a recurring basis using unobservable inputs (level 3) as defined in asc 820-fair value measurement. the resulting net changes, as well as the interest expense accretion on the estimated acquisition earn-out payables, for the years ended december 31, 2023 and 2022 were as follows:
change in fair value of estimated acquisition earn-out payables         $14.1       $(45.9      )
net change in earnings from estimated acquisition                       $21.8       $(38.9      )
earn-out payables for the years ended december 31, 2023 and 2022, the fair value of estimated earn-out payables was reevaluated and increased by $14.1 million for 2023 and decreased by $45.9 million for 2022, which are charges and credits respectively, exclusive of interest expense accretion, to the consolidated statements of income for 2023 and 2022.
as of december 31, 2023, the estimated acquisition earn-out payables equaled $249.2 million, of which $145.9 million was recorded as accounts payable and $103.3 million was recorded as other non-current liabilities. as of december 31, 2022, the estimated acquisition earn-out payables equaled $251.6 million, of which $119.3 million was recorded as accounts payable and $132.3 million was recorded as other non-current liabilities.
results of operations - segment information as discussed in note 16 "segment information" of the notes to consolidated financial statements, we operate four reportable segments: retail, national programs, wholesale brokerage and services. on a segmented basis, changes in amortization, depreciation and interest expenses generally result from activity associated with acquisitions. likewise, other income consists primarily of miscellaneous income and therefore can fluctuate between comparable periods. as such, in evaluating the operational efficiency of a segment, management focuses on the organic revenue growth rate and ebitdac margin.
the reconciliation of total commissions and fees included in the consolidated statements of income to organic revenue, a non-gaap financial measure, including by segment, and the growth rates for organic revenue for the year ended december 31, 2023 are as follows:

(2)a non-gaap financial measure nmf = not a meaningful figure the retail segment's total revenues in 2023 increased 17.1%, or $355.7 million, over 2022, to $2,440.0 million. the $352.0 million increase in core commissions and fees was driven by the following: (i) approximately $203.5 million related to the core commissions and fees revenue from acquisitions that had no comparable revenues in the same period of 2022; (ii) an increase of $159.4 million related to net new and renewal business; (iii) an increase from the impact of foreign currency translation of $8.8 million; and (iv) an offsetting decrease of $20.2 million related to commissions and fees recorded in 2022 from businesses since divested. profit-sharing contingent commissions in 2023 increased 2.3%, or $1.1 million, over 2022, to $49.9. the retail segment's total commissions and fees increased 17.0% and the organic revenue growth rate was 7.9% for 2023. the organic revenue growth rate was driven by net new business written during the preceding 12 months and growth on renewals of existing customers. renewal business was impacted by rate increases and changes in insurable values in most lines of business with continued increases in commercial property and casualty, employee benefits, professional and excess liability partially offset by continued premium rate reductions in workers' compensation. this growth was partially offset by a decline in revenue within our f&i businesses due to the slowdown in automobile and recreational vehicle industries.
income before income taxes for 2023 increased 13.2%, or $61.7 million, over the same period in 2022, to $528.4 million. the primary factors driving this increase were: (i) the profit associated with the net increase in revenue as described above; (ii) the drivers of ebitdac - adjusted described below; (iii) the decrease in intercompany interest expense; and partially offset by (iv) an increase in the change in estimated acquisition earn-out payables; and (v) depreciation growing faster than total revenues.
ebitdac - adjusted for 2023 increased 15.7%, or $101.2 million, from the same period in 2023, to $747.6 million. ebitdac margin - adjusted for 2023 decreased to 30.6% from 30.9% in the same period in 2022. the decrease in ebitdac margin - adjusted was primarily driven by (i) increased variable operating expenses associated with travel and entertainment, (ii) higher compensation costs, which were driven by hiring more employees to support our current and future growth, (iii) inflation and (iv) non-cash stock-based compensation.
national programs segment the national programs segment manages over 60 programs supported by over 100 well-capitalized carrier partners. in most cases, the insurance carriers that support these programs have delegated underwriting and, in many instances, claims-handling authority to our programs operations. these programs are generally distributed through a nationwide network of independent agents and brown & brown retail agents, and offer targeted products and services designed for specific industries, trade groups, professions, public entities and market niches. this segment also operates our write-your-own flood insurance carrier, wnfic and participates in two captives. wnfic's underwriting business consists of policies written on behalf of and fully ceded to the nfip, as well as excess flood policies, which are fully reinsured in the private market. the captives provide additional underwriting capacity that enable growth in core commissions and fees, and allow us to participate in underwriting results with limited exposure to claims expenses. the company has traditionally participated in underwriting profits through profit-sharing contingent commissions. these captives give us another way to continue to participate in underwriting results while limiting exposure to claims expenses. the captives focus on property insurance for earthquake and wind exposed properties underwritten by certain of our mgus. the captives limit the company's exposure to claims expenses either through reinsurance or by participating in limited tranches of the underwriting risk.
the national programs segment operations can be grouped into five broad categories: professional programs, personal lines programs, commercial programs, public entity-related programs and specialty programs. approximately 76% of the national programs segment's commissions and fees revenue is commission based.

profit-sharing contingent commissions in 2023 increased 136.2%, or $37.6 million, from 2022, to $65.2 which was primarily driven by lower storm activity in 2023, qualifying for certain programs due to improved underwriting results and to a lesser extent favorable loss development associated with hurricane ian. the national programs segment's growth rate for total commissions and fees was 24.0% and the organic revenue growth rate was 17.2% for 2023. the organic revenue growth was driven primarily by strong new business, good retention and rate increases.
income before income taxes for 2023 increased 49.6%, or $134.4 million, from the same period in 2022, to $405.5 million. income before income taxes increased due to the drivers of ebitdac - adjusted described below. this was partially offset by increases in change in estimated acquisition earn-out payables, amortization and intercompany interest expense.
ebitdac - adjusted for 2023 increased 41.4%, or $142.8 million, from the same period in 2022, to $488.0 million. ebitdac margin - adjusted for 2023 increased to 45.3% from 40.2%. ebitdac - adjusted increased due to leveraging our expense base in connection with strong growth of total revenues - adjusted, increased profit-sharing contingent commissions and lower claims costs in our captives.
wholesale brokerage segment the wholesale brokerage segment markets and sells excess and surplus commercial and personal lines insurance, primarily through independent agents and brokers, including brown & brown retail agents. approximately 86% of the wholesale brokerage segment's commissions and fees revenue is commission based.

(2)a non-gaap financial measure nmf = not a meaningful figure the wholesale brokerage segment's total revenues for 2023 increased 19.3%, or $87.3 million, over 2022, to $540.7 million. the $83.7 million increase in core commissions and fees was driven by the following: (i) $53.2 million related to net new and renewal business; and (ii) $34.4 million related to core commissions and fees revenue from acquisitions that had no comparable revenues in the same period of 2022; and (iii) an increase from the impact of foreign currency translation of $1.1 million and partially offset by (iv) a decrease of $5.0 million related to commissions and fees recorded in 2022 from a business since divested. profit-sharing contingent commissions for 2023 increased $2.5 million compared to 2022, to $14.8 million, primarily driven by qualifying for certain profit-sharing contingent commissions in 2023 that we did not qualify for in the prior year and, to a lesser extent, by acquired businesses in the last year. the wholesale brokerage segment's growth rate for total commissions and fees was 19.0%, and the organic revenue growth rate was 12.2% for 2023. the organic revenue growth rate was driven by strong new business, good retention, as well as rate increases for most lines of coverage, except for professional liability which experienced rates that were flat to down as compared to the prior year.
income before income taxes for 2023 increased 6.9%, or $8.1 million, over 2022, to $125.8 million, primarily due to the following: (i) the growth of ebitdac - adjusted described below; (ii) a loss in the prior year from a business that was divested; (iii) lower intercompany interest expense; and (iv) a decrease in acquisition/integration costs; partially offset by (v) an increase in the change in estimated acquisition earn-out payables; and (vi) higher amortization expense.
ebitdac - adjusted for 2023 increased 18.3%, or $26.7 million, from the same period in 2022, to $172.4 million. ebitdac margin - adjusted for 2023 decreased to 31.9% from 32.0% for the same period in 2022 due to: (i) increased variable operating expenses, which were primarily travel and meeting related, (ii) non-cash stock-based compensation, (iii) certain nonrecurring operating expenses, which offset (iv) good organic growth and (v) higher profit-sharing contingent commissions.
services segment the services segment provides insurance-related services, including third-party claims administration and comprehensive medical utilization management services in both the workers' compensation and all-lines liability arenas. the services segment also provides medicare set-aside account services, social security disability and medicare benefits advocacy services, and claims adjusting services.
unlike the other segments, nearly all of the services segment's revenue is generated from fees which are not significantly affected by fluctuations in general insurance premiums.
in the fourth quarter of 2023, the company announced and completed the sale of certain third-party claims administration and adjusting services businesses within the services segment. the pre-tax gain on sale of the businesses was $134.6 million. the annual total revenues of the disposed businesses were approximately $90 million, and the ebitdac margin - adjusted for the disposed business was similar to the overall ebitdac margin - adjusted for the services segment in 2023.

(2)a non-gaap financial measure nmf = not a meaningful figure the services segment's total revenues for 2023 decreased 5.1%, or $8.8 million, from 2022, to $163.1 million. the $8.8 million decrease in core commissions and fees, was driven by: (i) continued external factors impacting our social security disability and medicare benefits advocacy services and medicare set-aside businesses and (ii) the sale of certain third-party claims administration and adjusting services businesses.
income before income taxes for 2023 increased 538.2%, or $129.7 million, from 2022, to $153.8 million due primarily to the gain on disposal associated with the sale of certain third-party claims administration and adjusting services businesses and the drivers of ebitdac - adjusted described below.

business overview strategies and initiatives in fiscal 2023, our b2b scoring solutions, including the flagship fico® score, continued to be the standard measure of consumer credit risk in the u.s. we continued to promote adoption of our most predictive scores, fico® score 10 and 10 t. internationally, we launched fico® score 10 in canada, fico® score 6 in south africa, and fico® score 4 and fico® extended score 4 in mexico, further expanding our financial inclusion initiatives. we also remained committed to expanding usage of the fico® resilience index, a complement to fico scores that identifies consumers who are more resilient to economic stress relative to other consumers within the same fico score bands. we continued to develop scores that use alternative data to enhance conventional credit bureau data and generate scores for otherwise un-scorable consumers.

item 7.    management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations.
general this discussion should be read in conjunction with the information contained in our consolidated financial statements, and the accompanying notes elsewhere in this report. unless otherwise indicated, the "company," "we," "us," "our" or similar words are used to refer to lyondellbasell industries n.v. together with its consolidated subsidiaries ("lyondellbasell n.v.").
effective january 1, 2023, our catalloy and polybutene-1 businesses were moved from the advanced polymer solutions ("aps") segment and reintegrated into the olefins and polyolefins-americas ("o&p-americas") and olefins and polyolefins-europe, asia, international ("o&p-eai") segments. this move allows the aps team to focus on our compounding and solutions business, and to develop a more agile operating model with meaningful regional and segment growth strategies. the segment information provided herein has been revised for all periods presented to reflect these changes.
the discussion summarizing the significant factors affecting the results of operations and financial condition for the year ended december 31, 2021 and for the year ended december 31, 2022 compared to 2021 has been excluded from this form 10-k and can be found in the update to part ii, "item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations" of our annual report on form 10-k for the year ended december 31, 2022 as reported in exhibit 99.1 to the current report on form 8-k of the company filed with the securities and exchange commission on may 12, 2023 and is incorporated herein by reference.
overview throughout 2023, petrochemical markets faced headwinds from soft global demand, capacity additions and economic uncertainty. markets were broadly pressured by weak demand for durable goods which impacted margins in the o&p-americas, o&p-eai, intermediates & derivatives ("i&d") and aps segments. refining results declined primarily as a result of lower demand for diesel and other distillates, compared to the prior year. in contrast, oxyfuels margins benefited from tight supply and strong summertime gasoline crack spreads.
during 2023, we recognized non-cash impairment charges of $518 million, primarily consisting of a goodwill impairment charge of $252 million in our aps segment and an impairment charge of $192 million related to our european po joint venture recognized in our i&d segment.
in the first quarter of 2023, we started up the world's largest propylene oxide (po) and tertiary butyl alcohol (tba) unit in texas. these new assets on the u.s. gulf coast have an annual capacity of 470 thousand metric tons of po and one million metric tons of tba and its derivatives.
in may 2023, we issued our inaugural $500 million green bond. proceeds from the bond are being used to finance or refinance, in whole or in part, new or existing eligible green projects in the areas of circular economy, renewable energy, pollution prevention and control, and energy efficiency.
during 2023, we generated $4.9 billion in cash from operating activities. we remain committed to a disciplined approach to capital allocation. additionally, approximately $1.5 billion was reinvested in the business through capital expenditures while $1.8 billion was returned to shareholders through quarterly dividends and share repurchases.
table of contents results of operations for the periods discussed are presented in the table below.
year ended december 31, millions of dollars                                                                     2023                            2022

results of operations revenues-revenues decreased by $9,344 million, or 19%, in 2023 compared to 2022. average sales prices in 2023 were lower for many of our products, as sales prices generally correlate with crude oil prices, which decreased relative to 2022. these lower prices led to a 21% decrease in revenue. volume improvements resulted in a 1% increase in revenue, primarily driven by increased i&d sales volumes. favorable foreign exchange impacts resulted in a 1% increase in revenue.
cost of sales-cost of sales decreased by $7,998 million, or 18%, in 2023 compared to 2022. this decrease primarily related to lower feedstock and energy costs. fluctuations in our cost of sales are generally driven by changes in feedstock and energy costs. on an annual basis, feedstock and energy related costs generally represent approximately 70% to 80% of cost of sales. other variable costs account for approximately 10% of cost of sales and fixed operating costs, consisting primarily of expenses associated with employee compensation, depreciation and amortization, and maintenance, account for the remainder.
impairments-during 2023, we recognized non-cash impairment charges of $518 million, primarily consisting of a goodwill impairment charge of $252 million in our aps segment and an impairment charge of $192 million related to our european po joint venture recognized in our i&d segment. during 2022 we recognized a non-cash impairment of $69 million related to the sale of our australian polypropylene manufacturing facility. see notes 8, 9 and 21 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding impairment charges.
table of contents sg&a expenses-selling, general and administrative ("sg&a") expenses increased by $247 million, or 19%, in 2023 compared to 2022. approximately 60% of this increase was attributable to higher employee-related expenses and the remaining increase was primarily driven by professional fees incurred for strategic projects.
operating income-operating income decreased by $2,048 million, or 40%, in 2023 compared to 2022. in 2023, operating income decreased for our refining, o&p-americas, i&d, aps and o&p-eai segments by $668 million, $541 million, $342 million, $277 million and $235 million, respectively. operating income for our technology segment increased by $3 million in 2023 compared to 2022. results for each of our business segments are discussed further in the segment analysis section below.
interest expense-interest expense increased by $190 million, or 66%, in 2023 compared to 2022. approximately 55% of this increase was attributable to lower capitalized interest associated with our new po/tba plant which started-up in the first quarter of 2023. the remaining increase was primarily due to the impact of our fixed-for-floating interest rate swaps driven by higher interest rates in 2023.
interest income-interest income increased by $100 million, or 345%, in 2023 compared to 2022. approximately three quarters of the increase was due to higher interest rates in 2023. the remaining increase was driven by higher cash balances during 2023.
income taxes-our effective income tax rates of 19.1% in 2023 and 18.5% in 2022 resulted in tax provisions of $501 million and $882 million, respectively. in 2023, non-deductible impairments, an audit settlement in the second quarter, and fluctuations in uncertain tax positions increased the effective tax rate by 1.1%, 1.4%, and 2.2%, respectively. these increases were partially offset by decreases in the effective tax rate of 2.8% related to changes in pre-tax income in countries with varying statutory tax rates and 1.0% related to a patent box ruling received in the fourth quarter of 2023. for additional information, see note 17 to the consolidated financial statements.
comprehensive income-comprehensive income decreased by $2,303 million in 2023 compared to 2022, primarily due to a decrease in net income. the activities from the remaining components of comprehensive income are discussed below.
financial derivatives designated as cash flow hedges, primarily our forward-starting interest rate swaps, led to a decrease in comprehensive income of $288 million in 2023 compared to 2022, due to periodic changes in the benchmark interest rates combined with a decrease in notional outstanding.
defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans led to a decrease in comprehensive income of $443 million in 2023 compared to 2022, primarily due to actuarial losses resulting from lower-than-expected asset returns combined with the absence of pre-tax pension settlements in 2023.
foreign currency translations increased comprehensive income by $196 million in 2023 compared to 2022, primarily due to the weakening of the u.s. dollar relative to the euro and the british pound sterling in 2023, offset by the effective portion of our net investment hedges.
see notes 14, 15 and 19 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussions.
table of contents segment analysis we use earnings from continuing operations before interest, income taxes, and depreciation and amortization ("ebitda") as our measure of profitability for segment reporting purposes. this measure of segment operating results is used by our chief operating decision maker to assess the performance of, and allocate resources to, our operating segments. intersegment eliminations and items that are not directly related or allocated to business operations, such as foreign exchange gains (losses) and components of pension and other post-retirement benefit costs other than service cost, are included in "other." for additional information related to our operating segments, as well as a reconciliation of ebitda to its nearest generally accepted accounting principles ("gaap") measure, income from continuing operations before income taxes, see note 21 to our consolidated financial statements.
the following table presents the reconciliation of net income to ebitda for each of the periods presented:
year ended december 31, millions of u.s. dollars                                                 2023                            2022
loss from discontinued operations, net of tax                          5                               5
table of contents our continuing operations are managed through six reportable segments: o&p-americas, o&p-eai, i&d, aps, refining and technology. revenues and the components of ebitda for the periods presented are reflected in the tables below for our reportable segments:
year ended december 31, millions of dollars                                             2023                            2022

in calculating the impact of margin and volume on ebitda, consistent with industry practice, management offsets revenues and volumes related to ethylene co-products against the cost to produce ethylene. volume and price impacts of ethylene co-products are reported in margin.
ethylene raw materials-ethylene and its co-products are produced from two major raw material groups:
•ngls, principally ethane and propane, the prices of which are generally affected by natural gas prices; and
•crude oil-based liquids ("liquids" or "heavy liquids"), including naphtha, condensates and gas oils, the prices of which are generally related to crude oil prices.
we have flexibility to vary the raw material mix and process conditions in our u.s. olefins plants in order to maximize profitability as market prices fluctuate for both feedstocks and products. although prices of crude-based liquids and natural gas liquids are generally related to crude oil and natural gas prices, during specific periods the relationships among these materials and benchmarks may vary significantly. ethane made up approximately 70% of the raw materials used in our north american crackers in 2023 and 2022.
table of contents the following table sets forth selected financial information for the o&p-americas segment including income from equity investments, which is a component of ebitda.
year ended december 31, millions of dollars                                          2023                            2022
sales and other operating revenues                   $11,280                         $14,480
revenues-revenues decreased by $3,200 million, or 22%, in 2023 compared to 2022. lower average sales prices resulted in a 23% decrease in revenue primarily driven by increased market supply and lower demand. higher volumes due to improved operating rates resulted in a 1% increase in revenue.
ebitda-ebitda decreased by $562 million, or 20%, in 2023 compared to 2022. lower polyolefins results led to a 29% decrease in ebitda primarily driven by lower margins as a result of lower average sales prices reflecting softer demand and new industry capacity. higher olefins results contributed to a 7% increase in ebitda driven equally by increased volumes and higher margins, due to higher operating rates and lower feedstock and energy costs, respectively.
olefins and polyolefins-europe, asia, international segment overview-ebitda decreased in 2023 compared to 2022 primarily as a result of lower polyolefin margins partially offset by higher olefins results.
in calculating the impact of margin and volume on ebitda, consistent with industry practice, management offsets revenues and volumes related to ethylene co-products against the cost to produce ethylene. volume and price impacts of ethylene co-products are reported in margin.
ethylene raw materials-in europe, naphtha is the primary raw material for our ethylene production and represents approximately 65% to 70% of the raw materials used in 2023 and 2022.
the following table sets forth selected financial information for the o&p-eai segment including loss from equity investments, which is a component of ebitda.
year ended december 31, millions of dollars                                 2023                            2022
sales and other operating revenues          $10,479                         $13,455
revenues-revenues decreased by $2,976 million, or 22%, in 2023 compared to 2022. lower average sales prices resulted in a 23% decrease in revenue as sales prices generally correlate with crude oil prices, which, on average, decreased compared to 2022. lower volumes resulted in a revenue decrease of 1% primarily due to weak demand. favorable foreign exchange impacts resulted in a revenue increase of 2%.
table of contents ebitda-ebitda decreased by $187 million, or 105%, in 2023 compared to 2022. lower polyolefins results led to a 241% decrease in ebitda primarily driven by decreased margins due to lower average sales prices reflecting weak demand. higher olefins results led to an 88% increase in ebitda driven equally by higher volumes and margins resulting from the absence of planned and unplanned downtime and lower feedstock and energy costs, respectively. in 2022, we recognized a $69 million non-cash impairment charge in conjunction with the sale of our polypropylene manufacturing facility located in australia. the absence of this charge in 2023 resulted in a 39% increase in ebitda. see note 21 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.
intermediates and derivatives segment overview-ebitda decreased in 2023 compared to 2022, primarily driven by a non-cash impairment charge related to our european po joint venture recognized in 2023. segment results were relatively unchanged as improvements in our oxyfuels and related products results were offset by lower margins for propylene oxide and derivatives and intermediate chemicals.
the following table sets forth selected financial information for the i&d segment including loss from equity investments, which is a component of ebitda.
year ended december 31, millions of dollars                                 2023   2022
sales and other operating revenues          $11,086                         $12,950
revenues-revenues decreased by $1,864 million, or 14%, in 2023 compared to 2022. lower average sales prices resulted in a 20% decrease in revenue as a result of lower demand. sales volumes increased resulting in a 5% increase in revenue primarily due to additional volumes derived from our new po/tba facility and strong demand. favorable foreign exchange impacts resulted in a revenue increase of 1%.
ebitda-ebitda decreased $193 million, or 10%, in 2023 compared to 2022. during 2023, we recognized a non-cash impairment charge of $192 million related to our equity investment in the european po joint venture resulting in a 10% decrease in ebitda. see note 9 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.
excluding the impact of the impairment discussed above, segment results remained relatively unchanged. improved oxyfuels and related products results led to an ebitda increase of 31% primarily driven by increased volumes due to increased capacity related to our po/tba facility combined with higher margins due to increased gasoline cracks. this improvement was largely offset by a 20% decrease in ebitda from propylene oxide and derivatives results as margins decreased due to lower demand for durable goods. lower intermediate chemicals results led to a 9% decrease in ebitda driven by lower margins as demand softened.
table of contents advanced polymer solutions segment overview-ebitda decreased in 2023 compared to 2022, primarily due to the recognition of a $252 million non-cash goodwill impairment charge in 2023.
the following table sets forth selected financial information for the aps segment including loss from equity investments, which is a component of ebitda.
year ended december 31, millions of dollars                                 2023                            2022
sales and other operating revenues           $3,698                          $4,202
revenues-revenues decreased in 2023 by $504 million, or 12%, compared to 2022. average sales price declines resulted in an 11% decrease in revenue as a result of lower demand. sales volumes declines resulted in a 2% decrease in revenue stemming from lower demand. favorable foreign exchange impacts resulted in a revenue increase of 1%.
ebitda-ebitda decreased in 2023 by $277 million, or 241%, compared to 2022. during 2023, we recognized a non-cash goodwill impairment charge of $252 million after the effect of moving our catalloy and polybutene-1 businesses from our aps segment and reintegrating them into our o&p-americas and o&p-eai segments. this impairment charge resulted in a 219% decrease in ebitda. see note 8 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. lower volumes resulted in a 43% decrease in ebitda as a result of a decline in demand. during 2023 and 2022, we recognized a lifo inventory benefit of $8 million and charge of $21 million, respectively, which resulted in a 25% increase in ebitda.
the following table sets forth selected financial information and heavy crude oil processing rates for the refining segment and the u.s. refining market margins for the applicable periods. "brent" is a light sweet crude oil and is one of the main benchmark prices for purchases of oil worldwide. "maya" is a heavy sour crude oil grade produced in mexico that is a relevant benchmark for heavy sour crude oils in the u.s. gulf coast market. references to industry benchmarks for refining market margins are to industry prices reported by platts, a division of s&p global.

table of contents revenues-revenues decreased by $2,179 million, or 18%, in 2023 compared to 2022. lower product prices led to a revenue decrease of 19% as the average brent crude oil price decreased approximately $16.68 per barrel. sales volumes led to a revenue increase 1% due to higher operating rates at our fluid catalytic cracker and coker units, which yielded more higher-value refined products such as gasoline and distillates.
ebitda-ebitda decreased by $542 million or 59%, in 2023 compared to 2022. lower margins drove a 45% decrease in ebitda primarily due to a decrease in the maya 2-1-1 industry crack spread of approximately $6 per barrel as a result of lower demand for diesel and other distillates, compared to the prior year. during 2023 and 2022, we recognized a lifo inventory charge of $42 million and benefit of $40 million, respectively, which resulted in a 9% decrease in ebitda.
technology segment overview-our technology segment recognizes revenues related to the sale of polyolefin catalysts and the licensing of chemical and polyolefin process technologies. these revenues are offset in part by the costs incurred in the production of catalysts, licensing and services activities and research and development ("r&d") activities. in 2023 and 2022, our technology segment incurred approximately 50% to 55% of all r&d costs.
ebitda was relatively unchanged in 2023 compared to 2022 as higher catalyst margins and favorable foreign exchange impacts were partially offset by a decline in catalyst volumes.
the following table sets forth selected financial information for the technology segment.
year ended december 31, millions of dollars                               2023                          2022
sales and other operating revenues           $663                          $693
revenues-revenues decreased by $30 million, or 4%, in 2023 compared to 2022. lower catalyst volumes resulted in an 8% decrease in revenue primarily driven by lower demand. favorable foreign exchange impact increased revenue by 3%. higher licensing revenues resulting from more contracts reaching significant milestones drove a 1% increase in revenue.
ebitda-ebitda in 2023 increased by $9 million, or 2%, compared to 2022. higher catalyst margins resulted in a 5% increase in ebitda. during 2023 and 2022, we recognized a lifo inventory benefit of $7 million and charge of $13 million, respectively, which resulted in a 5% increase in ebitda. lower catalyst volumes resulted in an 11% decrease in ebitda driven by lower demand. favorable foreign exchange impacts resulted in an ebitda increase of 3%.
table of contents financial condition operating, investing and financing activities of continuing operations, which are discussed below, are presented in the following table:
year ended december 31, millions of dollars                           2023   2022
operating activities                   $4,942                          $6,119
operating activities-cash provided by operating activities of $4,942 million in 2023 primarily reflected earnings adjusted for non-cash items and cash used by the main components of working capital-accounts receivable, inventories and accounts payable.
in 2023, the main components of working capital provided $269 million of cash driven by a decrease in accounts receivable and an increase in accounts payable. the decrease in accounts receivable was primarily due to lower revenues in our o&p-americas, o&p-eai and aps segments, primarily driven by lower average sales prices. the increase in accounts payable was primarily driven by higher feedstock and energy costs in our o&p-americas segment.
cash provided by operating activities of $6,119 million in 2022 primarily reflected earnings adjusted for non-cash items and cash provided by the main components of working capital.
in 2022, the main components of working capital provided $450 million of cash driven by a decrease in accounts receivable, partially offset by a decrease in accounts payable. the decrease in accounts receivable was primarily due to lower revenues across most businesses primarily driven by lower average sales prices. the decrease in accounts payable was driven by lower production volumes as a result of lower operating rates.
investing activities-capital expenditures in 2023 totaled $1,531 million compared to $1,890 million in 2022. approximately 30% and 50% of our capital expenditures in 2023 and 2022, respectively, was for profit-generating growth projects, largely for our po/tba plant, with the remaining expenditures supporting sustaining maintenance. see note 21 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding capital spending by segment.
in 2023, foreign currency contracts with an aggregate notional value of €750 million expired. upon settlement of these foreign currency contracts, we paid €750 million ($820 million at the expiry spot rate) to our counterparties and received $903 million from our counterparties.
in 2022, foreign currency contracts with an aggregate notional value of €500 million expired. upon settlement of these foreign currency contracts, we paid €500 million ($501 million at the expiry spot rate) to our counterparties and received $614 million from our counterparties.
financing activities-we made dividend payments totaling $1,610 million and $3,246 million, in 2023 and 2022, respectively. the 2022 dividend payments included a special dividend of $5.20 per share totaling $1,704 million. additionally, in 2023 and 2022, we made payments of $211 million and $420 million to repurchase outstanding ordinary shares, respectively. for additional information related to our share repurchases and dividend payments, see note 19 to the consolidated financial statements.
table of contents in 2023, we issued $500 million of 5.625% guaranteed notes due 2033. additionally, we repaid the $425 million remaining of outstanding principal on our 4.0% guaranteed notes due 2023. for details see note 12 to the consolidated financial statements.
in 2023 and 2022, we made net repayments of $200 million and $4 million, respectively, through the issuance and repurchase of commercial paper instruments under our commercial paper program.
in 2022, we received a return of collateral of $238 million related to the positions held with our counterparties for certain forward-starting interest rate swaps. for additional information related to our swaps contracts, see note 14 to the consolidated financial statements.
liquidity and capital resources overview we plan to fund our working capital, capital expenditures, debt service, dividends and other cash requirements with our current available liquidity and cash from operations, which could be affected by general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory, business and other factors, many of which are beyond our control. debt repayment, and the purchase of shares under our share repurchase authorization, may be funded from cash and cash equivalents, cash from short-term investments, cash from operating activities, proceeds from the issuance of debt, or a combination thereof.
as part of our overall capital allocation strategy, we plan to provide returns to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases. barring any significant or unforeseen business challenges, mergers or acquisitions, over the long-term, we are targeting shareholder returns of 70% of free cash flow, defined as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures. we intend to continue to declare and pay quarterly dividends, with the goal of increasing the dividend over time, after giving consideration to our cash balances and expected results from operations. our focus on funding our dividends while remaining committed to a strong investment grade balance sheet continues to be the foundation of our capital allocation strategy.
cash and liquid investments as of december 31, 2023, we had cash and cash equivalents totaling $3,390 million, which includes $1,816 million in jurisdictions outside of the u.s., primarily held within the european union and the united kingdom. there are currently no legal or economic restrictions that would materially impede our transfers of cash.
credit arrangements at december 31, 2023, we had total debt, including current maturities, of $11,232 million, and $171 million of outstanding letters of credit, bank guarantees and surety bonds issued under uncommitted credit facilities.
we had total unused availability under our credit facilities of $4,150 million at december 31, 2023, which included the following:
•$3,250 million under our $3,250 million senior revolving credit facility, which backs our $2,500 million commercial paper program. availability under this facility is net of outstanding borrowings, outstanding letters of credit provided under the facility and notes issued under our commercial paper program. at december 31, 2023, we had no outstanding borrowings of commercial paper, and no borrowings or letters of credit outstanding under this facility; and
•$900 million under our $900 million u.s. receivables facility. availability under this facility is subject to a borrowing base of eligible receivables, which is reduced by outstanding borrowings and letters of credit, if any. at december 31, 2023 we had no borrowings or letters of credit outstanding under this facility.
table of contents at any time and from time to time, we may repay or redeem our outstanding debt, including purchases of our outstanding bonds in the open market, through privately negotiated transactions or a combination thereof, in each case using cash and cash equivalents, cash from our short-term investments, cash from operating activities, proceeds from the issuance of debt or proceeds from asset divestitures. any repayment or redemption of our debt will depend on prevailing market conditions, our liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors. in connection with such repurchases or redemptions, we may incur cash and non-cash charges, which could be material in the period in which they are incurred.
in accordance with our current interest rate risk management strategy and subject to management's evaluation of market conditions and the availability of favorable interest rates among other factors, we may from time to time enter into interest rate swap agreements to economically convert a portion of our fixed rate debt to variable rate debt or convert a portion of our variable rate debt to fixed rate debt.
share repurchases in may 2023, our shareholders approved a proposal to authorize us to repurchase up to 34.0 million ordinary shares, through november 19, 2024, which superseded any prior repurchase authorizations. our share repurchase authorization does not have a stated dollar amount, and purchases may be made through open market purchases, private market transactions or other structured transactions. repurchased shares could be retired or used for general corporate purposes, including for various employee benefit and compensation plans. the maximum number of shares that may yet be purchased is not necessarily an indication of the number of shares that will ultimately be purchased. in 2023, we purchased 2.3 million shares under our share repurchase authorization for $211 million.
as of february 20, 2024, we had approximately 33.1 million shares remaining under the current authorization. the timing and amounts of additional shares repurchased, if any, will be determined based on our evaluation of market conditions and other factors, including any additional authorizations approved by our shareholders. for additional information related to our share repurchase authorizations, see note 19 to the consolidated financial statements.
capital budget in 2024, we are planning to invest approximately $2.1 billion in capital expenditures. approximately 60% of the 2024 budget is planned for sustaining maintenance, with the remaining budget supporting profit-generating growth projects. approximately half of our profit-generating growth project budget, or $400 million, is for projects that support our sustainability goals.
cash requirements from contractual and other obligations as part of our ongoing operations, we enter into contractual arrangements that may require us to make future cash payments under certain circumstances. our cash requirements related to contractual and other obligations primarily consist of purchase obligations, principal and interest payments on outstanding debt, lease payments, pension and other post-retirement benefits and income taxes. for more information regarding our debt arrangements, lease obligations, pension and other post-retirement benefits and income taxes, see notes 12, 13, 15 and 17 to the consolidated financial statements, respectively.
we are party to obligations to purchase raw materials, utilities and industrial gases which are designed to ensure sources of supply and are not expected to be in excess of normal requirements. these purchase arrangements include provisions which state minimum purchase quantities; however, in the event we do not take the contractual minimum volumes, we are obligated to compensate the vendor only for any resulting economic losses they suffer. no material fees were paid to vendors for such losses in 2023. assuming that contractual minimum volumes are purchased at contract prices as of december 31, 2023, these commitments represent approximately 20% of our annual cost of sales with a weighted average remaining term of 7 years.
table of contents we also have purchase obligations under take-or-pay agreements which require us to either buy and take delivery of a minimum quantity of goods or to pay for any shortfall. these arrangements largely relate to product off-take agreements with a joint venture located in poland. no material shortfall was paid for quantities not taken under these contracts in 2023. when valued using a contract price as of december 31, 2023, these commitments represent approximately 5% of our annual cost of sales with a weighted average remaining term of 14 years.
current business outlook in the first quarter of 2024, seasonally slow demand and economic uncertainty provide headwinds for most businesses. relatively low ethane raw material costs continue to benefit our o&p-americas margins while regional demand is showing modest improvement. we expect oxyfuels and refining margins to be within typical winter seasonal ranges. in china, january demand was subdued as buyers managed inventories around the lunar new year holidays and growth remained uncertain. spring and summer seasonal demand improvements are expected across global markets. we are aligning first quarter operating rates with global demand and expect to operate our o&p-americas assets at 80% and both our o&p-eai and i&d assets at 75%.
during 2022, we introduced our vep, which expands capacity through low-cost debottlenecks and improved reliability, reduces costs and emissions by saving energy and increases margins through improvements in procurement, logistics and customer service. we estimate net income and recurring annual ebitda benefits for the vep based on 2017 through 2019 mid-cycle margins and modest inflation relative to a 2021 baseline year. we believe recurring annual ebitda is useful to investors because it represents a key measure used by management to assess progress towards our strategy of value creation.
at the end of 2023, we estimated vep benefits to have a year-end annual run rate of approximately $300 million of net income which, after adding back income taxes and depreciation and amortization of $75 million and $25 million, respectively, results in approximately $400 million of recurring annual ebitda, which exceeded our original expectations. we incurred one-time costs of approximately $200 million in 2023 to achieve this milestone.
given its performance in 2023, we anticipate that our vep will achieve a 2024 year-end annual run rate of approximately $445 million of net income, which, after adding back income taxes and depreciation and amortization of approximately $110 million and $45 million, respectively, results in approximately $600 million of recurring annual ebitda. we estimate incurring one-time costs of $325 million in 2024 to achieve this milestone.
by the end of 2025, the vep is expected to achieve a 2025 year-end annual run rate of up to $750 million in net income improvement, which, after adding back income taxes and depreciation and amortization of $185 million and $65 million, respectively, results in up to $1 billion of recurring annual ebitda.
related party transactions we have related party transactions with our joint venture partners. we believe that such transactions are effected on terms substantially no more or less favorable than those that would have been agreed upon by unrelated parties on an arm's length basis. see note 5 to the consolidated financial statements for additional related party disclosures.
critical accounting policies and estimates management applies those accounting policies that it believes best reflect the underlying business and economic events, consistent with accounting principles generally accepted in the u.s., see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements. inherent in such policies are certain key assumptions and estimates made by management and updated periodically based on its latest assessment of the current and projected business and general economic environment.
table of contents management believes the following accounting policies and estimates, and the judgments and uncertainties affecting them, are critical in understanding our reported operating results and financial condition.
inventories-we account for our raw materials, work-in-progress and finished goods inventories using the last-in, first-out ("lifo") method of accounting.
the cost of raw materials, which represents a substantial portion of our operating expenses, and energy costs generally follow price trends for crude oil and/or natural gas. crude oil and natural gas prices are subject to many factors, including changes in economic conditions.
since our inventory consists of manufactured products derived from crude oil, natural gas, natural gas liquids and correlated materials, as well as the associated feedstocks and intermediate chemicals, our inventory market values are generally influenced by changes in the benchmark of crude oil and heavy liquid values and prices for manufactured finished goods. the degree of influence of a particular benchmark may vary from period to period, as the composition of the dollar value lifo pools change. an actual valuation of inventory under the lifo method is performed at the end of each year based on the inventory levels and costs at that time. accordingly, interim lifo calculations are based on our estimates of expected inventory levels and costs at the end of the year.
lifo value is measured at the total pool level. the impact of the measurement of each lifo pool at the lower of cost or market value ("lcm") is a function of the current market prices and the composition, or product mix, of inventory within the pool at the balance sheet date. due to the compositions of our lifo pools, changes in market prices of the materials within the pool from period-to-period do not necessarily correlate with lcm charges. an lcm condition may arise due to a volumetric or price decline in a particular material that had previously provided a positive impact within a pool.
as indicated above, fluctuation in the prices of crude oil, natural gas and correlated products from period to period may result in the recognition of charges to adjust the value of inventory to the lower of cost or market in periods of falling prices and the reversal of those charges in subsequent interim periods, within the same fiscal year, as market prices recover. accordingly, our cost of sales and results of operations may be affected by such fluctuations.
we do not believe any of our inventory is at risk for impairment at this time, however as prices for our products and raw materials are inherently volatile and therefore no prediction can be given with certainty. given the inherent volatility in the prices of our finished goods and raw materials, sustained price declines could result in lcm inventory valuation charges.
long-lived assets impairment assessment-the need to test for impairment can be based on several indicators, including a significant reduction in prices of or demand for products produced, a weakened outlook for profitability, a significant reduction in margins, an expectation that a long-lived asset will be sold or otherwise disposed of significantly before the end of its previously estimated useful life, other changes to contracts or changes in the regulatory environment. if the sum of the undiscounted estimated pre-tax cash flows for an asset group is less than the asset group's carrying value, fair value is calculated for the asset group using an income approach or a market approach when appropriate, and the carrying value is written down to the calculated fair value. for purposes of impairment evaluation, long-lived assets including finite-lived intangible assets must be grouped at the lowest level for which independent cash flows can be identified.
significant judgment is involved in developing estimates of future cash flows since the results are based on forecasted financial information prepared using significant assumptions which may include, among other things, projected changes in supply and demand fundamentals (including industry-wide capacity, our planned utilization rate and end-user demand), new technological developments, capital expenditures, new competitors with significant raw material or other cost advantages, changes associated with world economies, the cyclical nature of the chemical and refining industries, uncertainties associated with governmental actions and other economic conditions. such estimates are consistent with those used in our financial planning and business performance reviews.
table of contents when an income approach is used to estimate fair value of our long-lived assets, the cash flows are discounted using a rate that is based on a variety of factors, including market and economic conditions, operational risk, regulatory risk and political risk. this discount rate is also compared to recent observable market transactions, if possible.
equity method investments impairment-investments in nonconsolidated entities accounted for under the equity method are assessed for impairment when there are indicators of a loss in value, such as a lack of sustained earnings capacity or a current fair value less than the investment's carrying amount. when it is determined such a loss in value is other than temporary, an impairment charge is recognized for the difference between the investment's carrying value and its estimated fair value. when determining whether a decline in value is other than temporary, management considers factors such as the duration and extent of the decline, the investee's financial condition and near-term prospects, and our ability and intention to retain our investment for a period that will be sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in the value of the investment. management's estimate of fair value of an investment is based on the income approach and/or market approach. for the income approach, the fair value is typically based on the present value of expected future cash flows using discount rates believed to be consistent with those used by principal market participants. for the market approach, since quoted market prices are usually not available, we utilize market multiples of revenue and earnings derived from comparable publicly-traded industrial gases companies.
during the fourth quarter of 2023, a trend of adverse financial performance triggered an impairment analysis of our investment in our european po joint venture. we concluded the asset was impaired and recorded a non-cash impairment charge of $192 million. the fair value of our investment in the joint venture was determined using an income approach which utilized unobservable inputs, which generally consist of market information provided by unrelated third parties. our fair value estimate was based on significant assumptions including management's best estimates of the expected future cash flows. these estimates required considerable judgment and are sensitive to changes in underlying assumptions such as future commodity prices and po/sm margins. as a result, there can be no assurance that the estimates and assumptions made for purposes of our impairment determination will prove to be an accurate prediction of the future.
an estimate of the sensitivity to net income resulting from impairment calculations is not practicable, given the numerous assumptions, including pricing, volumes, discount rates, and market information provided by unrelated third parties that can materially affect our estimates. that is, unfavorable adjustments to some of the above listed assumptions may be offset by favorable adjustments in other assumptions.
in response to challenging market conditions in china, during 2023, we assessed our equity method investment in bora lyondellbasell petrochemical co. ltd. ("blyb") for impairment and concluded that our $231 million investment in blyb is not impaired. however, certain circumstances beyond our control could change in the near-term resulting in the need to recognize a non-cash impairment in subsequent periods.
goodwill-as of december 31, 2023, we had goodwill of $1,647 million, primarily relating to the acquisition of a. schulman inc. in 2018 and the tax effect of the differences between the tax and book basis of our assets and liabilities resulting from the revaluation of those assets and liabilities to fair value in connection with the company's emergence from bankruptcy and fresh-start accounting in 2010.
effective january 1, 2023, our catalloy and polybutene-1 businesses were moved from our aps segment and reintegrated into our o&p-americas and o&p-eai segments. when moved, a portion of the aps reporting unit's goodwill was allocated to the o&p-americas and o&p-eai segments based on the fair values of the businesses that were reintegrated relative to the fair value of the aps segment. in the first quarter of 2023, we evaluated goodwill for impairment immediately before and after the transfer of these businesses. our evaluation resulted in the recognition of a non-cash goodwill impairment of $252 million recognized in our aps segment. see notes 8 and 21 to the consolidated financial statements.
table of contents an estimate of the sensitivity to net income resulting from impairment calculations is not practicable, given the numerous assumptions, including pricing, volumes and discount rates, which could materially affect our estimates. that is, unfavorable adjustments to some of the above listed assumptions may be offset by favorable adjustments in other assumptions.
we evaluate the recoverability of the carrying value of goodwill annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the goodwill of a reporting unit may not be fully recoverable. we have the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value. qualitative factors assessed for each of the reporting units include, but are not limited to, changes in long-term commodity prices, discount rates, competitive environments, planned capacity, cost factors such as raw material prices, and financial performance of the reporting units. if the qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value, a quantitative test is required.
we also have the option to proceed directly to the quantitative impairment test. under the quantitative impairment test, the fair value of each reporting unit, calculated using a discounted cash flow model, is compared to its carrying value, including goodwill. the discounted cash flow model inherently utilizes a significant number of estimates and assumptions, including operating margins, tax rates, discount rates, capital expenditures and working capital changes. if the carrying value of the reporting unit including goodwill exceeds its fair value, an impairment charge equal to the excess would be recognized, up to a maximum amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit.
in the fourth quarter of 2023, we performed a quantitative impairment assessment for our reporting units within our advanced polymer solutions segment and a qualitative impairment assessment of our other reporting units, which indicated that the fair value of our reporting units was greater than their carrying value including goodwill. based on this assessment, our historical assessment for impairment and forecasted demand for our products, a quantitative goodwill impairment test in the fourth quarter was not necessary.
during the fourth quarter of 2022, management performed a qualitative impairment assessment of our reporting units, which indicated that it was more likely than not that the fair value of our reporting units was greater than their carrying value including goodwill. accordingly, a quantitative goodwill impairment test was not required.
long-term employee benefit costs-our costs for long-term employee benefits, particularly pension and other post-retirement medical and life insurance benefits, are incurred over long periods of time, and involve many uncertainties over those periods. the net periodic benefit cost attributable to current periods is based on several assumptions about such future uncertainties and is sensitive to changes in those assumptions. it is management's responsibility, often with the assistance of independent experts, to select assumptions that in its judgment represent its best estimates of the future effects of those uncertainties and to review those assumptions periodically to reflect changes in economic or other factors.
the current benefit service costs, as well as the existing liabilities, for pensions and other post-retirement benefits are measured on a discounted present value basis. the discount rate is a current rate, related to the rate at which the liabilities could be settled. our assumed discount rate is based on yield information for high-quality corporate bonds with durations comparable to the expected cash settlement of our obligations. for the purpose of measuring the benefit obligations at december 31, 2023, we used a weighted average discount rate of 5.80% for the u.s. plans, which reflects the different terms of the related benefit obligations. the weighted average discount rate used to measure obligations for non-u.s. plans at december 31, 2023, was 4.00%, reflecting market interest rates. the discount rates in effect at december 31, 2023 will be used to measure net periodic benefit cost during 2024.
the benefit obligation and the net periodic benefit cost of other post-retirement medical benefits are also measured based on assumed rates of future increase in the per capita cost of covered health care benefits. as of december 31, 2023, the assumed rate of increase for our u.s. plans was 6.3%, decreasing to 4.5% in 2031 and thereafter.
table of contents the net periodic benefit cost of pension benefits included in expense is affected by the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets assumption. investment returns that are recognized currently in net income represent the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets applied to a market-related value of plan assets, which is defined as the market value of assets. the expected rate of return on plan assets is a longer-term rate and is expected to change less frequently than the current assumed discount rate, reflecting long-term market expectations, rather than current fluctuations in market conditions.
the weighted average expected long-term rate of return on assets in our u.s. plans of 7.25% is based on the average level of earnings that our independent pension investment advisor advised could be expected to be earned over time. the weighted average expected long-term rate of return on assets in our non-u.s. plans of 3.57% is based on expectations and asset allocations that vary by region. the asset allocations are summarized in note 15 to the consolidated financial statements.
the actual rate of return on plan assets may differ from the expected rate due to the volatility normally experienced in capital markets. management's goal is to manage the investments over the long term to achieve optimal returns with an acceptable level of risk and volatility.
net periodic pension cost recognized each year includes the expected asset earnings, rather than the actual earnings or loss. along with other gains and losses, this unrecognized amount, to the extent it cumulatively exceeds 10% of the greater of the projected benefit obligation or the market related value of the plan assets for the respective plan, is recognized as additional net periodic benefit cost over the average remaining service period of the participants in each plan.
the following table reflects the sensitivity of the benefit obligations and the net periodic benefit costs of our pension plans to changes in the actuarial assumptions:

the sensitivity of our post-retirement benefit plans obligations and net periodic benefit costs to changes in actuarial assumptions are reflected in the following table:

additional information on the key assumptions underlying these benefit costs appears in note 15 to the consolidated financial statements.
table of contents accruals for taxes based on income-the determination of our provision for income taxes and the calculation of our tax benefits and liabilities is subject to management's estimates and judgments due to the complexity of the tax laws and regulations in the tax jurisdictions in which we operate. uncertainties exist with respect to interpretation of these complex laws and regulations.
deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis, and are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to reverse.
we recognize future tax benefits to the extent that the realization of these benefits is more likely than not. our current provision for income taxes is impacted by the recognition and release of valuation allowances related to net deferred tax assets in certain jurisdictions. further changes to these valuation allowances may impact our future provision for income taxes, which will include no tax benefit with respect to losses incurred and no tax expense with respect to income generated in these countries until the respective valuation allowance is eliminated.
we recognize the financial statement benefits with respect to an uncertain income tax position that we have taken or may take on an income tax return when we believe it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained with the tax authorities.

business environment and executive overview conocophillips is one of the world's leading e&p companies based on both production and reserves with operations and activities in 13 countries. our diverse, low cost of supply portfolio includes resource-rich unconventional plays in north america; conventional assets in north america, europe, africa and asia; global lng developments; oil sands in canada; and an inventory of global exploration prospects. headquartered in houston, texas, at december 31, 2023, we employed approximately 9,900 people worldwide and had total assets of $96 billion.
overview at conocophillips, we anticipate that commodity prices will continue to be cyclical and volatile, and our view is that a successful business strategy in the e&p industry must be resilient in lower price environments while also retaining upside during periods of higher prices. as such, we are unhedged, remain committed to our disciplined investment framework and continually monitor market fundamentals, including the impacts associated with geopolitical tensions and conflicts, opec plus supply updates, global demand for our products, oil and gas inventory levels, governmental policies, inflation and supply chain disruptions.
the macro-environment of the global energy industry, including the energy transition, continues to evolve. we believe conocophillips will continue to play an essential role by executing on three objectives: responsibly meeting energy transition pathway demand, delivering competitive returns on and of capital and achieving our net-zero operational emissions ambition. we call this our triple mandate, and it represents our commitment to create long-term value for our stakeholders.
our triple mandate and our foundational principles guide our differential value proposition to deliver competitive returns to stockholders through price cycles. our foundational principles consist of maintaining balance sheet strength, providing peer-leading distributions, making disciplined investments, and demonstrating responsible and reliable esg performance.
total company production in 2023 was 1,826 mboed, yielding cash provided by operating activities of $20 billion. we invested $11.2 billion into the business in the form of capital expenditures and investments and provided returns of capital to shareholders of approximately $11 billion through our ordinary dividend, share repurchases and our vroc. for 2023, we returned $2.6 billion from our ordinary dividend, which included an increase from 51 cents per share to 58 cents per share, effective in december. we also returned $3.0 billion to shareholders from the vroc in 2023. in total for 2023, we returned $5.4 billion to shareholders through share repurchases. as of december 31, 2023, we have repurchased $28.8 billion of the $45 billion authorized share repurchase program. in february 2024, we announced our 2024 planned return of capital to shareholders of $9 billion through our three-tier return of capital framework. we also declared a first quarter ordinary dividend of 58 cents per share and a vroc of 20 cents per share.
in march, the department of interior published its rod approving our willow project in alaska, which adopted a plan consisting of three core pads. in december, following a ninth circuit court of appeals denial of a request for an injunction, we reached fid on the willow project and began winter construction.
conocophillips 2023 10-k management's discussion and analysis in october, we completed our acquisition of the remaining 50 percent working interest in surmont, an asset in our canada segment, for $2.7 billion of cash after customary adjustments. the transaction was funded by proceeds received via long-term debt offerings. this transaction includes a contingent payment arrangement of up to an additional $0.4 billion cad (approximately $0.3 billion) over a five-year term. as the 100 percent owner and operator of surmont, we will seek to optimize the asset while remaining on track to achieve our previously announced corporate emissions intensity objectives. see note 3.
in 2023, we took several steps to further our global lng business. in march, we completed our acquisition of 30 percent equity interest in palng phase 1. in june, we completed our acquisition of a 25 percent equity interest in nfs3 in qatar. additionally, in june, we signed a 20-year offtake agreement at the saguaro lng export facility on the west coast of mexico, subject to mexico pacific reaching fid and other certain conditions precedent. furthermore, in september, we signed a 15-year throughput agreement securing regasification capacity at the gate lng terminal in the netherlands. see note 3.
in the second quarter of 2023, we completed a strategic debt refinancing that extends the weighted average maturity of our portfolio from 15 to 17 years and reduces near term debt maturities. see note 9.
in april, we announced that we are accelerating our operations ghg emissions intensity reduction target through 2030. we are now targeting a reduction in gross operated and net equity operational emissions intensity of 50-60 percent from 2016 levels by 2030, an improvement from the previously announced target of 40-50 percent. in december, we achieved the gold standard pathway in the oil and gas methane partnership (ogmp) 2.0 initiative. for more information on our commitment to esg and the plan, see "contingencies-company response to climate-related risks" section of management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation.
operationally, we remain focused on safely executing the business. our lower 48 segment achieved record production in 2023. our international projects reached several key operational milestones, including first production ahead of schedule at several subsea projects in norway and china, as well as the startup of the second phase of montney's central processing facility in canada. production for 2023 was 1,826 mboed, representing an increase of 88 mboed or 5 percent compared to 2022. after adjusting for closed acquisitions and dispositions, production increased by 73 mboed or 4 percent.
key operating and financial summary significant items during 2023 and recent announcements included the following:
•generated cash provided by operating activities of $20.0 billion;
•ended the year with cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash of $5.9 billion and short-term investments of $1.0 billion;
•delivered record full-year total and lower 48 segment production of 1,826 mboed and 1,067 mboed, respectively;
•acquired the remaining 50 percent working interest in surmont for approximately $2.7 billion as well as future contingent payments of up to $0.4 billion cad ($0.3 billion);
•progressed global lng strategy through expansion in qatar, fid at palng and regasification agreements in the netherlands and offtake agreements in mexico;
•commenced startup at the second phase of montney's central processing facility in canada;
conocophillips 2023 10-k management's discussion and analysis business environment the energy industry has historically been subject to volatility in commodity prices, which fluctuate with the global economy's supply and demand for energy. for example, wti crude oil prices averaged $78 per barrel in 2023, compared with $94 per barrel in 2022. our profitability, reinvestment of cash flows and distributions to shareholders are influenced by these fluctuations. our triple mandate and foundational principles guide our differential value proposition to deliver competitive returns on and of capital to stockholders through price cycles. our foundational principles consist of maintaining balance sheet strength, providing peer-leading distributions, making disciplined investments and demonstrating responsible and reliable esg performance, all of which support strong financial returns and mitigate uncertainty associated with volatile commodity prices.
•balance sheet strength. a strong balance sheet is a strategic asset that provides flexibility through price cycles. we strive to maintain our 'a'-rating, as we did throughout 2023. in 2023, we initiated and completed a strategic debt refinancing to extend the weighted average maturity of our portfolio and reduced near-term debt maturities. in addition, we also funded the acquisition of the remaining 50 percent working interest in surmont from the proceeds of new long-term debt issuances. we ended the year with cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash of $5.9 billion and short-term investments of $1.0 billion, maintaining balance sheet strength.
•peer leading distributions. we believe in delivering value to our shareholders via our three-tiered return of capital framework, which consists of a growing, sustainable ordinary dividend, share repurchases and our vroc. this framework is how we plan to return greater than 30 percent of our net cash provided by operating activities to shareholders. in 2023, we returned $5.6 billion to shareholders through our ordinary dividend and vroc and $5.4 billion through share repurchases. our combined dividends and share repurchases of $11 billion represented over 50 percent of our net cash provided by operating activities. in february 2024, we announced our 2024 planned return of capital to shareholders of $9 billion through our three-tier return of capital framework. see "item 1a-risk factors our ability to execute our capital return program is subject to certain considerations."
•disciplined investments. our goal is to achieve strong free cash flow by exercising capital discipline, controlling our costs, and safely and reliably delivering production. we expect to make capital investments sufficient to at least sustain production throughout the price cycles. free cash flow is defined as cash from operations net of capital expenditures and investments and provides funds that are available to return to shareholders, strengthen the balance sheet or reinvest back into the business for future cash flow expansion.
◦exercise capital discipline. we participate in a commodity price-driven and capital-intensive industry, with varying lead times from when an investment decision is made to when an asset is operational and generates cash flow. as a result, we must invest significant capital to develop newly discovered fields, maintain existing fields and construct pipelines and lng facilities. we allocate capital across a geographically diverse, low cost of supply resource base, which combined with legacy assets results in low overall production decline. cost of supply is the wti equivalent price that generates a 10 percent after-tax return on a point-forward and fully burdened basis. fully burdened basis includes capital infrastructure, foreign currency exchange rates, cost of carbon, price-related inflation and g&a. in setting our capital plans, we exercise a rigorous approach that evaluates projects using these cost of supply criteria, which we believe will lead to value maximization and cash flow expansion using an optimized investment pace, not production growth for growth's sake. our cash allocation priorities call for the investment of sufficient capital to sustain production and provide returns of capital to shareholders.
◦control our costs. controlling our costs, without compromising safety or environmental stewardship, is a high priority. using various methodologies, we monitor costs monthly, on an absolute-dollar basis and a per-unit basis and report to management. managing costs is critical to maintaining a competitive position in our industry, particularly in a low commodity price environment, and positively impacts our ability to deliver strong cash from operations.
◦optimize our portfolio. we continue to evaluate our assets to determine whether they compete for capital within our portfolio and optimize as necessary, directing capital towards the most competitive investments and disposing of assets that do not compete.
in 2023, we completed the acquisition of the remaining 50 percent working interest in surmont and completed our acquisitions of equity interests in both the palng and nfs3 lng projects and signed both lng offtake and regasification agreements. see note 3.
conocophillips 2023 10-k management's discussion and analysis
▪apply new technologies and processes to improve recovery from existing fields.
▪successfully explore, develop and exploit new and existing fields.
as required by authoritative guidelines, the estimated future date when an asset will reach the end of its economic life is based on historical 12-month first-of-month average prices and current costs. this date estimates when production will end and affects the amount of estimated reserves. therefore, as prices and cost levels change from year to year, the estimate of proved reserves also changes. generally, our proved reserves decrease as prices decline and increase as prices rise.
reserve replacement represents the net change in proved reserves, net of production, divided by our current year production, as shown in our supplemental reserve table disclosures. our reserve replacement was 123 percent in 2023, reflecting a net increase from development drilling activity, extensions and discoveries and purchases, partially offset by lower prices. our organic reserve replacement, which excludes a net increase of 184 mmboe from sales and purchases, was 96 percent in 2023.
in the three years ended december 31, 2023, our reserve replacement was 219 percent. our organic reserve replacement during the three years ended december 31, 2023, which excludes a net increase of 1,293 mmboe related to sales and purchases, was 152 percent. see "supplementary data - oil and gas operations" for more information.
access to additional resources may become increasingly difficult as lower commodity price cycles can make projects uneconomic or unattractive. in addition, prohibition of direct investment in some nations, national fiscal terms, political instability, competition from national oil companies, and lack of access to high-potential areas due to environmental or other regulation may negatively impact our ability to increase our reserve base. as such, the timing and level at which we add to our reserve base may, or may not, allow us to fully replace our production over subsequent years.
see "item 1a-risk factors - unless we successfully develop resources, the scope of our business will decline, resulting in an adverse impact to our business."
•environmental, social and governance performance. we seek to fulfill our mission of delivering energy to the world through an integrated management system that assesses sustainability-related business risks and opportunities as part of our decision-making process. recognizing the importance of esg performance to our stakeholders and company success, we have a governance structure that extends from the board of directors through to executive leadership and business unit managers.
in october 2020, we became the first u.s.-based oil and natural gas company to adopt a paris-aligned climate risk framework that includes an ambition to achieve net-zero scope 1 and 2 emissions on a gross operated and net equity basis by 2050. we believe that this framework, combined with our success in meeting the business objectives set by our triple mandate, represents the most effective way for us to sustainably contribute to society's transition to a low-carbon economy. in 2023, we announced an acceleration of our operational ghg emissions intensity reduction target through 2030. in december, we achieved the gold standard pathway in the ogmp 2.0 initiative.
we believe that natural gas and oil will remain essential to the energy mix throughout the energy transition, and we also recognize the need for continuous reduction in the greenhouse gas intensity of production operations. the energy transition will likely be complex, evolving over multiple decades with many possible pathways and uncertainties. by following our triple mandate, we intend to meet this challenge in an economically viable, accountable and actionable way that creates long-term value for our stakeholders. for more information on our commitment to responsible and reliable esg performance through the energy transition, see "contingencies-company response to climate-related risks" section of management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation.
conocophillips 2023 10-k management's discussion and analysis commodity prices our earnings and operating cash flows generally correlate with crude oil and natural gas commodity prices. commodity price levels are subject to factors external to the company and over which we have no control, including but not limited to global economic health, supply or demand disruptions or fears thereof caused by civil unrest, global pandemics, military conflicts, actions taken by opec plus and other major oil producing countries, environmental laws, tax regulations, governmental policies and weather-related disruptions. the following graph depicts the average benchmark prices for wti crude oil, brent crude oil and u.s. henry hub natural gas since 2021:
brent crude oil prices averaged $82.62 per barrel in 2023, a decrease of 18 percent compared with $101.19 per barrel in 2022. similarly, average wti crude oil prices decreased 18 percent from $94.23 per barrel in 2022 to $77.62 per barrel in 2023. prices were lower through 2023 as rising non-opec supplies and russia's ability to redirect crude oil to destinations outside the eu more than offset opec plus crude oil supply curbs.
henry hub natural gas prices decreased 59 percent from an average of $6.65 per mmbtu in 2022 to $2.74 per mmbtu in 2023. natural gas prices decreased due to mild winter weather and u.s. domestic supply growth outpacing demand growth.
our realized bitumen price decreased 24 percent from an average of $55.56 per barrel in 2022 to $42.15 per barrel in 2023. the decrease was largely driven by weakness in wti, reflective of global markets adjusting to new trade dynamics and global crude oil demand concerns. we continue to optimize bitumen price realizations through optimizing diluent recovery unit operation, blending and transportation strategies.
conocophillips 2023 10-k management's discussion and analysis outlook production and capital
2024 capital expenditure guidance is $11.0 to $11.5 billion.

to meet our short- and long-term liquidity requirements, we look to a variety of funding sources, including cash generated from operating activities, proceeds from asset sales, our commercial paper and credit facility programs and our ability to sell securities using our shelf registration statement. in 2023, the primary uses of our available cash were $11.2 billion to support our ongoing capital expenditures and investments program, $2.7 billion for the acquisition of an additional 50 percent working interest in surmont, $5.4 billion to repurchase common stock, and $5.6 billion to pay the ordinary dividend and vroc. in addition to cash from operating activities, the other primary sources of additional capital were $2.7 billion in proceeds from long-term debt issuances to fund the surmont acquisition and $1.4 billion net sales of short-term investments. in 2023, cash and cash equivalents decreased by $0.8 billion to $5.6 billion. see note 9.
at december 31, 2023, we had cash and cash equivalents of $5.6 billion, short-term investments of $1.0 billion, and available borrowing capacity under our credit facility of $5.5 billion, totaling approximately $12.1 billion of liquidity. we believe current cash balances and cash generated by operations, together with access to external sources of funds as described below in the "significant changes in capital" section, will be sufficient to meet our funding requirements in the near- and long-term, including our capital spending program, dividend payments and required debt payments.
significant changes in capital operating activities cash provided by operating activities in 2023 totaled $20.0 billion, compared with $28.3 billion for 2022, and $17.0 billion for 2021. the decrease in cash provided by operating activities from 2022 is primarily due to lower realized commodity prices across all products, partly offset by higher sales volumes, net of associated production and operating costs.
the increase in cash provided by operating activities from 2022 compared to 2021 is primarily due to higher realized commodity prices, higher sales volumes mostly due to our acquisition of shell permian assets and the absence of the 2021 settlement of oil and gas hedging positions acquired from concho. the increase in cash provided by operating activities was partly offset by foreign tax and royalty payments in libya and foreign tax payments in norway in addition to u.s. tax payments.
our short- and long-term operating cash flows are highly dependent upon prices for crude oil, bitumen, natural gas, lng and ngls. prices and margins in our industry have historically been volatile and are driven by market conditions over which we have no control. absent other mitigating factors, as these prices and margins fluctuate, we would expect a corresponding change in our operating cash flows.
conocophillips 2023 10-k capital resources and liquidity the level of absolute production volumes, as well as product and location mix, is another significant factor impacting our cash flows. full-year production averaged 1,826 mboed in 2023, an increase of 88 mboed or 5 percent compared to 2022. first quarter 2024 production is expected to be 1.88 mmboed to 1.92 mmboed. future production is subject to numerous uncertainties, including, among others, the volatile crude oil and natural gas price environment, which may impact investment decisions; the effects of price changes on production sharing and variable-royalty contracts; acquisition and disposition of fields; field production decline rates; new technologies; operating efficiencies; timing of startups and major turnarounds; political instability; weather-related disruptions; and the addition of proved reserves through exploratory success and their timely and cost-effective development. while we actively monitor and manage these factors, changes in production levels can cause variability in cash flows, although we generally experience less variability in our cash flows due to changes in production levels than due to changes in commodity prices.
to maintain or grow our production volumes on an ongoing basis, we must continue to add to our proved reserve base. our estimates of our proved reserves generally increase as of a specified date as prices rise and decrease as prices decline. reserve replacement represents the net change in proved reserves, net of production, divided by our current year production. for information on proved reserves, including both developed and undeveloped reserves, see the reserve table disclosures contained in "supplementary data - oil and gas operations." see "item 1a-risk factors - unless we successfully develop resources, the scope of our business will decline, resulting in an adverse impact to our business."
as discussed in the "critical accounting estimates" section, engineering estimates of proved reserves are imprecise; therefore, reserves may be revised upward or downward each year due to the impact of changes in commodity prices or as more technical data becomes available on reservoirs. it is not possible to reliably predict how revisions will impact future reserve quantities.
investing activities in 2023, we invested $11.2 billion in capital expenditures and investments; $1.5 billion of which was primarily payments towards our investments in lng projects, including palng, nfe4 and nfs3. see note 3. the remaining $9.7 billion funded our operating capital program. capital expenditures invested in 2022 and 2021 were $10.2 billion and $5.3 billion, respectively. see the "capital expenditures and investments" section.
in october 2023, we acquired the remaining 50 percent working interest in surmont from totalenergies ep canada ltd. for approximately $2.7 billion of cash after customary adjustments. we funded this transaction by issuing new long-term debt. see note 3 and note 9.
proceeds from asset sales were $0.6 billion in 2023 compared with $3.5 billion in 2022. in 2022, we received proceeds of $1.4 billion for the sale of our remaining 91 million common shares of cve, proceeds of approximately $1.5 billion, primarily from asset divestitures in our asia pacific and lower 48 segments, and $0.5 billion in contingent payments associated with prior divestitures. see note 3 and note 5.
in december 2021, we completed our acquisition of shell's assets in the delaware basin for cash consideration of approximately $8.7 billion after customary adjustments. we funded this transaction with cash on hand. we completed our acquisition of concho on january 15, 2021 in an all-stock transaction. the assets acquired in the transaction included $382 million of cash. the net impact of these items is recognized within "acquisition of businesses, net of cash acquired" on our consolidated statement of cash flows. see note 3.
in 2021, total proceeds from asset dispositions were $1.7 billion. we received cash proceeds of $250 million from the sale of noncore assets in our lower 48 segment, $1.1 billion from sales of our investment in cve common shares and $244 million of contingent payments related to dispositions completed before 2021. see note 3 and note 5.
we invest in short-term investments as part of our cash investment strategy, the primary objective of which is to protect principal, maintain liquidity and provide yield and total returns; these investments include time deposits, commercial paper, as well as debt securities classified as available for sale. funds for short-term needs to support our operating plan and provide resiliency to react to short-term price volatility are invested in highly liquid instruments with maturities within the year. funds we consider available to maintain resiliency in longer term price downturns and to capture opportunities outside a given operating plan may be invested in instruments with maturities greater than one year. see note 12 and note 19.
investing activities in 2023 included net sales of $1,373 million of investments. we had net sales of $2,111 million of short-term instruments and net purchases of $738 million of long-term instruments. see note 19.
conocophillips 2023 10-k capital resources and liquidity financing activities our debt balance at december 31, 2023 was $18.9 billion compared with $16.6 billion at december 31, 2022. the current portion of debt, including payments for finance leases, is $1.1 billion. in 2023, we issued $2.7 billion principal amount of new debt to fund our acquisition of the remaining 50 percent working interest in surmont and completed refinancing transactions consisting of $1.1 billion in tender offers to repurchase existing debt with cash and a $1.1 billion new debt issuance to fund the repurchases, extending the weighted average maturity of our portfolio from 15 to 17 years and reducing near-term debt maturities. see note 9.
in 2022, we repurchased notes, retired floating rate debt, and executed a debt refinancing comprised of concurrent transactions including new debt issuances, a cash tender offer and debt exchange offers. in aggregate, these transactions along with naturally maturing debt, reduced the company's total debt by $3.3 billion.
in 2022, we refinanced our revolving credit facility from a total aggregate principal amount of $6.0 billion to $5.5 billion with an expiration date of february 2027. our revolving credit facility may be used for direct bank borrowings, the issuance of letters of credit totaling up to $500 million, or as support for our commercial paper program. the revolving credit facility is broadly syndicated among financial institutions and does not contain any material adverse change provisions or any covenants requiring maintenance of specified financial ratios or credit ratings. the facility agreement contains a cross-default provision relating to the failure to pay principal or interest on other debt obligations of $200 million or more by conocophillips, or any of its consolidated subsidiaries. the amount of the facility is not subject to redetermination prior to its expiration date.
credit facility borrowings may bear interest at a margin above the secured overnight financing rate (sofr). the agreement calls for commitment fees on available, but unused, amounts. the agreement also contains early termination rights if our current directors or their approved successors cease to be a majority of the board of directors.
the revolving credit facility supports conocophillips company's ability to issue up to $5.5 billion of commercial paper, which is primarily a funding source for short-term working capital needs. commercial paper maturities are generally limited to 90 days. with no commercial paper outstanding and no direct borrowings or letters of credit, we had access to $5.5 billion in available borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility at december 31, 2023.
in december 2023, fitch affirmed our long-term credit ratings. the current credit ratings on our long-term debt are:
•moody's: "a2" with a "stable" outlook see note 9 for additional information on debt and the revolving credit facility.
we do not have any ratings triggers on any of our corporate debt that would cause an automatic default, and thereby impact our access to liquidity, upon downgrade of our credit ratings. if our credit ratings are downgraded from their current levels, it could increase the cost of corporate debt available to us and restrict our access to the commercial paper markets. if our credit rating were to deteriorate to a level prohibiting us from accessing the commercial paper market, we would still be able to access funds under our revolving credit facility.
certain of our project-related contracts, commercial contracts and derivative instruments contain provisions requiring us to post collateral. many of these contracts and instruments permit us to post either cash or letters of credit as collateral. at december 31, 2023 and december 31, 2022, we had direct bank letters of credit of $340 million and $368 million, respectively, which secured performance obligations related to various purchase commitments incident to the ordinary conduct of business. in the event of a credit rating downgrade, we may be required to post additional letters of credit.
shelf registration we have a universal shelf registration statement on file with the sec under which we have the ability to issue and sell an indeterminate amount of various types of debt and equity securities.
conocophillips 2023 10-k capital resources and liquidity capital requirements for information about our capital expenditures and investments, see the "capital expenditures and investments" section.
our debt balance at december 31, 2023, was $18.9 billion, an increase of $2.3 billion from the balance at december 31, 2022 of $16.6 billion. in 2023, we issued $2.7 billion principal amount of new debt to fund our acquisition of the remaining 50 percent working interest in surmont and completed refinancing transactions consisting of $1.1 billion in tender offers to repurchase existing debt with cash and a $1.1 billion new debt issuance to fund the repurchases. in 2022, we executed concurrent debt refinancing transactions, repurchased existing notes, and retired floating rate notes upon natural maturity, that in aggregate reduced our total debt by $3.3 billion while also lowering our annual cash interest expense and extending the weighted average maturity of our debt portfolio. see note 9 for information regarding debt and note 19 for information regarding non-cash consideration of the surmont transaction.
in february 2024, we announced our 2024 planned return of capital to shareholders of $9 billion through our three-tier return of capital framework. we plan to deliver a compelling, growing ordinary dividend, through-cycle share repurchases and a vroc payment. the vroc provides a flexible tool for meeting our commitment of returning greater than 30 percent of cash from operating activities during periods where commodity prices are meaningfully higher than our planning price range. our 2023 total capital returned was $11 billion.
consistent with our commitment to deliver value to shareholders, for the full year of 2023, we paid ordinary dividends of $2.11 per common share and vroc payments of $2.50 per common share. this was an increase over 2022 when we paid ordinary dividends of $1.89 and vroc payments of $2.60 per common share and an increase over 2021 when we paid an ordinary dividend of $1.75 per common share. in february 2024, we declared a first quarter ordinary dividend of $0.58 per common share and a vroc payment of $0.20 per common share, both payable march 1, 2024, to shareholders of record on february 19, 2024.
the ordinary dividend and vroc are subject to numerous considerations and are determined and approved each quarter by the board of directors. all vroc payments to date have been declared along with the ordinary dividend, but paid in the following quarter. however, beginning in the first quarter of 2024, we plan to pay any quarterly dividend and vroc payment concurrently and will announce such payments in the same quarter they will be paid.
in late 2016, we initiated our current share repurchase program. in october 2022, our board of directors approved an increase to our authorization from $25 billion to $45 billion of our common stock to support our plan for future share repurchases. share repurchases were $5.4 billion, $9.3 billion, and $3.6 billion in 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively. as of december 31, 2023, share repurchases since the inception of our current program totaled 383.4 million shares and $28.8 billion. repurchases are made at management's discretion, at prevailing prices, subject to market conditions and other factors.
for more information on factors considered when determining the levels of returns of capital see "item 1a-risk factors - our ability to execute our capital return program is subject to certain considerations."
as of december 31, 2023, in addition to the priorities described above, we have contractual obligations to purchase goods and services of approximately $29.7 billion. we expect to fulfill $7.4 billion of these obligations in 2024. these figures exclude purchase commitments for jointly owned fields and facilities where we are not the operator. purchase obligations of $9.8 billion are related to agreements to access and utilize the capacity of third-party equipment and facilities, including pipelines and lng product terminals, to transport, process, treat and store commodities. purchase obligations of $17.8 billion are related to market-based contracts for commodity product purchases with third parties. the remainder is primarily our net share of purchase commitments for materials and services for jointly owned fields and facilities where we are the operator.

conocophillips 2023 10-k capital resources and liquidity contingencies we are subject to legal proceedings, claims and liabilities that arise in the ordinary course of business. we accrue for losses associated with legal claims when such losses are considered probable and the amounts can be reasonably estimated. see "critical accounting estimates" and note 11 for information on contingencies.
legal and tax matters we are subject to various lawsuits and claims, including but not limited to matters involving oil and gas royalty and severance tax payments, gas measurement and valuation methods, contract disputes, environmental damages, climate change, personal injury, and property damage. our primary exposures for such matters relate to alleged royalty and tax underpayments on certain federal, state and privately owned properties, claims of alleged environmental contamination and damages from historic operations, and climate change. we will continue to defend ourselves vigorously in these matters.
our legal organization applies its knowledge, experience, and professional judgment to the specific characteristics of our cases, employing a litigation management process to manage and monitor the legal proceedings against us. our process facilitates the early evaluation and quantification of potential exposures in individual cases. this process also enables us to track those cases that have been scheduled for trial and/or mediation. based on professional judgment and experience in using these litigation management tools and available information about current developments in all our cases, our legal organization regularly assesses the adequacy of current accruals and determines if adjustment of existing accruals, or establishment of new accruals, is required. see note 17.
environmental we are subject to the same numerous international, federal, state, and local environmental laws and regulations as other companies in our industry. the most significant of these environmental laws and regulations include, among others, the:
•european union regulation for registration, evaluation, authorization and restriction of chemicals (reach);
•u.s. federal comprehensive environmental response, compensation and liability act (cercla or superfund), which imposes liability on generators, transporters and arrangers of hazardous substances at sites where hazardous substance releases have occurred or are threatening to occur;
•u.s. federal resource conservation and recovery act (rcra), which governs the treatment, storage, and disposal of solid waste;
•u.s. federal oil pollution act of 1990 (opa90), under which owners and operators of onshore facilities and pipelines, lessees or permittees of an area in which an offshore facility is located, and owners and operators of vessels are liable for removal costs and damages that result from a discharge of oil into navigable waters of the u.s.;
•u.s. federal emergency planning and community right-to-know act (epcra), which requires facilities to report toxic chemical inventories with local emergency planning committees and response departments;
•u.s. federal safe drinking water act, which governs the disposal of wastewater in underground injection wells;
•u.s. department of the interior regulations, which relate to offshore oil and gas operations in u.s. waters and impose liability for the cost of pollution cleanup resulting from operations, as well as potential liability for pollution damages; and
these laws and their implementing regulations set limits on emissions and, in the case of discharges to water, establish water quality limits. they also establish standards and impose obligations for the remediation of releases of hazardous substances and hazardous wastes. in most cases, these regulations require permits in association with new or modified operations. these permits can require an applicant to collect substantial information in connection with the application process, which can be expensive and time-consuming. in addition, there can be delays associated with notice and comment periods and the agency's processing of the application. many of the delays associated with the permitting process are beyond the control of the applicant.
many states and foreign countries where we operate also have or are developing, similar environmental laws and regulations governing these same types of activities. while similar, in some cases these regulations may impose additional, or more stringent, requirements that can add to the cost and difficulty of marketing or transporting products across state and international borders.
conocophillips 2023 10-k capital resources and liquidity the ultimate financial impact arising from environmental laws and regulations is neither clearly known nor easily determinable as new standards, such as air emission standards and water quality standards, continue to evolve. however, environmental laws and regulations, including those that may arise to address concerns about global climate change, are expected to continue to have an increasing impact on our operations in the u.s. and in other countries in which we operate. notable areas of potential impacts include air emission compliance and remediation obligations in the u.s. and canada.
an example is the use of hydraulic fracturing, an essential completion technique that facilitates production of oil and natural gas otherwise trapped in lower permeability rock formations. a range of local, state, federal, or national laws and regulations currently govern hydraulic fracturing operations, with hydraulic fracturing currently prohibited in some jurisdictions. although hydraulic fracturing has been conducted for many decades, potential new laws, regulations and permitting requirements from various state environmental agencies, and others could result in increased costs, operating restrictions, operational delays and/or limit the ability to develop oil and natural gas resources. governmental restrictions on hydraulic fracturing could impact the overall profitability or viability of certain of our oil and natural gas investments. we have adopted operating principles that incorporate established industry standards designed to meet or exceed government requirements. our practices continually evolve as technology improves and regulations change.
we also are subject to certain laws and regulations relating to environmental remediation obligations associated with current and past operations. such laws and regulations include cercla and rcra and their state equivalents. longer-term expenditures are subject to considerable uncertainty and may fluctuate significantly.
we occasionally receive requests for information or notices of potential liability from the epa and state environmental agencies alleging that we are a potentially responsible party under cercla or an equivalent state statute. on occasion, we also have been made a party to cost recovery litigation by those agencies or by private parties. these requests, notices and lawsuits assert potential liability for remediation costs at various sites that typically are not owned by us, but allegedly contain waste attributable to our past operations. as of december 31, 2023, there were 15 sites around the u.s. in which we were identified as a potentially responsible party under cercla and comparable state laws.
for most superfund sites, our potential liability will be significantly less than the total site remediation costs because the percentage of waste attributable to us, versus that attributable to all other potentially responsible parties, is relatively low. although liability of those potentially responsible is generally joint and several for federal sites and frequently so for state sites, other potentially responsible parties at sites where we are a party typically have had the financial strength to meet their obligations, and where they have not, or where potentially responsible parties could not be located, our share of liability has not increased materially. many of the sites at which we are potentially responsible are still under investigation by the epa or the state agencies concerned. prior to actual cleanup, those potentially responsible normally assess site conditions, apportion responsibility and determine the appropriate remediation. in some instances, we may have no liability or attain a settlement of liability. actual cleanup costs generally occur after the parties obtain epa or equivalent state agency approval. there are relatively few sites where we are a major participant, and given the timing and amounts of anticipated expenditures, neither the cost of remediation at those sites nor such costs at all cercla sites, in the aggregate, is expected to have a material adverse effect on our competitive or financial condition.
expensed environmental costs were $791 million in 2023 and are expected to be approximately $937 million and $946 million in 2024 and 2025, respectively. capitalized environmental costs were $393 million in 2023 and are expected to be about $438 million and $450 million in 2024 and 2025, respectively.
accrued liabilities for remediation activities are not reduced for potential recoveries from insurers or other third parties and are not discounted (except those assumed in a purchase business combination, which we do record on a discounted basis).
many of these liabilities result from cercla, rcra, and similar state or international laws that require us to undertake certain investigative and remedial activities at sites where we conduct or once conducted operations or at sites where conocophillips-generated waste was disposed. the accrual also includes a number of sites we identified that may require environmental remediation but which are not currently the subject of cercla, rcra, or other agency enforcement activities. the laws that require or address environmental remediation may apply retroactively and regardless of fault, the legality of the original activities or the current ownership or control of sites. if applicable, we accrue receivables for probable insurance or other third-party recoveries. in the future, we may incur significant costs under both cercla and rcra.
conocophillips 2023 10-k capital resources and liquidity remediation activities vary substantially in duration and cost from site to site, depending on the mix of unique site characteristics, evolving remediation technologies, diverse regulatory agencies and enforcement policies, and the presence or absence of potentially liable third parties. therefore, it is difficult to develop reasonable estimates of future site remediation costs.
at december 31, 2023, our balance sheet included total accrued environmental costs of $184 million, compared with $182 million at december 31, 2022, for remediation activities in the u.s. and canada. we expect to incur a substantial amount of these expenditures within the next 30 years.
notwithstanding any of the foregoing, and as with other companies engaged in similar businesses, environmental costs and liabilities are inherent concerns in our operations and products, and there can be no assurance that material costs and liabilities will not be incurred. however, we currently do not expect any material adverse effect upon our results of operations or financial position as a result of compliance with current environmental laws and regulations.
see item 1a. risk factors-we expect to continue to incur substantial capital expenditures and operating costs as a result of our compliance with existing and future environmental laws and regulations and note 11 for information on environmental litigation.
climate change continuing political and social attention to the issue of global climate change has resulted in a broad range of proposed or promulgated state, national and international laws focusing on ghg emissions reduction. these proposed or promulgated laws apply or could apply in countries where we have interests or may have interests in the future. laws in this field continue to evolve, and while it is not possible to accurately estimate either a timetable for implementation or our future compliance costs relating to implementation, such laws, if enacted, could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial condition. examples of legislation and precursors for possible regulation that do or could affect our operations include:
•european emissions trading scheme (ets), the program through which many of the eu member states are implementing the kyoto protocol. our cost of compliance with the eu ets in 2023 was approximately $28 million (net share before-tax).
•u.k. emissions trading scheme, the program with which the u.k. has replaced the ets. our cost of compliance with the u.k. ets in 2023 was approximately $0.8 million (net share before-tax).
•the alberta technology innovation and emissions reduction (tier) regulation requires any existing facility with emissions equal to or greater than 100,000 metric tonnes of carbon dioxide, or equivalent, per year to meet a facility benchmark intensity. the total cost of compliance related to this regulation in 2023 was approximately $3.5 million (net share before-tax).
•the u.s. government has announced on september 17, 2021 the global methane pledge, a global initiative to reduce global methane emissions by at least 30 percent from 2020 levels by 2030.
•carbon taxes in certain jurisdictions. our cost of compliance with norwegian carbon legislation in 2023 was approximately $35 million (net share before-tax). we also incur a carbon tax for emissions from fossil fuel combustion in our british columbia and alberta operations in canada, totaling approximately $8.2 million (net share before-tax).
•the agreement reached in paris in december 2015 at the 21st conference of the parties to the united nations framework convention on climate change, setting out a process for achieving global emissions reductions. the new administration has recommitted the united states to the paris agreement, and a significant number of u.s. state and local governments and major corporations headquartered in the u.s. have also announced related commitments. accordingly, the u.s. administration set a new target on april 22, 2021 of a 50 to 52 percent reduction in ghg emissions from 2005 levels in 2030.
•the u.s. epa announced the final new source performance standards (oooob) and emissions guidelines (ooooc) rulemaking on december 2, 2023. while industry is awaiting final publication of the rulemaking, we do anticipate that implementing this regulation across our u.s. portfolio will result in additional compliance costs. the proposed sub-part w regulations and the methane emission reduction program (merp), passed as part of the inflation reduction act of 2022 will potentially result in impacts to our business. the implementation of the merp fee, while applicable for 2024 emissions, has not yet been finalized by the epa.

•governments and financial regulators are developing new reporting rules requiring increased disclosure around a range of sustainability topics. in march 2022 the u.s. sec proposed rule changes that would require registrants to include certain climate-related disclosures in their registration statements and periodic reports; in january 2023 the eu finalized the corporate sustainability reporting directive that will require more detailed sustainability reporting; in june 2023 the international sustainability standards board issued inaugural sustainability reporting standards; and in october 2023 in california multiple bills were signed into law requiring climate-related disclosures for companies that conduct business in the state. the patchwork of reporting standards that is developing may require significant increases in disclosures, which may be costly to implement.
•the u.s. council on environmental quality is preparing to finalize revised regulations under the national environmental policy act (nepa phase 2), along with corresponding guidance on the consideration of ghg emissions and climate change, in early 2024. the new regulatory framework's emphasis on avoiding and minimizing climate impacts increases uncertainty associated with the federal environmental review and permitting process for oil and gas activities.
compliance with changes in laws and regulations that create a ghg tax, emission trading scheme or ghg reduction policies could significantly increase our costs, reduce demand for fossil energy derived products, impact the cost and availability of capital and increase our exposure to litigation. such laws and regulations could also increase demand for less carbon intensive energy sources, including natural gas. the ultimate impact on our financial performance, either positive or negative, will depend on a number of factors, including but not limited to:
•the timing of the introduction of such legislation or regulation;
•the nature of the legislation (such as a cap and trade system or a tax on emissions) or regulation;
•the price placed on ghg emissions (either by the market or through a tax);
•the price and availability of offsets;
•the amount and allocation of allowances;
•technological and scientific developments leading to new products or services;
•any potential significant physical effects of climate change (such as increased severe weather events, changes in sea levels and changes in temperature); and
•whether, and the extent to which, increased compliance costs are ultimately reflected in the prices of our products and services.
see item 1a. risk factors-existing and future laws, regulations and internal initiatives relating to global climate changes, such as limitations on ghg emissions may impact or limit our business plans, result in significant expenditures, promote alternative uses of energy or reduce demand for our products and note 11 for information on climate change litigation.
company response to climate-related risks in 2020, we adopted a paris-aligned climate-related risk framework with an ambition to reduce our operational (scope 1 and 2) emissions to net-zero by 2050. the objective of our climate risk strategy is to manage climate-related risk, optimize opportunities and equip the company to respond to changes in key uncertainties, including government policies around the world, technologies for emissions reduction, alternative energy technologies and changes in consumer trends. the strategy sets out our choices around portfolio composition, emissions reductions, targets and incentives, emissions-related technology development, and our climate-related policy and finance sector engagement.
an important component of our climate risk strategy is the plan for the net-zero energy transition (the 'plan'). the plan outlines how we intend to play a valued role in the energy transition by executing on our triple mandate to: reliably and responsibly meet energy transition pathway demand, deliver competitive returns on and of capital and achieve our net-zero operational emissions ambition. the plan also outlines how we intend to apply our strategic capabilities and resources to meet the challenges posed by climate change in an economically viable, accountable and actionable way that balances the interests of our stakeholders.
conocophillips 2023 10-k capital resources and liquidity key elements of the plan include:
•maintaining strategic flexibility
◦building a resilient asset portfolio with a focus on low cost of supply and low ghg intensity to meet transition pathway energy demand.
◦committing to capital discipline through use of a fully burdened cost of supply, including cost of carbon, as the basis for capital allocation.
◦advocating for a well-designed, economy-wide price on carbon and engaging in development of other policy and legislation to address end-use emissions.
our plan does not include a scope 3 (end-use) emissions target. we recognize that end-use emissions must be reduced to meet global climate objectives. however, it is our view that supply-side constraints through scope 3 targets for north american and european upstream oil and gas producers would be counterproductive to climate goals. in the absence of policy measures that address global demand and with the shape and pace of technology and policy yet to be determined, setting and meeting scope 3 targets would require a shift of production to other global operators that have established less ambitious targets or no targets to reduce their own operational emissions or do not have any other ambitions or plans to manage climate-related risks, potentially eroding energy security and affordability as well as undercutting global climate change objectives. this is why we have consistently taken a prominent role in advocating for a well-designed, economy wide price on carbon and engaged in development of other policies or legislation that could address end-use emissions from high-carbon intensity energy use. we have also expanded policy advocacy beyond carbon pricing to include regulatory action, such as support for the direct regulation of methane.
in support of addressing our scope 1 and 2 emissions, in 2023, we made progress in several key areas.
•continued to refine our paris-aligned climate risk strategy.
•implemented our new near-zero 2030 methane emissions intensity target of approximately 1.5 kilogram carbon dioxide equivalent per boe or of 0.15 percent of gas produced.
our emissions reduction efforts and net-zero ambition are supported by our multi-disciplinary low-carbon technologies organization. see item 1a. risk factors-our ability to successfully execute on our energy transition plans is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties and may be costly to achieve.
new accounting standards for discussion of new accounting standards, see note 25.
conocophillips 2023 10-k critical accounting estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to select appropriate accounting policies and to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. see note 1 for descriptions of our major accounting policies. certain of these accounting policies involve judgments and uncertainties to such an extent there is a reasonable likelihood materially different amounts would have been reported under different conditions, or if different assumptions had been used. these critical accounting estimates are discussed with the audit and finance committee of the board of directors at least annually. we believe the following discussions of critical accounting estimates address all important accounting areas where the nature of accounting estimates or assumptions is material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for highly uncertain matters or the susceptibility of such matters to change.
oil and gas accounting accounting for oil and gas activity is subject to special accounting rules unique to the oil and gas industry. the acquisition of g&g seismic information, prior to the discovery of proved reserves, is expensed as incurred, similar to accounting for research and development costs. however, leasehold acquisition costs and exploratory well costs are capitalized on the balance sheet pending determination of whether proved oil and gas reserves have been recognized.
property acquisition costs for individually significant leaseholds, management periodically assesses for impairment based on exploration and drilling efforts to date. for insignificant individual leasehold acquisition costs, management exercises judgment and determines a percentage probability that the prospect ultimately will fail to find proved oil and gas reserves, including estimates of future expirations, and pools that leasehold information with others in similar geographic areas. for prospects in areas with limited, or no, previous exploratory drilling, the percentage probability of ultimate failure is normally judged to be quite high. this judgmental percentage is multiplied by the leasehold acquisition cost, and that product is divided by the contractual period of the leasehold to determine a periodic leasehold impairment charge that is reported in exploration expense. this judgmental probability percentage is reassessed and adjusted throughout the contractual period of the leasehold based on favorable or unfavorable exploratory activity on the leasehold or on adjacent leaseholds, and leasehold impairment amortization expense is adjusted prospectively.
at year-end 2023, we held $4.4 billion of net capitalized unproved property costs which consisted primarily of individually significant and pooled leaseholds, mineral rights held in perpetuity by title ownership, exploratory wells currently being drilled, suspended exploratory wells and capitalized interest. of this amount, approximately $3.0 billion is concentrated in the delaware and midland basins, where we have an ongoing significant and active development program. outside of the delaware and midland basins, the remaining $1.4 billion is primarily concentrated in canada. management periodically assesses our unproved property for impairment based on the results of exploration and drilling efforts and the outlook for commercialization.
exploratory costs for exploratory wells, drilling costs are temporarily capitalized, or "suspended," on the balance sheet, pending a determination of whether potentially economic oil and gas reserves have been discovered by the drilling effort to justify development.
if exploratory wells encounter potentially economic quantities of oil and gas, the well costs remain capitalized on the balance sheet as long as sufficient progress assessing the reserves and the economic and operating viability of the project is being made. the accounting notion of "sufficient progress" is a judgmental area, but the accounting rules do prohibit continued capitalization of suspended well costs on the expectation future market conditions will improve or new technologies will be found that would make the development economically profitable. often, the ability to move into the development phase and record proved reserves is dependent on obtaining permits and government or coventurer approvals, the timing of which is ultimately beyond our control. exploratory well costs remain suspended as long as we are actively pursuing such approvals and permits and believe they will be obtained. once all required approvals and permits have been obtained, the projects are moved into the development phase, and the oil and gas reserves are designated as proved reserves.
at year-end 2023, total suspended well costs were $184 million, compared with $527 million at year-end 2022. for additional information on suspended wells, including an aging analysis, see note 6.
conocophillips 2023 10-k proved reserves engineering estimates of the quantities of proved reserves are inherently imprecise and represent only approximate amounts because of the judgments involved in developing such information. reserve estimates are based on geological and engineering assessments of in-place hydrocarbon volumes, the production plan, historical extraction recovery and processing yield factors, installed plant operating capacity and approved operating limits. the reliability of these estimates at any point in time depends on both the quality and quantity of the technical and economic data and the efficiency of extracting and processing the hydrocarbons.
despite the inherent imprecision in these engineering estimates, accounting rules require disclosure of "proved" reserve estimates due to the importance of these estimates to better understand the perceived value and future cash flows of a company's operations. there are several authoritative guidelines regarding the engineering criteria that must be met before estimated reserves can be designated as "proved." our geosciences and reservoir engineering organization has policies and procedures in place consistent with these authoritative guidelines. we have trained and experienced internal engineering personnel who estimate our proved reserves held by consolidated companies, as well as our share of equity affiliates. see "supplementary data - oil and gas operations" for additional information.
proved reserve estimates are adjusted annually in the fourth quarter and during the year if significant changes occur and take into account recent production and subsurface information about each field. also, as required by current authoritative guidelines, the estimated future date when an asset will reach the end of its economic life is based on historical 12-month first-of-month average prices and current costs. this date estimates when production will end and affects the amount of estimated reserves. therefore, as prices and cost levels change from year to year, the estimate of proved reserves also changes. generally, our proved reserves decrease as prices decline and increase as prices rise.
our proved reserves include estimated quantities related to pscs, reported under the "economic interest" method, as well as variable-royalty regimes, and are subject to fluctuations in commodity prices, recoverable operating expenses and capital costs. if costs remain stable, reserve quantities attributable to recovery of costs will change inversely to changes in commodity prices. we would expect reserves from these contracts to decrease when product prices rise and increase when prices decline.
the estimation of proved reserves is also important to the income statement because the proved reserve estimate for a field serves as the denominator in the unit-of-production calculation of the dd&a of the capitalized costs for that asset. at year-end 2023, the net book value of productive pp&e subject to a unit-of-production calculation was approximately $62 billion and the dd&a recorded on these assets in 2023 was approximately $8.1 billion. the estimated proved developed reserves for our consolidated operations were 3.8 billion boe at the end of 2022 and 3.7 billion boe at the end of 2023. if the estimates of proved reserves used in the unit-of-production calculations had been lower by 10 percent across all calculations, before-tax dd&a in 2023 would have increased by an estimated $894 million.
business combination-valuation of oil and gas properties for business combinations, management applies the principles of acquisition accounting under fasb asc topic 805 - "business combinations" and allocates the purchase price to assets acquired and liabilities assumed, based on their estimated fair values as of the acquisition date. estimating the fair values involves making various assumptions, of which the most significant assumptions relate to the fair values assigned to proved and unproved oil and gas properties. for significant business combinations, management generally utilizes a discounted cash flow approach, based on market participant assumptions, and considers engaging third party valuation experts in preparing fair value estimates.
significant inputs incorporated within the valuation include future commodity price assumptions and production profiles of reserve estimates, the pace of drilling plans, future operating and development costs, inflation rates, and discount rates using a market-based weighted average cost of capital determined at the time of the acquisition. when estimating the fair value of unproved properties, additional risk-weighting adjustments are applied to probable and possible reserves.
the assumptions and inputs incorporated within the fair value estimates are subject to considerable management judgement and are based on industry, market, and economic conditions prevalent at the time of the acquisition. although we based these estimates on assumptions believed to be reasonable, these estimates are inherently unpredictable and uncertain and actual results could differ. see note 3.
conocophillips 2023 10-k impairments long-lived assets used in operations are assessed for impairment whenever changes in facts and circumstances indicate a possible significant deterioration in the future cash flows expected to be generated by an asset group. if there is an indication the carrying amount of an asset may not be recovered, a recoverability test is performed using management's assumptions for prices, volumes and future development plans. if the sum of the undiscounted cash flows before income-taxes is less than the carrying value of the asset group, the carrying value is written down to estimated fair value and reported as an impairment in the periods in which the determination is made. individual assets are grouped for impairment purposes at the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows of other groups of assets-generally on a field-by-field basis for e&p assets. because there usually is a lack of quoted market prices for long-lived assets, the fair value of impaired assets is typically determined based on the present values of expected future cash flows using discount rates and prices believed to be consistent with those used by principal market participants, or based on a multiple of operating cash flow validated with historical market transactions of similar assets where possible.
the expected future cash flows used for impairment reviews and related fair value calculations are based on estimated future production volumes, commodity prices, operating costs and capital decisions, considering all available evidence at the date of review. differing assumptions could affect the timing and the amount of an impairment in any period. see note 6 and note 7.
investments in nonconsolidated entities accounted for under the equity method are assessed for impairment whenever changes in the facts and circumstances indicate a loss in value has occurred. such evidence of a loss in value might include our inability to recover the carrying amount, the lack of sustained earnings capacity which would justify the current investment amount, or a current fair value less than the investment's carrying amount. when such a condition is judgmentally determined to be other than temporary, an impairment charge is recognized for the difference between the investment's carrying value and its estimated fair value. when determining whether a decline in value is other than temporary, management considers factors such as the length of time and extent of the decline, the investee's financial condition and near-term prospects, and our ability and intention to retain our investment for a period that will be sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in the market value of the investment. since quoted market prices are usually not available, the fair value is typically based on the present value of expected future cash flows using discount rates and prices believed to be consistent with those used by principal market participants, plus market analysis of comparable assets owned by the investee, if appropriate. differing assumptions could affect the timing and the amount of an impairment of an investment in any period. see the "aplng" section of note 4.
asset retirement obligations and environmental costs under various contracts, permits and regulations, we have material legal obligations to remove tangible equipment and restore the land or seabed at the end of operations at operational sites. our largest asset removal obligations involve plugging and abandonment of wells, removal and disposal of offshore oil and gas platforms around the world, as well as oil and gas production facilities and pipelines in alaska. fair value is estimated using a present value approach, incorporating assumptions about estimated amounts and timing of settlements and impacts of the use of technologies. estimating future asset removal costs requires significant judgement. most of these removal obligations are many years, or decades, in the future and the contracts and regulations often have vague descriptions of what removal practices and criteria must be met when the removal event actually occurs. the carrying value of our asset retirement obligation estimate is sensitive to inputs such as asset removal technologies and costs, regulatory and other compliance considerations, expenditure timing, and other inputs into valuation of the obligation, including discount and inflation rates, which are all subject to change between the time of initial recognition of the liability and future settlement of our obligation.
normally, changes in asset removal obligations are reflected in the income statement as increases or decreases to dd&a over the remaining life of the assets. however, for assets at or nearing the end of their operations, as well as previously sold assets for which we retained the asset removal obligation, an increase in the asset removal obligation can result in an immediate charge to earnings, because any increase in pp&e due to the increased obligation would immediately be subject to impairment, due to the low fair value of these properties.
in addition to asset removal obligations, under the above or similar contracts, permits and regulations, we have certain environmental-related projects. these are primarily related to remediation activities required by canada and various states within the u.s. at exploration and production sites. future environmental remediation costs are difficult to estimate because they are subject to change due to such factors as the uncertain magnitude of cleanup costs, the unknown time and extent of such remedial actions that may be required, and the determination of our liability in proportion to that of other responsible parties. see note 8.
conocophillips 2023 10-k projected benefit obligations the actuarial determination of projected benefit obligations and company contribution requirements involves judgment about uncertain future events, including estimated retirement dates, salary levels at retirement, mortality rates, lump-sum election rates, rates of return on plan assets, future health care cost-trend rates, and rates of utilization of health care services by retirees. due to the specialized nature of these calculations, we engage outside actuarial firms to assist in the determination of these projected benefit obligations and company contribution requirements. ultimately, we will be required to fund all vested benefits under pension and postretirement benefit plans not funded by plan assets or investment returns, but the judgmental assumptions used in the actuarial calculations significantly affect periodic financial statements and funding patterns over time. projected benefit obligations are particularly sensitive to the discount rate assumption. a 100 basis-point decrease in the discount rate assumption would increase projected benefit obligations by $600 million. benefit expense is sensitive to the discount rate and return on plan assets assumptions. a 100 basis-point decrease in the discount rate assumption would increase annual benefit expense by $50 million, while a 100 basis-point decrease in the return on plan assets assumption would increase annual benefit expense by $40 million. in determining the discount rate, we use yields on high-quality fixed income investments matched to the estimated benefit cash flows of our plans. we are also exposed to the possibility that lump sum retirement benefits taken from pension plans during the year could exceed the total of service and interest components of annual pension expense and trigger accelerated recognition of a portion of unrecognized net actuarial losses and gains. these benefit payments are based on decisions by plan participants and are therefore difficult to predict. in the event there is a significant reduction in the expected years of future service of present employees or the elimination of the accrual of defined benefits for some or all of their future services for a significant number of employees, we could recognize a curtailment gain or loss. see note 16.
contingencies a number of claims and lawsuits are made against the company arising in the ordinary course of business. management exercises judgment related to accounting and disclosure of these claims which includes losses, damages, and underpayments associated with environmental remediation, tax, contracts, and other legal disputes. as we learn new facts concerning contingencies, we reassess our position both with respect to amounts recognized and disclosed considering changes to the probability of additional losses and potential exposure. however, actual losses can and do vary from estimates for a variety of reasons including legal, arbitration, or other third-party decisions; settlement discussions; evaluation of scope of damages; interpretation of regulatory or contractual terms; expected timing of future actions; and proportion of liability shared with other responsible parties. estimated future costs related to contingencies are subject to change as events evolve and as additional information becomes available during the administrative and litigation processes. for additional information on contingent liabilities, see the "contingencies" section within "capital resources and liquidity" and note 11.
income taxes we are subject to income taxation in numerous jurisdictions worldwide. we record deferred tax assets and liabilities to account for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements and our tax returns. we routinely assess our deferred tax assets and reduce such assets by a valuation allowance if we deem it is more likely than not that some portion, or all, of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. in assessing the need for adjustments to existing valuation allowances, we consider all available positive and negative evidence. positive evidence includes reversals of temporary differences, forecasts of future taxable income, assessment of future business assumptions and applicable tax planning strategies that are prudent and feasible. negative evidence includes losses in recent years as well as the forecasts of future net income (loss) in the realizable period. in making our assessment regarding valuation allowances, we weight the evidence based on objectivity. numerous judgments and assumptions are inherent in the determination of future taxable income, including factors such as future operating conditions and the assessment of the effects of foreign taxes on our u.s. federal income taxes (particularly as related to prevailing oil and gas prices). see note 17.
we regularly assess and, if required, establish accruals for uncertain tax positions that could result from assessments of additional tax by taxing jurisdictions in countries where we operate. we recognize a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination, based on the technical merits of the position. these accruals for uncertain tax positions are subject to a significant amount of judgment and are reviewed and adjusted on a periodic basis in light of changing facts and circumstances considering the progress of ongoing tax audits, court proceedings, changes in applicable tax laws, including tax case rulings and legislative guidance, or expiration of the applicable statute of limitations. see note 17.

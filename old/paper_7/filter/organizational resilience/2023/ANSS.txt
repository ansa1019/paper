business ansys, a corporation formed in 1994, develops and globally markets engineering simulation software and services widely used by engineers, designers, researchers and students across a broad spectrum of industries and academia, including high-tech, aerospace and defense, automotive, energy, industrial equipment, materials and chemicals, consumer products, healthcare and construction. headquartered south of pittsburgh, pennsylvania, we employed 6,200 and 5,600 people as of december 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. we focus on the development of open and flexible solutions that enable users to analyze designs on-premises and/or via the cloud, providing a common platform for fast, efficient and cost-conscious product development, from design concept to final-stage testing, validation and deployment. we distribute our suite of simulation technologies through direct sales offices in strategic, global locations and a global network of independent resellers and distributors (collectively, channel partners). it is our intention to continue to maintain this hybrid sales and distribution model. we operate and report as one segment.
when visionary companies need to know how their world-changing ideas will perform, they close the gap between design and reality using ansys simulation. for more than 50 years, ansys software has enabled innovators across industries to push the boundaries of product design by using the predictive power of simulation. from sustainable transportation and advanced satellite systems to life-saving medical devices, ansys powers innovation that drives human advancement.
our strategy of pervasive insights seeks to deepen the use of simulation in our core market, to inject simulation throughout the product lifecycle and extend the accessibility to a broader set of users and use cases. our business has three vectors of growth:
•more products. our broad and deep multiphysics portfolio enables us to grow with customers as they use simulation to solve more complex problems across a broad set of industries.
•more users. investments in simulation education and user experience simplification has made simulation more accessible to a broader user base.
•more computations. larger and more complex simulations drive more computation, requiring customers to use more ansys licenses to complete their simulations.
through decades of investments in the academic community and enhanced user experiences, our solutions have become accessible and relevant beyond our core "engineering" end user, to reach more users upstream and downstream from our core, which is the product validation process. our multiphysics solutions enable our customers to address increasingly complex r&d challenges from the component through the system and mission level of analysis. our products seamlessly enable access to high performance compute capacity to run simulations, on-premises or in the cloud, which means our customers' r&d teams are unencumbered by compute capacity limitations that can hinder r&d cycle times. our investments in artificial intelligence capabilities across our simulation portfolio and technical support services enhance the customer experience, democratize simulation and further next-generation innovation.
the engineering software simulation market is strong and growing. the market growth is driven by customers' need for rapid, quality innovation in a cost-efficient manner, enabling faster time to market for new products and lower warranty costs. increasing product complexity is driving sustained demand for simulations. key industry trends fueling customers' increasing needs for simulation include:
•sustainability, including minimizing waste and physical prototyping, and improving circularity and development time.
we have been investing and intend to continue to invest in our portfolio to broaden the range of physics and enable customers to analyze the interactions among physics at the component, system and mission level. our strategy of pervasive insights is aligned with the near-term market growth opportunities and is laying the foundation for a future where simulation can be further democratized to broader classes of end-users and end-use cases. in addition, we have and will continue to partner with industry leaders to extend simulation into other ecosystems and customer r&d workflows.
we license our technology to businesses in a diverse set of industries, educational institutions and governmental agencies. we believe that the features, functionality and integrated multiphysics capabilities of our software products are as strong as they have ever been. the software business is generally characterized by long sales cycles which increase the difficulty of predicting sales for any particular quarter. we make many operational and strategic decisions based upon short- and long-term sales forecasts that are impacted not only by these long sales cycles, but also by current global economic conditions. as a result, we believe that our overall performance is best measured by fiscal year results rather than by quarterly results. please see the sub-section entitled "company operational risks" under part i, item 1a. of this annual report on form 10-k for additional discussion of the potential impact of our sales forecasts on our financial condition, cash flows and operating results.
we address the competition and price pressure that we face in the short- and long-term by focusing on expanding the breadth, depth, ease of use and quality of the technologies, features, functionality and integrated multiphysics capabilities of our software products as compared to our competitors; investing in research and development to develop new and innovative products and increasing the capabilities of our existing products; maintaining a diverse industry footprint and focusing on customer needs, training, consulting and support; and enhancing our distribution channels. we also evaluate and execute strategic acquisitions to supplement our global engineering talent, product offerings and distribution channels.
synopsys merger agreement on january 15, 2024, we entered into the merger agreement with synopsys and merger sub, pursuant to which merger sub will merge with and into ansys, with ansys surviving the merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of synopsys. our board of directors has unanimously approved the merger agreement and, subject to certain exceptions set forth in the merger agreement, resolved to recommend that our stockholders adopt the merger agreement. if the merger is consummated, our common stock will be delisted from the nasdaq global select market and deregistered under the exchange act.
under the merger agreement, at the effective time of the merger, each issued and outstanding share of our common stock (subject to certain exceptions set forth in the merger agreement) will be cancelled and converted into the right to receive (i) 0.3450 of a share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of synopsys and (ii) $197.00 in cash, without interest, subject to applicable withholding taxes. with regard to the stock consideration, if the aggregate number of shares of synopsys common stock to be issued in connection with the merger would exceed the maximum share number, (a) the exchange ratio will be reduced to the minimum extent necessary such that the aggregate number of shares of synopsys common stock to be issued in connection with the merger does not exceed the maximum share number and (b) the per share cash amount will be correspondingly increased to offset such adjustment.
the merger agreement contains customary representations, warranties and covenants made by each of ansys, synopsys, and merger sub, including, among others, covenants regarding the conduct of our and synopsys' businesses during the pendency of the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, the making of certain public disclosures and other matters as described in the merger agreement. we and synopsys have agreed to use reasonable best efforts to take all actions necessary to consummate the merger, including cooperating to obtain the regulatory approvals necessary to complete the merger. we have agreed not to, among other things, (a) solicit proposals relating to alternative transactions or (b) enter into discussions or negotiations or provide non-public information in connection with any proposal for an alternative transaction from a third party, subject to certain exceptions to permit our board of directors to comply with its fiduciary obligations. we have further agreed to cease and cause to be terminated any existing discussions or negotiations, if any, with regard to alternative transactions.
the merger agreement may be terminated under certain circumstances, including that either party may have the right to terminate if the merger is not completed by january 15, 2025, which may be extended to january 15, 2026 as provided in the merger agreement. if the merger agreement is terminated, (a) synopsys, under specified circumstances, including termination following an injunction arising in connection with certain antitrust or foreign investment laws, will be required to pay us a termination fee of $1,500.0 million; and (b) we, under specified circumstances, including our termination of the merger agreement to accept and enter into a definitive agreement with respect to a superior proposal (as defined in the merger agreement) or synopsys' termination upon the change by our board of directors of its recommendation in favor of the merger, will be required to pay synopsys a termination fee of $950.0 million.
the completion of the merger is subject to customary closing conditions, including, among others, approval of the merger under certain applicable antitrust and foreign investment regimes and the adoption of the merger agreement by our stockholders. we anticipate the transaction to close in the first half of 2025.
overview overall gaap and non-gaap results this section includes a discussion of gaap and non-gaap results. for reconciliations of non-gaap results to gaap results, see the section titled "non-gaap results" herein.
the 2023 period non-gaap results exclude the income statement effects of stock-based compensation, excess payroll taxes related to stock-based compensation, amortization of acquired intangible assets, expenses related to business combinations and adjustments for the income tax effect of the excluded items. the 2022 period non-gaap results also exclude the income statement effects of acquisition accounting adjustments to deferred revenue from business combinations closed prior to 2022. this adjustment is not material in 2023.
operating income                                5.6     %                          11.1     %
our results reflect an increase in revenue during the year ended december 31, 2023 due to growth in subscription lease license, maintenance and service revenue. we also experienced increased operating expenses during the year ended december 31, 2023, primarily due to increased personnel costs. the actual u.s. dollar reported results were impacted by a stronger u.s. dollar.
this section also includes a discussion of constant currency results, which we use for financial and operational decision-making and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons by excluding the effects of foreign currency fluctuations on the reported results. constant currency is a non-gaap measure. all constant currency results presented in this item 7 exclude the effects of foreign currency fluctuations on the reported results. to present this information, the 2023 results for entities whose functional currency is a currency other than the u.s. dollar were converted to u.s. dollars at rates that were in effect for the 2022 comparable period, rather than the actual exchange rates in effect for 2023. constant currency growth rates are calculated by adjusting the 2023 reported amounts by the 2023 currency fluctuation impacts and comparing to the 2022 comparable period reported amounts.
impact of foreign currency our comparative financial results were impacted by fluctuations in the u.s. dollar during the year ended december 31, 2023 as compared to the year ended december 31, 2022. the impacts on our revenue and operating income as a result of the fluctuations of the u.s. dollar when measured against our foreign currencies based on 2022 exchange rates are reflected in the table below. amounts in brackets indicate an adverse impact from currency fluctuations.

other key business metric annual contract value (acv) is a key performance metric and is useful to investors in assessing the strength and trajectory of our business. acv is a supplemental metric to help evaluate the annual performance of the business. over the life of the contract, acv equals the total value realized from a customer. acv is not impacted by the timing of license revenue recognition. acv is used by management in financial and operational decision-making and in setting sales targets used for compensation. acv is not a replacement for, and should be viewed independently of, gaap revenue and deferred revenue as acv is a performance metric and is not intended to be combined with any of these items. there is no gaap measure comparable to acv. acv is composed of the following:
•the annualized value of maintenance and subscription lease contracts with start dates or anniversary dates during the period, plus
•the value of perpetual license contracts with start dates during the period, plus
•the annualized value of fixed-term services contracts with start dates or anniversary dates during the period, plus
•the value of work performed during the period on fixed-deliverable services contracts.
when we refer to the anniversary dates in the definition of acv above, we are referencing the date of the beginning of the next twelve-month period in a contractually committed multi-year contract. if a contract is three years in duration, with a start date of july 1, 2023, the anniversary dates would be july 1, 2024 and july 1, 2025. we label these anniversary dates as they are contractually committed. while this contract would be up for renewal on july 1, 2026, our acv performance metric does not assume any contract renewals.
example 1: for purposes of calculating acv, a $100,000 subscription lease contract or a $100,000 maintenance contract with a term of july 1, 2023 - june 30, 2024, would each contribute $100,000 to acv for fiscal year 2023 with no contribution to acv for fiscal year 2024.
example 2: for purposes of calculating acv, a $300,000 subscription lease contract or a $300,000 maintenance contract with a term of july 1, 2023 - june 30, 2026, would each contribute $100,000 to acv in each of fiscal years 2023, 2024 and 2025. there would be no contribution to acv for fiscal year 2026 as each period captures the full annual value upon the anniversary date.
example 3: a perpetual license valued at $200,000 with a contract start date of march 1, 2023 would contribute $200,000 to acv in fiscal year 2023.
(in thousands, except percentages)        2023                                                     2022                                         change actual                           constant currency                   actual                           actual                                        constant currency amount                                                                                                amount                      %                 amount                      %
recurring acv includes both subscription lease license and maintenance acv and excludes perpetual license and service acv.
industry commentary in 2023, acv growth was broad based across industries. our core industries of high-tech, aerospace and defense (a&d) and automotive experienced growth as we continue to see trends, such as generative ai, pervasive connectivity and electrification, transform industry landscapes. our technology remains a vital component to our customers' success as the need for innovation and agility reaches new heights. in the high-tech industry, the proliferation of connected devices is driving more applications for analog chips across industries, including automotive and healthcare. in tandem, our customers continue to invest in our solutions to develop advanced packaging technologies, such as 3d-ic, to overcome integration density constraints and meet the needs of compute-intensive applications, such as ai/ml. within the automotive industry, our simulation solutions remain vital components in the development and validation of safe, reliable adas features, electrified powertrains and software-defined vehicles. additionally, in the a&d industry, our modeling and simulation capabilities remain central to the development and deployment of more efficient aircraft, the advanced air mobility segment and increasingly complex defense technology.
revenue results from region to region can fluctuate due to the timing, duration and size of multi-year lease subscription contracts in any particular period and are not necessarily indicative of the underlying operational performance. to drive growth, we continue to focus on a number of sales improvement activities across the geographic regions, including sales hiring, pipeline building, productivity initiatives and customer engagement activities.
during the year ended december 31, 2023, trade restrictions limited the sale of certain ansys products and services to entities performing research & development and certain controlled activities in china. additional restrictions or a further deterioration in the global trade environment could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations or financial condition. refer to part i, item 1a herein for a discussion of additional business risks, including those associated with the export of certain technologies to china.
acquisitions we make targeted acquisitions in order to support our long-term strategic direction, accelerate innovation, provide increased capabilities to our existing products, supply new products and services, expand our customer base and enhance our distribution channels.
on january 3, 2023, we completed the acquisition of dynamore for a purchase price of $139.2 million, or $126.4 million net of cash acquired. the acquisition expands our position as a simulation solution provider within the automotive industry. the effects of the acquisition were not material to our consolidated results of operations.
additionally, during the year ended december 31, 2023 and 2022, we completed other acquisitions to expand our solution offerings and enhance our customers' experience. the effects of the acquisitions were not material to our consolidated results of operations individually or in the aggregate. the combined purchase price of these acquisitions during the years ended december 31, 2023 and 2022 was $94.4 million, or $88.3 million net of cash acquired, and $401.7 million, or $390.8 million net of cash acquired, respectively.

revenue for the year ended december 31, 2023 increased 9.9% compared to the year ended december 31, 2022, or 10.2% in constant currency. maintenance revenue growth of 9.9%, or 10.3% in constant currency, is correlated with the license sales discussed later in this paragraph and is driven substantially by our existing customer base. the reported $99.3 million growth in maintenance revenue was attributable to a $95.8 million increase in maintenance associated with lease licenses and a $3.5 million increase in maintenance associated with perpetual sales. subscription lease license revenue increased 14.3%, or 14.4% in constant currency, as compared to the year ended december 31, 2022, with substantially all of the increase attributable to additional sales to our existing customers. the reported $98.4 million increase in lease license revenue was attributable to a $83.8 million increase in value from multi-year licenses and a $14.6 million increase in value from annual licenses.
we continue to experience increased demand from our customers for contracts that often include longer-term, subscription leases involving a larger number of our software products. these arrangements typically involve a higher overall transaction price. the upfront recognition of license revenue related to these larger transactions can result in significant subscription lease revenue volatility. software products, across a large variety of applications and industries, are increasingly distributed in software-as-a-service, cloud and other subscription environments in which the licensing approach is time-based rather than perpetual. this preference could result in a shift from perpetual licenses to time-based licenses, such as subscription leases, over the long term.
with respect to revenue, on average for the year ended december 31, 2023, the u.s. dollar was 0.6% stronger, when measured against our foreign currencies, than for the year ended december 31, 2022. the table below presents the net impacts of currency fluctuations on revenue for the year ended december 31, 2023. amounts in brackets indicate a net adverse impact from currency fluctuations.

software licenses: the increase in the cost of software licenses was primarily due to increased third-party royalties of $7.1 million.
amortization: the increase in amortization expense was primarily due to the amortization of newly acquired intangible assets.
maintenance and service: the net increase in maintenance and service costs was primarily due to the following:
•increased stock-based compensation of $3.3 million.
•decreased salaries of $1.2 million.
the improvement in gross profit was a result of the increase in revenue.

•increased salaries, incentive compensation and other headcount-related costs of $50.2 million.
•increased stock-based compensation of $33.1 million.
•increased business travel of $8.1 million as in-person meetings and live attendance at trade events have continued to expand.
•increased it maintenance and software hosting costs of $3.0 million.
•decreased third-party commissions of $6.3 million.
•decreased costs related to foreign exchange translation of $3.5 million due to a stronger u.s. dollar.
•decreased bad debt expense of $3.5 million.
we anticipate that we will continue to make targeted investments in our global sales and marketing organizations and our global business infrastructure to enhance and support our revenue-generating activities.
research and development: the increase in research and development costs was primarily due to the following:
•increased salaries, incentive compensation and other headcount-related expenses of $41.0 million.
•increased stock-based compensation of $17.4 million.
•increased it maintenance and software hosting costs of $2.9 million.
amortization: the increase in amortization expense was primarily due to the amortization of newly acquired intangible assets.
we have traditionally invested significant resources in research and development activities and intend to continue to make investments in expanding the ease of use and capabilities of our broad portfolio of simulation software products.
overall, the impacts from currency fluctuations resulted in decreased operating income of $1.4 million for the year ended december 31, 2023 as compared to the year ended december 31, 2022.
interest income: interest income for the year ended december 31, 2023 was $19.6 million as compared to $5.7 million for the year ended december 31, 2022. the higher interest rate environment and the related increase in the average rate of return on invested cash balances was partially offset by a lower invested cash balance as a result of investments in acquisitions and share repurchases.
interest expense: interest expense for the year ended december 31, 2023 was $47.1 million as compared to $22.7 million for the year ended december 31, 2022 due to a higher interest rate environment.
other expense, net: our other expense consisted of the following:
the increase in the effective tax rate from the prior year was primarily due to a non-recurring benefit in 2022 of $22.8 million related to u.s. tax benefits on foreign earnings from entity structuring activities, a decrease in benefits related to stock-based compensation of $9.0 million, a non-recurring benefit in 2022 of $8.7 million related to extraterritorial income exclusions from prior periods and an $8.3 million decrease in the benefit related to foreign-derived intangible income (fdii). these increases were offset by a $10.6 million decrease in tax related to global intangible low-taxed income as a result of a change in estimate from the prior year.
when compared to the federal and state combined statutory rate for each respective period, the effective tax rates for the years ended december 31, 2023 and 2022 were favorably impacted by tax benefits from the fdii deduction and research and development credits, partially offset by the impact of non-deductible compensation.
non-gaap results we provide non-gaap revenue, non-gaap gross profit, non-gaap gross profit margin, non-gaap operating income, non-gaap operating profit margin, non-gaap net income and non-gaap diluted earnings per share as supplemental measures to gaap regarding our operational performance. these financial measures exclude the impact of certain items and, therefore, have not been calculated in accordance with gaap. a detailed explanation and a reconciliation of each non-gaap financial measure to its most comparable gaap financial measure are included below, as applicable.

we use non-gaap financial measures (a) to evaluate our historical and prospective financial performance as well as our performance relative to our competitors, (b) to set internal sales targets and spending budgets, (c) to allocate resources, (d) to measure operational profitability and the accuracy of forecasting, (e) to assess financial discipline over operational expenditures and (f) as an important factor in determining variable compensation for management and employees. in addition, many financial analysts that follow us focus on and publish both historical results and future projections based on non-gaap financial measures. we believe that it is in the best interest of our investors to provide this information to analysts so that they accurately report the non-gaap financial information. moreover, investors have historically requested, and we have historically reported, these non-gaap financial measures as a means of providing consistent and comparable information with past reports of financial results.
while we believe that these non-gaap financial measures provide useful supplemental information to investors, there are limitations associated with the use of these non-gaap financial measures. these non-gaap financial measures are not prepared in accordance with gaap, are not reported by all our competitors and may not be directly comparable to similarly titled measures of our competitors due to potential differences in the exact method of calculation. we compensate for these limitations by using these non-gaap financial measures as supplements to gaap financial measures and by reviewing the reconciliations of the non-gaap financial measures to their most comparable gaap financial measures.
the adjustments to these non-gaap financial measures, and the basis for such adjustments, are outlined below:
acquisition accounting for deferred revenue. historically, we have consummated acquisitions in order to support our strategic and other business objectives. under prior accounting guidance, a fair value provision resulted in acquired deferred revenue that was often recorded on the opening balance sheet at an amount that was lower than the historical carrying value. although this fair value provision has no impact on our business or cash flow, it adversely impacts our reported gaap revenue in the reporting periods following an acquisition. in 2022, we adopted accounting guidance which eliminates the fair value provision that resulted in the deferred revenue adjustment on a prospective basis. in order to provide investors with financial information that facilitates comparison of both historical and future results, we have historically provided non-gaap financial measures which exclude the impact of the acquisition accounting adjustment for acquisitions prior to the adoption of the new guidance in 2022. the 2022 non-gaap financial measures presented in this document include the adjustment to exclude the income statement effects of acquisition accounting adjustments to deferred revenue from business combinations closed prior to 2022. there is no adjustment included for 2023 as the impact is not material.
amortization of intangible assets from acquisitions. we incur amortization of intangible assets, included in our gaap presentation of amortization expense, related to various acquisitions we have made. we exclude these expenses for the purpose of calculating non-gaap gross profit, non-gaap gross profit margin, non-gaap operating income, non-gaap operating profit margin, non-gaap net income and non-gaap diluted earnings per share when we evaluate our continuing operational performance because these costs are fixed at the time of an acquisition, are then amortized over a period of several years after the acquisition and generally cannot be changed or influenced by us after the acquisition. accordingly, we do not consider these expenses for purposes of evaluating our performance during the applicable time period after the acquisition, and we exclude such expenses when making decisions to allocate resources. we believe that these non-gaap financial measures are useful to investors because they allow investors to (a) evaluate the effectiveness of the methodology and information used by us in our financial and operational decision-making, and (b) compare our past reports of financial results as we have historically reported these non-gaap financial measures.
stock-based compensation expense. we incur expense related to stock-based compensation included in our gaap presentation of cost of maintenance and service; research and development expense; and selling, general and administrative expense. this non-gaap adjustment also includes excess payroll tax expense related to stock-based compensation. although stock-based compensation is an expense and viewed as a form of compensation, we exclude these expenses for the purpose of calculating non-gaap gross profit, non-gaap gross profit margin, non-gaap operating income, non-gaap operating profit margin, non-gaap net income and non-gaap diluted earnings per share when we evaluate our continuing operational performance. specifically, we exclude stock-based compensation during our annual budgeting process and our quarterly and annual assessments of our performance. the annual budgeting process is the primary mechanism whereby we allocate resources to various initiatives and operational requirements. additionally, the annual review by our board of directors during which it compares our historical business model and profitability to the planned business model and profitability for the forthcoming year excludes the impact of stock-based compensation. in evaluating the performance of our senior management and department managers, charges related to stock-based compensation are excluded from expenditure and profitability results. in fact, we record stock-based compensation expense into a stand-alone cost center for which no single operational manager is responsible or accountable. in this way, we can review, on a period-to-period basis, each manager's performance and assess financial discipline over operational expenditures without the effect of stock-based compensation. we believe that these non-gaap financial measures are useful to investors because they allow investors to (a) evaluate our operating results and the effectiveness of the methodology used by us to review our operating results, and (b) review historical comparability in our financial reporting as well as comparability with competitors' operating results.
expenses related to business combinations. we incur expenses for professional services rendered in connection with business combinations, which are included in our gaap presentation of selling, general and administrative expense. we also incur other expenses directly related to business combinations, including compensation expenses and concurrent restructuring activities, such as employee severances and other exit costs. these costs are included in our gaap presentation of selling, general and administrative and research and development expenses. we exclude these acquisition-related expenses for the purpose of calculating non-gaap operating income, non-gaap operating profit margin, non-gaap net income and non-gaap diluted earnings per share when we evaluate our continuing operational performance, as we generally would not have otherwise incurred these expenses in the periods presented as a part of our operations. we believe that these non-gaap financial measures are useful to investors because they allow investors to (a) evaluate our operating results and the effectiveness of the methodology used by us to review our operating results, and (b) review historical comparability in our financial reporting as well as comparability with competitors' operating results.
non-gaap tax provision. we utilize a normalized non-gaap annual effective tax rate (aetr) to calculate non-gaap measures. this methodology provides better consistency across interim reporting periods by eliminating the effects of non-recurring items and aligning the non-gaap tax rate with our expected geographic earnings mix. to project this rate, we analyzed our historic and projected non-gaap earnings mix by geography along with other factors such as our current tax structure, recurring tax credits and incentives, and expected tax positions. on an annual basis we re-evaluate and update this rate for significant items that may materially affect our projections.
non-gaap financial measures are not in accordance with, or an alternative for, gaap. our non-gaap financial measures are not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for comparable gaap financial measures and should be read only in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with gaap.
we have provided a reconciliation of the non-gaap financial measures to the most directly comparable gaap financial measures as listed below:
gaap reporting measure           non-gaap reporting measure revenue                          non-gaap revenue gross profit                     non-gaap gross profit gross profit margin              non-gaap gross profit margin operating income                 non-gaap operating income operating profit margin          non-gaap operating profit margin net income                       non-gaap net income diluted earnings per share       non-gaap diluted earnings per share constant currency. in addition to the non-gaap financial measures detailed above, we use constant currency results for financial and operational decision-making and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons by excluding the effects of foreign currency fluctuations on the reported results. to present this information, the 2023 results for entities whose functional currency is a currency other than the u.s. dollar were converted to u.s. dollars at rates that were in effect for the 2022 comparable period, rather than the actual exchange rates in effect for 2023. constant currency growth rates are calculated by adjusting the 2023 reported amounts by the 2023 currency fluctuation impacts and comparing the adjusted amounts to the 2022 comparable period reported amounts. we believe that these non-gaap financial measures are useful to investors because they allow investors to (a) evaluate the effectiveness of the methodology and information used by us in our financial and operational decision-making, and (b) compare our reported results to our past reports of financial results without the effects of foreign currency fluctuations.
liquidity and capital resources as of december 31,   change
working capital                                                      $1,160,273                          $869,286        $290,987                   33.5
cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments cash and cash equivalents consist primarily of highly liquid investments such as money market funds and deposits held at major banks. short-term investments consist primarily of deposits held by certain of our foreign subsidiaries with original maturities of three months to one year. the following table presents our foreign and domestic holdings of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments as of december 31, 2023 and 2022:
as of december 31,
(in thousands, except percentages)                   2023                 % of total   2022                                    % of total domestic                                     $529,092                     61.5                     $326,784                    53.2
in general, it is our intention to permanently reinvest all earnings in excess of previously taxed amounts. substantially all of the pre-2018 earnings of our non-u.s. subsidiaries were taxed through the transition tax and post-2018 current earnings are taxed as part of global intangible low-taxed income tax expense. these taxes increase our previously taxed earnings and allow for the repatriation of the majority of our foreign earnings without any residual u.s. federal tax. unrecognized provisions for taxes on indefinitely reinvested undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries would not be significant.
the amount of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments held by foreign subsidiaries is subject to translation adjustments caused by changes in foreign currency exchange rates as of the end of each respective reporting period, the offset to which is recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss on our consolidated balance sheet.
cash flows from operating activities year ended december 31,   change

net cash provided by operating activities increased during the current fiscal year due to increased customer receipts driven primarily by acv growth, partially offset by payments related to higher operating expenses, interest payments due to the higher interest rate environment as compared to the year ended december 31, 2022 and increased income tax payments associated with higher taxable income.

net cash used in investing activities decreased during the current fiscal year due primarily to decreased cash outlays for acquisitions of $177.4 million. we currently plan capital spending of $40.0 million to $50.0 million during fiscal year 2024 as compared to the $25.3 million that was spent in fiscal year 2023. the level of spending will depend on various factors, including the growth of the business and general economic conditions.
cash flows from financing activities year ended december 31,                                  change
net cash used in financing activities decreased during the current fiscal year primarily due to decreased stock repurchases of $9.1 million and increased proceeds from shares issued for stock-based compensation of $4.5 million.
other cash flow information on june 30, 2022, we entered into a credit agreement (the 2022 credit agreement) with pnc bank, national association as administrative agent, swing line lender, and an l/c issuer, the lenders party thereto, and the other l/c issuers party thereto. the 2022 credit agreement refinanced our previous credit agreements in their entirety. the 2022 credit agreement provides for a $755.0 million unsecured term loan facility and a $500.0 million unsecured revolving loan facility, which includes a $50.0 million sublimit for the issuance of letters of credit. terms used in this description of the 2022 credit agreement with initial capital letters that are not otherwise defined herein are as defined in the 2022 credit agreement.
as of december 31, 2023, the carrying value of our term loan was $753.9 million, with no principal payments due in the next twelve months. borrowings under the term loan and revolving loan facilities accrue interest at a rate that is based on the term sofr plus an applicable margin or at the base rate plus an applicable margin, at our election. the base rate is the highest of (i) the overnight bank funding rate, plus 0.500%, (ii) the pnc bank, national association prime rate, and (iii) daily simple sofr plus an adjustment for sofr plus 1.00%. the applicable margin for the borrowings is a percentage per annum based on the lower of (1) a pricing level determined by our then-current consolidated net leverage ratio and (2) a pricing level determined by our public debt rating (if available).
on september 29, 2023, the 2022 credit agreement was amended to provide for an interest rate adjustment (sustainability rate adjustment) based upon the achievement of certain environmental, social and governance key performance indicators (kpis). the sustainability rate adjustment range is +/- 0.05% and will go into effect in the first quarter of 2024 based on the 2023 kpis and will be adjusted annually based on the kpis of the preceding year.
the rate in effect for the first quarter of 2024 under the 2022 credit agreement is 6.32%.
we previously entered into operating lease commitments, primarily for our domestic and international offices. the commitments related to these operating leases is $137.6 million, of which $27.0 million is due in the next twelve months.
under our stock repurchase program, we repurchased shares as follows:
number of shares repurchased                         650                               725
as of december 31, 2023, 1.1 million shares remained available for repurchase under the program. average price paid per share excludes excise tax. as of january 1, 2023, our share repurchases in excess of issuances are subject to a 1% excise tax enacted by the inflation reduction act. as of december 31, 2023, we had $0.1 million of accrued excise tax. any excise tax incurred is recognized and reflected as part of the cost basis of the shares acquired in the consolidated statements of stockholders' equity. the authorized repurchase program does not have an expiration date.
we continue to generate positive cash flows from operating activities and believe that the best uses of our excess cash are to invest in the business; acquire or make investments in complementary companies, products, services and technologies; and make payments on our outstanding debt balances. any future acquisitions may be funded by available cash and investments, cash generated from operations, debt financing or the issuance of additional securities.
we believe that existing cash and cash equivalent balances, together with cash generated from operations and access to the $500.0 million revolving loan facility, will be sufficient to meet our working capital, capital expenditure requirements and contractual obligations through at least the next twelve months and the foreseeable future thereafter. our cash requirements in the future may also be financed through additional equity or debt financings. however, future disruptions in the capital markets could make financing more challenging and there can be no assurance that such financing can be obtained on commercially reasonable terms, or at all.
contractual and other obligations our significant contractual and other obligations as of december 31, 2023 are summarized below:
global headquarters operating lease(2)                                                           27,343             4,480               22,863
other operating leases(3)                                                                       110,235            22,550               87,685
(1)borrowings under long-term debt accrue interest at a rate that is based on the term sofr plus an applicable margin or at the base rate plus an applicable margin, at our election. the base rate is the highest of (i) the overnight bank funding rate, plus 0.500%, (ii) the pnc bank, national association prime rate, and (iii) daily simple sofr plus an adjustment for sofr plus 1.00%. the applicable margin for the borrowings is a percentage per annum based on the lower of (1) a pricing level determined by our then-current consolidated net leverage ratio and (2) a pricing level determined by our public debt rating (if available). as the interest rate is variable, interest on the long-term debt is estimated using the interest rate as of december 31, 2023. for additional information, see note 10 to the consolidated financial statements included in part iv, item 15 of this annual report on form 10-k.
(2)we previously entered into a lease agreement for 186,000 square feet of rentable space located in an office facility in canonsburg, pennsylvania, which serves as our headquarters. the term of the lease is 183 months, beginning on october 1, 2014 and expiring on december 31, 2029. we have a one-time right to terminate the lease on december 31, 2025 by providing the landlord with at least 18 months' prior written notice of such termination.
(3)other operating leases primarily include lease commitments for our other domestic and international offices as well as certain operating equipment.
(4)unconditional purchase obligations primarily include minimum royalty contracts, software licenses and support, and network services, which are unrecorded as of december 31, 2023. the unconditional purchase obligations are in addition to the current and long-term liabilities recorded on our december 31, 2023 consolidated balance sheet.
(5)we have $54.9 million of unrecognized tax benefits, including estimated interest and penalties, that have been recorded as liabilities in accordance with income tax accounting guidance for which we are uncertain as to if or when such amounts may be settled. as a result, such amounts are excluded from the table above.
(6)on december 5, 2023, we entered into an agreement to make a strategic equity investment. the investment is subject to regulatory approvals and customary closing conditions and is expected to close in the first half of 2024.
if the merger agreement is terminated under certain circumstances specified in the merger agreement, we would be required to pay a termination fee of $950.0 million.
critical accounting estimates we have prepared our consolidated financial statements in accordance with gaap. in preparing our consolidated financial statements, we make assumptions, judgments and estimates that can have a significant impact on our financial position and results of operations. these estimates, assumptions and judgments are made based on our historical experience and on other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. actual results could materially differ from any of our estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
the accounting policies, methods and estimates used to prepare our consolidated financial statements are described in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements included in part iv, item 15 of this annual report on form 10-k. the most critical accounting judgments and estimates that we made in preparing our consolidated financial statements involved:
•revenue recognition;
•valuation of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in business combinations; and
revenue recognition description our revenue is derived principally from the licensing of computer software products and from related maintenance contracts. we enter into contracts that include combinations of products, maintenance and services, which are accounted for as separate performance obligations with differing revenue recognition patterns.
judgments and estimates our contracts with customers typically include promises to transfer licenses and services to a customer. judgment is required to determine if the promises are separate performance obligations, and if so, to allocate the transaction price to each performance obligation. we use the estimated standalone selling price method to allocate the transaction price for each performance obligation. the estimated standalone selling price is determined using all information reasonably available to us, including market conditions and other observable inputs. the corresponding revenues are recognized as the related performance obligations are satisfied.
our time-based subscription lease license contracts with customers are sold as a bundled arrangement that includes the rights to a term software license as well as post-contract support (pcs), which includes unspecified technical enhancements and customer support. revenue is recognized up front at the commencement of the lease for the term software lease license and recognized ratably over the term of the contract for the pcs in the arrangement. utilizing observable inputs, we determined that 50% of the estimated standalone selling price of the subscription lease license is attributable to the term software license, while 50% is attributable to pcs. this determination involved judgment, particularly as it relates to the value relationship between our pcs and subscription lease licenses, the value relationship between pcs and our perpetual licenses and its linkage to the shortened term of a subscription lease license, the average economic life of our software, renewal rates of our customers and the price of the bundled arrangement in relation to the perpetual licensing approach.
changes in these estimates could significantly impact the recognition of revenue in a given period.
valuation of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in business combinations description in accordance with business combination accounting, we allocate the purchase price of an acquired business to its identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date based upon their estimated fair values. the excess of the fair value of consideration transferred over the fair value of net identifiable assets acquired, if any, is recorded as goodwill. intangible assets are recognized apart from goodwill whenever an acquired intangible asset arises from contractual or other legal rights, or whenever it is capable of being separated or divided from the acquired entity and sold, transferred, licensed, rented or exchanged, either individually or in combination with a related contract, asset or liability.
judgments and estimates determining these fair values requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions, particularly with respect to acquired intangible assets. we determined the fair value of our intangible assets using various valuation techniques, including the relief-from-royalty method and the multi-period excess earnings method. these models utilize certain unobservable inputs classified as level 3 measurements as defined by asc 820, fair value measurements and disclosures. the determination of fair value requires considerable judgment and is sensitive to changes in underlying assumptions, estimates and market factors. estimating fair value requires us to make assumptions and estimates regarding our future plans, as well as industry and economic conditions. these assumptions and estimates include, but are not limited to: royalty rate, discount rate, customer attrition rate and obsolescence rate. the fair values of the intangible assets will be amortized over their useful lives.
if actual results are materially different than the assumptions we used to determine fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed through a business combination, it is possible that adjustments to the carrying values of such assets and liabilities will have a material impact on our financial position and results of operations. see note 4 to the consolidated financial statements included in part iv, item 15 of this annual report on form 10-k for information regarding our business acquisitions.
income taxes description our income tax expense reflects management's best estimate of current and future taxes to be paid. we account for income taxes under the asset and liability method, which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements. under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. the effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period of the enactment date.
additionally, as part of our accounting for income taxes, tax benefits related to uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken on a tax return are recorded when such benefits meet a more-likely-than-not threshold. otherwise, these tax benefits are recorded when a tax position has been effectively settled, which means that the statute of limitations has expired or the appropriate taxing authority has completed its examination even though the statute of limitations remains open.
judgments and estimates we are subject to tax in the united states and numerous foreign jurisdictions. significant judgements and estimates are required in the determination of consolidated income tax expense. we record net deferred tax assets to the extent we believe these assets will more likely than not be realized. in making such determination, we consider all available positive and negative evidence, including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, tax planning strategies and recent financial operations. the assumptions about future taxable income require the use of significant judgement and are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying business. in the event we determine that we will be able to realize deferred tax assets for which a valuation allowance was used to reduce their carrying value, the adjustment to the valuation allowance will be recorded as a reduction to the provision for income taxes in the period such determination is made.
the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws and regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions across our global operations. significant judgment is required in the identification and measurement of uncertain tax positions. our liability for unrecognized tax benefits contains uncertainties because we are required to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate the exposures associated with our various filing positions. we adjust the liabilities when our judgement changes as a result of new information not previously available.
although we believe that the judgments and estimates discussed herein are reasonable, actual results could differ and we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material. to the extent actual results differ from estimated amounts recorded, such differences will impact the income tax provision in the period in which the determination is made.

item 7.    management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations.
the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included elsewhere in this report. it also should be read in conjunction with the disclosure under "special note regarding forward-looking statements" in part i of this form 10-k.
table of contents outlook we effectively executed our operating plan in fiscal 2023 and as a result we have never been better positioned, both by our balance sheet and with our operating strategy, to address market conditions in 2024. higher interest rates during 2023 constrained homebuilding consumers' ability to purchase new homes, but consumers were employed and buyers that could purchase homes did so. there has been a very short supply of affordable homes and very strong demand for those affordable homes. that is partly because the market for existing homes has been quiet, as current homeowners are reluctant to lose the benefit of their low interest rate mortgages.
throughout 2023, our consistent operating strategy was
•reduce our land assets while growing our business,
•enhance our return on equity and our return on inventory by focusing on allocation of cash and other liquid assets.
as other homebuilders pulled back, we grew the pace at which we produced and sold homes, using pricing and incentives to keep our homes affordable, with reduced margins absorbing the cost of doing this. the strategic benefits of driving volume resulted in advantages that both were immediately valuable and will have durable benefits.
•by driving volume, particularly in a difficult interest rate environment, we:
◦increased our market position in many core markets as we moved forward when some others pulled back.
◦refined relationships with strategic land banks. the ability to use land banks to gain future access to land without having to own it is an invaluable tool in our current approach to land acquisition.
◦improved our sales, marketing and dynamic pricing machine into what has become an advanced digital engine that is helping us price offerings in various markets and generate sales at the rate necessary to match our sales pace to the pace at which we are producing homes.
•we enhanced our position as builder of choice for existing and new trade partners, as our strategy of maintaining volume made us a dependable and consistent source of work. our relationships with trade partners in local markets improved the efficiency of our operations, reduced the time it takes us to build homes and helped our inventory absorption.
•we positioned ourselves with land and new communities for strong volume in all of our operating markets. as we drove volume and delivered homes, we optioned new land and started additional communities for next year's deliveries. we continued to option land to replace communities, especially when others walked away. owners and developers of critical land assets saw us as a consistent market participant, even when market conditions became more tenuous. our variable land pricing tool enables home site values to move up or down as a percentage of the sale price of a home as markets move up and down.
while market conditions have been challenging, we have consistently found ways to address market needs. demand is strong and there is a chronic housing supply shortage that needs to be filled. we will continue to drive production to meet that housing shortage. and, if interest rates subside, we will be well prepared to meet the resulting release of pent up demand.
we have continued our land light strategy of seeking land purchase options and purchasing primarily finished homesites on which we are ready to start, or have already started, building homes. at the end of 2023, 76% of our homesites were controlled through options or other contracts, rather than owned. the years supply of homesites we owned improved during 2023 to end the year with a 1.4 years owned supply, compared with a 1.9 years owned supply in the prior year.
we delivered over 73,000 homes in 2023, which represents a 10% increase over 2022. our net earnings and diluted earnings per share were $3.9 billion, and $13.73 per share, respectively. we also delivered substantially increased homebuilding cash flow. we are well-positioned with land and community count to expect to deliver 80,000 homes in 2024, which would be a 10% increase over 2023.
we expect to begin fiscal 2024 with strong starts, sales and closings. we are expecting to deliver between 16,500 and 17,000 homes in the first quarter of 2024, with a margin of 21.00% to 21.25% as lower margin sales from the fourth quarter of 2023 when interest rates spiked get delivered. margins should increase as the year progresses. at the end of our 2023 year, we had 1,260 active communities. we expect our community count to increase during 2024 by mid-to-high single digits.
our balance sheet has never been stronger. we ended 2023 with $6.3 billion of homebuilding cash and no outstanding borrowings under our $2.6 billion revolving credit facility. we did this while spending $1.1 billion to redeem/repurchase homebuilding senior notes and an additional $1.1 billion to repurchase 10 million shares of our stock. at the end of 2023, our cash substantially exceeded our total homebuilding debt by $3.5 billion.
based on the strength of our balance sheet and our ability to thrive even under adverse market conditions, we are confident that in 2024, lennar will continue to grow and will achieve new levels of performance.
table of contents results of operations overview our net earnings attributable to lennar were $3.9 billion, or $13.73 per diluted and basic share in 2023 and $4.6 billion, or $15.72 per diluted share ($15.74 per basic share) in 2022.

(1)during the year ended november 30, 2022, other revenues in our multifamily segment included land sales to unconsolidated entities of $237.5 million.
revenues from home sales increased 2% in the year ended november 30, 2023 to $32.5 billion from $31.8 billion in the year ended november 30, 2022. revenues were higher primarily due to a 10% increase in the number of home deliveries, partially offset by a 7% decrease in the average sales price of homes delivered. new home deliveries increased to 73,087 homes in the year ended november 30, 2023 from 66,399 homes in the year ended november 30, 2022. the average sales price of homes delivered was $446,000 in the year ended november 30, 2023, compared to $480,000 in the year ended november 30, 2022. the decrease in average sales price of homes delivered in the year ended november 30, 2023 compared to the same period last year was primarily due to pricing to market through an increased use of incentives and product mix.
gross margins on home sales were $7.6 billion, or 23.3%, in the year ended november 30, 2023, compared to $8.8 billion, or 27.5%, in the year ended november 30, 2022. gross margins in the year ended november 30, 2023 decreased because of a decrease in average sales price, which was partially offset by a decrease in costs per square foot as we continued to focus on construction cost savings.
selling, general and administrative expenses were $2.2 billion in the year ended november 30, 2023, compared to $2.0 billion in the year ended november 30, 2022. as a percentage of revenues from home sales, selling, general and administrative expenses increased to 6.9% in the year ended november 30, 2023, from 6.2% in the year ended november 30, 2022, primarily due to an increase in the use of brokers due to current market conditions.
during the year ended november 30, 2023, our homebuilding operating earnings included $141.2 million of interest income due to an increase in cash balances and higher interest rates, which was partially offset by an impairment of $36.8 million of an investment in a joint venture.
operating earnings for our financial services segment were $507.1 million in the year ended november 30, 2023, compared to operating earnings of $381.9 million in the year ended november 30, 2022.the increase in operating earnings was primarily due to a higher profit per locked loan in our mortgage business as a result of higher margins, and higher lock volume because of an increase in capture rate and deliveries. there was also an increase in profitability from our title business due to higher volume and productivity as a result of continued implementation of technology initiatives. the operating earnings in the year ended november 30, 2022 included a $35.5 million one-time charge due to an increase in a litigation accrual in the third quarter of fiscal 2022 related to a court judgment. we have appealed this judgment since we believe there were clear errors of table of contents law made by the trial court. excluding this one-time charge, operating earnings in the year ended november 30, 2022 were $417.4 million.
operating loss for the multifamily segment was $50.6 million in the year ended november 30, 2023, compared to operating earnings of $69.5 million in the year ended november 30, 2022. operating loss for the lennar other segment was $211.2 million in the year ended november 30, 2023, compared to an operating loss of $735.6 million in the year ended november 30, 2022. lennar other operating loss for the year ended november 30, 2023 was primarily due to negative mark-to-market adjustments of $50.2 million on our publicly traded technology investments and a $65.0 million write-off of one of our non-public technology investments. the operating loss for the year ended november 30, 2022 was primarily due to negative mark-to-market adjustments of $655.1 million on our publicly traded technology investments.
for the years ended november 30, 2023 and 2022, we had a tax provision of $1.2 billion and $1.4 billion, which resulted in an overall effective income tax rate of 24.0% and 22.8%, respectively. our overall effective income tax rate was higher than last year, primarily due to the resolution of an uncertain state tax position and the retroactive reinstatement of the new energy efficient home credit, both during 2022.

(3)negative gross and net margins were due to period costs and/or impairments in urban divisions that impact costs of homes sold without sufficient sales of homes revenue to offset those costs.
summary of homebuilding data deliveries:
of the total homes delivered listed above, 340 homes with a dollar value of $156.2 million and an average sales price of $459,000 represent home deliveries from unconsolidated entities for the year ended november 30, 2023, compared to 174 home deliveries with a dollar value of $67.5 million and an average sales price of $388,000 for the year ended november 30, 2022.
average sales incentives per                                                                  sales incentives home delivered                                                                              as a % of revenues years ended november 30,
of the total new orders listed above, 321 homes with a dollar value of $152.9 million and an average sales price of $476,000 represent new orders from unconsolidated entities for the year ended november 30, 2023, compared to 261 new orders with a dollar value of $116.7 million and an average sales price of $447,000 for the year ended november 30, 2022.
(2)new orders represent the number of new sales contracts executed with homebuyers, net of cancellations, during the years ended november 30, 2023 and 2022.
table of contents we experienced cancellation rates in our homebuilding segments and homebuilding other as follows:
of the total homes in backlog listed above, 147 homes with a backlog dollar value of $74.5 million and an average sales price of $507,000 represent the backlog from unconsolidated entities at november 30, 2023, compared to 166 homes with a backlog dollar value of $77.8 million and an average sales price of $469,000 at november 30, 2022.
backlog represents the number of homes under sales contracts. homes are sold using sales contracts, which are generally accompanied by sales deposits. in some instances, purchasers are permitted to cancel sales if they fail to qualify for financing or under certain other circumstances. we do not recognize revenue on homes under sales contracts until the sales are closed and title passes to the new homeowners.
homebuilding east: revenues from home sales increased in 2023 compared to 2022, primarily due to an increase in the number of home deliveries in all the states in the segment except in new jersey. this was partially offset by a decrease in the average sales price of homes delivered in all the states in the segment except in new jersey and pennsylvania. the increase in the number of home deliveries in alabama, florida, pennsylvania and south carolina was primarily due to an increase in the number of active communities. the decrease in the number of home deliveries in new jersey was primarily due to a decrease in the number of deliveries per active community due to the timing of opening and closing of communities. the increase in the average sales price of homes delivered in new jersey and pennsylvania was primarily due to product mix. the decrease in the average sales price of homes delivered in alabama, florida and south carolina was primarily due to pricing to market and product mix. for the year ended november 30, 2023, an increase in revenues per square foot was partially offset by an increase in costs per square foot primarily due to higher material and labor costs. in addition, land costs increased year over year. thus gross margin percentage of home deliveries decreased year over year.
homebuilding central: revenues from home sales increased in 2023 compared to 2022, primarily due to an increase in the number of home deliveries in all the states in the segment except in georgia and virginia. this was partially offset by a decrease in the average sales price of homes delivered in all the states in the segment except in illinois, maryland and tennessee. the increase in the number of home deliveries in illinois, indiana, maryland, minnesota, tennessee and north carolina was primarily due to an increase in the number of deliveries per active community. the decrease in the number of home deliveries in other states in the segment was primarily due to a decrease in the number of deliveries per active community due to the timing of opening and closing of communities. the decrease in the average sales price of homes delivered in georgia, indiana, minnesota, north carolina and virginia was primarily due to pricing to market and product mix. the increase in the average sales price of homes delivered in illinois, maryland and tennessee was primarily due to product mix. for the year ended november 30, 2023, a decrease in revenues per square foot was partially offset by a decrease in costs per square foot. overall, gross margins remained flat year over year as land costs remained flat while interest expense decreased as a result of our focus on reducing debt.

multifamily segment we have been actively involved, primarily through unconsolidated entities, in the development, construction and property management of multifamily rental properties. our multifamily segment focuses on developing a geographically diversified portfolio of institutional quality multifamily rental properties in select u.s. markets.
originally, our multifamily segment focused on building multifamily properties and selling them shortly after they were completed. however, more recently we have focused on creating and participating in funds that build multifamily properties with the intention of retaining them after they are completed.
table of contents the following table provides information related to our investment in the multifamily segment:
number of operating properties/investments sold through joint ventures        -                                     2

the multifamily segment manages and has investments in multifamily venture fund i (the "lmv i") and multifamily venture fund ii lp (the "lmv ii"), which are long-term multifamily development investment vehicles involved in the development, construction and ownership of class-a multifamily rental properties. details of each as of and during the year ended november 30, 2023 are included below:
(in thousands)                                                                    lmv i                         lmv ii lennar's carrying value of investments                                     $193,829                       267,874
(1)while there are remaining commitments with lmv i, there are no plans for additional capital calls.
our multifamily segment had equity investments in unconsolidated entities. the breakout of the multifamily segment's equity investments in unconsolidated entities and the development activities by stage were as follows:
under construction/owned                             16
completed and operating                              58
total development costs                      $9,883,073
as of november 30, 2023, our multifamily segment also had a pipeline of potential future projects, which were under contract or had letters of intent, totaling approximately $6.2 billion in anticipated development costs across a number of states that will be developed primarily by unconsolidated entities.
table of contents lennar other segment our lennar other segment includes fund investments we retained subsequent to our sale of the rialto investment and asset management platform as well as strategic investments in technology companies that are looking to improve the homebuilding and financial services industries to better serve homebuyers and homeowners and increase efficiencies. as of november 30, 2023 and 2022, our balance sheet had $657.9 million and $788.5 million, respectively, of assets in the lennar other segment, which included investments in unconsolidated entities of $276.2 million and $316.5 million, respectively. we have investments in blend labs, inc. ("blend labs"), hippo holdings, inc. ("hippo"), opendoor technologies, inc. ("opendoor"), smartrent, inc. ("smartrent"), sonder holdings, inc. ("sonder") and sunnova energy international, inc. ("sunnova"), which are held at market and will therefore change depending on the fair value of our shareholdings in those entities on the last day of each quarter. all the investments are accounted for as investments in equity securities which are held at fair value and the changes in fair values are recognized through earnings. the following is a detail of lennar other unrealized losses from mark-to-market adjustments on our technology investments:
at november 30, 2023 and 2022, lennar other owned commercial mortgage-backed securities ("cmbs") with carrying values of $38.0 million and $35.5 million, respectively. these securities were purchased at discount rates ranging from 33% to 55% with coupon rates ranging from 3.0% to 3.4%, stated and assumed final distribution dates between september 2025 and march 2026, and stated maturity dates between september 2058 and march 2059. we review changes in estimated cash flows periodically to determine if an other-than-temporary impairment has occurred on our cmbs. based on management's assessment, no impairment charges were recorded during the years ended november 30, 2023 and 2022. we classify these securities as held-for-sale at november 30, 2023 and 2022.
financial condition and capital resources at november 30, 2023, we had cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash related to our homebuilding, financial services, multifamily and other operations of $6.6 billion, compared to $4.8 billion at november 30, 2022.
we finance all of our activities including homebuilding, financial services, multifamily, other and general operating needs primarily with cash generated from our operations, debt issuances and investor funds as well as cash borrowed under our warehouse lines of credit and our unsecured revolving credit facility (the "credit facility"). at november 30, 2023, we had $6.3 billion of homebuilding cash and cash equivalents and no outstanding borrowings under our $2.6 billion revolving credit facility, thereby approximately $8.9 billion of available capacity.
operating cash flow activities during 2023 and 2022, cash provided by operating activities totaled $5.2 billion and $3.3 billion, respectively. during 2023, cash provided by operating activities was positively impacted by our net earnings and $2.3 billion decrease in inventories due to our strategy of controlling more homesites and acquiring finished homesites, thus reducing the amount of spend related to inventory. this was partially offset by a decrease in accounts payable and other liabilities of $626 million, primarily due to the payment of income taxes, an increase in receivables of $329 million, an increase in deposits and pre-acquisition costs on real estate of $296 million as we increased the percentage of controlled homesites, and an increase in loans held-for-sale of $367 million primarily related to the sale of loans originated by our financial services segment.
during 2022, cash provided by operating activities was positively impacted by our net earnings, excluding lennar other unrealized mark-to-market losses on our publicly traded technology investments and other realized loss totaling $672 million and an increase in accounts payable and other liabilities of $701 million. this was partially offset by a $1.7 billion increase in inventories due to strategic land purchases, land development and construction costs, $672 million increase in deposits and pre-acquisition costs on real estate as we increased the percentage of controlled homesites, and an increase in receivables of $422 million.
investing cash flow activities during 2023 and 2022, cash used in investing activities totaled $177 million and $128 million, respectively. during 2023, our cash used in investing activities was primarily due to cash contributions of $201 million to unconsolidated entities, table of contents which primarily included (1) $94 million to homebuilding unconsolidated entities, (2) $81 million to lennar other unconsolidated entities, and (3) $27 million to multifamily unconsolidated entities. this was partially offset by distributions of capital from unconsolidated entities of $100 million, which primarily included (1) $70 million from homebuilding unconsolidated entities, and (2) $29 million from our lennar other unconsolidated entities.
during 2022, our cash used in investing activities was primarily due to cash contributions of $447 million to unconsolidated entities, which primarily included (1) $307 million to homebuilding unconsolidated entities, (2) $111 million to lennar other unconsolidated entities, and (3) $30 million to multifamily unconsolidated entities. in addition, we had $94 million of purchases of investment securities related to strategic technology investments in the lennar other segment. this was partially offset by distributions of capital from unconsolidated entities of $398 million, which primarily included (1) $79 million from homebuilding unconsolidated entities, (2) $252 million from multifamily unconsolidated entities, and (3) $67 million from our lennar other unconsolidated entities.
financing cash flow activities during 2023 and 2022, our cash used in financing activities totaled $3.2 billion and $1.3 billion, respectively. during 2023, our cash used in financing activities was primarily due to the (1) redemption of $378 million aggregate principal amount of our 4.875% senior notes due december 2023, (2) redemption of $425 million aggregate principal amount of our 5.875% senior notes due november 2024, (3) $296 million combined of partial repurchase of our 4.500% senior notes due 2024 and 4.75% senior notes due 2027, (4) $105 million principal payments on notes payable and other borrowings, (5) repurchase of our common stock for $1.2 billion, which included $1.1 billion of repurchases of our stock under our repurchase program and $73 million of repurchases related to our equity compensation plan, (6) $431 million of dividend payments, and (7) $381 million of net payments from liabilities related to consolidated inventory not owned due to land sales to land banks, net of takedowns. these were partially offset by (1) $29 million of net borrowings under our financial services warehouse facilities, and (2) receipts related to noncontrolling interests of $21 million.
during 2022, our cash used in financing activities was primarily due to (1) early redemption of $575 million aggregate principal amount of our 4.75% senior notes due november 2022, (2) $48 million principal payment on notes payable and other borrowings, (3) repurchase of our common stock for $1.0 billion, which included $968 million of repurchase of our stock under our repurchase program and $72 million of repurchases related to our equity compensation plan, and (4) $438 million of dividend payments. these were partially offset by (1) $485 million of net proceeds from liabilities related to consolidated inventory not owned due to land sales to land banks, net of takedowns, (2) $409 million of net borrowings under our financial services warehouse facilities, and (3) receipts related to noncontrolling interests of $42 million.
debt to total capital ratios are financial measures commonly used in the homebuilding industry and are presented to assist in understanding the leverage of our homebuilding operations. homebuilding debt to total capital and net homebuilding debt to total capital were calculated as follows:
total capital                                          $29,397,146                       28,147,794
homebuilding debt to total capital                                 9.6%                            14.4%
net homebuilding debt to total capital (1)                      (15.0)%                           (2.4)%
(1)net homebuilding debt to total capital is a non-gaap financial measure defined as net homebuilding debt (homebuilding debt less homebuilding cash and cash equivalents) divided by total capital (net homebuilding debt plus stockholders' equity). our management believes the ratio of net homebuilding debt to total capital is a relevant and a useful financial measure to investors in understanding the leverage employed in our homebuilding operations. however, because net homebuilding debt to total capital is not calculated in accordance with gaap, this financial measure should not be considered in isolation or as an alternative to financial measures prescribed by gaap. rather, this non-gaap financial measure should be used to supplement our gaap results.
at november 30, 2023, homebuilding debt to total capital was lower compared to november 30, 2022, primarily as a result of an increase in stockholders' equity due to net earnings and a decrease in homebuilding debt due to debt paydowns and debt repurchases, partially offset by share repurchases.
we are continually exploring various types of transactions to manage our leverage and liquidity positions, take advantage of market opportunities and increase our revenues and earnings. these transactions may include the issuance of table of contents additional indebtedness, the repurchase of our outstanding indebtedness, the repurchase of our common stock, the acquisition of homebuilders and other companies, the purchase or sale of assets or lines of business, the issuance of common stock or securities convertible into shares of common stock, and/or the pursuit of other financing alternatives. in connection with some of our non-homebuilding businesses, we are also considering other types of transactions such as sales, restructurings, joint ventures, spin-offs or initial public offerings as we continue to move back towards being a pure play homebuilding company. we have announced an intention to spin off, subject to market conditions, our multifamily and single-family rental asset management businesses and some of our investment assets.
we planned to spin off our multifamily and single family home for rent asset management businesses, together with some investment assets, by transferring them to a newly formed subsidiary, quarterra group, inc ("quarterra"), and distributing the stock of that subsidiary to our stockholders. that would have made us more of a pure play homebuilding company. at this time, we have deferred this transaction due to market conditions.
our homebuilding senior notes and other debts payable are summarized within note 4 of the notes to consolidated financial statements.
total maximum borrowings capacity               $3,000,000
the proceeds available under the credit facility, which are subject to specified conditions for borrowing, may be used for working capital and general corporate purposes. the credit agreement also provides that up to $500 million in commitments may be used for letters of credit. as of both november 30, 2023 and 2022, we had no outstanding borrowings under the credit facility. in addition to the credit facility, we have other letter of credit facilities with different financial institutions.
we often post letters of credit instead of making cash deposits for option contracts and for similar purposes. we often are required to post surety bonds to guarantee completion of projects, particularly when municipal authorities are involved. our outstanding letters of credit and surety bonds are described below:
performance letters of credit                                                                         $1,404,541                     1,259,033

anticipated future costs primarily for site improvements related to performance surety bonds           2,499,680                     2,273,694
our homebuilding average debt outstanding and the average rates of interest were as follows:
under the credit facility agreement (the "credit agreement"), we are required to maintain a minimum consolidated tangible net worth, a maximum leverage ratio and either a liquidity or an interest coverage ratio. these ratios are calculated per the credit facility agreement, which involves adjustments to gaap financial measures. as of the end of each fiscal quarter, we are required to maintain minimum consolidated tangible net worth of approximately $10.6 billion plus 50% of the cumulative consolidated net income for each completed fiscal quarter subsequent to february 28, 2022, if positive, plus 50% of the net cash proceeds from any equity offerings from and after february 28, 2022, minus the amount paid after february 28, 2022 to repurchase common stock (subject to a limit on deductions in any four fiscal quarter period of 12.5% of consolidated tangible net worth) and minus, in the case of a spin-off transaction, the consolidated net worth of assets that are spun off (subject to a limit of $1.0 billion). as of the end of each fiscal quarter, we are required to maintain a leverage ratio that shall not exceed 65% and may be reduced by 2.5% per quarter if our interest coverage ratio is less than 2.25:1.00 for two consecutive fiscal calendar quarters. the leverage ratio will have a floor of 60%. if our interest coverage ratio subsequently exceeds 2.25:1.00 for two consecutive fiscal calendar quarters, the leverage ratio we will be required to maintain will be increased by 2.5% per quarter to a maximum of 65%. as of the end of each fiscal quarter, we are also required to maintain either (1) liquidity in an amount equal table of contents to or greater than 1.00x consolidated interest incurred for the last twelve months then ended or (2) an interest coverage ratio equal to or greater than 1.50:1.00 for the last twelve months then ended. we believe that we were in compliance with our debt covenants at november 30, 2023.
the following summarizes our required debt covenants and our actual levels or ratios with respect to those covenants as calculated per the credit agreement as of november 30, 2023:
(dollars in thousands)              covenant level                   level achieved as of november 30, 2023
(1)we are only required to maintain either (1) liquidity in an amount equal to or greater than 1.00x consolidated interest incurred for the last twelve months then ended or (2) an interest coverage ratio of equal to or greater than 1.50:1.00 for the last twelve months then ended. although we are in compliance with our debt covenants for both calculations, we have only disclosed our liquidity test.
at november 30, 2023, the financial services segment had warehouse facilities, all of which were 364-day repurchase facilities and were used to fund residential mortgages or commercial mortgages for lmf commercial as follows:
(1)subsequent to november 30, 2023, the maturity date of december 2023 was extended to march 2024 and the maturity date of november 2023 was extended to january 2024.
(3)consists of two commercial facilities each with maximum aggregate commitment amounts of $200 million. subsequent to november 30, 2023, one of the facility's maturity date was extended to december 2024.
the financial services segment uses residential mortgage loan warehouse facilities to finance its residential lending activities until the mortgage loans are sold to investors and the proceeds are collected. the facilities are non-recourse to us and are expected to be renewed or replaced with other facilities when they mature. the lmf commercial facilities finance lmf commercial loan originations and securitization activities and were secured by up to 80% interests in the originated commercial loans financed.
borrowings and collateral under the facilities were as follows:
borrowings under the residential facilities              $2,020,187                         1,877,411
collateral under the residential facilities               2,097,020                         1,950,155
borrowings under the lmf commercial facilities               12,525                           124,399
if the facilities are not renewed or replaced, the borrowings under the lines of credit will be repaid by selling the mortgage loans held-for-sale to investors and by collecting receivables on loans sold but not yet paid for. without the facilities, the financial services segment would have to use cash from operations and other funding sources to finance its lending activities.
table of contents changes in capital structure in march 2022, our board of directors approved an authorization for us to repurchase up to the lesser of $2.0 billion in value, or 30 million in shares, of our outstanding class a or class b common stock. the repurchase authorization has no expiration date. this authorization was in addition to what was remaining of our october 2021 stock repurchase program. subsequent to november 30, 2023, our board of directors authorized an increase to our stock repurchase program to enable us to repurchase up to an additional $5 billion in value of our outstanding class a or class b common stock. repurchases are authorized to be made in open-market or private transactions. the repurchase authorization has no expiration date.
the following table provides information about our repurchases of class a and class b common stock:
during the year ended november 30, 2023, treasury stock increased by 11.3 million shares primarily due to our repurchase of 10.0 million shares of class a and class b common stock through our stock repurchase program. during the year ended november 30, 2022, treasury stock decreased due to our retirement of 46.7 million and 2.8 million treasury shares of class a and class b common stock, respectively, as authorized by our board of directors. the retirement of class a and class b common stock in treasury resulted in a reclass between treasury shares and additional paid-in capital within stockholders' equity. during the year ended november 30, 2022, this decrease in treasury shares was partially offset by our repurchase of 9.6 million and 1.3 million shares of class a and class b common stock, respectively, through our stock repurchase program.
during both the years ended november 30, 2023 and 2022, our class a and class b common stockholders received an aggregate per share annual dividend of $1.50. on january 9, 2024, our board of directors increased our annual dividend to $2.00 per share from $1.50 per share, resulting in a quarterly cash dividend of $0.50 per share on both our class a and class b common stock. the dividend is payable on february 7, 2024 to holders of record at the close of business on january 24, 2024.
based on our current financial condition and credit relationships, we believe that our operations and borrowing resources will provide for our current and long-term capital requirements at our anticipated levels of activity.
supplemental financial information currently, certain of our 100% owned subsidiaries, which are primarily our homebuilding subsidiaries, are guaranteeing all our senior notes. the guarantees are full and unconditional.
the indentures governing our senior notes require that, if any of our 100% owned subsidiaries, other than our finance company subsidiaries and foreign subsidiaries, directly or indirectly guarantee at least $75 million principal amount of debt of lennar corporation (other than senior notes), those subsidiaries must also guarantee lennar corporation's obligations with regard to its senior notes. included in the following tables as part of "obligors" together with lennar corporation are subsidiary entities that are not finance company subsidiaries or foreign subsidiaries and were guaranteeing the senior notes because at november 30, 2023 they were guaranteeing lennar corporation's letter of credit facilities and its credit facility, disclosed in note 4 of the notes to consolidated financial statements. the guarantees are full, unconditional and joint and several and the guarantor subsidiaries are 100% directly or indirectly owned by lennar corporation. a subsidiary's guarantee of lennar senior notes will be suspended at any time when it is not directly or indirectly guaranteeing at least $75 million principal amount of debt of lennar corporation (other than senior notes), and a subsidiary will be released from its guarantee and any other obligations it may have regarding the senior notes if all or substantially all its assets, or all of its capital stock, are sold or otherwise disposed. if the proposed spin-off of our multifamily and single-family rental asset management businesses or any other of our businesses takes place, the subsidiaries involved in those businesses will no longer guarantee our senior notes.
supplemental information for the obligors, which excludes non-guarantor subsidiaries and intercompany transactions, at november 30, 2023 is included in the following tables. intercompany balances and transactions within the obligors have been eliminated and amounts attributable to the obligor's investment in consolidated subsidiaries that have not issued or guaranteed the senior notes have been excluded. amounts due from and transactions with non-guarantor subsidiaries and related parties are separately disclosed:

off-balance sheet arrangements homebuilding - investments in unconsolidated entities we regularly monitor the results of our homebuilding, multifamily, and lennar other unconsolidated joint ventures and any trends that may affect their future liquidity or results of operations. we also monitor the performance of homebuilding joint ventures in which we have investments on a regular basis to assess compliance with debt covenants. for those joint ventures not in compliance with their debt covenants, we evaluate and assess possible impairment of our investments. we believe that substantially all of the joint ventures were in compliance with their debt covenants at november 30, 2023, except for one joint venture that had an other-than-temporary impairment which is included in note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements.
at november 30, 2023, we had equity investments in 48 active homebuilding and land unconsolidated entities (of which 5 had recourse debt, 15 had non-recourse debt and 28 had no debt), compared to 48 active homebuilding and land unconsolidated entities at november 30, 2022. historically, we have invested in unconsolidated entities that acquired and developed land (1) for our homebuilding operations or for sale to third parties or (2) for the construction of homes for sale to third-party homebuyers. through these entities, we have primarily sought to reduce and share our risk by limiting the amount of our capital invested in land, while obtaining access to potential future homesites and allowing us to participate in strategic ventures. the use of these entities also, in some instances, has enabled us to acquire land to which we could not otherwise obtain access, or could not obtain access on as favorable terms, without the participation of a strategic partner. participants in these joint ventures have been land owners/developers, other homebuilders and financial or strategic partners. joint ventures with land owners/developers have given us access to homesites owned or controlled by our partners. joint ventures with other homebuilders have provided us with the ability to bid jointly with our partners for large land parcels. joint ventures with financial partners have allowed us to combine our homebuilding expertise with access to our partners' capital. joint ventures with strategic partners have allowed us to combine our homebuilding expertise with the specific expertise (e.g. commercial or infill experience) of our partner. each joint venture is governed by an executive committee consisting of members from the partners. details regarding these investments, balances and debt are included in note 3 of the notes to consolidated financial statements.
the following table summarizes the principal maturities of our homebuilding unconsolidated entities ("jvs") debt as per current debt arrangements as of november 30, 2023. it does not represent estimates of future cash payments that will be made to reduce debt balances. many jv loans have extension options in the loan agreements that would allow the loans to be extended into future years.

multifamily - investments in unconsolidated entities at november 30, 2023, multifamily had equity investments in 22 active unconsolidated entities that are engaged in multifamily residential developments (of which 20 had non-recourse debt and 2 had no debt), and 23 active unconsolidated table of contents entities at november 30, 2022. we invest in unconsolidated entities that acquire and develop land to construct multifamily rental properties. through these entities, we are focusing on developing a geographically diversified portfolio of institutional quality multifamily rental properties in select u.s. markets. participants in these joint ventures have been financial partners. joint ventures with financial partners have allowed us to combine our development and construction expertise with access to our partners' capital. each joint venture is governed by an operating agreement that provides significant substantive participating voting rights on major decisions to our partners.
the multifamily segment manages and has investments in lmv i, lmv ii and canada pension plan investments fund, which are long-term multifamily development investment vehicles involved in the development, construction and ownership of class-a multifamily rental properties. details of each as of and during the year ended november 30, 2023 are included in note 3 of the notes to consolidated financial statements.
we regularly monitor the results of our multifamily unconsolidated joint ventures and any trends that may affect their future liquidity or results of operations. we also monitor the performance of multifamily joint ventures in which we have investments on a regular basis to assess compliance with debt covenants. for those joint ventures not in compliance with the debt covenants, we evaluate and assess possible impairment of our investment. we believe all of the joint ventures were in compliance with their debt covenants at november 30, 2023.
the following table summarizes the principal maturities of our multifamily unconsolidated entities debt as per current debt arrangements as of november 30, 2023. it does not represent estimates of future cash payments that will be made to reduce debt balances.

lennar other - investments in unconsolidated entities as part of the sale of the rialto investment and asset management platform, we retained the right to receive a portion of payments with regard to carried interests if certain funds meet specified performance thresholds. we periodically receive advance distributions related to the carried interests in order to cover income tax obligations resulting from allocations of taxable income to the carried interests. these distributions are not subject to clawbacks but reduce future carried interest payments to which we become entitled from the applicable funds and were recorded as equity in earnings (loss) in the consolidated statement of operations. our investment in the rialto funds totaled $148.7 million and $185.1 million as of november 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively.
as of november 30, 2023 and 2022, we had strategic technology investments in unconsolidated entities of $127.5 million and $131.5 million respectively, accounted for under the equity method of accounting.
option contracts we often obtain access to land through option contracts, which generally enable us to control portions of properties owned by third parties (including land banks) and unconsolidated entities until we have determined whether to exercise the options. since fiscal year 2020, we have been increasing the percentage of our total homesites that we control through options rather than own.
as part of our focus on strategic relationships to further enhance our land lighter strategy, at the end of fiscal year 2020 we entered into an arrangement with various land bank investor groups. under the arrangement, in most instances when we want to acquire a property for use in our for-sale single-family home business, we will offer the investor group the opportunity to acquire the property and give us an option to purchase all or a portion of it back in the future, if it is mutually beneficial to both parties. to the extent the investor group does not elect to purchase properties we identify, we can utilize our other investor relationships to have other investor groups purchase the land or we can purchase it directly. the arrangement with the investor group, together with existing and other strategic partnerships we are discussing, are significant steps in our strategy to migrate to a higher percentage of our homesites which we control but do not own, which we expect will result in greater cash flow and higher returns on assets and equity.
table of contents the table below indicates the number of homesites to which we had access through option contracts with third parties or unconsolidated jvs (i.e., controlled homesites) and homesites owned at november 30, 2023 and 2022:

(1)the amounts presented in the table above exclude debt issuance costs and any discounts/premiums and purchase accounting adjustments.
(2)interest commitments on variable interest-bearing debt are determined based on the interest rate as of november 30, 2023.
(3)amounts include $12.8 million of remaining equity investment commitments to lmv ii, for future expenditures related to the construction and development of the projects and $69.8 million of remaining equity investment commitment to the upward america venture.
we are subject to the usual obligations associated with entering into contracts (including option contracts) for the purchase, development and sale of real estate in the routine conduct of our business. option contracts for the purchase of land generally reduce our financial risk and costs of capital associated with land holdings. at november 30, 2023, we had access to 309,700 homesites through option contracts with third parties and unconsolidated entities in which we have investments. at november 30, 2023, we had $1.9 billion of non-refundable option deposits and pre-acquisition costs related to certain of these homesites and had posted $198.9 million of letters of credit in lieu of cash deposits under certain land and option contracts.
at november 30, 2023, we had letters of credit outstanding in the amount of $1.8 billion (which included the $198.9 million of letters of credit discussed above). details on our letters of credit outstanding and outstanding surety bonds are included in note 4 of the notes to consolidated financial statements.
our financial services segment had a pipeline of loan applications in process of $3.3 billion at november 30, 2023. loans in process for which interest rates were committed to the borrowers totaled approximately $2.1 billion as of table of contents november 30, 2023. a significant portion of these commitments had a remaining period of 60 days or less. since a portion of these commitments is expected to expire without being exercised by the borrowers or borrowers may not meet certain criteria at the time of closing, the total commitments do not necessarily represent future cash requirements.
our financial services segment uses mandatory mortgage-backed securities ("mbs") forward commitments, option contracts, futures contracts and investor commitments to hedge our mortgage-related interest rate exposure. these instruments involve, to varying degrees, elements of credit and interest rate risk. credit risk associated with mbs forward commitments, option contracts, futures contracts and loan sales transactions is managed by limiting our counterparties to investment banks, federally regulated bank affiliates and other investors meeting our credit standards. our risk, in the event of default by the purchaser, is the difference between the contract price and fair value of the mbs forward commitments and the option contracts. at november 30, 2023, we had open commitments amounting to $3.2 billion to sell mbs with varying settlement dates through february 2024 and open future contracts in the amount of $5.9 million with the settlement dates through march 2024.
the following sections discuss market and financing risk, seasonality and interest rates and changing prices that may have an impact on our business:
market and financing risk we finance our contributions to jvs, land acquisition and development activities, construction activities, financial services activities, multifamily activities and general operating needs primarily with cash generated from operations and debt, as well as borrowings under our credit facility and warehouse repurchase facilities. we also purchase land under option agreements, which enables us to control homesites until we have determined whether to exercise the options. we try to manage the financial risks of adverse market conditions associated with land holdings by what we believe to be prudent underwriting of land purchases in areas we view as desirable growth markets, careful management of the land development process and limitation of risks by using partners to share the costs of purchasing and developing land as well as obtaining access to land through option contracts. although we believe our land underwriting standards are conservative, we do not anticipate a severe decline in land values and the sharply reduced demand for new homes in the near future.
seasonality we historically have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, variability in quarterly results. our homebuilding business is seasonal in nature and generally reflects higher levels of new home order activity in our second and third fiscal quarters and increased deliveries in the second half of our fiscal year. however, a variety of factors can alter seasonal patterns.
interest rates and changing prices inflation can have a long-term impact on us because increasing costs of land, materials and labor result in a need to increase the sales prices of homes. in addition, inflation is often accompanied by higher interest rates, which can have a negative impact on housing demand and increase the costs of financing land development activities and housing construction. rising interest rates as well as increased material and labor costs, may reduce gross margins. an increase in materials and labor costs would be particularly a problem during a period of declining home prices. conversely, deflation can impact the value of real estate and make it difficult for us to recover our land costs. therefore, either inflation or deflation could adversely impact our future results of operations.
new accounting pronouncements see note 1 of the notes to our consolidated financial statements for a comprehensive list of new accounting pronouncements.
critical accounting policies and estimates our accounting policies are more fully described in note 1 of the notes to our consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this document. as discussed in note 1, the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. future events and their effects cannot be determined with absolute certainty. therefore, the determination of estimates requires the exercise of judgment. actual results could differ from those estimates, and such differences may be material to our consolidated financial statements. listed below are those policies and estimates that we believe are critical and require the use of significant judgment in their application.
goodwill we recorded a significant amount of goodwill in connection with the 2018 acquisition of calatlantic. we record goodwill associated with acquisitions of businesses when the purchase price of the business exceeds the fair value of the net table of contents tangible and identifiable assets acquired. in accordance with asc topic 350, intangibles-goodwill and other ("asc 350"), we evaluate goodwill for potential impairment on at least an annual basis. we have the option to perform a qualitative or quantitative assessment to determine whether the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value. qualitative factors may include, but are not limited to, economic conditions, industry and market considerations, cost factors, overall financial performance of the reporting units and other entity and reporting unit specific events. we believe that the accounting estimate for goodwill is a critical accounting estimate because of the judgment required in assessing the fair value of each of our reporting units. we estimate fair value through various valuation methods, including the use of discounted expected future cash flows of each reporting unit. the expected future cash flows for each segment are significantly impacted by current market conditions. if these market conditions and resulting expected future cash flows for each reporting unit decline significantly, the actual results for each segment could differ from our estimate, which would cause goodwill to be impaired. our accounting for goodwill represents our best estimate of future events.
homebuilding revenue recognition homebuilding revenues and related profits from sales of homes are recognized at the time of the closing of a sale, when title to and possession of the property are transferred to the homebuyer. in order to promote sales of the homes, we may offer sales incentives to homebuyers. the types of incentives vary on a community-by-community basis and home-by-home basis. they include primarily price discounts on individual homes and financing incentives, all of which are reflected as a reduction of home sales revenues. our performance obligation, to deliver the agreed-upon home, is generally satisfied in less than one year from the original contract date. cash proceeds from home closings held in escrow for our benefit, typically for approximately three days, are included in homebuilding cash and cash equivalents in the consolidated balance sheets and disclosed in the notes to consolidated balance sheets. contract liabilities include customer deposit liabilities related to sold but undelivered homes that are included in other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets. we periodically elect to sell parcels of land to third parties. cash consideration from land sales is typically due on the closing date, which is generally when performance obligations are satisfied, and revenue is recognized as title to and possession of the property are transferred to the buyer.
multifamily revenue recognition our multifamily segment provides management services with respect to the development, construction and property management of rental projects in joint ventures in which we have investments. as a result, our multifamily segment earns and receives fees, which are generally based upon a stated percentage of development and construction costs and a percentage of gross rental collections. these fees are recorded over the period in which the services are performed using an input method, which properly depicts the level of effort required to complete the management services. in addition, our multifamily segment provides general contractor services for the construction of some of its rental projects and recognizes the revenue over the period in which the services are performed using an input method, which properly depicts the level of effort required to complete the construction services. these customer contracts require us to provide management and general contractor services which represents a performance obligation that we satisfy over time. management fees and general contractor services in the multifamily segment are included in multifamily revenue. when the multifamily segment acts as general contractor, it treats the entire construction cost as revenue and treats payments to subcontractors as expenses.
inventories inventories are stated at cost unless the inventory within a community is determined to be impaired, in which case the impaired inventory is written down to fair value. inventory costs include land, land development and home construction costs, real estate taxes and interest related to development and construction. we review our inventory for indicators of impairment by evaluating each community during each reporting period. if the undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by a community are less than its carrying amount, an impairment charge is recorded to write down the carrying amount of such community to its estimated fair value.
in conducting our review for indicators of impairment on a community level, we evaluate, among other things, the margins on homes that have been delivered, margins on homes under sales contracts in backlog, projected margins with regard to future home sales over the life of the community, projected margins with regard to future land sales, and the estimated fair value of the land itself.
we estimate the fair value of our communities using a discounted cash flow model. the projected cash flows for each community are significantly impacted by estimates related to market supply and demand, product type by community, homesite sizes, sales pace, sales prices, sales incentives, construction costs, sales and marketing expenses, the local economy, competitive conditions, labor costs, costs of materials and other factors for that particular community. we evaluate the historical performance of each of our communities as well as current trends in the market and economy impacting the community and its surrounding areas. these trends are analyzed for each of the estimates listed above.
table of contents since the estimates and assumptions included in our cash flow models are based upon historical results and projected trends, they do not anticipate unexpected changes in market conditions or strategies that may lead to us incurring additional impairment charges in the future.
using all the available information, we calculate our best estimate of projected cash flows for each community. while many of the estimates are calculated based on historical and projected trends, all estimates are subjective and change from market to market and community to community as market and economic conditions change. the determination of fair value also requires discounting the estimated cash flows at a rate we believe a market participant would determine to be commensurate with the inherent risks associated with the assets and related estimated cash flow streams. the discount rate used in determining each asset's fair value depends on the community's projected life and development stage.
we estimate the fair value of inventory evaluated for impairment based on market conditions and assumptions made by management at the time the inventory is evaluated, which may differ materially from actual results if market conditions or our assumptions change.
we believe that the accounting related to inventory valuation and impairment is a critical accounting policy because: (1) assumptions inherent in the valuation of our inventory are highly subjective and susceptible to change and (2) the impact of recognizing impairments on our inventory could be material to our consolidated financial statements.
product warranty although we subcontract virtually all aspects of construction to others and our contracts call for the subcontractors to repair or replace any deficient items related to their trades, we are primarily responsible to homebuyers to correct any deficiencies. additionally, in some instances, we may be held responsible for the actions of or losses incurred by subcontractors. warranty and similar reserves for homes are established at an amount estimated to be adequate to cover potential costs for materials and labor with regard to warranty-type claims expected to be incurred subsequent to the delivery of a home. reserves are determined based upon historical data and trends with respect to similar product types and geographical areas. we believe the accounting estimate related to the reserve for warranty costs is a critical accounting estimate because the estimate requires a large degree of judgment. while we believe that the reserve for warranty costs is adequate, there can be no assurances that historical data and trends will accurately predict our actual warranty costs. additionally, there can be no assurances that future economic or financial developments might not lead to a significant change in the reserve.
investments in unconsolidated entities we strategically invest in unconsolidated entities that acquire and develop land (1) for our homebuilding operations or for sale to third parties, (2) for construction of homes for sale to third-party homebuyers or (3) for the construction and sale of multifamily rental properties. our homebuilding partners generally are unrelated homebuilders, land owners/developers and financial or other strategic partners. additionally, in recent years, we have invested in technology companies that are looking to improve the homebuilding and financial services industry in order to better serve homebuyers and homeowners and increase efficiencies. our multifamily partners are all financial partners.
most of the unconsolidated entities through which we acquire and develop land are accounted for by the equity method of accounting because we are not the primary beneficiary or a de-facto agent, and we have a significant, but less than controlling, interest in the entities. we record our investments in these entities in our consolidated balance sheets as investments in unconsolidated entities and our pro-rata share of the entities' earnings or losses in our consolidated statements of operations as equity in earnings (loss) from unconsolidated entities within each of the respective segments. for most unconsolidated entities, we generally have the right to share in earnings and distributions on a pro-rata basis based upon ownership percentages. however, certain homebuilding unconsolidated entities and all of our multifamily unconsolidated entities provide for a different allocation of profit and cash distributions if and when cumulative results of the joint venture exceed specified targets (such as a specified internal rate of return). advances to these entities are included in the investment balance.
management looks at specific criteria and uses its judgment when determining if we are the primary beneficiary of, or have a controlling interest in, an unconsolidated entity. factors considered in determining whether we have significant influence, or we have control include risk and reward sharing, experience and financial condition of the other partners, voting rights, involvement in day-to-day capital and operating decisions and continuing involvement. the accounting policy relating to the use of the equity method of accounting is a critical accounting policy due to the judgment required in determining whether the entity is a vie or a voting interest entity and then whether we are the primary beneficiary or have control or significant influence. we believe that the equity method of accounting is appropriate for our investments in unconsolidated entities where we are not the primary beneficiary and we do not have a controlling interest, but rather share control with our partners.
we evaluate the long-lived assets in unconsolidated entities for indicators of impairment during each reporting period. a series of operating losses of an investee or other factors may indicate that a decrease in the fair value of our investment in the unconsolidated entity below its carrying amount has occurred which is other-than-temporary. the amount of impairment recognized is the excess of the investment's carrying amount over its estimated fair value.
table of contents the evaluation of our investment in unconsolidated entities for other-than-temporary impairment includes certain critical assumptions: (1) projected future distributions from the unconsolidated entities, (2) discount rates applied to the future distributions, (3) the length of the time and the extent to which the market value has been less than cost, and (4) various other factors. our assumptions on the projected future distributions from unconsolidated entities are dependent on market conditions.
we believe our assumptions on discount rates are critical accounting policies because the selection of the discount rates affects the estimated fair value of our investments in unconsolidated entities. a higher discount rate reduces the estimated fair value of our investments in unconsolidated entities, while a lower discount rate increases the estimated fair value of our investments in unconsolidated entities. because of changes in economic conditions, actual results could differ materially from management's assumptions and may require material valuation adjustments to our investments in unconsolidated entities to be recorded in the future.
consolidation of variable interest entities gaap requires the assessment of whether an entity is a vie and, if so, if we are the primary beneficiary at the inception of the entity or at a reconsideration event. additionally, gaap requires the consolidation of vies in which we have a controlling financial interest. a controlling financial interest will have both of the following characteristics: (a) the power to direct the activities of a vie that most significantly impact the vie's economic performance and (b) the obligation to absorb losses of the vie that could potentially be significant to the vie or the right to receive benefits from the vie that could potentially be significant to the vie.
our variable interest in vies may be in the form of (1) equity ownership, (2) contracts to purchase assets, (3) management services and development agreements between us and a vie, (4) loans provided by us to a vie or other partner and/or (5) guarantees provided by members to banks and other third parties. we examine specific criteria and use our judgment when determining if we are the primary beneficiary of a vie. factors considered in determining whether we are the primary beneficiary include risk and reward sharing, experience and financial condition of other partner(s), voting rights, involvement in day-to-day capital and operating decisions, representation on a vie's executive committee, existence of unilateral kick-out rights or voting rights, level of economic disproportionality between us and the other partner(s) and contracts to purchase assets from vies.
generally, all major decision making in our joint ventures is shared among all partners. in particular, business plans and budgets are generally required to be unanimously approved by all partners. usually, management and other fees earned by us are nominal and believed to be at market and there is no significant economic disproportionality between us and other partners. generally, we purchase less than a majority of the jv's assets and the purchase prices under our option contracts are believed to be at market.
generally, our unconsolidated entities become vies and consolidate if the other partner(s) lack the intent and financial wherewithal to remain in the entity. as a result, we continue to fund operations and debt paydowns through partner loans or substituted capital contributions. the accounting policy relating to variable interest entities is a critical accounting policy because the determination of whether an entity is a vie and, if so, whether we are primary beneficiary may require us to exercise significant judgment.

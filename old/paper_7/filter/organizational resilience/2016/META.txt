item 7.   management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included in part ii, item 8, "financial statements and supplementary data" of this annual report on form 10-k. in addition to our historical consolidated financial information, the following discussion contains forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates, and beliefs. our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements. factors that could cause or contribute to these differences include those discussed below and elsewhere in this annual report on form 10-k, particularly in part i, item 1a, "risk factors." for a discussion of limitations in the measurement of certain of our user metrics, see the section entitled "limitations of key metrics and other data" in this annual report on form 10-k.
certain revenue information in the section entitled "-revenue-foreign exchange impact on revenue" is presented on a constant currency basis. this information is a non-gaap financial measure. to calculate revenue on a constant currency basis, we translated revenue for the full year 2016 using 2015 monthly exchange rates for our settlement currencies other than the u.s. dollar. this non-gaap financial measure is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, financial information prepared and presented in accordance with gaap. this measure may be different from non-gaap financial measures used by other companies, limiting its usefulness for comparison purposes. moreover, presentation of revenue on a constant currency basis is provided for year-over-year comparison purposes, and investors should be cautioned that the effect of changing foreign currency exchange rates has an actual effect on our operating results. we believe this non-gaap financial measure provides investors with useful supplemental information about the financial performance of our business, enable comparison of financial results between periods where certain items may vary independent of business performance, and allows for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in operating our business.
executive overview of full year 2016 results our key user metrics and financial results for 2016 are as follows:
user growth:
•   daily active users (daus) were 1.23 billion on average for december 2016, an increase of 18% year-over-year.
•   monthly active users (maus) were 1.86 billion as of december 31, 2016, an increase of 17% year-over-year.
financial results:
•   net income was $10.22 billion* with diluted earnings per share of $3.49*.
•   capital expenditures were $4.49 billion.
•   cash and cash equivalents, and marketable securities were $29.45 billion as of december 31, 2016.
•   headcount was 17,048 as of december 31, 2016.
*in the fourth quarter of 2016, we elected to early adopt accounting standards update no. 2016-09, compensation-stock compensation (topic 718): improvement to employee share-based payment accounting (asu 2016-09) which required us to reflect any adoption adjustments as of january 1, 2016, the beginning of the annual period that includes the interim period of adoption. as such, certain full year 2016 financial results data above included the impacts of the asu 2016-09 adoption. see note 1 of the accompanying notes to our consolidated financial statements for additional information related to this adoption.
in 2016, we continued to make progress on our three main revenue growth priorities: (i) continuing to capitalize on the shift to mobile, (ii) growing the number of marketers using our ad products, and (iii) making our ads more relevant and effective through continued adoption of newer ad formats and tools for marketers.
we continued to invest, based on our roadmap, in: (i) our most developed ecosystem, the facebook app and platform as well as video, (ii) driving growth and building ecosystems around our products and features that already have significant user bases, such as messenger, instagram, and whatsapp, and (iii) long-term technology initiatives that we believe will further our mission to connect the world, such as virtual reality and artificial intelligence. we intend to continue to invest based on this roadmap and we expect these investments and our increasingly global scale will drive significant overall year-over-year expense growth compared to 2016. in addition, we anticipate our expenses in 2017 will continue to grow as we execute on priorities such as (i) hiring top engineering talent, (ii) investing in research and development, content, and sales and marketing efforts, and (iii) expanding our data center capacity and office facilities to support our rapid growth.
trends in our user metrics the numbers for our key metrics, our daus, maus, and average revenue per user (arpu), do not include instagram, whatsapp, or oculus users unless they would otherwise qualify as such users, respectively, based on their other activities on facebook. in addition, other user engagement metrics do not include instagram, whatsapp, or oculus unless otherwise specifically stated.
trends in the number of users affect our revenue and financial results by influencing the number of ads we are able to show, the value of our ads to marketers, the volume of payments transactions, as well as our expenses and capital expenditures. substantially all of our daily and monthly active users (as defined below) access facebook on mobile devices.
•   daily active users (daus). we define a daily active user as a registered facebook user who logged in and visited facebook through our website or a mobile device, or used our messenger application (and is also a registered facebook user), on a given day. we view daus, and daus as a percentage of maus, as measures of user engagement.
note: for purposes of reporting daus, maus, and arpu by geographic region, europe includes all users in russia and turkey and rest of world includes all users in africa, latin america, and the middle east.
worldwide daus increased 18% to 1.23 billion on average during december 2016 from 1.04 billion during december 2015. we experienced growth in daus across major markets, including india, indonesia, and brazil.
•   monthly active users (maus). we define a monthly active user as a registered facebook user who logged in and visited facebook through our website or a mobile device, or used our messenger application (and is also a registered facebook user), in the last 30 days as of the date of measurement. maus are a measure of the size of our global active user community.
as of december 31, 2016, we had 1.86 billion maus, an increase of 17% from december 31, 2015. users in india, indonesia, and brazil represented key sources of growth in 2016, relative to the same period in 2015.
trends in our monetization by user geography we calculate our revenue by user geography based on our estimate of the geography in which ad impressions are delivered, virtual and digital goods are purchased or virtual reality platform devices are shipped. we define arpu as our total revenue in a given geography during a given quarter, divided by the average of the number of maus in the geography at the beginning and end of the quarter. while arpu includes all sources of revenue, the number of maus used in this calculation only includes users of facebook and messenger as described in the definition of mau above. the geography of our users affects our revenue and financial results because we currently monetize users in different geographies at different average rates. our revenue and arpu in regions such as united states & canada and europe are relatively higher primarily due to the size and maturity of those online and mobile advertising markets. for example, arpu in 2016 in the united states & canada region was more than eight times higher than in the asia-pacific region.
note: our revenue by user geography in the charts above is geographically apportioned based on our estimation of the geographic location of our users when they perform a revenue-generating activity. this allocation differs from our revenue by geography disclosure in our consolidated financial statements where revenue is geographically apportioned based on the location of the marketer or developer. we discovered an error in the algorithm we used to attribute our revenue by user geography in late 2015. while this issue did not affect our overall worldwide revenue, it did affect our attribution of revenue to different geographic regions. the fourth quarter of 2015 revenue by user geography and arpu amounts for all regions were adjusted to reflect this reclassification.
for 2016, worldwide arpu was $15.98, an increase of 34% from 2015. over this period, arpu increased by 49% in united states & canada, 35% in europe, 34% in asia-pacific, and 25% in rest of world. in addition, user growth was more rapid in geographies with relatively lower arpu, such as asia-pacific and rest of world. we expect that user growth in the future will be primarily concentrated in those regions where arpu is relatively lower, such that worldwide arpu may continue to increase at a slower rate relative to arpu in any geographic region, or potentially decrease even if arpu increases in each geographic region.
critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles (gaap). the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, costs and expenses, and related disclosures. we evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. our estimates are based on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. our actual results could differ from these estimates.
an accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made, if different estimates reasonably could have been used, or if changes in the estimate that are reasonably possible could materially impact the financial statements. we believe that the assumptions and estimates associated with revenue recognition for payments and other fees, income taxes, share-based compensation, loss contingencies, and business combinations and valuation of goodwill and other acquired intangible assets have the greatest potential impact on our consolidated financial statements. therefore, we consider these to be our critical accounting policies and estimates. for further information on all of our significant accounting policies, see note 1 of our accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements included in part ii, item 8, "financial statements and supplementary data" of this annual report on form 10-k.
income taxes we are subject to income taxes in the united states and numerous foreign jurisdictions. significant judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes and income tax assets and liabilities, including evaluating uncertainties in the application of accounting principles and complex tax laws.
we record a provision for income taxes for the anticipated tax consequences of the reported results of operations using the asset and liability method. under this method, we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, as well as for loss and tax credit carryforwards. deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the tax rates that are expected to apply to taxable income for the years in which those tax assets and liabilities are expected to be realized or settled. we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the net amount that we believe is more likely than not to be realized.
we recognize tax benefits from uncertain tax positions only if we believe that it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position. these uncertain tax positions include our estimates for transfer pricing that have been developed based upon analyses of appropriate arms-length prices. similarly, our estimates related to uncertain tax positions concerning research tax credits are based on an assessment of whether our available documentation corroborating the nature of our activities supporting the tax credits will be sufficient. although we believe that we have adequately reserved for our uncertain tax positions (including net interest and penalties), we can provide no assurance that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be materially different. we make adjustments to these reserves in accordance with the income tax accounting guidance when facts and circumstances change, such as the closing of a tax audit or the refinement of an estimate. to the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded, such differences will affect the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made, and could have a material impact on our financial condition and operating results.
share-based compensation we account for share-based employee compensation plans under the fair value recognition and measurement provisions in accordance with applicable accounting standards, which require all share-based payments to employees, including grants of stock options and restricted stock units (rsus), to be measured based on the grant date fair value of the awards, with the resulting expense generally recognized on a straight-line basis over the period during which the employee is required to perform service in exchange for the award.
we elected to early adopt asu 2016-09 in the fourth quarter of 2016, which among other items, provides an accounting policy election to account for forfeitures as they occur, rather than to account for them based on an estimate of expected forfeitures. we elected to account for forfeitures as they occur and therefore, share-based compensation expense for the year ended december 31, 2016 has been calculated based on actual forfeitures in our consolidated statements of income, rather than our previous approach which was net of estimated forfeitures. the net cumulative effect of this change was recognized as a $39 million increase to paid-in capital as of january 1, 2016. share-based compensation expense for the years ended december 31, 2015 and 2014 were recorded net of estimated forfeitures, which were based on historical forfeitures and adjusted to reflect changes in facts and circumstances, if any.
we have historically issued unvested restricted shares to employee stockholders of certain acquired companies. as these awards are generally subject to continued post-acquisition employment, we have accounted for them as post-acquisition share-based compensation expense. we recognize compensation expense equal to the grant date fair value of the common stock on a straight-line basis over the period during which the employee is required to perform service in exchange for the award.
loss contingencies we are involved in various lawsuits, claims, investigations, and proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business. certain of these matters include speculative claims for substantial or indeterminate amounts of damages. we record a liability when we believe that it is both probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. significant judgment is required to determine both probability and the estimated amount. we review these provisions at least quarterly and adjust these provisions accordingly to reflect the impact of negotiations, settlements, rulings, advice of legal counsel, and updated information.
we believe that the amount or estimable range of reasonably possible loss, will not, either individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows with respect to loss contingencies for legal and other contingencies as of december 31, 2016. however, the outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain. therefore, if one or more of these legal matters were resolved against us for amounts in excess of management's expectations, our results of operations and financial condition, including in a particular reporting period, could be materially adversely affected.
business combinations and valuation of goodwill and other acquired intangible assets we allocate the fair value of purchase consideration to the tangible assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and intangible assets acquired based on their estimated fair values. the excess of the fair value of purchase consideration over the fair values of these identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill. such valuations require management to make significant estimates and assumptions, especially with respect to intangible assets. significant estimates in valuing certain intangible assets include, but are not limited to, future expected cash flows from acquired users, acquired technology, and trade names from a market participant perspective, useful lives, and discount rates. management's estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable, but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and, as a result, actual results may differ from estimates. during the measurement period, which is one year from the acquisition date, we may record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, with the corresponding offset to goodwill. upon the conclusion of the measurement period, any subsequent adjustments are recorded to earnings.
we review goodwill for impairment at least annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances would more likely than not reduce the fair value of our single reporting unit below its carrying value. as of december 31, 2016, no impairment of goodwill has been identified.
acquired finite-lived intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives. we evaluate the recoverability of our intangible assets for possible impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. the evaluation is performed at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities. recoverability of these assets is measured by a comparison of the carrying amounts to the future undiscounted cash flows the assets are expected to generate. if such review indicates that the carrying amount of property and equipment and intangible assets is not recoverable, the carrying amount of such assets is reduced to fair value. we have not recorded any significant impairment charges during the years presented.
in addition to the recoverability assessment, we routinely review the remaining estimated useful lives of our finite-lived intangible assets. if we reduce the estimated useful life assumption for any asset, the remaining unamortized balance would be amortized over the revised estimated useful life.
components of results of operations revenue advertising. we generate substantially all of our revenue from advertising. our advertising revenue is generated by displaying ad products on facebook, instagram, and third-party affiliated websites or mobile applications. marketers pay for ad products either directly or through their relationships with advertising agencies, based on the number of clicks made by people, the number of actions taken by people, or the number of impressions delivered. we recognize revenue from the delivery of click-based ads in the period in which a person clicks on the content, and action-based ads in the period in which a person takes the action the marketer contracted for. we recognize revenue from the display of impression-based ads in the contracted period in which the impressions are delivered. impressions are considered delivered when an ad is displayed to people. the number of ads we show is subject to methodological changes as we continue to evolve our ads business and the structure of our ads products. we calculate price per ad as total ad revenue divided by the number of ads delivered, representing the effective price paid per impression by a marketer regardless of their desired objective such as impression, click, or action. for advertising revenue arrangements where we are not the primary obligor, we recognize revenue on a net basis.
payments and other fees. we enable payments from people to purchase virtual and digital goods from our developers. people can transact and make payments on the facebook website by using debit and credit cards, paypal, mobile phone payments, gift cards, or other methods. we receive a fee from developers when people make purchases in these applications using our payments infrastructure. we recognize revenue net of amounts remitted to our developers. we have mandated the use of our payments infrastructure for game applications on facebook, and fees related to payments are generated almost exclusively from games. our other fees revenue, which has not been significant in recent periods, consists primarily of revenue from the delivery of virtual reality platform devices and related platform sales, and our ad serving and measurement products.
cost of revenue and operating expenses cost of revenue. our cost of revenue consists primarily of expenses associated with the delivery and distribution of our products. these include expenses related to the operation of our data centers, such as facility and server equipment depreciation, salaries, benefits, and share-based compensation for employees on our operations teams, and energy and bandwidth costs. cost of revenue also includes credit card and other transaction fees related to processing customer transactions, amortization of intangible assets, costs associated with data partner arrangements, and cost of virtual reality platform device inventory sold.
research and development. research and development expenses consist primarily of share-based compensation, salaries, and benefits for employees on our engineering and technical teams who are responsible for building new products as well as improving existing products. we expense all of our research and development costs as they are incurred.
marketing and sales. our marketing and sales expenses consist of salaries, share-based compensation, and benefits for our employees engaged in sales, sales support, marketing, business development, and customer service functions. our marketing and sales expenses also include marketing and promotional expenditures, as well as amortization of intangible assets.
general and administrative. the majority of our general and administrative expenses consist of salaries, benefits, and share-based compensation for certain of our executives as well as our legal, finance, human resources, corporate communications and policy, and other administrative employees. in addition, general and administrative expenses include professional and legal services.

the most important factor driving advertising revenue growth was an increase in revenue from ads in news feed. for 2016, we estimate that mobile advertising revenue represented approximately 83% of total advertising revenue, as compared with approximately 77% in 2015. factors that influenced our advertising revenue growth in 2016 included (i) an increase in demand for our ad inventory, in part driven by an increase in the number of marketers actively advertising on facebook, (ii) an increase in user growth and engagement, and (iii) an increase in the number and frequency of ads displayed in news feed, as well as the quality, relevance, and performance of those ads. however, we anticipate increases in the number and frequency of ads displayed in news feed will be a less significant driver of our revenue growth in the future.
in 2016 compared to 2015, the average price per ad increased by 5% and the number of ads delivered increased by 50%. the increase in average price per ad was driven by a continued mix shift towards a greater percentage of our ads being shown in news feed while the increase in the ads delivered was driven by the same factors that influenced our advertising growth.
advertising spending is traditionally seasonally strong in the fourth quarter of each year. we believe that this seasonality in advertising spending affects our quarterly results, which generally reflect significant growth in advertising revenue between the third and fourth quarters and a decline in advertising spending between the fourth and subsequent first quarters. for instance, our advertising revenue increased 27%, 31%, and 22% between the third and fourth quarters of 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively, while advertising revenue for both the first quarters of 2016 and 2015 declined 8% compared to the fourth quarters of 2015 and 2014.
payments and other fees revenue in 2016 decreased $96 million, or 11%, compared to 2015. the majority of the decrease in payments and other fees revenue was due to decreased payments revenue from games played on personal computers. we anticipate payments and other fees revenue will continue to decline in 2017.
the most important factor driving advertising revenue growth was an increase in revenue from ads in news feed on mobile devices. in 2015, we estimate that mobile advertising revenue represented approximately 77% of total advertising revenue, as compared with approximately 65% in 2014. factors that influenced our mobile advertising revenue growth in 2015 included (i) an increase in demand for our ad inventory, in part driven by an increase in the number of marketers actively advertising on facebook, (ii) an increase in mobile user growth and engagement, and (iii) an increase in the number and frequency of ads displayed in news feed, as well as the quality, relevance, and performance of those ads.
in 2015 compared to 2014, the average price per ad increased by 140% and the number of ads delivered decreased by 38%. the increase in average price per ad was driven by a product change related to certain non-news feed ads during the third quarter of 2014, which decreased the number of ads displayed but increased the prominence of each ad. average price per ad was also driven by a mix shift towards a greater percentage of our ads being shown in news feed. the reduction in ads delivered was driven by factors including the product change described above as well as the shift in usage towards mobile devices where people are shown fewer ads as compared to personal computers.
payments and other fees revenue in 2015 decreased $125 million, or 13%, compared to 2014. the decrease in payments and other fees revenue was a result of decreased payments revenue from games played on personal computers, partially offset by an increase in other fees revenue related to acquisitions closed in the second half of 2014.
no customer represented 10% or more of total revenue during the years ended december 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014.
foreign exchange impact on revenue the general strengthening of the u.s. dollar relative to certain foreign currencies from the full year 2015 compared to the same period in 2016 had an unfavorable impact on our revenue. if we had translated revenue for the full year 2016 using the prior year's monthly exchange rates for our settlement currencies other than the u.s. dollar, our total revenue and advertising revenue would have been $27.91 billion, and $27.15 billion, respectively. using these constant rates, revenue and advertising revenue would have been $270 million and $269 million higher than actual revenue and advertising revenue, respectively, for the full year 2016.
the general strengthening of the u.s. dollar relative to certain foreign currencies (primarily the euro) from the full year 2014 to the same period in 2015 had an unfavorable impact on our revenue. if we had translated revenue for the full year 2015 using 2014 monthly exchange rates for our settlement currencies other than the u.s. dollar, our total revenue and advertising revenue would have been $19.11 billion and $18.26 billion, respectively. using these constant rates, both revenue and advertising revenue would have been $1.19 billion higher than actual revenue and advertising revenue for the full year 2015.

2016 compared to 2015. cost of revenue in 2016 increased $922 million, or 32%, compared to 2015. the majority of the increase was due to an increase in operational expenses related to our data centers and technical infrastructure and, to a lesser extent, higher costs associated with ads payment processing and various partnership agreements.
2015 compared to 2014. cost of revenue in 2015 increased $714 million, or 33%, compared to 2014. the increase was primarily due to an increase in operational expenses related to our data centers and technical infrastructure, compared to 2014. amortization of our intangible assets in 2015 also increased $100 million compared to 2014, mostly due to the full year impact of acquisitions completed in the second half of 2014.
in 2017, we anticipate that the cost of revenue will increase as we continue to expand our data center capacity and technical infrastructure to support user growth, increased user engagement, and the delivery of new products and services and, to a lesser extent, due to higher costs associated with ads payment processing and various partnership agreements.

2016 compared to 2015. research and development expenses in 2016 increased $1.10 billion, or 23%, compared to 2015. the majority of the increase was due to an increase in payroll and benefits as a result of a 34% growth in employee headcount from december 31, 2015 to december 31, 2016 in engineering and other technical functions. additionally, our equipment and related expenses in 2016 to support our research and development efforts increased $170 million compared to 2015.
2015 compared to 2014. research and development expenses in 2015 increased $2.15 billion, or 81%, compared to 2014. the majority of the increase was due to an increase in share-based compensation expense of $1.02 billion compared to 2014, which reflected the full year impact of share-based compensation related to the acquisitions completed in the second half of 2014. in addition, other payroll and benefits expense increased as a result of a 43% growth in employee headcount from december 31, 2014 to december 31, 2015 in engineering and other technical functions.
in 2017, we plan to continue to accelerate the hiring of software engineers and other technical employees and increasing our investment to support our research and development initiatives.

2015 compared to 2014. marketing and sales expenses in 2015 increased $1.05 billion, or 62%, compared to 2014. the majority of the increase was due to increases in amortization of our intangible assets of $305 million due to the full year impact of acquisitions completed in the second half of 2014, and in payroll and benefits expenses as a result of a 32% increase in employee headcount from december 31, 2014 to december 31, 2015 in our marketing and sales functions. additionally, our marketing expenses increased $258 million in 2015, compared to 2014.
in 2017, we plan to continue to increase our investment and the hiring of marketing and sales employees to support our marketing, sales, and partnership efforts.

2016 compared to 2015. general and administrative expenses in 2016 increased $436 million, or 34%, compared to 2015. the majority of the increase was due to an increase in payroll and benefits expenses as a result of a 43% increase in employee headcount from december 31, 2015 to december 31, 2016 in general and administrative functions, and to a lesser extent, higher professional services and legal fees.
2015 compared to 2014. general and administrative expenses in 2015 increased $322 million, or 33%, compared to 2014. the increase was primarily due to an increase in payroll and benefits expenses as a result of a 36% increase in employee headcount from december 31, 2014 to december 31, 2015 in general and administrative functions, including an increase of $20 million in share-based compensation expense in 2015, and to a lesser extent, higher legal and other professional services fees.
in 2017, we plan to continue to increase general and administrative expenses to support overall company growth.

2016 compared to 2015. interest and other income/(expense), net in 2016 increased $122 million compared to 2015. interest income/(expense), net increased mostly due to increases in interest income driven by higher invested cash balances and interest rates. in addition, the majority of the decrease in other income/(expense), net was due to foreign exchange impact resulting from the periodic re-measurement of our foreign currency balances.
2015 compared to 2014. interest and other income/(expense), net in 2015 increased $53 million, or 63%, compared to 2014. other income/(expense), net increased primarily due to a decrease in foreign exchange losses resulting from the periodic re-measurement of our foreign currency balances. in addition, interest income/(expense), net increased due to higher invested cash balances and interest rates.

2016 compared to 2015. our provision for income taxes in 2016 decreased $205 million, or 8%, compared to 2015, primarily due to the impact of the adoption of asu 2016-09, and was partially offset by an increase in income before provision for income taxes. our effective tax rate decreased due to more of our income before provision for income taxes being earned in jurisdictions with a tax rate lower than the u.s. statutory rate where we have asserted our intention to indefinitely reinvest certain of those earnings, as well as due to a lower increase in our unrecognized tax benefit in 2016 compared to 2015 and the adoption of asu 2016-09 effective january 1, 2016.
the adoption of asu 2016-09 significantly impacts both the timing and method of how the tax effects of share-based awards are recognized. asu 2016-09 requires the income tax effects to be recognized in the provision for income taxes when the awards vest or are settled whereas previously such income tax benefits were recognized as part of additional paid-in capital and could not be recognized until they were realized through a reduction in income taxes payable. these combined effects had the impact of decreasing our provision for income taxes by $934 million and our effective tax rate by 7% in 2016. excluding the adoption of asu 2016-09, our provision for income taxes and effective tax rate in 2016 would have been $3.24 billion and 26%, respectively.
in july 2016, we received a statutory notice of deficiency (notice) from the irs related to transfer pricing with our foreign subsidiaries in conjunction with the examination of the 2010 tax year. while the notice applies only to the 2010 tax year, the irs states that it will also apply its position for tax years subsequent to 2010, which, if the irs prevails in its position, could result in an additional federal tax liability of approximately $3.0 billion to $5.0 billion in excess of the originally filed u.s. return, plus interest and any penalties asserted. we do not agree with the position of the irs and have filed a petition in the united states tax court challenging the notice. we have previously accrued an estimated unrecognized tax benefit consistent with the guidance in asc 740 that is lower than the potential additional federal tax liability of $3.0 to $5.0 billion in excess of the originally filed u.s. return, plus interest and penalties. if the irs prevails in the assessment of additional tax due based on its position, the assessed tax, interest and penalties, if any, could have a material adverse impact on our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.
2015 compared to 2014. our provision for income taxes in 2015 increased $536 million, or 27%, compared to 2014, primarily due to an increase in income before provision for income taxes. our effective tax rate in 2015 remained flat due to an increase in income subject to tax in jurisdictions with tax rates lower than the u.s. statutory rate offset by an increase in unrecognized tax benefits.
effective tax rate items. our 2016 effective tax rate differs from the u.s. statutory rate primarily due to more of our income before provision for income taxes being earned in jurisdictions with tax rates lower than the u.s. statutory rate where we have the asserted our intention to indefinitely reinvest those earnings and the recognition of certain tax benefits from share-based award activities after the adoption of asu 2016-09. our effective tax rate in the future will depend on the mix of our income before provision for income taxes earned in jurisdictions with a tax rate lower than the u.s. statutory rate where we have the ability and intent to indefinitely reinvest those earnings, as well as a number of other factors, including integrating intellectual property from acquisitions, research tax credits, share-based compensation, settlement of tax contingency items, and the impact of new legislation.
the portion of our income before provision for income taxes earned in jurisdictions with a tax rate lower than the u.s. statutory rate will depend upon the proportion of revenue and costs associated with the respective jurisdictions. our ability to assert our intention to indefinitely reinvest those future earnings will depend upon the amount, location, and cost of deploying those earnings to where they are needed by the business.
integrating intellectual property from acquisitions into our business generally involves intercompany transactions that have the impact of increasing our provision for income taxes. consequently, our provision for income taxes and our effective tax rate may initially increase following an acquisition and integration. the magnitude of this impact will depend upon the specific type, size, and taxing jurisdictions of the intellectual property as well as the relative contribution to income in subsequent periods.
the accounting for share-based compensation will increase or decrease our effective tax rate based upon the difference between our share-based compensation expense and the benefits taken on our tax return which depends upon the share price at the time of employee award vesting.
we anticipate our 2017 annual effective tax rate will be lower than 2016. we anticipate that more of our income before provision for income taxes will be earned in jurisdictions with a tax rate lower than the u.s. statutory rate where we intend to assert to indefinitely reinvest those earnings which we expect will result in a lower effective tax rate for 2017. in addition, we anticipate that asu 2016-09 will further lower our effective tax rate, relative to the u.s. statutory rate, if our share price remains constant to the january 31, 2017 price of $130.32. as asu 2016-09 requires recognition of certain tax benefits on a discrete basis, we anticipate that our effective tax rate will vary from quarter to quarter depending on our share price in each period. if our share price remains constant to the january 31, 2017 price, we anticipate that our effective tax rate will be lower in the first quarter of 2017 and increase in the remaining quarters throughout the year.
unrecognized tax benefits. as of december 31, 2016, our net unrecognized tax benefits are $2.43 billion accrued as other liabilities and are predominantly accrued for uncertainties related to transfer pricing with our foreign subsidiaries, which includes licensing of intellectual property, providing services and other transactions, as well as for uncertainties with our research tax credits. the ultimate settlement of the liabilities will depend upon resolution of tax audits, litigation, or events that would otherwise change the assessment of such items. based upon the status of litigation described above and the current status of tax audits in various jurisdictions, we believe it is unlikely that a material change to our unrecognized tax benefits will occur within the next 12 months. we expect to continue to accrue unrecognized tax benefits for certain recurring tax positions and anticipate that the amount accrued will be similar to 2016. absent any unanticipated event, we do not expect our unrecognized tax benefits will have a significant impact on our effective tax rate in 2017.

net cash provided by operating activities(1)     $16,108               $10,320                $7,326
purchases of property and equipment               (4,491    )           (2,523    )           (1,831    )
(1)   we elected to early adopt asu 2016-09 in the fourth quarter of 2016. the impacts of adoption have been reflected retrospectively in certain of our consolidated statements of cash flows data for all periods presented. share-based compensation for the year ended december 31, 2016 included the impact the adoption. see note 1 of the accompanying notes to our consolidated financial statements for additional information related to this adoption.
our principal sources of liquidity are our cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities, and cash generated from operations. cash and cash equivalents, and marketable securities consist primarily of cash on deposit with banks, investments in money market funds, and investments in u.s. government securities, u.s. government agency securities, and corporate debt securities. cash and cash equivalents, and marketable securities were $29.45 billion as of december 31, 2016, an increase of $11.02 billion from december 31, 2015, primarily due to $16.11 billion of cash generated from operations, partially offset by $4.49 billion for purchases of property and equipment and $312 million for principal payments on capital lease and other financing obligations.
cash paid for income taxes (net of refunds) was $1.21 billion for the year ended december 31, 2016. as of december 31, 2016, our federal net operating loss carryforward was $3.14 billion, although we anticipate only a relatively small portion of this will be available to offset our federal taxable income in 2017. as of december 31, 2016, we had $312 million of federal tax credits, of which a substantial portion will be available to offset our federal tax liabilities in 2017. we expect that the amount of cash paid for income taxes will significantly increase in 2017.
in may 2016, we terminated our undrawn five-year senior unsecured revolving credit facility that allowed us to borrow up to $6.5 billion and entered into a $2.0 billion senior unsecured revolving credit facility (2016 facility). any amounts outstanding under the 2016 facility will be due and payable on may 20, 2021. as of december 31, 2016, no amounts had been drawn down and we were in compliance with the covenants under this credit facility.
in november 2016, our board of directors authorized a $6.0 billion share repurchase program of our class a common stock commencing in 2017 and does not have an expiration date. the timing and actual number of shares repurchased depend on a variety of factors, including price, general business and market conditions, and other investment opportunities, through open market purchases or privately negotiated transactions including through the use of trading plans intended to qualify under rule 10b5-1 under the securities exchange act of 1934, as amended (exchange act).
as of december 31, 2016, $5.10 billion of the $29.45 billion in cash and cash equivalents, and marketable securities was held by our foreign subsidiaries. we have provided residual taxes in jurisdictions where we do not intend to indefinitely reinvest the earnings of the local subsidiary.
in january 2017, we began funding withholding taxes due on employee equity awards by net share settlement, rather than our previous approach of requiring employees to sell shares of our common stock to cover taxes upon vesting of such awards. we expect this net share settlement approach will increase our cash outflows and reduce the number of shares that will be issued in connection with the vesting of our employee equity awards. if we had used the net share settlement approach in 2016, our cash outflows would have increased by approximately $2.3 billion for the year ended december 31, 2016, and the number of shares of class a common stock issued in connection with the vesting of employee equity awards during this period would have decreased by approximately 20 million shares.
we currently anticipate that our available funds, credit facility, and cash flow from operations will be sufficient to meet our operational cash needs for the foreseeable future.
cash provided by operating activities cash flow from operating activities during 2016, mostly consisted of net income, adjusted for certain non-cash items, such as share-based compensation expense of $3.22 billion and total depreciation and amortization of $2.34 billion. the increase in cash flow from operating activities during 2016 compared to 2015, was mostly due to an increase in net income, including the impact of asu 2016-09 adoption, as adjusted for depreciation and amortization, deferred income taxes, and share-based compensation expense.
cash flow from operating activities during 2015, mostly consisted of net income, adjusted for certain non-cash items, such as share-based compensation expense of $2.96 billion, total depreciation and amortization of $1.95 billion, and tax benefit from share-based award activity of $1.72 billion, which had been reclassified from financing activity as a result of asu 2016-09 adoption. the increase in cash flow from operating activities during 2015 compared to 2014, was primarily due to an increase in net income, as adjusted for share-based compensation expense, and higher income tax payable as of december 31, 2015 compared to 2014.
cash flow from operating activities during 2014, primarily consisted of net income, adjusted for certain non-cash items, such as tax benefit from share-based award activity of $1.85 billion, which had been reclassified from financing activity as a result of asu 2016-09 adoption, share-based compensation expense of $1.79 billion and total depreciation and amortization of $1.24 billion. the cash flow from operating activities during 2014 compared to 2013 increased mainly due to an increase in net income of $1.44 billion, as adjusted for certain non-cash items described above, partially offset by a decrease in income tax refunds of $415 million.
cash used in investing activities cash used in investing activities was $11.74 billion during 2016, mostly due to $7.19 billion for net purchases of marketable securities and $4.49 billion for capital expenditures as we continued to invest in data centers, servers, office buildings, and network infrastructure. the increase in cash used in investing activities during 2016 compared to 2015 was mostly due to increases in capital expenditures and net purchases of marketable securities.
cash used in investing activities during 2015, primarily resulted from $6.70 billion for net purchases of marketable securities and $2.52 billion for capital expenditures as we continued to invest in servers, data centers, network infrastructure, and office buildings. the increase in cash used in investing activities during 2015 compared to 2014 was mainly due to increases in net purchases of marketable securities, partially offset by a decrease in acquisitions of businesses and purchases of intangible assets.
cash used in investing activities during 2014 primarily resulted from $4.98 billion for the acquisition of businesses and $1.83 billion for capital expenditures related to network infrastructure and the construction of data centers and office buildings, partially offset by $1.24 billion for the net sales and maturities of marketable securities. the increase in cash used in investing activities during 2014 compared to 2013 was mainly due to increases in acquisitions of businesses and purchases of intangible assets, and capital expenditures, partially offset by net sales of marketable securities.
we anticipate making capital expenditures in 2017 of approximately $7.0 billion to $7.5 billion.
cash used in financing activities cash used in financing activities during 2016, mostly consisted of principal payments on capital lease and other financing obligations. the increase in cash used in financing activities was due to full repayment of our capital lease and other financing obligations in 2016.
cash used in financing activities during 2015, primarily consisted of principal payments on capital lease obligations. the decrease in cash used in financing activities was primarily due to lower principal payments related to our capital lease transactions.
cash used in financing activities during 2014 was $298 million, which primarily resulted from $243 million of payments related to our capital lease transactions, and $55 million of other financing activities.
off-balance sheet arrangements we did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements as of december 31, 2016.
contractual obligations our principal commitments consist of obligations under operating leases for offices, land, facilities, and data centers. the following table summarizes our commitments to settle contractual obligations in cash as of december 31, 2016 (in millions):
1 year                      years             years               5 years operating lease obligations                                           $1,964           $277                     $549              $405                $733
(1)   financing obligation - building in progress - leased facility represents our commitments to lease certain office buildings that are currently under construction. as of december 31, 2016, $112 million of the total obligation was recorded as a liability and is included in other liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets. see note 9 of the accompanying notes to our consolidated financial statements for additional information related to this financing obligation.
in addition, our other liabilities include $2.43 billion related to uncertain tax positions as of december 31, 2016. due to uncertainties in the timing of the completion of tax audits, the timing of the resolution of these positions is uncertain and we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of payments in individual years beyond 12 months. as a result, this amount is not included in the above contractual obligations table.
contingencies we are involved in claims, lawsuits, government investigations, and other legal proceedings. we record a provision for a liability when we believe that it is both probable that a liability has been incurred, and that the amount can be reasonably estimated. significant judgment is required to determine both probability and the estimated amount. such legal proceedings are inherently unpredictable and subject to significant uncertainties, some of which are beyond our control. should any of these estimates and assumptions change or prove to be incorrect, it could have a material impact on our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows.

recently issued accounting pronouncements in may 2014, the fasb issued accounting standards update no. 2014-09, revenue from contracts with customers (topic 606) (asu 2014-09), which amends the existing accounting standards for revenue recognition. in august 2015, the fasb issued asu no. 2015-14, revenue from contracts with customers (topic 606): deferral of the effective date, which delays the effective date of asu 2014-09 by one year. the fasb also agreed to allow entities to choose to adopt the standard as of the original effective date. in march 2016, the fasb issued accounting standards update no. 2016-08, revenue from contracts with customers (topic 606): principal versus agent considerations (reporting revenue gross versus net) (asu 2016-08) which clarifies the implementation guidance on principal versus agent considerations. the guidance includes indicators to assist an entity in determining whether it controls a specified good or service before it is transferred to the customers. the new revenue recognition standard will be effective for us in the first quarter of 2018, with the option to adopt it in the first quarter of 2017. we currently anticipate adopting the new standard effective january 1, 2018. the new standard also permits two methods of adoption: retrospectively to each prior reporting period presented (full retrospective method), or retrospectively with the cumulative effect of initially applying the guidance recognized at the date of initial application (the modified retrospective method). we currently anticipate adopting the standard using the modified retrospective method. while we are still in the process of completing our analysis on the impact this guidance will have on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures, we do not expect the impact to be material.

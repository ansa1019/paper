   for 2016 and 2015, the company recorded a dot on-time arrival rate of 81.3% and 78.1%, respectively, and a system completion factor of 99.0% and 98.7%, respectively.
                            the company took delivery of five new boeing 787-9 dreamliners, eight new boeing
737-900ers, seven new boeing 737-800s, two new boeing 777-300ers and six used airbus a319s. united exited from scheduled service four boeing 757-200s, 16 embraer erj 145s and two boeing 747-400s. the company took delivery of the first boeing 777-300er in the companys fleet, named the new spirit of united, featuring the all-new united polaris business class seat.

outlook set forth below is a discussion of the principal matters that we believe could impact our financial and operating performance and cause our results of operations in future periods to differ materially from our historical
operating results and/or from our anticipated results of operations described in the forward-looking statements in this report. see part i, item 1a., risk factors, of this report and the factors described under forward-looking information below for additional discussion of these and other factors that could affect us.
the company is committed to improving the efficiency and quality of all aspects of its business in 2017. in order to continue improving operational performance in 2017, our top focus will be on further improvements in completion factor, departure performance and baggage handling.
as outlined at our 2016 investor day presentation, the company expects to drive significant incremental value by 2020 relative to 2015. united anticipates capturing this value through a variety of initiatives including a re-fleeting and upgauge program, additional customer choice through segmentation, improvements to the revenue management systems, ongoing sensible cost management, realizing our full network potential through improved schedule quality and enhancements to the mileageplus program. in addition, the company will continue to focus on improving reliability while increasing the efficiency of the operation.
economic conditions. the economic outlook for the aviation industry in 2017 is characterized by moderate u.s. and global economic growth. in such conditions, we expect a moderate increase in the demand for air travel. continuing economic uncertainty, along with the strengthening u.s. dollar, is providing uncertainty in key asian, south american and european markets, and continued political and socioeconomic tensions may result in diminished demand for air travel.
capacity. in 2017, the company expects consolidated asms to grow between 1% and 2% year-over-year.
fuel. the companys average aircraft fuel price per gallon including related taxes was $1.49 in 2016 as compared to $1.94 in 2015. since 2014, the price of jet fuel has declined and remains volatile. based on projected fuel consumption in 2017, a one dollar change in the price of a barrel of crude oil would change the companys annual fuel expense by approximately $95 million.
labor. as of december 31, 2016, united had approximately 80% of employees represented by unions. in 2016, united reached contract extensions with its pilots and dispatchers, amended collective bargaining agreements with its iam represented employees, reached a five-year contract with the afa covering all of its flight attendants and reached a six-year contract with the ibt covering its technicians and related employees. additionally, the company will be increasing pay for its pilots in order to align with a recently implemented contract of another airline. the costs associated with all these agreements is expected to add approximately $900 million of costs for full-year 2017. the company cannot predict the outcome of future negotiations with its unionized employee groups. increases in the pay and benefits resulting from new collective bargaining agreements could have a material financial impact on the company.
results of operations in this section, we compare results of operations for the year ended december 31, 2016 with results of operations for the year ended december 31, 2015, and results of operations for the year ended december 31, 2015 with results of operations for the year ended december 31, 2014.
operating revenue the table below illustrates the year-over-year percentage change in the companys operating revenues for the years ended december 31 (in millions, except percentage changes):
2016               2015               increase          % change
other operating revenue              4,223              4,142   81                2.0
the table below presents the companys selected passenger revenue and selected operating data based on geographic region (regional flights consist primarily of domestic routes):
asms (capacity)                           3.1 %                  (0.2)%                  2.0 %                 2.8 %                   2.1 %                  (3.7)%                     1.4 %
passenger load factor (points)            (0.6)                   (3.3)           0.6                    2.2                           (0.6)           0.3                               (0.5)
(a) see part ii, item 6 of this report for the definition of these statistics.
consolidated passenger revenue decreased $1.3 billion, or 4.1%, in 2016 as compared to 2015. consolidated prasm decreased 5.4% in 2016 as compared to 2015. the decline in prasm was driven by factors including a competitive domestic fare environment, lower surcharges, a strong u.s. dollar and reductions from energy-related corporate travel.
cargo revenue decreased $61 million, or 6.5%, in 2016 as compared to 2015 due to lower freight yields and lower mail volumes year-over-year, partially offset by an increase in freight volumes. freight yields were negatively impacted as air freighter competitors increased capacity in response to lower fuel prices. another contributing factor to the year-over-year decrease was a u.s. west coast port labor dispute that resulted in an increase in air freight results in the first quarter of 2015. the labor dispute was resolved during the first quarter of 2015.
operating expense the table below includes data related to the companys operating expense for the year ended december 31 (in millions, except percentage changes):
2016              2015                     increase        % change
regional capacity purchase                                     2,197             2,290              (93)           (4.1)
aircraft maintenance materials and outside repairs             1,749             1,651                98             5.9
special charges                                                  638               326               312              nm other operating expenses                                       5,421             5,078               343             6.8
salaries and related costs increased $562 million, or 5.8%, in 2016 as compared to 2015 primarily due to higher pay rates and benefit expenses driven by new and extended collective bargaining agreements, an increase in employee incentive expenses due to improvements in operational performance and a 2.2% increase in average full-time equivalent employees, partially offset by a reduction in profit sharing expense in 2016 as compared to 2015, a reduction in medical and dental costs and the results of certain costs savings initiatives in 2016.
the decrease in aircraft fuel expense was primarily attributable to decreased fuel prices and a reduction in fuel hedge losses, partially offset by the impact of a 1.4% increase in capacity. 2016 fuel expense includes the benefit of a $20 million fuel tax refund. the table below presents the significant changes in aircraft fuel cost per gallon for the year ended december 31 (in millions, except percentage changes):
(in millions)              %                                           average price per gallon change
change total aircraft fuel purchase cost excluding fuel hedge impacts            $5,596                  $6,918         (19.1)             $1.43                   $1.78                   (19.7)
depreciation and amortization increased $158 million, or 8.7%, in 2016 as compared to 2015 primarily due to additions of new aircraft, conversions of operating leases to capital leases, aircraft improvements, accelerated depreciation of certain assets related to several fleet types and increases in information technology assets.
aircraft maintenance materials and outside repairs increased $98 million, or 5.9%, in 2016 as compared to 2015 primarily due to a year-over-year increase in airframe maintenance visits as a result of the cyclical timing of these visits and volume-driven increases in component costs, partially offset by a reduction in costs due to the timing of maintenance on certain engines.
aircraft rent decreased $74 million, or 9.8%, in 2016 as compared to 2015 primarily due to lease expirations, the purchase or capital lease conversion of several operating leased aircraft and lower lease renewal rates for certain aircraft.
impairment of assets                                                $412           $79
severance and benefit costs                                           37           107
(gains) losses on sale of assets and other special charges            51           122
see note 16 to the financial statements included in part ii, item 8 of this report for additional information.
other operating expenses increased $343 million, or 6.8%, in 2016 as compared to 2015 primarily due to increases in ground handling costs, food and technology costs associated with the companys enhanced customer experience initiatives, rate-driven increases in hotel expenses for crews, increases in marketing expenses related to the 2016 summer olympics and volume-driven increases in cargo costs.
nonoperating income (expense)
the following table illustrates the year-over-year dollar and percentage changes in the companys nonoperating income (expense) (in millions, except percentage changes):
2016             2015              increase             % change
interest capitalized               72                49   23                       46.9
the decrease in interest expense of $55 million, or 8.2%, in 2016 as compared to 2015 was primarily due to the prepayment of certain debt issuances in 2015 and declining balances of other debt, partially offset by interest expense on debt issued for the acquisition of new aircraft, the conversion of certain operating leases to capital leases and certain constructed airport assets accounted for as capital leases.
in 2015, miscellaneous, net included losses of $80 million from fuel derivatives not qualifying for hedge accounting. foreign currency losses were approximately $43 million and $129 million in 2016 and 2015, respectively. foreign currency results included $8 million and $61 million of foreign exchange losses for 2016 and 2015, respectively, related to the companys cash holdings in venezuela. miscellaneous, net for 2015 also includes a $134 million special charge related to the write-off of unamortized non-cash debt discounts for the early redemption of the 6% notes due 2026 (the 2026 notes) and the 6% notes due 2028 (the 2028 notes).

(a) see part ii, item 6 of this report for the definition of these statistics.
consolidated passenger revenue in 2015 decreased $977 million, or 2.9%, as compared to 2014 primarily due to a decrease in consolidated yield of 4.3% year-over-year. yields were impacted by a competitive domestic fare environment, unfavorable foreign currency results due to the strengthening of the u.s. dollar, international surcharge declines, travel reductions from corporate customers in the energy sector and increased industry capacity in certain regions. the decline in yields was partially offset by a 1.5% year-over-year increase in traffic.
operating expense the table below includes data related to the companys operating expense for the year ended december 31 (in millions, except percentage changes):
2015              2014               increase               % change

salaries and related costs increased $778 million, or 8.7%, in 2015 as compared to 2014 primarily due to a $463 million increase in profit sharing costs as a result of improved profitability, higher pay rates driven by new collective bargaining agreements, an increase in medical and dental costs and an increase in pension expense resulting from changes in actuarial assumptions.
the decrease in aircraft fuel expense was primarily attributable to decreased fuel prices partially offset by losses from fuel hedging activity and a 1.6% increase in capacity. the table below presents the significant changes in aircraft fuel cost per gallon for the year ended december 31 (in millions, except percentage changes):
(in millions)   %                                                      average price per gallon change

depreciation and amortization increased $140 million, or 8.3%, in 2015 as compared to 2014 primarily due to additions in owned property and equipment, specifically related to new aircraft, information technology assets and several aircraft capital lease conversions from operating leases.
aircraft maintenance materials and outside repairs decreased $128 million, or 7.2%, in 2015 as compared to 2014 primarily due to a year-over-year decrease in significant airframe maintenance visits as a result of the cyclical timing of these visits, improvements in the efficiency of in-house maintenance programs, a reduced volume of seat and landing gear maintenance and a reduction of flying hours under certain power-by-the-hour engine maintenance agreements, partially offset by increases in expenses related to aircraft reliability projects and wi-fi systems maintenance.
aircraft rent decreased $129 million or 14.6% in 2015 as compared to 2014 primarily due to lease expirations, the purchase or capital lease conversion of several operating leased aircraft and lower lease renewal rates for certain aircraft.
severance and benefit costs                                                           $107          $199

nonoperating income (expense)
the following table illustrates the year-over-year dollar and percentage changes in uals nonoperating income (expense) (in millions, except percentage changes):
2015              2014               increase        % change
interest capitalized                49                 52           (3)             (5.8)
the decrease in interest expense of $66 million, or 9.0%, in 2015 as compared to 2014 was primarily due to the prepayment of certain debt issuances and declining balances of other debt, partially offset by interest expense on debt issued for the acquisition of new aircraft.
miscellaneous, net included losses of $80 million and $462 million from fuel derivatives not qualifying for hedge accounting in 2015 and 2014, respectively. foreign currency losses were approximately $129 million and $41 million in 2015 and 2014, respectively. foreign currency results included $61 million and $10 million of foreign exchange losses for 2015 and 2014, respectively, related to the companys cash holdings in venezuela. miscellaneous, net for 2015 includes a $134 million special charge related to the write-off of unamortized non-cash debt discounts for the early redemption of the 2026 notes and the 2028 notes. 2014 miscellaneous, net includes a $64 million debt extinguishment charge related to the retirement of the $248 million 6% convertible junior subordinated debentures due 2030.
liquidity and capital resources as of december 31, 2016, the company had $4.4 billion in unrestricted cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments, a decrease of $0.8 billion from december 31, 2015. the company had its entire commitment capacity of $1.35 billion under the credit agreement available for letters of credit or borrowings as of december 31, 2016. as of december 31, 2016, the company had $124 million of restricted cash and cash equivalents, which is primarily collateral for letters of credit and estimated future workers compensation claims. we may be required to post significant additional cash collateral to provide security for obligations. restricted cash and cash equivalents at december 31, 2015 totaled $206 million.
we have a significant amount of fixed obligations, including debt, aircraft leases and financings, leases of airport property and other facilities and pension funding obligations. at december 31, 2016, the company had
approximately $11.7 billion of debt and capital lease obligations, including $1.0 billion that are due within the next 12 months. in addition, we have substantial noncancelable commitments for capital expenditures, including the acquisition of new aircraft and related spare engines. as of december 31, 2016, our current liabilities exceeded our current assets by approximately $5.0 billion. however, approximately $5.9 billion of our current liabilities are related to our advance ticket sales and frequent flyer deferred revenue, both of which largely represent revenue to be recognized for travel in the near future and not actual cash outlays. the deficit in working capital does not have an adverse impact to our cash flows, liquidity or operations. the company made principal payments of debt and capital lease obligations totaling $1.4 billion in 2016.
the company will continue to evaluate opportunities to prepay its debt, including open market repurchases, to reduce its indebtedness and related interest.
for 2017, the company expects between $4.2 billion and $4.4 billion of gross capital expenditures. see notes 11 and 15 to the financial statements included in part ii, item 8 of this report for additional information on commitments.
as of december 31, 2016, a substantial portion of the companys assets, principally aircraft, route authorities, airport slots and loyalty program intangible assets, was pledged under various loan and other agreements. we must sustain our profitability and/or access the capital markets to meet our significant long-term debt and capital lease obligations and future commitments for capital expenditures, including the acquisition of aircraft and related spare engines. see note 11 to the financial statements included in part ii, item 8 of this report for additional information on assets provided as collateral by the company.
the following is a discussion of the companys sources and uses of cash from 2014 through 2016.
cash flows from operating activities
cash flow provided by operations for the year ended december 31, 2016 was $5.5 billion compared to $6.0 billion in the same period in 2015. working capital changes reduced cash flow from operations by $0.5 billion year-over-year in 2016 as compared to 2015. the following were significant working capital items in 2016:
   frequent flyer and advance purchase of miles decreased $0.6 billion due to increased utilization of pre-purchased miles.
   other assets, including spare parts, increased by $0.3 billion as part of the companys efforts to improve fleet reliability.
   accounts payable increased $0.2 billion, driven by the timing of payments.
cash flow provided by operations for the year ended december 31, 2015 was $6.0 billion compared to $2.6 billion in the same period in 2014. the $3.4 billion increase is primarily attributable to an increase of $3.1 billion in income before income taxes and a $0.4 billion increase in non-cash items for the year ended december 31, 2015 as compared to the same period in 2014. working capital changes reduced cash flow from operations by $0.1 billion year-over-year in 2015 as compared to 2014. the following were significant working capital items in 2015:
   cash flow increased by $0.2 billion from the return of hedge collateral net of the impact of changes in fuel derivative positions.
   other liabilities, including accrued wages, decreased $0.2 billion, which included $0.8 billion in pension contributions offset by
$0.7 billion in profit sharing accruals.
   frequent flyer deferred revenue and advanced purchase of miles decreased $0.2 billion.
the companys capital expenditures were $3.2 billion and $2.7 billion in 2016 and 2015, respectively. the companys capital expenditures for both years were primarily attributable to the purchase of aircraft, facility and fleet-related costs and the purchase of information technology assets.
the companys capital expenditures were $2.7 billion and $2.0 billion in 2015 and 2014, respectively. the companys capital expenditures for both years were primarily attributable to the purchase of aircraft, facility and fleet-related costs. in 2015, the company announced a strategic partnership with azul. through a wholly-owned subsidiary, the company invested $100 million for an economic stake of approximately five percent in azul, brazils largest carrier by cities served, which provides a range of customer benefits including codesharing of flights, joint loyalty program participation and expanded connection opportunities on routes between the u.s. and brazil, a key market for united, in addition to other points in north and south america.
cash flows from financing activities significant financing events in 2016 were as follows:
share repurchases the company used $2.6 billion of cash to purchase 50 million shares of its common stock during 2016 under its share repurchase programs. as of december 31, 2016, the company has $1.8 billion remaining to spend under its share repurchase program.
debt issuances in 2016, united completed two enhanced equipment trust certificate (eetc) offerings for a total principal amount of $2.0 billion. of the $2.0 billion, united received and recorded $708 million of proceeds as debt as of december 31, 2016 to finance the purchase of 17 aircraft. united expects to receive all proceeds from the pass-through trusts by the end of the second quarter of 2017.
in 2016, united borrowed approximately $369 million aggregate principal amount from various financial institutions to finance the purchase of several aircraft delivered in 2016.

leases and capacity purchase agreements   note 13
contractual obligations. the companys business is capital intensive, requiring significant amounts of capital to fund the acquisition of assets, particularly aircraft. in the past, the company has funded the acquisition of aircraft through outright purchase, by issuing debt, by entering into capital or operating leases, or through vendor financings. the company also often enters into long-term lease commitments with airports to ensure access to terminal, cargo, maintenance and other required facilities.
the table below provides a summary of the companys material contractual obligations as of december 31, 2016 (in billions):
capital lease obligationsprincipal portion                  0.1           0.1           0.1                                 0.6       0.9

(a)   long-term debt presented in the companys financial statements is net of $124 million of debt discount, premiums and debt issuance costs which are being amortized over the debt terms. contractual payments are not net of the debt discount, premiums and debt issuance costs.
(b)                  includes interest portion of capital lease obligations of $67 million in 2017, $57 million in 2018, $50 million in 2019, $47 million in 2020,
$44 million in 2021 and $339 million thereafter. future interest payments on variable rate debt are estimated using estimated future variable rates based on a yield curve.
(c)                                         represents our estimates of future minimum noncancelable commitments under our cpas and does not include the portion of the underlying obligations for aircraft and facility rent that is disclosed as part of aircraft and nonaircraft operating leases. amounts also exclude a portion of uniteds capital lease obligation recorded for certain of its cpas. see note 13 to the financial statements included in part ii, item 8 of this report for the significant assumptions used to estimate the payments.
(d)   amounts represent postretirement benefit payments, net of subsidy receipts, through 2026. benefit payments approximate plan contributions as plans are substantially unfunded.
(e)                               represents estimate of the minimum funding requirements as determined by government regulations for uniteds material pension plans. amounts are subject to change based on numerous assumptions, including the performance of assets in the plan and bond rates. see critical accounting policies, below, for a discussion of our current year assumptions regarding uniteds pension plans.
(f)   represents contractual commitments for firm order aircraft, spare engines and other capital purchase commitments. see note 15 to the financial statements included in part ii, item 8 of this report for a discussion of our purchase commitments.
off-balance sheet arrangements. an off-balance sheet arrangement is any transaction, agreement or other contractual arrangement involving an unconsolidated entity under which a company has (1) made guarantees, (2) a retained or a contingent interest in transferred assets, (3) an obligation under derivative instruments classified as equity, or (4) any obligation arising out of a material variable interest in an unconsolidated entity that provides financing, liquidity, market risk or credit risk support, or that engages in leasing, hedging or research and development arrangements. the companys primary off-balance sheet arrangements include operating leases, which are summarized in the contractual obligations table in contractual obligations, above, and certain municipal bond obligations, as discussed below.
as of december 31, 2016, united had cash collateralized $72 million of letters of credit. united also had $383 million of surety bonds securing various obligations at december 31, 2016. most of the letters of credit have evergreen clauses and are expected to be renewed on an annual basis and the surety bonds have expiration dates through 2021.
as of december 31, 2016, united is the guarantor of approximately $1.9 billion in aggregate principal amount of tax-exempt special facilities revenue bonds and interest thereon. these bonds, issued by various airport municipalities, are payable solely from rentals paid under long-term agreements with the respective governing bodies. the leasing arrangements associated with a majority of these obligations are accounted for as operating leases. the leasing arrangements associated with a portion of these obligations are accounted for as capital leases. the annual lease payments for those obligations accounted for as operating leases are included in the operating lease payments in the contractual obligations table above.
as of december 31, 2016, united is the guarantor of $168 million of aircraft mortgage debt issued by one of uniteds regional carriers. the aircraft mortgage debt is subject to increased cost provisions and the company would potentially be responsible for those costs under the guarantees. the increased cost provisions in the $168 million of aircraft mortgage debt are similar to those in certain of the companys debt agreements. see note 15 to the financial statements included in part ii, item 8 of this report for additional information on increased cost provisions related to the companys debt.
eetcs. in june 2016 and september 2016, united completed two separate eetc offerings for a total principal amount of $2.0 billion. united has received and recorded $708 million of the proceeds from these offerings as debt as of december 31, 2016. see notes 11 and 14 to the financial statements included in part ii, item 8 of this report for additional information on eetc pass-through trusts and variable interest entity consideration.
increased cost provisions. see note 15 to the financial statements included in part ii, item 8 of this report for additional information on increased cost provisions related to the companys debt.
fuel consortia. united participates in numerous fuel consortia with other air carriers at major airports to reduce the costs of fuel distribution and storage. interline agreements govern the rights and responsibilities of the consortia members and provide for the allocation of the overall costs to operate the consortia based on usage. the consortia (and in limited cases, the participating carriers) have entered into long-term agreements to lease certain airport fuel storage and distribution facilities that are typically financed through tax-exempt bonds (either special facilities lease revenue bonds or general airport revenue bonds), issued by various local municipalities. in general, each consortium lease agreement requires the consortium to make lease payments in amounts sufficient
to pay the maturing principal and interest payments on the bonds. as of december 31, 2016, approximately $1.5 billion principal amount of such bonds were secured by significant fuel facility leases in which united participates, as to which united and each of the signatory airlines has provided indirect guarantees of the debt. as of december 31, 2016, the companys contingent exposure was approximately $234 million principal amount of such bonds based on its recent consortia participation. the companys contingent exposure could increase if the participation of other air carriers decreases. the guarantees will expire when the tax-exempt bonds are paid in full, which ranges from 2017 to 2049. the company did not record a liability at the time these indirect guarantees were made. see note 15 to the financial statements included in part ii, item 8 of this report for additional information related to the companys fuel consortia.
critical accounting policies critical accounting policies are defined as those that are affected by significant judgments and uncertainties which potentially could result in materially different accounting under different assumptions and conditions. the company has prepared the financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america (gaap), which requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts in the financial statements. actual results could differ from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions. the company has identified the following critical accounting policies that impact the preparation of the financial statements.
revenue recognition. the company records passenger ticket sales and tickets sold by other airlines for use on united as passenger revenue when the transportation is provided or upon estimated breakage. the value of unused passenger tickets is included in current liabilities as advance ticket sales. tickets sold by other airlines are recorded at the estimated values to be billed to the other airlines. differences between amounts billed and the actual amounts may be rejected and rebilled or written off if the amount recorded was different from the original estimate. when necessary, the company records a reserve against its interline billings and payables if historical experience indicates that these amounts are different. non-refundable tickets generally expire on the date of the intended flight, unless the date is extended by notification from the customer on or before the intended flight date.
fees charged in association with changes or extensions to non-refundable tickets are recorded as other revenue at the time the fee is incurred. the fare on the changed ticket, including any additional collection of fare, is deferred and recognized in accordance with our transportation revenue recognition policy at the time the transportation is provided. change fees related to non-refundable tickets are considered a separate transaction from the air transportation because they represent a charge for the companys additional service to modify a previous sale. therefore, the pricing of the change fee and the initial customer order are separately determined and represent distinct earnings processes.
the company records an estimate of breakage revenue on the flight date for tickets that will expire unused. these estimates are based on the evaluation of actual historical results and forecasted trends. refundable tickets expire after one year from the date of issuance.
the financial accounting standards board (fasb) amended the fasb accounting standards codification and created a new topic 606, revenue from contracts with customers. this amendment prescribes that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. the amendment supersedes the revenue recognition requirements in topic 605, revenue recognition, and most industry-specific guidance throughout the industry topics of the accounting standards codification. the company currently plans to use the full-retrospective approach in adopting this standard on january 1, 2018. under the new standard, certain airline ancillary fees directly related to passenger revenue tickets, such as ticket change fees and baggage fees, are likely to no longer be considered distinct performance obligations separate from the passenger travel component. in addition, the ticket change fees which were previously recognized when received and booking fees when paid, will likely be recognized when transportation is provided. the company
has previously recorded ancillary fees and change fees in other operating revenue but will record these in passenger revenue under the new standard. the company is evaluating other possible impacts from the new standard on its consolidated financial statements.
frequent flyer accounting. the companys mileageplus program is designed to increase customer loyalty. program participants earn miles by flying on united and certain other participating airlines. program participants can also earn miles through purchases from other non-airline partners that participate in the companys loyalty program. we sell miles to these partners, which include credit card issuers, retail merchants, hotels, car rental companies and our participating airline partners. miles can be redeemed for free (other than taxes and government imposed fees), discounted or upgraded air travel and non-travel awards. the company records its obligation for future award redemptions using a deferred revenue model.
when frequent flyers earn miles for flights, the company recognizes a portion of the ticket sales as revenue when the air transportation occurs and defers a portion of the ticket sale representing the value of the related miles as a multiple-deliverable revenue arrangement. the company determines the estimated selling price of air transportation and miles as if each element is sold on a separate basis. the total consideration from each ticket sale is then allocated to each of these elements, individually, on a pro rata basis. the miles are recorded in frequent flyer deferred revenue on the companys consolidated balance sheet and recognized into revenue when the transportation is provided.
the companys estimated selling price of miles is based on an equivalent ticket value less fulfillment discount, which incorporates the expected redemption of miles, as the best estimate of selling price for these miles. the equivalent ticket value is based on the prior 12 months weighted average equivalent ticket value of similar fares as those used to settle award redemptions while taking into consideration such factors as redemption pattern, cabin class, loyalty status and geographic region. the estimated selling price of miles is adjusted by a fulfillment discount that considers a number of factors, including redemption patterns of various customer groups.
united has a significant contract to sell mileageplus miles to its co-branded credit card partner, chase. united identified the following significant revenue elements in its second amended and restated co-branded card marketing services agreement (the co-brand agreement): the air transportation element represented by the value of the mile (generally resulting from its redemption for future air transportation and whose fair value is described above); use of the united brand and access to mileageplus member lists; advertising; and other travel related benefits.
the fair value of the elements is determined using managements estimated selling price of each element. the objective of using the estimated selling price based methodology is to determine the price at which we would transact a sale if the product or service were sold on a stand-alone basis. accordingly, we determine our best estimate of selling price by considering multiple inputs and methods including, but not limited to, discounted cash flows, brand value, volume discounts, published selling prices, number of miles awarded and number of miles redeemed. the company estimated the selling prices and volumes over the term of the co-brand agreement in order to determine the allocation of proceeds to each of the multiple elements to be delivered. we also evaluate volumes on an annual basis, which may result in a change in the allocation of estimated selling price on a prospective basis.
the company records passenger revenue related to the air transportation element when the transportation is delivered. the other elements are generally recognized as other operating revenue when earned.
the company accounts for miles sold and awarded that will never be redeemed by program members, which we refer to as breakage. the company reviews its breakage estimates annually based upon the latest available information regarding redemption and expiration patterns. miles expire after 18 months of member account inactivity. the companys estimate of the expected expiration of miles requires significant management judgment. current and future changes to expiration assumptions or to the expiration policy, or to program rules and program redemption opportunities, may result in material changes to the deferred revenue balance as well as recognized revenues from the programs.
the following table summarizes information related to the companys frequent flyer deferred revenue liability:
% of miles earned expected to expire                                                                                16%
impact of 1% change in outstanding miles or weighted average ticket value on deferred revenue (in millions)         $54
long-lived assets. the net book value of operating property and equipment for the company was $23 billion and $22 billion at december 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. the assets recorded value is impacted by a number of accounting policy elections, including the estimation of useful lives and residual values and, when necessary, the recognition of asset impairment charges.
the company records assets acquired, including aircraft, at acquisition cost. depreciable life is determined through economic analysis, such as reviewing existing fleet plans, obtaining appraisals and comparing estimated lives to other airlines that operate similar fleets. as aircraft technology has improved, useful life has increased and the company has generally estimated the lives of those aircraft to be 30 years. residual values are estimated based on historical experience with regard to the sale of both aircraft and spare parts and are established in conjunction with the estimated useful lives of the related fleets. residual values are based on when the aircraft are acquired and typically reflect asset values that have not reached the end of their physical life. both depreciable lives and residual values are revised periodically as facts and circumstances arise to recognize changes in the companys fleet plan and other relevant information. a one-year increase in the average depreciable life of the companys flight equipment would reduce annual depreciation expense on flight equipment by approximately $57 million.
the company evaluates the carrying value of long-lived assets and intangible assets subject to amortization whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that an impairment may exist. for purposes of this testing, the company has generally identified the aircraft fleet type as the lowest level of identifiable cash flows for purposes of testing aircraft for impairment. an impairment charge is recognized when the assets carrying value exceeds its net undiscounted future cash flows and its fair market value. the amount of the charge is the difference between the assets carrying value and fair market value.
in 2016, the company determined that the faas action impaired the entire value of its newark slots because the slots no longer were the mechanism that governed take-off and landing rights, and the company recorded a special charge to write off the intangible asset. see notes 16 to the financial statements included in part ii, item 8 of this report for additional information.
defined benefit plan accounting. we sponsor defined benefit pension plans for eligible employees and retirees. the most critical assumptions impacting our defined benefit pension plan obligations and expenses are the weighted average discount rate and the expected long-term rate of return on the plan assets.
uniteds pension plans under-funded status was $1.9 billion at december 31, 2016. funding requirements for tax-qualified defined benefit pension plans are determined by government regulations. in 2017, we anticipate contributing at least $400 million to our pension plans. the fair value of the plans assets was $3.4 billion at december 31, 2016.
when calculating pension expense for 2017, the company assumed that its plans assets would generate a long-term rate of return of approximately 7.0%. the expected long-term rate of return assumption was developed based on historical experience and input from the trustee managing the plans assets. the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets is based on a target allocation of assets, which is based on a goal of earning the highest rate of return while maintaining risk at acceptable levels. our projected long-term rate of return reflects the active management of our plans assets. the plans strive to have assets sufficiently diversified so that adverse or unexpected results from one security class will not have an unduly detrimental impact on the entire portfolio. plan fiduciaries regularly review actual asset allocation and the pension plans investments are periodically rebalanced to the targeted allocation when considered appropriate.
the defined benefit pension plans assets consist of return generating investments and risk mitigating investments which are held through direct ownership or through interests in common collective trusts. return generating investments include primarily equity securities, fixed-income securities and alternative investments (e.g. private equity and hedge funds). risk mitigating investments include primarily u.s. government and investment grade corporate fixed-income securities. the allocation of assets was as follows at december 31, 2016:
percent of total      expected long-term rate of return equity securities                        35 %                   9.5 %
pension expense increases as the expected rate of return on plan assets decreases. lowering the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets by 50 basis points (from 7.0% to 6.5%) would increase estimated 2017 pension expense by approximately $17 million. future pension obligations for uniteds plans were discounted using a weighted average rate of 4.18% at december 31, 2016. the company selected the discount rate for substantially all of its plans by using a hypothetical portfolio of high quality bonds at december 31, 2016 that would provide the necessary cash flows to match the projected benefit payments. the pension liability and future pension expense both increase as the discount rate is reduced. lowering the discount rate by 50 basis points (from 4.18% to 3.68%) would increase the pension liability at december 31, 2016 by approximately $575 million and increase the estimated 2017 pension expense by approximately $73 million. future changes in plan asset returns, plan provisions, assumed discount rates, pension funding law and various other factors related to the participants in our pension plans will impact our future pension expense and liabilities. we cannot predict with certainty what these factors will be in the future.
actuarial gains or losses are triggered by changes in assumptions or experience that differ from the original assumptions. under the applicable accounting standards for defined benefit pension plans, those gains and losses are not required to be recognized currently as pension benefit expense, but instead may be deferred as part of accumulated other comprehensive income and amortized into expense over the average remaining service life of the covered active employees. all gains and losses in accumulated other comprehensive income are amortized to expense over the remaining years of service of the covered active employees. at december 31, 2016 and 2015, the company had unrecognized actuarial losses for pension benefit plans of $1.5 billion and $844 million, respectively, recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income.
other postretirement benefit plan accounting. uniteds postretirement plan provides certain health care benefits, primarily in the united states, to retirees and eligible dependents, as well as certain life insurance benefits to certain retirees reflected as other benefits. united also has retiree medical programs that permit retirees who meet certain age and service requirements to continue medical coverage between retirement and medicare eligibility. eligible employees are required to pay a portion of the costs of their retiree medical benefits, which in some cases may be offset by accumulated unused sick time at the time of their retirement. plan benefits are subject to co-payments, deductibles and other limits as described in the plans.
the company accounts for other postretirement benefits by recognizing the difference between plan assets and obligations, or the plans funded status, in its financial statements. other postretirement benefit expense is recognized on an accrual basis over employees approximate service periods and is generally calculated independently of funding decisions or requirements. united has not been required to pre-fund its plan obligations, which has resulted in a significant net obligation, as discussed below. the companys benefit obligation was $1.7 billion and $2.0 billion for the other postretirement benefit plans at december 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
the calculation of other postretirement benefit expense and obligations requires the use of a number of assumptions, including the assumed discount rate for measuring future payment obligations and the health care cost trend rate. the company determines the appropriate discount rate for each of the plans based on current rates on high quality corporate bonds that would generate the cash flow necessary to pay plan benefits when due. the companys weighted average discount rate to determine its benefit obligations as of december 31, 2016 was 4.07%, as compared to 4.49% for december 31, 2015. the health care cost trend rate assumed for 2016 was 6.75%, declining to 5.0% in 2023, as compared to assumed trend rate for 2017 of 6.50%, declining to 5.0% in 2023. a 1% increase in assumed health care trend rates would increase the companys total service and interest cost for the year ended december 31, 2016 by $13 million; whereas, a 1% decrease in assumed health care trend rates would decrease the companys total service and interest cost for the year ended december 31, 2016 by $11 million. a one percentage point decrease in the weighted average discount rate would increase the companys postretirement benefit liability by approximately $181 million and increase the estimated 2016 benefits expense by approximately $11 million.
actuarial gains or losses are triggered by changes in assumptions or experience that differ from the original assumptions and prior service credits result from a retroactive reduction in benefits due under the plans. under the applicable accounting standards for postretirement welfare benefit plans, actuarial gains and losses and prior service credits are not required to be recognized currently, but instead may be deferred as part of accumulated other comprehensive income and amortized into expense over the average remaining service life of the covered active employees or the average life expectancy of inactive participants. at december 31, 2016 and 2015, the company had unrecognized actuarial gains for postretirement welfare benefit plans of $384 million and $236 million, respectively, recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income.
income taxes. the company has a net deferred tax asset totaling $655 million as of december 31, 2016, including $1.6 billion of federal and state nol carryforwards and $108 million of alternative minimum tax credit carryforwards, net of a $8 million valuation allowance, which do not expire. the federal nol carryforwards will expire beginning in 2026 if unused. in addition, the majority of tax benefits of the state net operating losses of $56 million, net of a $36 million valuation allowance, will expire over a five to 20-year period. at the end of 2016, the company maintained a valuation allowance of $68 million against certain state and local nols and credit carryforwards which will expire unused due to limited carryforward periods.
the company periodically assesses whether it is more likely than not that it will generate sufficient taxable income to realize its deferred income tax assets. the company establishes valuation allowances if it is not likely it will realize its deferred income tax assets. in making this determination, the company considers all available positive and negative evidence and makes certain assumptions. the company considers, among other things, projected future taxable income, scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities, the overall business environment, the companys historical financial results and tax planning strategies. in evaluating the likelihood of utilizing the companys net deferred income tax assets, the significant factors that the company considers include (1) the companys recent history and forecasted profitability; (2) growth in the u.s. and global economies; and (3) future impact of taxable temporary differences. during 2015, after considering all positive and negative evidence and the four sources of taxable income, the company concluded that its deferred income tax assets were more likely than not to be realized. therefore, the company released almost all of its valuation allowance in 2015, resulting in a $3.1 billion benefit in its provision for income taxes.

item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this filing. the discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties, including those set forth under part i, item 1a."risk factors" of this form 10-k.
executive overview general we are a diversified, multi-national healthcare enterprise that provides services to government sponsored healthcare programs, focusing on under-insured and uninsured individuals. we provide member-focused services through locally based staff by assisting in accessing care, coordinating referrals to related health and social services and addressing member concerns and questions.
results of operations depend on our ability to manage expenses associated with health benefits (including estimated costs incurred) and sg&a costs. we measure operating performance based upon two key ratios. the hbr represents medical costs as a percentage of premium revenues, excluding premium tax and health insurer fee revenues that are not separately billed, and reflects the direct relationship between the premium received and the medical services provided. the sg&a expense ratio represents sg&a costs as a percentage of premium and service revenues, again excluding premium tax and health insurer fee revenues that are not separately billed.
health net acquisition on march 24, 2016, the company acquired all of the issued and outstanding shares of health net, a publicly traded managed care organization that delivers healthcare services through health plans and government-sponsored managed care plans. the transaction was valued at approximately $5,990 million, including the assumption of $703 million of outstanding debt. the acquisition allows the company to offer a more comprehensive and scalable portfolio of solutions and provides opportunity for additional growth across the combined company's markets. 2016 was a transformative year with the acquisition of health net. due to the size of this acquisition, the primary driver of the year over year variances discussed throughout this section are related to the acquisition of health net.
regulatory trends and uncertainties the new u.s. presidential administration and certain members of congress have affirmatively indicated that they will pursue full repeal of or significant amendment to the aca. even if the aca is not amended or repealed, the new administration could propose changes impacting implementation of the aca. the ultimate content and timing of any legislation enacted under the new administration that would impact the current implementation of the aca remains uncertain. however, we believe we have both the capacity and capability to successfully navigate industry changes to the benefit of our members, customers and shareholders.
for additional information regarding regulatory trends and uncertainties, see part i, item 1 "business - regulation" and item 1a, "risk factors."

total revenues total revenues increased 78% in the year ended december 31, 2016, over the corresponding period in 2015, primarily as a result of the acquisition of health net, growth in the health insurance marketplace business, and the impact from expansions, acquisitions or new programs in many of our states in 2016 and 2015. during the year ended december 31, 2016, we received medicaid premium rate adjustments which yielded a net 1% composite change across all of our markets.
operating expenses medical costs the hbr for the year ended december 31, 2016 was 86.5%, a decrease of 240 basis points over the comparable period in 2015. the decrease compared to last year is primarily attributable to the acquisition of health net, membership growth in medicaid expansion and health insurance marketplace products, and improvement in hbr in the higher acuity populations. also, in the fourth quarter, we recognized additional revenue relating to the retroactive contract amendment that changed the minimum mlr calculation under california's medicaid expansion program, which reduced our 2016 hbr by 50 basis points.
cost of services cost of services increased by $243 million in the year ended december 31, 2016, compared to the corresponding period in 2015. this was primarily due to the acquisition of health net and growth in our correctional business, partially offset by lower pharmacy costs to external customers. the cost of service ratio for the year ended december 31, 2016 was 85.5%, compared to 86.4% in 2015. the decrease is primarily due to the acquisition of health net, which operates at a lower cost of service ratio.
selling, general and administrative expenses sg&a increased by $1,874 million in the year ended december 31, 2016, compared to the corresponding period in 2015.  this was primarily due to the acquisition of health net, acquisition related expenses, restructuring and integration costs, and the impact from expansions, acquisitions, or new programs in many of our states in 2016 and 2015. during the year ended december 31, 2016, we recorded approximately $234 million of health net acquisition related expenses, which reduced our diluted earnings per share by $0.98. during the year ended december 31, 2015, we recorded approximately $27 million of health net acquisition related expenses, which reduced our diluted earnings per share by $0.14. we also recorded expense of $50 million in 2016 for contribution commitments to our charitable foundation.
the consolidated sg&a expense ratio was 9.8% for the year ended december 31, 2016 compared to 8.5% for the year ended december 31, 2015. the consolidated sg&a expense ratio excluding health net acquisition related expenses was 9.2% for the year ended december 31, 2016 compared to 8.3% for the year ended december 31, 2015. the increase in the sg&a expense ratio is primarily attributable to the addition of the health net business, which operates at a higher sg&a expense ratio due to a higher mix of commercial and medicare business.
the following table summarizes the components of other income (expense) for the year ended december 31, ($ in millions):
the increase in investment income in 2016 reflects an increase in investment balances over 2015, primarily due to the acquisition of health net. interest expense increased during the year ended december 31, 2016 by $174 million primarily reflecting the issuance of an additional $2,400 million in senior notes in february 2016 in connection with the financing of the health net transaction. interest expense also increased due to the issuance of an additional $500 million in senior notes in june 2016, the assumption of health net's $400 million in senior notes, and the issuance of the $1,200 million in senior notes in november 2016. these increases were partially offset by the redemption of the centene $425 million 5.75% senior notes and the health net $400 million 6.375% senior notes in november 2016 and december 2016, respectively. in addition, the company incurred $11 million associated with the early redemption of the centene 5.75% senior notes due 2017 and the health net 6.375% senior notes due 2017, which was recorded in interest expense.
income tax expense our effective tax rate for the year ended december 31, 2016 was 51.8% compared to 48.6% in 2015. the effective tax rate is higher than the applicable statutory rate primarily as a result of the non-deductibility of the hif, limitations on the deductibility of compensation, and the non-deductibility of certain acquisition related costs incurred in connection with the acquisition of health net.

managed care total revenues increased 83% in the year ended december 31, 2016, compared to the year ended december 31, 2015, primarily as a result of the acquisition of health net and expansions or new programs in many of our states, particularly california, florida, georgia, indiana, louisiana, mississippi, oregon, texas, and washington. earnings from operations increased $557 million between years primarily reflecting the acquisition of health net and product and geographical expansions in many of our states.
specialty services total revenues increased 28% in the year ended december 31, 2016, compared to the year ended december 31, 2015, resulting primarily from the acquisition of health net, growth in our behavioral health and correctional services businesses, and increased services associated with membership growth in the managed care segment. earnings from operations decreased $2 million in the year ended december 31, 2016, compared to the year ended december 31, 2015, primarily due to lower earnings in our specialty pharmacy, home health, and behavioral health businesses as well as increased utilization in several specialty services businesses, partially offset by an increase in earnings related to our pharmacy benefits management and correctional services businesses, and the health net acquisition.
total revenues total revenues increased 37% in the year ended december 31, 2015, over the corresponding period in 2014, primarily as a result of the impact from expansions or new programs in many of our states, particularly florida, illinois, indiana, louisiana, mississippi, ohio and texas. during the year ended december 31, 2015, we received medicaid premium rate adjustments which yielded a net 1% composite change across all of our markets.
operating expenses medical costs the consolidated hbr for the year ended december 31, 2015 of 88.9% was a decrease of 40 basis points over the comparable period in 2014. the decrease compared to the previous year is primarily attributable to improvement in medical expense in the high acuity populations (ltc/mmp) and membership growth in medicaid expansion programs and health insurance marketplace, which operate at a lower hbr than traditional medicaid businesses.
cost of services cost of services increased by $341 million in the year ended december 31, 2015, compared to the corresponding period in 2014. this was primarily due to growth in the acariahealth business. the cost of service ratio for the year ended december 31, 2015, was 86.4% compared to 87.1% in 2014.
selling, general and administrative expenses sg&a increased by $504 million in the year ended december 31, 2015, compared to the corresponding period in 2014. this was primarily due to expenses for additional staff and facilities to support our membership growth. during the year ended december 31, 2015, we recorded approximately $27 million of health net acquisition related expenses, which reduced our diluted earnings per share by $0.14.
during the first quarter of 2015, we recorded a gain of $10 million on the settlement of contingent consideration related to the community health solutions (chs) transaction. we also recorded expense of $10 million for a contribution to our charitable foundation during the first quarter of 2015.
also during 2015, we experienced higher than anticipated opt-out rates and member attrition in the new michigan dual demonstration program, resulting in lower than expected membership and lower blended premium rates. as a result, the fair value of estimated contingent consideration was reduced from $50 million to $16 million, and we recorded a gain of $34 million in sg&a. in connection with the lower membership and revenue outlook, we conducted an impairment analysis of the identifiable intangible assets and goodwill, resulting in a reduction of goodwill and intangible assets of $38 million which was recorded in sg&a. the company's initial allocation of fair value resulted in goodwill and intangible assets of $52 million. at december 31, 2015, the company had goodwill of $11 million and other identifiable intangible assets of $1 million, net of $2 million of amortization, remaining on the balance sheet.
the consolidated sg&a expense ratio for the years ended december 31, 2015 and 2014 was 8.5% and 8.3%, respectively. the sg&a ratio for the year ended december 31, 2015 was 8.3% excluding the impact of the health net acquisition related expenses. the increase over the prior year is primarily related to the expansion of our health insurance marketplace business which operates at a higher sg&a ratio and incurred higher open enrollment costs in the fourth quarter of 2015.
the following table summarizes the components of other income (expense) for the year ended december 31, ($ in millions):
the increase in investment income in 2015 reflects an increase in investment balances over 2014 and improved performance of certain equity investments. interest expense increased during the year ended december 31, 2015 by $8 million primarily reflecting the issuance of $300 million of senior notes in april 2014 and the issuance of an additional $200 million in senior notes in january 2015.
income tax expense our effective tax rate for the year ended december 31, 2015 was 48.6%, compared to 42.9% in 2014. the effective tax rate is higher than the applicable statutory rate primarily as a result of the non-deductibility of the health insurer fee expense.

managed care total revenues increased 39% in the year ended december 31, 2015, primarily as a result of expansions or new programs in many of our states, particularly florida, illinois, indiana, louisiana, mississippi, ohio and texas. earnings from operations increased $160 million between years primarily reflecting growth in the business.
specialty services total revenues increased 47% in the year ended december 31, 2015, resulting primarily from increased services associated with membership growth in the managed care segment and growth in our pharmacy businesses. earnings from operations increased $81 million in the year ended december 31, 2015, primarily reflecting growth in the specialty services provided to our increased managed care membership.
liquidity and capital resources shown below is a condensed schedule of cash flows for the years ended december 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, used in the discussion of liquidity and capital resources ($ in millions).
net cash provided by operating activities                         $1,851                $658                $1,223
effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents          (1    )              -                    (1    )
cash flows provided by operating activities normal operations are funded primarily through operating cash flows and borrowings under our revolving credit facility.  cash flows from operating activities for 2016 were $1,851 million, or 3.3 times net earnings, compared to $658 million in 2015. the cash provided by operations in 2016 was primarily due to net earnings, an increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses and medical claims liabilities, and a decrease in other assets and premium and related receivables. additionally, cash provided by operations was increased by approximately $445 million in the fourth quarter due to the finalization of the opening balance sheet and respective cash flows for the eight day period from the march 24, 2016 acquisition date to march 31, 2016.
cash flows from operating activities for 2015 decreased to $658 million, compared to $1,223 million in 2014. the cash provided by operations in 2015 and 2014 was primarily related to net earnings and an increase in medical claims liabilities resulting from growth in the business, partially offset by increases in premium and related receivables.
cash flows from operations in each year were impacted by the timing of payments we received from our states. states may prepay the following month premium payment, which we record as unearned revenue, or they may delay our premium payment, which we record as a receivable. we typically receive capitation payments monthly; however, the states in which we operate may decide to adjust their payment schedules which could positively or negatively impact our reported cash flows from operating activities in any given period. specifically, at december 31, 2016, the state of illinois was behind in processing capitation for several months. we continue to monitor the receivable balance and work with the state on the timing of payments.
the reimbursement of the hif from our state customers may be settled as a separate payment or monthly in combination with our other premium payments. the vast majority of our state customers are settling the reimbursement through a separate payment after verification of each state's portion of our hif, resulting in an increase in premium and related receivables at december 31, 2016. during 2016, we paid the 2016 annual hif totaling $513 million. this negatively impacted our cash flows as we have not been reimbursed from many of our state customers. similarly, during 2015, we paid the 2015 annual hif invoice totaling $220 million. the table below details the impact to cash flows from operations from the timing of payments from our states ($ in millions).
net increase (decrease) in operating cash flow              $117             $(387     )         $(334     )
cash flows used in investing activities investing activities used cash of $2,397 million for the year ended december 31, 2016, and $813 million in the comparable period in 2015. cash flows used in investing activities in 2016 primarily consisted of our acquisition of health net, net additions to the investment portfolio of our regulated subsidiaries, including transfers from cash and cash equivalents to long term investments and capital expenditures.
in march 2016, we acquired health net for approximately $5,990 million, including the assumption of $703 million of debt. the total consideration for the acquisition was $5,287 million, consisting of centene common shares valued at $3,038 million, $2,247 million in cash, and $2 million related to the fair value adjustment to stock based compensation associated with pre-combination service.
we spent $306 million and $150 million in the year ended december 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, on capital expenditures for system enhancements and market expansions.
as of december 31, 2016, our investment portfolio consisted primarily of fixed-income securities with a weighted average duration of 3.2 years. we had unregulated cash and investments of $264 million at december 31, 2016, compared to $78 million at december 31, 2015. unregulated cash and investments include cost and equity method investments and company owned life insurance contracts.
cash flows used in investing activities in 2015 primarily consisted of additions to the investment portfolio of our regulated subsidiaries, including transfers from cash and cash equivalents to long term investments and capital expenditures.
cash flows used in investing activities in 2014 primarily consisted of additions to the investment portfolio of our regulated subsidiaries, including transfers from cash and cash equivalents to long term investments, the acquisition of u.s. medical management and chs, an equity investment in ribera salud and capital expenditures. we completed the acquisition of u.s. medical management for $213 million in total consideration. the transaction was financed through a combination of centene common stock as well as $80 million of cash. we also completed a transaction with chs for initial cash consideration of $56 million as well as common stock. additionally, we purchased a noncontrolling interest in ribera salud, s.a. (ribera salud), a spanish health management group for $17 million.
cash flows provided by financing activities our financing activities provided cash of $2,717 million, $305 million and $198 million in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. financing activities in 2016, 2015 and 2014 are discussed below.
during 2016, our financing activities primarily related to the proceeds from the issuance of senior notes in february 2016 associated with the health net acquisition, the issuance of additional senior notes in june 2016 and november 2016, partially offset by the redemption of our 5.75% senior notes due 2017, the redemption of our 6.375% senior notes due 2017, and the repayment of amounts outstanding under our revolving credit facility.
in february 2016, our wholly owned unrestricted subsidiary (escrow issuer) issued $1,400 million of 5.625% senior notes ($1,400 million notes) at par due 2021 and $1,000 million of 6.125% senior notes ($1,000 million notes) at par due 2024. we used the net proceeds of the offering, together with borrowings under the our new $1,000 million revolving credit facility and cash on hand, to fund the cash consideration for the health net acquisition and to pay acquisition and offering related fees and expenses. in connection with the february 2016 issuance, we entered into interest rate swap agreements for notional amounts of $600 million and $1,000 million, at floating rates of interest based on the three month libor plus 4.22% and the three month libor plus 4.44%, respectively. gains and losses due to changes in the fair value of the interest rate swaps completely offset changes in the fair value of the hedged portion of the underlying debt and are recorded as an adjustment to the $1,400 million notes and $1,000 million notes.
in connection with the closing of the health net acquisition on march 24, 2016, our then-existing unsecured $500 million revolving credit facility was terminated and simultaneously replaced with a new $1,000 million unsecured revolving credit facility (revolving credit facility). borrowings under the agreement bear interest based upon libor rates, the federal funds rate or the prime rate. the agreement has a maturity date of march 24, 2021.
in june 2016, we issued an additional $500 million of 4.75% senior notes due 2022 at a premium to yield 4.41% ($500 million add-on notes). the $500 million add-on notes were offered as additional debt securities under the indenture governing the $500 million of 4.75% senior notes issued april 2014. we used the net proceeds of the offering to repay amounts outstanding under our revolving credit facility and to pay offering related fees and expenses.
in november 2016, we issued an additional $1,200 million of 4.75% senior notes due 2025. we used the net proceeds to redeem our $425 million of 5.75% senior notes due 2017 and health net's $400 million of 6.375% senior notes due 2017, to repay amounts outstanding under our revolving credit facility, to pay related fees and expenses and for general purposes.
during 2015, our financing activities primarily related to the proceeds from the issuance of senior debt and an additional $150 million of borrowings on our revolving credit facility. in january 2015, we issued an additional $200 million of 4.75% senior notes due may 15, 2022 at par (add on notes). in connection with the january 2015 issuance, we entered into interest rate swap agreements for a notional amount of $200 million (2015 swap agreements) that are scheduled to expire on may 15, 2022. under the 2015 swap agreements, we receive a fixed rate of 4.75% and pay a variable rate of libor plus a spread adjusted quarterly, which allows us to adjust the $200 million notes to a floating rate. we do not hold or issue any derivative instrument for trading or speculative purposes.
in april 2014, pursuant to a shelf registration statement, we issued $300 million 4.75% senior notes due may 15, 2022 at par. interest is paid semi-annually in may and november. in connection with the issuance, we entered into $300 million notional amount of interest rate swap agreements (2014 swap agreements) that are scheduled to expire may 15, 2022. under the 2014 swap agreements, we receive a fixed rate of 4.75% and pay a variable rate of libor plus a spread adjusted quarterly, which allows us to adjust the $300 million notes to a floating rate. we do not hold or issue any derivative instrument for trading or speculative purposes.
liquidity metrics the credit agreement underlying our revolving credit facility contains non-financial and financial covenants, including requirements of minimum fixed charge coverage ratios and maximum debt-to-ebitda ratios. we are required to not exceed a maximum debt-to-ebitda ratio of 3.5 to 1.0 prior to december 31, 2016, and 3.0 to 1.0 on and subsequent to december 31, 2016. as of december 31, 2016, we had $100 million in borrowings outstanding under our revolving credit facility, and we were in compliance with all covenants. as of december 31, 2016, there were no limitations on the availability under the revolving credit agreement as a result of the debt-to-ebitda ratio.
we had outstanding letters of credit of $71 million as of december 31, 2016, which were not part of our revolving credit facility. we also had letters of credit for $45 million (valued at the december 31, 2016 conversion rate), or €42 million, representing our proportional share of the letters of credit issued to support ribera salud's outstanding debt which are a part of the revolving credit facility. collectively, the letters of credit bore weighted interest of 1.42% as of december 31, 2016. in addition, we had outstanding surety bonds of $365 million as of december 31, 2016.
the indentures governing our various maturities of senior notes contain non-financial and financial covenants of centene corporation, including requirements of a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio. as of december 31, 2016, we were in compliance with all covenants.
at december 31, 2016, we had working capital, defined as current assets less current liabilities, of a negative $258 million, compared to a negative $24 million at december 31, 2015. we manage our short term and long term investments with the goal of ensuring that a sufficient portion is held in investments that are highly liquid and can be sold to fund short term requirements as needed.
at december 31, 2016, our debt to capital ratio, defined as total debt divided by the sum of total debt and total equity, was 44.1%, compared to 36.0% at december 31, 2015. excluding the $64 million non-recourse mortgage note, our debt to capital ratio was 43.7% as of december 31, 2016, compared to 34.7% at december 31, 2015.  the increase in the ratio over the prior year is due to the financing associated with the health net acquisition. we utilize the debt to capital ratio as a measure, among others, of our leverage and financial flexibility.
we have a stock repurchase program authorizing us to repurchase up to 8 million shares of common stock from time to time on the open market or through privately negotiated transactions. we have 3 million available shares remaining under the program for repurchases as of december 31, 2016. no duration has been placed on the repurchase program. we reserve the right to discontinue the repurchase program at any time. we did not make any repurchases under this plan during 2016, 2015 or 2014.
during the year ended december 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, we received dividends of $121 million, $11 million, and $50 million, respectively, from our regulated subsidiaries.
2017 expectations during 2017, we expect to make net capital contributions to our insurance subsidiaries of approximately $250 million associated with our growth and spend approximately $520 million in additional capital expenditures primarily associated with system integration and enhancements and market expansions. these amounts are expected to be funded by unregulated cash flow generation in 2017 and borrowings on our revolving credit facility. however, from time to time we may elect to raise additional funds for these and other purposes, either through issuance of debt or equity, the sale of investment securities or otherwise, as appropriate. in addition, we may strategically pursue refinancing opportunities to extend maturities and/or improve terms of our indebtedness if we believe such opportunities are favorable to us.
based on our operating plan, we expect that our available cash, cash equivalents and investments, cash from our operations and cash available under our credit facility will be sufficient to finance our general operations and capital expenditures for at least 12 months from the date of this filing.
contractual obligations the following table summarizes future contractual obligations. these obligations contain estimates and are subject to revision under a number of circumstances. our debt consists of borrowings from our senior notes, revolving credit facility, mortgages and capital leases. the purchase obligations consist primarily of software purchases and maintenance contracts. the contractual obligations and estimated period of payment over the next five years and beyond are as follows ($ in millions):
operating lease obligations             631                     133                     221                  165        112
(1) our consolidated balance sheet as of december 31, 2016, includes $869 million of other long term liabilities. this consists primarily of long term deferred income taxes, liabilities under our deferred compensation plan, reserves for uncertain tax positions and retirement benefit obligations. these liabilities have been excluded from the table above as the timing and/or amount of any cash payment is uncertain.
commitments in addition, in connection with obtaining regulatory approval of the health net acquisition from the california department of insurance and the california department of managed health care, we committed to certain undertakings (the undertakings). the undertakings included, among other items, operational commitments around premiums, dividend restrictions, minimum risk based capital (rbc) levels, local offices, growth, accreditation, hedis scores and other quality measures, network adequacy, certifications, investments and capital expenditures. specifically, we agreed to, among other things:
•   invest an additional $30 million through the california organized investment network over the five years following completion of the acquisition;
•   build a service center in an economically distressed community in california, investing $200 million over 10 years and employing at least 300 people;
•   contribute $65 million to improve enrollee health outcomes ($10 million over 10 years), support locally-based consumer assistance programs ($5 million over five years) and strengthen the health care delivery system ($50 million over five years), (of which, the present value of $61 million was expensed in the year ended december 31, 2016 and classified as sg&amp;a expenses in the consolidated statements of operations); and
•   invest $75 million of its investment portfolio in vehicles supporting california's health care infrastructure.
the undertakings require significant investments by us, may restrict or impose additional material costs on our future obligations and strategic initiatives in certain geographies, and subject us to various enforcement mechanisms.
regulatory capital and dividend restrictions our operations are conducted through our subsidiaries. as managed care organizations, most of our subsidiaries are subject to state regulations and other requirements that, among other things, require the maintenance of minimum levels of statutory capital, as defined by each state, and restrict the timing, payment and amount of dividends and other distributions that may be paid to us. generally, the amount of dividend distributions that may be paid by a regulated subsidiary without prior approval by state regulatory authorities is limited based on the entity's level of statutory net income and statutory capital and surplus.
our regulated subsidiaries are required to maintain minimum capital requirements prescribed by various regulatory authorities in each of the states in which we operate. as of december 31, 2016, our subsidiaries had aggregate statutory capital and surplus of $4,529 million, compared with the required minimum aggregate statutory capital and surplus requirements of $2,259 million. during the year ended december 31, 2016, we contributed $467 million of net statutory capital to our subsidiaries. for our subsidiaries that file with the national association of insurance commissioners (naic), we estimate our rbc percentage (including kentucky spirit) to be in excess of 350% of the authorized control level (excluding the interim impact of the health insurance fee).
under the california knox-keene health care service plan act of 1975, as amended ("knox-keene"), certain of our california subsidiaries must comply with tangible net equity (tne) requirements. under these knox-keene tne requirements, actual net worth less unsecured receivables and intangible assets must be more than the greater of (i) a fixed minimum amount, (ii) a minimum amount based on premiums or (iii) a minimum amount based on health care expenditures, excluding capitated amounts. in addition, certain of our california subsidiaries have made certain undertakings to the dmhc to restrict dividends and loans to affiliates, to the extent that the payment of such would reduce such entities' tne below the required amount as specified in the undertaking.
the naic has adopted rules which set minimum risk-based capital requirements for insurance companies, managed care organizations and other entities bearing risk for healthcare coverage. as of december 31, 2016, each of our health plans was in compliance with the risk-based capital requirements enacted in those states.
as a result of the above requirements and other regulatory requirements, certain of our subsidiaries are subject to restrictions on their ability to make dividend payments, loans or other transfers of cash to their parent companies. such restrictions, unless amended or waived or unless regulatory approval is granted, limit the use of any cash generated by these subsidiaries to pay our obligations. the maximum amount of dividends that can be paid by our insurance company subsidiaries without prior approval of the applicable state insurance departments is subject to restrictions relating to statutory surplus, statutory income and unassigned surplus. as of december 31, 2016, the amount of capital and surplus or net worth that was unavailable for the payment of dividends or return of capital to us was $2,259 million in the aggregate.
recent accounting pronouncements for this information, refer to note 2, summary of significant accounting policies, in the notes to the consolidated financial statements, included herein.
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our results of operations and liquidity and capital resources are based on our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with gaap. our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note 2, summary of significant accounting policies, to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere herein. our accounting policies regarding medical claims liability and intangible assets are particularly important to the portrayal of our financial position and results of operations and require the application of significant judgment by our management. as a result, they are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty. we have reviewed these critical accounting policies and related disclosures with the audit committee of our board of directors.
goodwill and intangible assets we have made several acquisitions that have resulted in our recording of intangible assets. these intangible assets primarily consist of customer relationships, purchased contract rights, provider contracts, trade names and goodwill. we allocate the fair value of purchase consideration to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their fair values at the acquisition date. the excess of the fair value of consideration transferred over the fair value of the net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. goodwill is generally attributable to the value of the synergies between the combined companies and the value of the acquired assembled workforce, neither of which qualifies for recognition as an intangible asset. at december 31, 2016, we had $4,712 million of goodwill and $1,545 million of other intangible assets.
intangible asset            amortization period purchased contract rights          5 - 15 years provider contracts                 4 - 15 years customer relationships             3 - 15 years trade names                        1 - 20 years developed technology                    5 years our management evaluates whether events or circumstances have occurred that may affect the estimated useful life or the recoverability of the remaining balance of goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets. if the events or circumstances indicate that the remaining balance of the intangible asset or goodwill may be impaired, the potential impairment will be measured based upon the difference between the carrying amount of the intangible asset or goodwill and the fair value of such asset. our management must make assumptions and estimates, such as the discount factor, future utility and other internal and external factors, in determining the estimated fair values. while we believe these assumptions and estimates are appropriate, other assumptions and estimates could be applied and might produce significantly different results.
goodwill is reviewed annually during the fourth quarter for impairment. in addition, an impairment analysis of intangible assets would be performed based on other factors. these factors include significant changes in membership, state funding, medical contracts and provider networks and contracts.
we first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform the two-step quantitative goodwill impairment test. we generally do not calculate the fair value of a reporting unit unless we determine, based on a qualitative assessment, that it is more likely than not that its fair value is less than its carrying amount. however, in certain circumstances, such as recent acquisitions, we may elect to perform a quantitative assessment without first assessing qualitative factors. the fair value of all reporting units with material amounts of goodwill was substantially in excess of the carrying value as of our annual impairment testing date, with the exception of reporting units that were recently acquired without excess fair value on the acquisition date and our home health business, which maintains $267 million of goodwill. during 2016, events and circumstances led to unfavorable results in the home health business, which indicated that the goodwill might be impaired. we completed a quantitative analysis, and the estimate of future undiscounted cash flows indicated that such carrying amounts were expected to be recovered. to the extent the undiscounted cash flows are not sufficient in future periods, the reporting unit could be at risk for impairment.
medical claims liability our medical claims liability includes claims reported but not yet paid, or inventory, estimates for claims incurred but not reported, or ibnr, and estimates for the costs necessary to process unpaid claims at the end of each period. we estimate our medical claims liability using actuarial methods that are commonly used by health insurance actuaries and meet actuarial standards of practice. these actuarial methods consider factors such as historical data for payment patterns, cost trends, product mix, seasonality, utilization of healthcare services and other relevant factors.
actuarial standards of practice generally require that the medical claims liability estimates be adequate to cover obligations under moderately adverse conditions. moderately adverse conditions are situations in which the actual claims are expected to be higher than the otherwise estimated value of such claims at the time of estimate. in many situations, the claims amounts ultimately settled will be different than the estimate that satisfies the actuarial standards of practice. we include in our ibnr an estimate for medical claims liability under moderately adverse conditions which represents the risk of adverse deviation of the estimates in our actuarial method of reserving.
we use our judgment to determine the assumptions to be used in the calculation of the required estimates. the assumptions we consider when estimating ibnr include, without limitation, claims receipt and payment experience (and variations in that experience), changes in membership, provider billing practices, healthcare service utilization trends, cost trends, product mix, seasonality, prior authorization of medical services, benefit changes, known outbreaks of disease or increased incidence of illness such as influenza, provider contract changes, changes to fee schedules, and the incidence of high dollar or catastrophic claims.
we apply various estimation methods depending on the claim type and the period for which claims are being estimated. for more recent periods, incurred non-inpatient claims are estimated based on historical per member per month claims experience adjusted for known factors. incurred hospital inpatient claims are estimated based on known inpatient utilization data and prior claims experience adjusted for known factors. for older periods, we utilize an estimated completion factor based on our historical experience to develop ibnr estimates. the completion factor is an actuarial estimate of the percentage of claims incurred during a given period that have been received or adjudicated as of the reporting period to the estimate of the total ultimate incurred costs. when we commence operations in a new state or region, we have limited information with which to estimate our medical claims liability. see "risk factors - failure to accurately estimate and price our medical expenses or effectively manage our medical costs or related administrative costs could negatively affect our financial position, results of operations or cash flows." these approaches are consistently applied to each period presented.
additionally, we contract with independent actuaries to review our estimates on a quarterly basis. the independent actuaries provide us with a review letter that includes the results of their analysis of our medical claims liability. we do not solely rely on their report to adjust our claims liability. we utilize their calculation of our claims liability only as additional information, together with management's judgment, to determine the assumptions to be used in the calculation of our liability for claims.
our development of the medical claims liability estimate is a continuous process which we monitor and refine on a monthly basis as additional claims receipts and payment information becomes available. as more complete claims information becomes available, we adjust the amount of the estimates, and include the changes in estimates in medical costs in the period in which the changes are identified. in every reporting period, our operating results include the effects of more completely developed medical claims liability estimates associated with previously reported periods. we consistently apply our reserving methodology from period to period. as additional information becomes known to us, we adjust our actuarial models accordingly to establish medical claims liability estimates.
the paid and received completion factors, claims per member per month and per diem cost trend factors are the most significant factors affecting the ibnr estimate. the following table illustrates the sensitivity of these factors and the estimated potential impact on our operating results caused by changes in these factors based on december 31, 2016 data:

while we believe our estimates are appropriate, it is possible future events could require us to make significant adjustments for revisions to these estimates. for example, a 1% increase or decrease in our estimated medical claims liability would have affected net earnings by $25 million for the year ended december 31, 2016, excluding the effect of any return of premium, risk corridor, or minimum mlr programs. the estimates are based on our historical experience, terms of existing contracts, our observance of trends in the industry, information provided by our providers and information available from other outside sources.
the change in medical claims liability is summarized as follows (in millions):
(1) days in claims payable is a calculation of medical claims liability at the end of the period divided by average expense per calendar day for the fourth quarter of each year.
medical claims are usually paid within a few months of the member receiving service from the physician or other healthcare provider. as a result, the liability generally is described as having a "short-tail," which causes less than 5% of our medical claims liability as of the end of any given year to be outstanding the following year. we believe that substantially all the development of the estimate of medical claims liability as of december 31, 2016 will be known by the end of 2017.
changes in estimates of incurred claims for prior years are primarily attributable to reserving under moderately adverse conditions. additionally, as a result of minimum hbr and other return of premium programs, approximately $39 million, $47 million and $26 million of the "incurred related to: prior years" was recorded as a reduction to premium revenues in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. further, claims processing initiatives yielded increased claim payment recoveries and coordination of benefits related to prior year dates of service. changes in medical utilization and cost trends and the effect of medical management initiatives may also contribute to changes in medical claim liability estimates. while we have evidence that medical management initiatives are effective on a case by case basis, medical management initiatives primarily focus on events and behaviors prior to the incurrence of the medical event and generation of a claim. accordingly, any change in behavior, leveling of care, or coordination of treatment occurs prior to claim generation and as a result, the costs prior to the medical management initiative are not known by us. additionally, certain medical management initiatives are focused on member and provider education with the intent of influencing behavior to appropriately align the medical services provided with the member's acuity. in these cases, determining whether the medical management initiative changed the behavior cannot be determined. because of the complexity of our business, the number of states in which we operate, and the volume of claims that we process, we are unable to practically quantify the impact of these initiatives on our changes in estimates of ibnr.
the following are examples of medical management initiatives that may have contributed to the favorable development through lower medical utilization and cost trends:
•   appropriate leveling of care for neonatal intensive care unit hospital admissions, other inpatient hospital admissions, and observation admissions, in accordance with interqual or other criteria.
•   management of our pre-authorization list and more stringent review of durable medical equipment and injectibles.
•   emergency room program designed to collaboratively work with hospitals to steer non-emergency care away from the costly emergency room setting (through patient education, on-site alternative urgent care settings, etc.)
•   increase emphasis on case management and clinical rounding where case managers are nurses or social workers who are employed by the health plan to assist selected patients with the coordination of healthcare services in order to meet a patient's specific healthcare needs.
•   incorporation of disease management which is a comprehensive, multidisciplinary, collaborative approach to chronic illnesses such as asthma.
•   prenatal and infant health programs utilized in our start smart for your baby outreach service.
revenue recognition our health plans generate revenues primarily from premiums received from the states in which we operate health plans. we generally receive a fixed premium per member per month pursuant to our state contracts and recognize premium revenues during the period in which we are obligated to provide services to our members at the amount reasonably estimable. in some instances, our base premiums are subject to an adjustment, or risk score, based on the acuity of its membership. generally, the risk score is determined by the state analyzing submissions of processed claims data to determine the acuity of our membership relative to the entire state's medicaid membership. we estimate the amount of risk adjustment based upon the processed claims data submitted and expected to be submitted to cms and record revenues on a risk adjusted basis. some contracts allow for additional premiums related to certain supplemental services provided such as maternity deliveries.
our contracts with states may require us to maintain a minimum hbr or may require us to share profits in excess of certain levels. in certain circumstances, our plans may be required to return premium to the state in the event profits exceed established levels. we estimate the effect of these programs and recognize reductions in revenue in the current period. other states may require us to meet certain performance and quality metrics in order to receive additional or full contractual revenue. for performance-based contracts, we do not recognize revenue subject to refund until data is sufficient to measure performance.
revenues are recorded based on membership and eligibility data provided by the states, which is adjusted on a monthly basis by the states for retroactive additions or deletions to membership data. these eligibility adjustments are estimated monthly and subsequent adjustments are made in the period known. we continuously review and updates those estimates as new information becomes available. it is possible that new information could require us to make additional adjustments, which could be significant, to these estimates.
our medicare advantage contracts are with cms. cms deploys a risk adjustment model which apportions premiums paid to all health plans according to health severity and certain demographic factors. the cms risk adjustment model pays more for members whose medical history would indicate that they are expected to have higher medical costs. under this risk adjustment methodology, cms calculates the risk adjusted premium payment using diagnosis data from hospital inpatient, hospital outpatient, physician treatment settings as well as prescription drug events. we and the health care providers collect, compile and submit the necessary and available diagnosis data to cms within prescribed deadlines. we estimate risk adjustment revenues based upon the diagnosis data submitted and expected to be submitted to cms and record revenues on a risk adjusted basis.
our specialty services generate revenues under contracts with state and federal programs, healthcare organizations and other commercial organizations, as well as from our own subsidiaries. revenues are recognized when the related services are provided or as ratably earned over the covered period of services. we recognize revenue related to administrative services under the t-3 tricare government-sponsored managed care support contract in the north region for the dod's tricare program (t-3 contract) on a straight-line basis over the option period, when the fees become fixed and determinable. the t-3 contract includes various performance-based incentives and penalties. for each of the incentives or penalties, we adjust revenue accordingly based on the amount that it has earned or incurred at each interim date and are legally entitled to in the event of a contract termination.
some states enact premium taxes, similar assessments and provider pass-through payments, collectively premium taxes, and these taxes are recorded as a separate component of both revenues and operating expenses. additionally, our insurance subsidiaries are subject to the affordable care act annual hif. if we are able to negotiate reimbursement of portions of these premium taxes or the hif, we recognize revenue associated with the hif on a straight-line basis when we have binding agreements for such reimbursements, including the "gross-up" to reflect the hifs non-tax deductible nature. collectively, this revenue is recorded as premium tax and health insurer fee revenue in the consolidated statements of operations.

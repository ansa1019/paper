item 7: management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction this md&a provides information we believe necessary for understanding our financial condition, changes in financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. the md&a should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements, notes to consolidated financial statements, and other information contained in this report. the forward-looking statements in this section and other parts of this report involve assumptions, risks, uncertainties, and other factors, including statements regarding our plans, objectives, goals, strategies, and financial performance. our actual results could differ materially from the results anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of factors set forth under the caption "forward-looking statements" and those set forth in item 1a.
executive overview business combinations on august 16, 2016, huntington completed its acquisition of firstmerit corporation in a stock and cash transaction valued at approximately $3.7 billion. firstmerit corporation was a diversified financial services company headquartered in akron, ohio, with operations in ohio, michigan, wisconsin, illinois and pennsylvania. post acquisition, huntington now operates across an eight-state midwestern footprint. the acquisition resulted in a combined company with a larger market presence and more diversified loan portfolio, as well as a larger core deposit funding base and economies of scale associated with a larger financial institution. for further discussion, see note 3 of the notes to consolidated financial statements.
2016 financial performance review in 2016, we reported net income of $712 million, a 3% increase from the prior year. earnings per common share on a diluted basis for the year was $0.70, down 14% from the prior year. reported net income was impacted by firstmerit acquisition related expenses totaling $282 million pre-tax, or $0.20 per common share and a reduction to the litigation reserve totaling $42 million pre-tax, or $0.03 per common share.
fully-taxable equivalent net interest income was $2.4 billion, up $0.4 billion, or 22%. this reflected the impact of 21% earning asset growth, 22% interest-bearing liability growth, and a 1 basis point increase in the nim to 3.16%. the average earning asset growth included an $8.8 billion, or 18%, increase in average loans and leases and a $4.1 billion, or 30%, increase in average securities, both of which were impacted by the firstmerit acquisition. the net interest margin expansion reflected a 9 basis point positive impact from the mix and yield on earning assets, a 3 basis point increase in the benefit from noninterest-bearing funds, partially offset by an 11 basis point increase in funding costs.
the provision for credit losses was $191 million, up $91 million, or 91%. the higher provision expense was due to several factors, including the migration of the acquired portfolio to the originated portfolio, and the corresponding reserve build, portfolio growth and transitioning the firstmerit portfolio to huntington's reserving methodology. net charge-offs represented an annualized 0.19% of average loans and leases, which remains below our long-term target of 35 to 55 basis points.
noninterest income was $1.1 billion, up $111 million, or 11%. service charges on deposit accounts increased $44 million, or 16%, reflecting the benefit of continued new customer acquisition. in addition, cards and payment processing income increased $26 million, or 18%, due to higher card related income and underlying customer growth. also, mortgage banking income increased $16 million, or 15%, reflecting a 24% increase in mortgage origination volume. finally, gain on sale of loans increased $14 million, or 43%, primarily reflecting an increase of $6 million in sba loan sales gains and the $7 million gains on non-relationship c&i and cre loan sales, both of which were related to the balance sheet optimization strategy completed in the 2016 fourth quarter.
noninterest expense was $2.4 billion, up $433 million, or 22%. reported noninterest expense was impacted by firstmerit acquisition-related expenses totaling $282 million. personnel costs increased $227 million, or 20%, primarily reflecting $76 million of acquisition-related expense and a 31% increase in the number of average full-time equivalent employees largely related to the in-store branch expansion and the addition of colleagues from firstmerit. in addition, outside data processing and other services, professional services, equipment expense, and net occupancy expense all increased as a result of acquisition-related expenses. also, other expense decreased $17 million, or 8%, primarily reflecting a $42 million reduction to litigation reserves, which was mostly offset by a $40 million contribution in the 2016 fourth quarter to achieve the philanthropic plans related to firstmerit.
the tangible common equity to tangible assets ratio was 7.16%, down 66 basis points. the cet1 risk-based capital ratio was 9.56%, down 23 basis points. the regulatory tier 1 risk-based capital ratio was 10.92%, up 39 basis points. all capital ratios were impacted by the $1.3 billion of goodwill created and the issuance of $2.8 billion of common stock as part of the firstmerit acquisition. the regulatory tier 1 risk-based and total risk-based capital ratios benefited from the issuance of $600 million of class d preferred equity and separately, the issuance of $100 million of class c preferred equity in exchange for firstmerit preferred equity in conjunction with the acquisition. the total risk-based capital ratio was impacted by the repurchase of $65 million of trust preferred securities. in addition, $5 million of trust preferred securities acquired in the firstmerit acquisition were subsequently redeemed. there were no common shares repurchased during 2016.
business overview general our general business objectives are: (1) grow net interest income and fee income, (2) deliver positive operating leverage, (3) increase primary relationships across all business segments, (4) continue to strengthen risk management, and (5) maintain capital and liquidity positions consistent with our risk appetite. additionally, we are focused on the successful integration of firstmerit in 2017.
economy looking forward into 2017, we are optimistic that improved consumer confidence and jobs growth will translate into overall economic growth in the markets where we do business. operationally, we expect to realize the full financial benefits of integration completion within the second half of the year, meeting our commitment for cost savings. we are driving revenue synergies and organic revenue growth, leveraging our expanded footprint and customer base. we will see minor benefits from the federal reserve's december interest rate action, and any additional rate increases in 2017 would be additive to our bottom line.

(1)   comparisons for presented periods are impacted by a number of factors. refer to "significant items" in the discussion of results of operations.
discussion of results of operations this section provides a review of financial performance from a consolidated perspective. it also includes a "significant items" section that summarizes key issues important for a complete understanding of performance trends. key consolidated balance sheet and income statement trends are discussed. all earnings per share data are reported on a diluted basis. for additional insight on financial performance, please read this section in conjunction with the "business segment discussion."
significant items earnings comparisons among the three years ended december 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014 were impacted by a number of significant items summarized below.
1.   mergers and acquisitions. significant events relating to mergers and acquisitions, and the impacts of those events on our reported results, were as follows:
•   during 2016, $282 million of noninterest expense and $1 million of noninterest income was recorded related to the acquisition of firstmerit. this resulted in a negative impact of $0.20 per common share in 2016.

net interest income / average balance sheet our primary source of revenue is net interest income, which is the difference between interest income from earning assets (primarily loans, securities, and direct financing leases), and interest expense of funding sources (primarily interest-bearing deposits and borrowings). earning asset balances and related funding sources, as well as changes in the levels of interest rates, impact net interest income. the difference between the average yield on earning assets and the average rate paid for interest-bearing liabilities is the net interest spread. noninterest-bearing sources of funds, such as demand deposits and shareholders' equity, also support earning assets. the impact of the noninterest-bearing sources of funds, often referred to as "free" funds, is captured in the net interest margin, which is calculated as net interest income divided by average earning assets. both the net interest margin and net interest spread are presented on a fully-taxable equivalent basis, which means that tax-free interest income has been adjusted to a pretax equivalent income, assuming a 35% tax rate.
the following table shows changes in fully-taxable equivalent interest income, interest expense, and net interest income due to volume and rate variances for major categories of earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities:

fully-taxable equivalent net interest income for 2016 increased $429 million, or 22%, from 2015. this reflected the impact of 21% earning asset growth, a 1 basis point increase in the nim to 3.16%, partially offset by 22% interest-bearing liability growth.
•   $4.1 billion, or 30%, increase in average securities, primarily reflecting the firstmerit acquisition, as well as the reinvestment of cash flows and additional investment in lcr level 1 qualifying securities. the 2016 average balance also included $2.1 billion of direct purchase municipal instruments in our commercial segment, up from $1.7 billion in the year-ago period.
•   $4.0 billion, or 20%, increase in average c&amp;i loans and leases was impacted by the firstmerit acquisition. the increase in average c&amp;i loans and leases also reflects organic growth in equipment finance leases, automobile dealer floorplan lending, and corporate banking.
•   $1.8 billion, or 20%, increase in average automobile loans, which reflects continued strength in new and used automobile originations, while maintaining our underwriting consistency and discipline. this increase was also impacted by the firstmerit acquisition and was partially offset by the $1.5 billion auto loan securitization during the 2016 fourth quarter.
•   $2.8 billion, or 53%, increase in savings and other domestic deposits, reflecting continued banker focus across all segments on obtaining our customers' full deposit relationship.
•   $2.4 billion, or 44% increase in average long-term debt, reflecting the issuance of $2.0 billion of senior debt during 2016, as well as $0.5 billion of subordinate debt assumed during the acquisition of firstmerit.
the 1 basis point increase in nim primary reflected:
•   9 basis point positive impact from the mix and yield on earning assets, a 3 basis point increase in the benefit from noninterest-bearing funds, partially offset by an 11 basis point increase in funding costs.
fully-taxable equivalent net interest income for 2015 increased $118 million, or 6%, from 2014. this reflected the impact of 9% earning asset growth, partially offset by 7% interest-bearing liability growth and an 8 basis point decrease in the nim to 3.15%.
•   $1.8 billion, or 15%, increase in average securities, primarily reflecting additional investment in lcr level 1 qualifying securities. the 2015 average balance also included $1.7 billion of direct purchase municipal instruments originated by our commercial segment, up from $1.0 billion in the year-ago period.
•   $1.4 billion, or 8%, increase in average c&amp;i loans and leases, primarily reflecting the $0.9 billion increase in asset finance, including the $0.8 billion of equipment finance leases acquired in the huntington technology finance transaction at the end of the 2015 first quarter.
•   $1.5 billion, or 8%, increase in money market deposits, reflecting continued banker focus across all segments on obtaining our customers' full deposit relationship.
•   $0.7 billion, or 11%, increase in average interest-bearing demand deposits. the increase reflected growth in both consumer and commercial accounts.
•   $0.7 billion, or 11%, increase in average total debt, reflecting a $2.1 billion, or 60%, increase in average long-term debt partially offset by a $1.4 billion, or 51%, reduction in average short-term borrowings. the increase in average long-term debt reflected the issuance of $3.1 billion of bank-level senior debt during 2015, including $0.9 billion during the 2015 fourth quarter, as well as $0.5 billion of debt assumed in the huntington technology finance acquisition at the end of the 2015 first quarter.
•   $0.6 billion, or 29%, increase in brokered deposits and negotiated cds, which were used to efficiently finance balance sheet growth while continuing to manage the overall cost of funds.
partially offset by:
•   $0.7 billion, or 21%, decrease in average core certificates of deposit due to the strategic focus on changing the funding sources to low- and no-cost demand deposits and money market deposits.
the primary items impacting the decrease in the nim were:
•   6 basis point negative impact from the mix and yield on earning assets, primarily reflecting lower rates on loans and the impact of an increase in total securities balances.
•   3 basis point negative impact from the mix and yield of total interest-bearing liabilities.
partially offset by:
•   1 basis point increase in the benefit to the margin of noninterest-bearing funds.
(this section should be read in conjunction with the credit risk section.)
the provision for credit losses is the expense necessary to maintain the alll and the aulc at levels appropriate to absorb our estimate of credit losses inherent in the loan and lease portfolio and the portfolio of unfunded loan commitments and letters-of-credit.
the provision for credit losses in 2016 was $191 million, up $91 million, or 91%, from 2015. the higher provision expense was due to several factors, including the migration of the acquired loan portfolio to the originated portfolio, which requires a reserve build, portfolio growth and transitioning the firstmerit portfolio to our reserve methodology. ncos represented 19 basis points of average loans and leases, consistent with 2015, and below our long-term target of 35 to 55 basis points.

risk management and capital a comprehensive discussion of risk management and capital matters affecting us can be found in the risk governance section included in item 1a and the regulatory matters section of item 1 of this form 10-k.
some of the more significant processes used to manage and control credit, market, liquidity, operational, and compliance risks are described in the following sections.
credit risk credit risk is the risk of financial loss if a counterparty is not able to meet the agreed upon terms of the financial obligation. the majority of our credit risk is associated with lending activities, as the acceptance and management of credit risk is central to profitable lending. we also have credit risk associated with our afs and htm securities portfolios (see note 5 and note 6 of the notes to consolidated financial statements). we engage with other financial counterparties for a variety of purposes including investing, asset and liability management, mortgage banking, and trading activities. while there is credit risk associated with derivative activity, based on our underwriting practices we believe this exposure is minimal. (see note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements)
we continue to focus on the identification, monitoring, and managing of our credit risk. in addition to the traditional credit risk mitigation strategies of credit policies and processes, market risk management activities, and portfolio diversification, we use quantitative measurement capabilities utilizing external data sources, enhanced use of modeling technology, and internal stress testing processes. our portfolio management resources demonstrate our commitment to maintaining an aggregate moderate-to-low risk profile. in our efforts to continue to identify risk mitigation techniques, we have focused on product design features, origination policies, and solutions for delinquent or stressed borrowers.
the maximum level of credit exposure to individual credit borrowers is limited by policy guidelines based on the perceived risk of each borrower or related group of borrowers. all authority to grant commitments is delegated through the independent credit administration function and is closely monitored and regularly updated. concentration risk is managed through limits on loan type, geography, industry, and loan quality factors. we focus predominantly on extending credit to retail and commercial customers with existing or expandable relationships within our primary banking markets, although we will consider lending opportunities outside our primary markets if we believe the associated risks are acceptable and aligned with strategic initiatives. although we offer a broad set of products, we continue to develop new lending products and opportunities. each of these new products and opportunities goes through a rigorous development and approval process prior to implementation to ensure our overall objective of maintaining an aggregate moderate-to-low risk portfolio profile.
the checks and balances in the credit process and the separation of the credit administration and risk management functions are designed to appropriately assess and sanction the level of credit risk being accepted, facilitate the early recognition of credit problems when they occur, and provide for effective problem asset management and resolution. for example, we do not extend additional credit to delinquent borrowers except in certain circumstances that substantially improve our overall repayment or collateral coverage position.
total commercial loans and leases were $35.4 billion at december 31, 2016, and represented 53% of our total loan and lease credit exposure. our commercial loan portfolio is diversified by product type, customer size, and geography within our footprint, and is comprised of the following (see commercial credit discussion):
c&i - c&i loans and leases are made to commercial customers for use in normal business operations to finance working capital needs, equipment purchases, or other projects. the majority of these borrowers are customers doing business within our geographic regions. c&i loans and leases are generally underwritten individually and secured with the assets of the company and/or the personal guarantee of the business owners. the financing of owner occupied facilities is considered a c&i loan even though there is improved real estate as collateral. this treatment is a result of the credit decision process, which focuses on cash flow from operations of the business to repay the debt. the operation, sale, rental, or refinancing of the real estate is not considered the primary repayment source for these types of loans. as we have expanded our c&i portfolio, we have developed a series of "vertical specialties" to ensure that new products or lending types are embedded within a structured, centralized commercial lending area with designated, experienced credit officers. these specialties are comprised of either targeted industries (for example, healthcare, food & agribusiness, energy, etc.) and/or lending disciplines (equipment finance, abl, etc.), all of which requires a high degree of expertise and oversight to effectively mitigate and monitor risk. as such, we have dedicated colleagues and teams focused on bringing value added expertise to these specialty clients.
cre - cre loans consist of loans to developers and reits supporting income-producing or for-sale commercial real estate properties. we mitigate our risk on these loans by requiring collateral values that exceed the loan amount and underwriting the loan with projected cash flow in excess of the debt service requirement. these loans are made to finance properties such as apartment buildings, office and industrial buildings, and retail shopping centers, and are repaid through cash flows related to the operation, sale, or refinance of the property. for loans secured by real estate, appropriate appraisals are obtained at origination and updated on an as needed basis in compliance with regulatory requirements.
construction cre - construction cre loans are loans to developers, companies, or individuals used for the construction of a commercial or residential property for which repayment will be generated by the sale or permanent financing of the property. our construction cre portfolio primarily consists of retail, multi family, office, and warehouse project types. generally, these loans are for construction projects that have been presold or preleased, or have secured permanent financing, as well as loans to real estate companies with significant equity invested in each project. these loans are underwritten and managed by a specialized real estate lending group that actively monitors the construction phase and manages the loan disbursements according to the predetermined construction schedule.
total consumer loans and leases were $31.6 billion at december 31, 2016, and represented 47% of our total loan and lease credit exposure. the consumer portfolio is comprised primarily of automobile loans, home equity loans and lines-of-credit, and residential mortgages (see consumer credit discussion).
automobile - automobile loans are comprised primarily of loans made through automotive dealerships and include exposure in selected states outside of our primary banking markets. the exposure outside of our primary banking markets represents 16% of the total exposure, with no individual state representing more than 5%. applications are underwritten using an automated underwriting system that applies consistent policies and processes across the portfolio.
home equity - home equity lending includes both home equity loans and lines-of-credit. this type of lending, which is secured by a first-lien or junior-lien on the borrower's residence, allows customers to borrow against the equity in their home or refinance existing mortgage debt. products include closed-end loans which are generally fixed-rate with principal and interest payments, and variable-rate, interest-only lines-of-credit which do not require payment of principal during the 10-year revolving period. the home equity line of credit may convert to a 20-year amortizing structure at the end of the revolving period. applications are underwritten centrally in conjunction with an automated underwriting system. the home equity underwriting criteria is based on minimum credit scores, debt-to-income ratios, and ltv ratios, with current collateral valuations. the underwriting for the floating rate lines of credit also incorporates a stress analysis for a rising interest rate.
residential mortgage - residential mortgage loans represent loans to consumers for the purchase or refinance of a residence. these loans are generally financed over a 15-year to 30-year term, and in most cases, are extended to borrowers to finance their primary residence. applications are underwritten centrally using consistent credit policies and processes. all residential mortgage loan decisions utilize a full appraisal for collateral valuation. huntington has not originated or acquired residential mortgages that allow negative amortization or allow the borrower multiple payment options.
rv and marine finance - rv and marine finance loans are loans provided to consumers for the purpose of financing recreational vehicles and boats. loans are originated on an indirect basis through a series of dealerships across 26 states. the loans are underwritten centrally using an application and decisioning system similar to automobile loans. the current portfolio includes 60% of the balances within our core footprint states.
other consumer - other consumer loans primarily consists of consumer loans not secured by real estate, including personal unsecured loans, overdraft balances, and credit cards.
the table below provides the composition of our total loan and lease portfolio:
loans originated for investment are stated at their principal amount outstanding adjusted for partial charge-offs, and net deferred loan fees and costs. acquired loans are those purchased in the firstmerit acquisition and are recorded at estimated fair value at the acquisition date with no carryover of the related alll. the difference between acquired contractual balance and estimated fair value at acquisition date was recorded as a purchase premium or discount. the acquired loan portfolio will show a continuous decline as a result of payments, payoffs, charge-offs or other disposition, unless huntington acquires additional loans in the future.
our loan portfolio is composed of consumer and commercial credits. at the corporate level, we manage the credit exposure and portfolio composition in part via a credit concentration policy. the policy designates specific loan types, collateral types, and loan structures to be formally tracked and assigned limits as a percentage of capital. c&i lending by naics categories, specific limits for cre primary project types, loans secured by residential real estate, shared national credit exposure, and designated high risk loan definitions represent examples of specifically tracked components of our concentration management process. currently there are no identified concentrations that exceed the established limit, including the impact of the firstmerit acquisition. our concentration management policy is approved by the roc of the board and is one of the strategies used to ensure a high quality, well diversified portfolio that is consistent with our overall objective of maintaining an aggregate moderate-to-low risk profile. changes to existing concentration limits require the approval of the roc prior to implementation, incorporating specific information relating to the potential impact on the overall portfolio composition and performance metrics.
the table below provides our total loan and lease portfolio segregated by the type of collateral securing the loan or lease. the changes in the collateral composition from december 31, 2015 are consistent with the portfolio growth metrics.
the increase in the unsecured exposure is centered in high quality commercial credit customers.
table 10 - loan and lease portfolio by collateral type
commercial credit the primary factors considered in commercial credit approvals are the financial strength of the borrower, assessment of the borrower's management capabilities, cash flows from operations, industry sector trends, type and sufficiency of collateral, type of exposure, transaction structure, and the general economic outlook. while these are the primary factors considered, there are a number of other factors that may be considered in the decision process. we utilize a centralized preview and senior loan approval committee, led by our chief credit officer. the risk rating (see next paragraph), size, and complexity of the credit determines the threshold for approval of the senior loan committee with a minimum credit exposure of $10.0 million. for loans not requiring senior loan committee approval, with the exception of small business loans, credit officers who understand each local region and are experienced in the industries and loan structures of the requested credit exposure are involved in all loan decisions and have the primary credit authority. for small business loans, we utilize a centralized loan approval process for standard products and structures. in this centralized decision environment, certain individuals who understand each local region may make credit-extension decisions to preserve our commitment to the communities in which we operate. in addition to disciplined and consistent judgmental factors, a sophisticated credit scoring process is used as a primary evaluation tool in the determination of approving a loan within the centralized loan approval process.
in commercial lending, on-going credit management is dependent on the type and nature of the loan. we monitor all significant exposures on an on-going basis. all commercial credit extensions are assigned internal risk ratings reflecting the borrower's pd and lgd. this two-dimensional rating methodology provides granularity in the portfolio management process. the pd is rated and applied at the borrower level. the lgd is rated and applied based on the specific type of credit extension and the quality and lien position associated with the underlying collateral. the internal risk ratings are assessed at origination and updated at each periodic monitoring event. there is also extensive macro portfolio management analysis on an on-going basis. we continually review and adjust our risk-rating criteria based on actual experience, which provides us with the current risk level in the portfolio and is the basis for determining an appropriate allowance for credit losses (acl) amount for the commercial portfolio. a centralized portfolio management team monitors and reports on the performance of the entire commercial portfolio, including small business loans, to provide consistent oversight.
in addition to the initial credit analysis conducted during the approval process, our credit review group performs testing to provide an independent review and assessment of the quality and risk of new loan originations. this group is part of our risk management area and conducts portfolio reviews on a risk-based cycle to evaluate individual loans, validate risk ratings, and test the consistency of credit processes.
our standardized loan grading system considers many components that directly correlate to loan quality and likelihood of repayment, one of which is guarantor support. on an annual basis, or more frequently if warranted, we consider, among other things, the guarantor's reputation and creditworthiness, along with various key financial metrics such as liquidity and net worth, assuming such information is available. our assessment of the guarantor's credit strength, or lack thereof, is reflected in our risk ratings for such loans, which is directly tied to, and an integral component of, our acl methodology. when a loan goes to impaired status, viable guarantor support is considered in the determination of a credit loss.
if our assessment of the guarantor's credit strength yields an inherent capacity to perform, we will seek repayment from the guarantor as part of the collection process and have done so successfully.
substantially all loans categorized as classified (see note 4 of notes to consolidated financial statements) are managed by sad. sad is a specialized group of credit professionals that handle the day-to-day management of workouts, commercial recoveries, and problem loan sales. its responsibilities include developing and implementing action plans, assessing risk ratings, and determining the appropriateness of the allowance, the accrual status, and the ultimate collectability of the classified loan portfolio.
c&i portfolio we manage the risks inherent in the c&i portfolio through origination policies, a defined loan concentration policy with established limits, on-going loan level reviews and portfolio level reviews, recourse requirements, and continuous portfolio risk management activities. our origination policies for the c&i portfolio include loan product-type specific policies such as ltv and debt service coverage ratios, as applicable. during 2016, the most volatile segment of the c&i portfolio was loans to borrowers supporting oil and gas exploration and production, and currently represents less than 1% of the total loan portfolio. while the energy industry remains a focus, the performance of the energy related portfolio has stabilized over the past three quarters.
the c&i portfolio continues to have solid origination activity as evidenced by its growth over the past 12 months and we maintain a focus on high quality originations. the loans added as a result of the firstmerit acquisition have a very similar risk profile and composition to the legacy huntington portfolio. the only material new geographic location is the chicago market. problem loans had trended downward over the last several years, reflecting a combination of proactive risk identification and effective workout strategies implemented by the sad. however, in the first quarter of 2016 c&i problem loans began to increase, primarily as a result of oil and gas exploration and production customers and the increase in overall c&i loan portfolio size. we have seen some improvement in the energy portfolio risk profile since the 2016 first quarter. we continue to maintain a proactive approach to identifying borrowers that may be facing financial difficulty in order to maximize the potential solutions. subsequent to the origination of the loan, the credit review group provides an independent review and assessment of the quality of the underwriting and risk of new loan originations.
cre portfolio we manage the risks inherent in this portfolio specific to cre lending, focusing on the quality of the developer and the specifics associated with each project. generally, we: (1) limit our loans to 80% of the appraised value of the commercial real estate at origination, (2) require net operating cash flows to be 125% of required interest and principal payments, and (3) if the commercial real estate is non-owner occupied, require that at least 50% of the space of the project be preleased. we actively monitor both geographic and project-type concentrations and performance metrics of all cre loan types, with a focus on loans identified as higher risk based on the risk rating methodology. both macro-level and loan-level stress-test scenarios based on existing and forecast market conditions are part of the on-going portfolio management process for the cre portfolio.
dedicated real estate professionals originate and manage the portfolio. the portfolio is diversified by project type and loan size, and this diversification represents a significant portion of the credit risk management strategies employed for this portfolio. subsequent to the origination of the loan, the credit review group provides an independent review and assessment of the quality of the underwriting and risk of new loan originations.
appraisal values are obtained in conjunction with all originations and renewals, and on an as needed basis, in compliance with regulatory requirements and to ensure appropriate decisions regarding the on-going management of the portfolio reflect the changing market conditions. appraisals are obtained from approved vendors and are reviewed by an internal appraisal review group comprised of certified appraisers to ensure the quality of the valuation used in the underwriting process. we continue to perform on-going portfolio level reviews within the cre portfolio. these reviews generate action plans based on occupancy levels or sales volume associated with the projects being reviewed. this highly individualized process requires working closely with all of our borrowers, as well as an in-depth knowledge of cre project lending and the market environment.
consumer credit consumer credit approvals are based on, among other factors, the financial strength and payment history of the borrower, type of exposure, and transaction structure. consumer credit decisions are generally made in a centralized environment utilizing decision models. importantly, certain individuals who understand each local region have the authority to make credit extension decisions to preserve our focus on the local communities in which we operate. each credit extension is assigned a specific pd and lgd. the pd is generally based on the borrower's most recent credit bureau score (fico), which we update quarterly, providing an ongoing view of the borrowers pd. the lgd is related to the type of collateral associated with the credit extension, which typically does not change over the course of the loan term. this allows huntington to maintain a current view of the customer for credit risk management and acl purposes.
in consumer lending, credit risk is managed from a segment (i.e., loan type, collateral position, geography, etc.) and vintage performance analysis. all portfolio segments are continuously monitored for changes in delinquency trends and other asset quality indicators. we make extensive use of portfolio assessment models to continuously monitor the quality of the portfolio, which may result in changes to future origination strategies. the ongoing analysis and review process results in a determination of an appropriate alll amount for our consumer loan portfolio. the independent risk management group has a consumer process review component to ensure the effectiveness and efficiency of the consumer credit processes.
collection actions by our customer assistance team are initiated as needed through a centrally managed collection and recovery function. we employ a series of collection methodologies designed to maintain a high level of effectiveness, while maximizing efficiency. in addition to the consumer loan portfolio, the customer assistance team is responsible for collection activity on all sold and securitized consumer loans and leases. collection practices include a single contact point for the majority of the residential real estate secured portfolios.
automobile portfolio our strategy in the automobile portfolio continues to focus on high quality borrowers as measured by both fico and internal custom scores, combined with appropriate ltvs, terms, and profitability. our strategy and operational capabilities allow us to appropriately manage the origination quality across the entire portfolio, including our newer markets. although increased origination volume and entering new markets can be associated with increased risk levels, we believe our disciplined strategy and operational processes significantly mitigate these risks.
we have continued to consistently execute our value proposition and take advantage of available market opportunities. importantly, we have maintained our high credit quality standards while expanding the portfolio.
residential real estate secured portfolios the properties securing our residential mortgage and home equity portfolios are primarily located within our geographic footprint. huntington continues to support our local markets with consistent underwriting across all residential secured products. the residential-secured portfolio originations continue to be of high quality, with the majority of the negative credit impact coming from loans originated in 2006 and earlier. our portfolio management strategies associated with our home savers group allow us to focus on effectively helping our customers with appropriate solutions for their specific circumstances.
(1)   the ltv ratios for home equity loans and home equity lines-of-credit are cumulative and reflect the balance of any senior loans. ltv ratios reflect collateral values at the time of loan origination.
(2)   portfolio weighted average fico scores reflect currently updated customer credit scores whereas origination weighted-average fico scores reflect the customer credit scores at the time of loan origination.
home equity portfolio within the home equity portfolio, the standard product is a 10-year interest-only draw period with a 20-year fully amortizing term at the end of the draw period. prior to 2006, the standard product was a 10-year draw period with a balloon payment. in either case, after the 10-year draw period, the borrower must reapply, subject to full underwriting guidelines, to continue with the interest only revolving structure or begin repaying the debt in a term structure. the principal and interest payment associated with the term structure will be higher than the interest-only payment, resulting in end of draw period risk. our heloc risk can be segregated into two distinct segments: (1) home equity lines-of-credit underwritten with a balloon payment at maturity acquired from firstmerit and (2) home equity lines-of-credit with an automatic conversion to a 20-year amortizing loan. we manage this risk based on both the actual maturity date of the line-of-credit structure and at the end of the 10-year draw period. this risk is embedded in the portfolio which we address with proactive contact strategies beginning one year prior to either maturity or the end of draw period. in certain circumstances, our home saver group is able to provide payment and structure relief to borrowers experiencing significant financial hardship associated with the payment adjustment.
the table below summarizes our home equity line-of-credit portfolio by end of draw period described above:
table 12 - draw schedule of home equity line-of-credit portfolio
residential mortgages portfolio huntington underwrites all applications centrally, with a focus on higher quality borrowers. we do not originate residential mortgages that allow negative amortization or allow the borrower multiple payment options and have incorporated regulatory requirements and guidance into our underwriting process. residential mortgages are originated based on a completed full appraisal during the credit underwriting process. we update values in compliance with applicable regulations to facilitate our portfolio management, as well as our workout and loss mitigation functions.
we are subject to repurchase risk associated with residential mortgage loans sold in the secondary market. an appropriate level of reserve for representations and warranties related to residential mortgage loans sold has been established to address this repurchase risk inherent in the portfolio.
rv and marine finance portfolio our strategy in the rv and marine portfolio focuses on high quality borrowers, combined with appropriate ltvs, terms, and profitability. although entering new markets can be associated with increased risk levels, we believe our disciplined strategy and operational processes significantly mitigate these risks.
(this section should be read in conjunction with note 4 of the notes to consolidated financial statements.)
we believe the most meaningful way to assess overall credit quality performance is through an analysis of credit quality performance ratios. this approach forms the basis of most of the discussion in the sections immediately following: npas and nals, tdrs, acl, and ncos. in addition, we utilize delinquency rates, risk distribution and migration patterns, and product segmentation in the analysis of our credit quality performance.
credit quality performance in 2016, including the firstmerit acquisition, reflected continued overall positive results. total ncos were $109 million or 0.19% of average total loans and leases. the acl to total loans and leases ratio decreased by 23 basis points to 1.10%, due to the impact of the firstmerit acquisition as acquired loans are recorded at fair value with no associated alll on the date of acquisition.
npas and nals npas consist of (1) nals, which represent loans and leases no longer accruing interest, (2) oreo properties, and (3) other npas. any loan in our portfolio may be placed on nonaccrual status prior to the policies described below when collection of principal
or interest is in doubt. also, when a borrower with discharged non-reaffirmed debt in a chapter 7 bankruptcy is identified and the loan is determined to be collateral dependent, the loan is placed on nonaccrual status.
c&i and cre loans (except for purchased credit impaired loans) are placed on nonaccrual status at 90-days past due, or earlier if repayment of principal and interest is in doubt. of the $255 million of cre and c&i-related nals at december 31, 2016, $173 million, or 68%, represented loans that were less than 30-days past due, demonstrating our continued commitment to proactive credit risk management. with the exception of residential mortgage loans guaranteed by government organizations which continue to accrue interest, first lien loans secured by residential mortgage collateral are placed on nonaccrual status at 150-days past due. junior-lien home equity loans are placed on nonaccrual status at the earlier of 120-days past due or when the related first-lien loan has been identified as nonaccrual. automobile and other consumer loans are charged-off at 120-days past due.
when loans are placed on nonaccrual, accrued interest income is reversed with current year accruals charged to interest income and prior year amounts generally charged-off as a credit loss. when, in our judgment, the borrower's ability to make required interest and principal payments has resumed and collectability is no longer in doubt, the loan or lease could be returned to accrual status.
the table reflects period-end nals and npas detail for each of the last five years:
nonaccrual loans and leases as a % of total loans and leases          0.63   %              0.74   %              0.63   %              0.75   %              1.00   %

•   $59 million, or 34%, increase in c&amp;i nals, with the majority of the increase in our energy related portfolios, noting that the performance of the energy portfolio has stabilized since the 2016 first quarter.
•   $24 million, or 86%, increase in oreo, predominantly associated with an increase in commercial properties from the firstmerit acquisition.
partially offset by declines in the residential and cre portfolios.

tdr loans tdrs are modified loans where a concession was provided to a borrower experiencing financial difficulties. tdrs can be classified as either accruing or nonaccruing loans. nonaccruing tdrs are included in nals whereas accruing tdrs are excluded from nals, as it is probable that all contractual principal and interest due under the restructured terms will be collected. tdrs primarily reflect our loss mitigation efforts to proactively work with borrowers in financial difficulty or to comply with regulations regarding the treatment of certain bankruptcy filing and discharge situations. acquired, non-purchased credit impaired loans are only considered for tdr reporting for modifications made subsequent to acquisition. over the past five quarters, the accruing component of the total tdr balance has been between 80% and 84% indicating there is no identified credit loss and the borrowers continue to make their monthly payments.  in fact, over 80% of the $513 million of accruing tdrs secured by residential real estate (residential mortgage and home equity in table 15) are current on their required payments.  in addition, over 60% of the accruing pool have had no delinquency at all in the past 12 months. there is very limited migration from the accruing to non-accruing components, and virtually all of the charge-offs as presented in table 16 come from the non-accruing tdr balances.
the following table presents our accruing and nonaccruing tdrs at period-end for each of the past five years:
our strategy is to structure tdrs in a manner that avoids new concessions subsequent to the initial tdr terms. however, there are times when subsequent modifications are required, such as when the modified loan matures. often the loans are performing in accordance with the tdr terms, and a new note is originated with similar modified terms. these loans are subjected to the normal underwriting standards and processes for other similar credit extensions, both new and existing. if the loan is not performing in accordance with the existing tdr terms, typically an individualized approach to repayment is established. in accordance with gaap, the refinanced note is evaluated to determine if it is considered a new loan or a continuation of the prior loan. a new loan is considered for removal of the tdr designation. a continuation of the prior note requires the continuation of the tdr designation, and because the refinanced note constitutes a new or amended debt instrument, it is included in our tdr activity table (below) as a new tdr and a restructured tdr removal during the period.
the types of concessions granted for existing tdrs are consistent with those granted on new tdrs and include interest rate reductions, amortization or maturity date changes beyond what the collateral supports, and principal forgiveness based on the borrower's specific needs at a point in time. our policy does not limit the number of times a loan may be modified. a loan may be modified multiple times if it is considered to be in the best interest of both the borrower and us.
commercial loans are not automatically considered to be accruing tdrs upon the granting of a new concession. if the loan is in accruing status and no loss is expected based on the modified terms, the modified tdr remains in accruing status. for loans that are on nonaccrual status before the modification, collection of both principal and interest must not be in doubt, and the borrower must be able to exhibit sufficient cash flows for at least a six-month period of time to service the debt in order to return to accruing status. this six-month period could extend before or after the restructure date.
any granted change in terms or conditions that are not readily available in the market for that borrower, requires the designation as a tdr. there are no provisions for the removal of the tdr designation based on payment activity for consumer loans. a loan may be returned to accrual status when all contractually due interest and principal has been paid and the borrower demonstrates the financial capacity to continue to pay as agreed, with the risk of loss diminished. during the 2016 third quarter, huntington transferred $81 million of home equity tdrs from loans held for sale back to loans.

acl our total credit reserve is comprised of two different components, both of which in our judgment are appropriate to absorb credit losses inherent in our loan and lease portfolio: the alll and the aulc. combined, these reserves comprise the total acl. our acl methodology committee is responsible for developing the methodology, assumptions and estimates used in the calculation, as well as determining the appropriateness of the acl. the alll represents the estimate of losses inherent in the loan portfolio at the reported date. additions to the alll result from recording provision expense for loan losses or increased risk levels resulting from loan risk-rating downgrades, while reductions reflect charge-offs (net of recoveries), decreased risk levels resulting from loan risk-rating upgrades, or the sale of loans. the aulc is determined by applying the same quantitative reserve determination process to the unfunded portion of the loan exposures adjusted by an applicable funding expectation. (see note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements)
the acquired loans were recorded at their fair value as of the acquisition date and the prior alll was eliminated. an alll for acquired loans is estimated using a methodology similar to that used for originated loans. the allowance determined for each acquired loan is compared to the remaining fair value adjustment for that loan. if the computed allowance is greater, the excess is added to the allowance through a provision for loan losses. if the computed allowance is less, no additional allowance is recognized.
our acl evaluation process includes the on-going assessment of credit quality metrics, and a comparison of certain acl benchmarks to current performance. while the total acl balance increased year over year, all of the relevant benchmarks remain strong.
the following table reflects activity in the alll and aulc for each of the last five years:

(1)   percentages represent the percentage of each loan and lease category to total loans and leases.
•   $57 million, or 19%, increase in the alll of the c&amp;i portfolio was primary driven by the impact of the acquisition and loan growth within the portfolio along with an increase in nals within our energy related portfolios.
•   $11 million, or 45%, increase in the alll of the other consumer portfolio driven primarily by growth within the credit card portfolio.
partially offset by:
•   $18 million, or 22%, decline in the alll of the home equity portfolio. the decline was driven by a reduction in delinquent and nonaccrual loans.
•   $8 million, or 20%, decline in the alll of the residential mortgage portfolio, also driven by a reduction in delinquency rates within the portfolio.
the acl to total loans declined to 1.10% at december 31, 2016, compared to 1.33% at december 31, 2015. the reduction in the ratio can be attributed directly to the acquisition of the firstmerit loan portfolio. we believe the ratio is appropriate given the risk profile of our loan portfolio. we continue to focus on early identification of loans with changes in credit metrics and proactive action plans for these loans. given the combination of these noted positive and negative factors, we believe that our acl is appropriate and its coverage level is reflective of the quality of our portfolio and the current operating environment.
ncos any loan in any portfolio may be charged-off prior to the policies described below if a loss confirming event has occurred. loss confirming events include, but are not limited to, bankruptcy (unsecured), continued delinquency, foreclosure, or receipt of an asset valuation indicating a collateral deficiency where that asset is the sole source of repayment. additionally, discharged, collateral dependent non-reaffirmed debt in chapter 7 bankruptcy filings will result in a charge-off to estimated collateral value, less anticipated selling costs at the time of discharge.
c&i and cre loans are either charged-off or written down to net realizable value at 90-days past due with the exception of administrative small ticket lease delinquencies. automobile loans, rv and marine finance, and other consumer loans are generally charged-off at 120-days past due. first-lien and junior-lien home equity loans are charged-off to the estimated fair value of the collateral, less anticipated selling costs, at 150-days past due and 120-days past due, respectively. residential mortgages are charged-off to the estimated fair value of the collateral, less anticipated selling costs, at 150-days past due.

in assessing nco trends, it is helpful to understand the process of how commercial loans are treated as they deteriorate over time. the alll established is consistent with the level of risk associated with the original underwriting. as a part of our normal portfolio management process for commercial loans, the loan is periodically reviewed and the alll is increased or decreased based on the updated risk rating. in certain cases, the standard alll is determined to not be appropriate, and a specific reserve is established based on the projected cash flow or collateral value of the specific loan. charge-offs, if necessary, are generally recognized in a period after the specific alll was established. if the previously established alll exceeds that necessary to satisfactorily resolve the problem loan, a reduction in the overall level of the alll could be recognized. consumer loans are treated in much the same manner as commercial loans, with increasing reserve factors applied based on the risk characteristics of the loan, although specific reserves are not identified for consumer loans. in summary, if loan quality deteriorates, the typical credit sequence would be periods of reserve building, followed by periods of higher ncos as the previously established alll is utilized. additionally, an increase in the alll either precedes or is in conjunction with increases in nals. when a loan is classified as nal, it is evaluated for specific alll or charge-off. as a result, an increase in nals does not necessarily result in an increase in the alll or an expectation of higher future ncos.
all residential mortgage loans greater than 150-days past due are charged-down to the estimated value of the collateral, less anticipated selling costs. the remaining balance is in delinquent status until a modification can be completed, or the loan goes through the foreclosure process.
ncos increased $21 million, or 24%, in 2016. given the low level of c&i and cre nco's, there will continue to be some volatility on a period-to-period comparison basis.
market risk market risk refers to potential losses arising from changes in interest rates, foreign exchange rates, equity prices and commodity prices, including the correlation among these factors and their volatility. when the value of an instrument is tied to such external factors, the holder faces market risk. we are primarily exposed to interest rate risk as a result of offering a wide array of financial products to our customers and secondarily to price risk from trading securities, securities owned by our broker-dealer subsidiary, foreign exchange positions, equity investments, and investments in securities backed by mortgage loans.
interest rate risk overview we actively manage interest rate risk, as changes in market interest rates can have a significant impact on reported earnings. changes in market interest rates may result in changes in the fair market value of our financial instruments, cash flows, and net interest income. we seek to achieve consistent growth in net interest income and capital while managing volatility arising from shifts in market interest rates. alco oversees market risk management, establishing risk measures, limits, and policy guidelines for managing the amount of interest rate risk and its effect on net interest income and capital. according to these policies, responsibility for measuring and the management of interest rate risk resides in the corporate treasury group.
interest rate risk on our balance sheet consists of reprice, option, and basis risks. reprice risk results from differences in the maturity, or repricing, of asset and liability portfolios. option risk arises from embedded options present in the investment portfolio and in many financial instruments such as loan prepayment options, deposit early withdrawal options, and interest rate options. these options allow customers opportunities to benefit when market interest rates change, which typically results in higher costs or lower revenue for us. basis risk refers to the potential for changes in the underlying relationship between market rates or indices, which subsequently result in a narrowing of profit spread on an earning asset or liability. basis risk is also present in administered rate liabilities, such as interest-bearing checking accounts, savings accounts, and money market accounts where historical pricing relationships to market rates may change due to the level or directional change in market interest rates. the interest rate risk position is measured and monitored using risk management tools, including earnings simulation modeling and eve sensitivity analysis, which capture both short-term and long-term interest rate risk exposures. combining the results from these separate risk measurement processes allows a reasonably comprehensive view of our short-term and long-term interest rate risk.
interest rate risk measurement is calculated and reported to the alco monthly and roc at least quarterly. the information reported includes period-end results and identifies any policy limits exceeded, along with an assessment of the policy limit breach and the action plan and timeline for resolution, mitigation, or assumption of the risk.
we use two approaches to model interest rate risk: net interest income at risk (nii at risk) and eve.
nii at risk uses net interest income simulation analysis which involves forecasting net interest earnings under a variety of scenarios including changes in the level of interest rates, the shape of the yield curve, and spreads between market interest rates. the sensitivity of net interest income to changes in interest rates is measured using numerous interest rate scenarios including shocks, gradual ramps, curve flattening, curve steepening as well as forecasts of likely interest rates scenarios. modeling the sensitivity of net interest earnings to changes in market interest rates is highly dependent on numerous assumptions incorporated into the modeling process. to the extent that actual performance is different than what was assumed, actual net interest earnings sensitivity may be different than projected. the assumptions used in the models are our best estimates based on studies conducted by the treasury department. the treasury department uses a data warehouse to study interest rate risk at a transactional level and uses various ad-hoc reports to refine assumptions continuously. assumptions and methodologies regarding administered rate liabilities (e.g., savings, money market and interest-bearing checking accounts), balance trends, and repricing relationships reflect our best estimate of expected behavior and these assumptions are reviewed regularly.
we also have longer-term interest rate risk exposure, which may not be appropriately measured by earnings sensitivity analysis. alco uses economic value of equity at risk modeling, or eve, sensitivity analysis to study the impact of long-term cash flows on earnings and capital. eve involves discounting present values of all cash flows of on-balance sheet and off-balance sheet items under different interest rate scenarios. the discounted present value of all cash flows represents our eve. the analysis requires modifying the expected cash flows in each interest rate scenario, which will impact the discounted present value. the amount of base-case measurement and its sensitivity to shifts in the yield curve allow us to measure longer-term repricing and option risk in the balance sheet.

basis point change scenario   -25                  +100                 +200
the nii at risk results included in the table above reflect the analysis used monthly by management. it models gradual -25, +100 and +200 basis point parallel shifts in market interest rates, implied by the forward yield curve over the next twelve months. due to the current low level of short-term interest rates, the analysis reflects a declining interest rate scenario of 25 basis points, the point at which many assets and liabilities reach zero percent.
our nii at risk is within our board of director's policy limits for the +100 and +200 basis point scenarios. there is no policy limit for the -25 basis point scenario. the nii at risk reported shows that our earnings are more asset sensitive at december 31, 2016 than at december 31, 2015, as a result of the $4.9 billion notional value reduction in asset receive-fixed cash flow swaps, the introduction of new non-maturity deposit models in the 2016 first quarter, and the firstmerit acquisition in the third quarter.
as of december 31, 2016, we had $10.8 billion of notional value in receive-fixed cash flow swaps, which we use for asset and liability management purposes. at december 31, 2016, the following table shows the expected maturity for asset and liability receive-fixed cash flow swaps:

basis point change scenario   -25                  +100                 +200
the eve results included in the table above reflect the analysis used monthly by management. it models immediate -25, +100 and +200 basis point parallel shifts in market interest rates. due to the current low level of short-term interest rates, the analysis reflects a declining interest rate scenario of 25 basis points, the point at which many deposit costs reach zero percent.
we are within our board of director's policy limits for the +100 and +200 basis point scenarios. there is no policy limit for the -25 basis point scenario. the eve depicts a moderate level of long-term interest rate risk, which indicates the balance sheet is positioned favorably for rising interest rates.
(this section should be read in conjunction with note 7 of notes to the consolidated financial statements.)
at december 31, 2016, we had a total of $186 million of capitalized msrs representing the right to service $18.9 billion in mortgage loans. of this $186 million, $13.7 million was recorded using the fair value method and $172.5 million was recorded using the amortization method.
msr fair values are sensitive to movements in interest rates as expected future net servicing income depends on the projected outstanding principal balances of the underlying loans, which can be reduced by prepayments. prepayments usually increase when mortgage interest rates decline and decrease when mortgage interest rates rise. we have employed hedging strategies to reduce the risk of msr fair value changes or impairment. however, volatile changes in interest rates can diminish the effectiveness of these economic hedges. we report msr fair value adjustments net of hedge-related trading activity in the mortgage banking income category of noninterest income. changes in fair value between reporting dates are recorded as an increase or a decrease in mortgage banking income.
msrs recorded using the amortization method generally relate to loans originated with historically low interest rates, resulting in a lower probability of prepayments and, ultimately, impairment. msr assets are included in servicing rights in the consolidated financial statements.
price risk price risk represents the risk of loss arising from adverse movements in the prices of financial instruments that are carried at fair value and are subject to fair value accounting. we have price risk from trading securities, securities owned by our broker-dealer subsidiary, foreign exchange positions, equity investments, and investments in securities backed by mortgage loans. we have established loss limits on the trading portfolio, on the amount of foreign exchange exposure that can be maintained, and on the amount of marketable equity securities that can be held.
liquidity risk liquidity risk is the possibility of us being unable to meet current and future financial obligations in a timely manner. liquidity is managed to ensure stable, reliable, and cost-effective sources of funds to satisfy demand for credit, deposit withdrawals and investment opportunities. we consider core earnings, strong capital ratios, and credit quality essential for maintaining high credit ratings, which allows us cost-effective access to market-based liquidity. we rely on a large, stable core deposit base and a diversified base of wholesale funding sources to manage liquidity risk. the alco is appointed by the roc to oversee liquidity risk management and the establishment of liquidity risk policies and limits. the treasury department is responsible for identifying, measuring, and monitoring our liquidity profile. the position is evaluated daily, weekly, and monthly by analyzing the composition of all funding sources, reviewing projected liquidity commitments by future months, and identifying sources and uses of funds. the overall management of our liquidity position is also integrated into retail and commercial pricing policies to ensure a stable core deposit base. liquidity risk is reviewed and managed continuously for the bank and the parent company, as well as its subsidiaries. in addition, liquidity working groups meet regularly to identify and monitor liquidity positions, provide policy guidance, review funding strategies, and oversee the adherence to, and maintenance of, the contingency funding plans.
our primary source of liquidity is our core deposit base. core deposits comprised approximately 94% of total deposits at december 31, 2016. we also have available unused wholesale sources of liquidity, including advances from the fhlb of cincinnati, issuance through dealers in the capital markets, and access to certificates of deposit issued through brokers. liquidity is further provided by unencumbered, or unpledged, investment securities that totaled $15.0 billion as of december 31, 2016. the treasury department also prepares a contingency funding plan that details the potential erosion of funds in the event of a systemic financial market crisis or institutional-specific stress scenario. an example of an institution specific event would be a downgrade in our public credit rating by a rating agency due to factors such as deterioration in asset quality, a large charge to earnings, a decline in profitability or other financial measures, or a significant merger or acquisition. examples of systemic events unrelated to us that could have an effect on our access to liquidity would be terrorism or war, natural disasters, political events, or the default or bankruptcy of a major corporation, mutual fund or hedge fund. similarly, market speculation or rumors about us, or the banking industry in general, may adversely affect the cost and availability of normal funding sources. the liquidity contingency plan therefore outlines the process for addressing a liquidity crisis. the plan provides for an evaluation of funding sources under various market conditions. it also assigns specific roles and responsibilities and communication protocols for effectively managing liquidity through a problem period.

investment securities portfolio the expected weighted average maturities of our afs and htm portfolios are significantly shorter than their contractual maturities as reflected in note 5 and note 6 of the notes to consolidated financial statements. particularly regarding the mbs and abs, prepayments of principal and interest that historically occur in advance of scheduled maturities will shorten the expected life of these portfolios. the expected weighted average maturities, which take into account expected prepayments of principal and interest under existing interest rate conditions, are shown in the following table:

(for further information related to debt issuances please see note 11 of the notes to consolidated financial statements.)
to the extent we are unable to obtain sufficient liquidity through core deposits, we may meet our liquidity needs through sources of wholesale funding, asset securitization, or sale.  sources of wholesale funding include other domestic deposits of $250,000 or more, brokered deposits and negotiable cds, deposits in foreign offices, short-term borrowings, and long-term debt. at december 31, 2016, total wholesale funding was $16.2 billion, an increase from $11.4 billion at december 31, 2015. the increase from prior year-end primarily relates to an increase in short-term borrowings, brokered time deposits and negotiable cds, and long-term debt, partially offset by a decrease in deposits in foreign offices and domestic time deposits of $250,000 or more.
liquidity coverage ratio at december 31, 2016, we believe the bank had sufficient liquidity to be in compliance with the lcr requirements and to meet its cash flow obligations for the foreseeable future.

at december 31, 2016, the carrying value of investment securities pledged to secure public and trust deposits, trading account liabilities, u.s. treasury demand notes, and security repurchase agreements totaled $5.0 billion. there were no securities of a non-governmental single issuer that exceeded 10% of shareholders' equity at december 31, 2016.
parent company liquidity the parent company's funding requirements consist primarily of dividends to shareholders, debt service, income taxes, operating expenses, funding of nonbank subsidiaries, repurchases of our stock, and acquisitions. the parent company obtains funding to meet obligations from dividends and interest received from the bank, interest and dividends received from direct subsidiaries, net taxes collected from subsidiaries included in the federal consolidated tax return, fees for services provided to subsidiaries, and the issuance of debt securities.
at december 31, 2016 and december 31, 2015, the parent company had $1.8 billion and $0.9 billion, respectively, in cash and cash equivalents. the increase primarily relates to 2016 issuances of long-term debt and preferred stock.
on january 18, 2017, the board of directors declared a quarterly common stock cash dividend of $0.08 per common share. the dividend is payable on april 3 2017, to shareholders of record on march 20, 2017. based on the current quarterly dividend of $0.08 per common share, cash demands required for common stock dividends are estimated to be approximately $87 million per quarter. on january 18, 2017, the board of directors declared a quarterly series a, series, b, series, c, and series d preferred stock dividend payable on april 17, 2017 to shareholders of record on april 1, 2017. based on the current dividend, cash demands required for series a preferred stock are estimated to be approximately $8 million per quarter. cash demands required for series b preferred stock are expected to be less than $1 million per quarter. cash demands required for series c preferred stock are expected to be approximately $2 million per quarter. cash demands required for series d preferred stock are expected to be approximately $9 million per quarter.
during the fourth quarter, the bank declared a return of capital to the holding company of $225 million payable in the 2017 first quarter. to help meet any additional liquidity needs, the parent company may issue debt or equity securities from time to time. in april 2016, the bank issued $490 million of preferred stock to the holding company. in the 2016 third and fourth quarter, the bank declared and paid a preferred dividend of $7 million to the holding company.
off-balance sheet arrangements in the normal course of business, we enter into various off-balance sheet arrangements. these arrangements include commitments to extend credit, interest rate swaps, financial guarantees contained in standby letters-of-credit issued by the bank, and commitments by the bank to sell mortgage loans.
commitments to extend credit commitments to extend credit generally have fixed expiration dates, are variable-rate, and contain clauses that permit huntington to terminate or otherwise renegotiate the contracts in the event of a significant deterioration in the customer's credit quality. these arrangements normally require the payment of a fee by the customer, the pricing of which is based on prevailing market conditions, credit quality, probability of funding, and other relevant factors. since many of these commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon, the contract amounts are not necessarily indicative of future cash requirements. the interest rate risk arising from these financial instruments is insignificant as a result of their predominantly short-term, variable-rate nature. see note 21 for more information.
interest rate swaps balance sheet hedging activity is arranged to receive hedge accounting treatment and is classified as either fair value or cash flow hedges. fair value hedges are purchased to convert deposits and long-term debt from fixed-rate obligations to floating rate. cash flow hedges are also used to convert floating rate loans made to customers into fixed rate loans. see note 19 for more information.
standby letters-of-credit standby letters-of-credit are conditional commitments issued to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third-party. these guarantees are primarily issued to support public and private borrowing arrangements, including commercial paper, bond financing, and similar transactions. most of these arrangements mature within two years and are expected to expire without being drawn upon. standby letters-of-credit are included in the determination of the amount of risk-based capital that the parent company and the bank are required to hold. through our credit process, we monitor the credit risks of outstanding standby letters-of-credit. when it is probable that a standby letter-of-credit will be drawn and not repaid in full, a loss is recognized in the provision for credit losses. see note 21 for more information.
commitments to sell loans activity related to our mortgage origination activity supports the hedging of the mortgage pricing commitments to customers and the secondary sale to third parties. in addition, we have commitments to sell residential real estate loans. these contracts mature in less than one year. see note 21 for more information.
we believe that off-balance sheet arrangements are properly considered in our liquidity risk management process.

operational risk operational risk is the risk of loss due to human error; inadequate or failed internal systems and controls, including the use of financial or other quantitative methodologies that may not adequately predict future results; violations of, or noncompliance with, laws, rules, regulations, prescribed practices, or ethical standards; and external influences such as market conditions, fraudulent activities, disasters, and security risks. we continuously strive to strengthen our system of internal controls to ensure compliance with laws, rules, and regulations, and to improve the oversight of our operational risk. we actively and continuously monitor cyber-attacks such as attempts related to online deception and loss of sensitive customer data. we evaluate internal systems, processes and controls to mitigate loss from cyber-attacks and, to date, have not experienced any material losses.
our objective for managing cyber security risk is to avoid or minimize the impacts of external threat events or other efforts to penetrate our systems. we work to achieve this objective by hardening networks and systems against attack, and by diligently managing visibility and monitoring controls within our data and communications environment to recognize events and respond before the attacker has the opportunity to plan and execute on its own goals. to this end we employ a set of defense in-depth strategies, which include efforts to make us less attractive as a target and less vulnerable to threats, while investing in threat analytic capabilities for rapid detection and response. potential concerns related to cyber security may be escalated to our board-level technology committee, as appropriate. as a complement to the overall cyber security risk management, we use a number of internal training methods, both formally through mandatory courses and informally through written communications and other updates. internal policies and procedures have been implemented to encourage the reporting of potential phishing attacks or other security risks. we also use third-party services to test the effectiveness of our cyber security risk management framework, and any such third parties are required to comply with our policies regarding information security and confidentiality.
to mitigate operational risks, we have a senior management operational risk committee and a senior management legal, regulatory, and compliance committee. the responsibilities of these committees, among other duties, include establishing and maintaining management information systems to monitor material risks and to identify potential concerns, risks, or trends that may have a significant impact and ensuring that recommendations are developed to address the identified issues. in addition, we have a senior management model risk oversight committee that is responsible for policies and procedures describing how model risk is evaluated and managed and the application of the governance process to implement these practices throughout the enterprise. these committees report any significant findings and recommendations to the risk management committee. potential concerns may be escalated to our roc, as appropriate.
the firstmerit integration is inherently large and complex. our objective for managing execution risk is to minimize impacts to daily operations. we have an established integration management office led by senior management. responsibilities include central management, reporting, and escalation of key integration deliverables. in addition, a board level integration governance committee has been established to assist in the oversight of the integration of people, systems, and processes of firstmerit with huntington.
the goal of this framework is to implement effective operational risk techniques and strategies; minimize operational, fraud, and legal losses; minimize the impact of inadequately designed models and enhance our overall performance.
compliance risk financial institutions are subject to many laws, rules, and regulations at both the federal and state levels. these broad-based laws, rules, and regulations include, but are not limited to, expectations relating to anti-money laundering, lending limits, client privacy, fair lending, prohibitions against unfair, deceptive or abusive acts or practices, protections for military members as they enter active duty, and community reinvestment. additionally, the volume and complexity of recent regulatory changes have increased our overall compliance risk. as such, we utilize various resources to help ensure expectations are met, including a team of compliance experts dedicated to ensuring our conformance with all applicable laws, rules, and regulations. our colleagues receive training for several broad-based laws and regulations including, but not limited to, anti-money laundering and customer privacy. additionally, colleagues engaged in lending activities receive training for laws and regulations related to flood disaster protection, equal credit opportunity, fair lending, and/or other courses related to the extension of credit. we set a high standard of expectation for adherence to compliance management and seek to continuously enhance our performance.
capital
(this section should be read in conjunction with the regulatory matters section included in part 1, item 1 and note 22 of the notes to consolidated financial statements.)
both regulatory capital and shareholders' equity are managed at the bank and on a consolidated basis. we have an active program for managing capital and maintain a comprehensive process for assessing the company's overall capital adequacy. we believe our current levels of both regulatory capital and shareholders' equity are adequate.
regulatory capital we are subject to the basel iii capital requirements including the standardized approach for calculating risk-weighted assets in accordance with subpart d of the final capital rule. the following table presents risk-weighted assets and other financial data necessary to calculate certain financial ratios, including the common cet1 on a basel iii basis, which we use to measure capital adequacy.

all capital ratios were impacted by the $1.3 billion of goodwill created and the issuance of $2.8 billion of common stock as part of the firstmerit acquisition. the regulatory tier 1 risk-based and total risk-based capital ratios benefited from the issuance of $400 million and $200 million of class d preferred equity during the 2016 first and second quarters, respectively, and the issuance of $100 million of class c preferred equity during the 2016 third quarter in exchange for firstmerit preferred equity in conjunction with the acquisition. the total risk-based capital ratio was impacted by the repurchase of $40 million of trust preferred securities during the 2016 fourth quarter and $20 million of trust preferred securities during the 2016 third quarter, both of which were executed under the de minimis clause of the federal reserve's ccar rules. in addition, $5 million of trust preferred securities were acquired in the firstmerit acquisition and subsequently were redeemed.
shareholders' equity we generate shareholders' equity primarily through the retention of earnings, net of dividends and share repurchases. other potential sources of shareholders' equity include issuances of common and preferred stock. our objective is to maintain capital at an amount commensurate with our risk profile and risk tolerance objectives, to meet both regulatory and market expectations, and to provide the flexibility needed for future growth and business opportunities.
shareholders' equity totaled $10.3 billion at december 31, 2016, an increase of $3.7 billion when compared with december 31, 2015. in connection with the firstmerit merger, during the 2016 third quarter, we issued $2.8 billion of common stock and $0.1 billion of preferred stock. during the 2016 first and second quarter, we issued $400 million and $200 million of preferred stock, respectively. costs of $15 million related to the issuances are reported as a direct deduction from the face amount of the stock.
on june 29, 2016, we announced that the federal reserve did not object to our proposed capital actions included in our capital plan submitted to the federal reserve in april 2016 as part of the 2016 comprehensive capital analysis and review ("ccar"). these actions included a 14% increase in the quarterly dividend per common share to $0.08, starting in the fourth quarter of 2016. our capital plan also included the issuance of capital in connection with the acquisition of firstmerit corporation and continues the previously announced suspension of our share repurchase program.
dividends we consider disciplined capital management as a key objective, with dividends representing one component. our current capital ratios and expectations for continued earnings growth positions us to continue to actively explore additional capital management opportunities.
share repurchases from time to time the board of directors authorizes the company to repurchase shares of our common stock. although we announce when the board of directors authorizes share repurchases, we typically do not give any public notice before we repurchase our shares. future stock repurchases may be private or open-market repurchases, including block transactions, accelerated or delayed block transactions, forward transactions, and similar transactions. various factors determine the amount and timing of our share repurchases, including our capital requirements, the number of shares we expect to issue for employee benefit plans and acquisitions, market conditions (including the trading price of our stock), and regulatory and legal considerations, including the frb's response to our annual capital plan. our capital plan continues the previously announced suspension of our share repurchase program. there were no common shares repurchased during 2016.
business segment discussion overview our business segments are based on our internally-aligned segment leadership structure, which is how we monitor results and assess performance. we have five major business segments: consumer and business banking, commercial banking, commercial real estate and vehicle finance (crevf), regional banking and the huntington private client group (rbhpcg), and home lending. a treasury / other function includes technology and operations, other unallocated assets, liabilities, revenue, and expense.
business segment results are determined based upon our management reporting system, which assigns balance sheet and income statement items to each of the business segments. the process is designed around our organizational and management structure and, accordingly, the results derived are not necessarily comparable with similar information published by other financial institutions.
on august 16, 2016, we completed our acquisition of firstmerit corporation and segment results were impacted by the mid-quarter acquisition.
revenue sharing revenue is recorded in the business segment responsible for the related product or service. fee sharing is recorded to allocate portions of such revenue to other business segments involved in selling to, or providing service to customers. results of operations for the business segments reflect these fee sharing allocations.
expense allocation the management accounting process that develops the business segment reporting utilizes various estimates and allocation methodologies to measure the performance of the business segments. expenses are allocated to business segments using a two-phase approach. the first phase consists of measuring and assigning unit costs (activity-based costs) to activities related to product origination and servicing. these activity-based costs are then extended, based on volumes, with the resulting amount allocated to business segments that own the related products. the second phase consists of the allocation of overhead costs to all five business segments from treasury / other. we utilize a full-allocation methodology, where all treasury / other expenses, except reported significant items, and a small amount of other residual unallocated expenses, are allocated to the five business segments.
we use an active and centralized ftp methodology to attribute appropriate income to the business segments. the intent of the ftp methodology is to transfer interest rate risk from the business segments by providing matched duration funding of assets and liabilities. the result is to centralize the financial impact, management, and reporting of interest rate risk in the treasury / other function where it can be centrally monitored and managed. the treasury / other function charges (credits) an internal cost of funds for assets held in (or pays for funding provided by) each business segment. the ftp rate is based on prevailing market interest rates for comparable duration assets (or liabilities).
net income by business segment net income by business segment for the past three years is presented in the following table:
table 35 - net income (loss) by business segment
consumer and business banking      $358,146                    $236,298                    $172,199
treasury / other the treasury / other function includes revenue and expense related to assets, liabilities, and equity not directly assigned or allocated to one of the five business segments. other assets include investment securities and bank owned life insurance. the financial impact associated with our ftp methodology, as described above, is also included.
the net loss reported by the treasury / other function reflected a combination of factors:
•   the impact of our investment securities portfolios and the net impact of derivatives used to hedge interest rate sensitivity.
•   $282 million of firstmerit acquisition-related expense, $42 million reduction to litigation reserves, certain corporate administrative, and other miscellaneous expenses not allocated to other business segments.
•   the provision for income taxes for the business segments is calculated at a statutory 35% tax rate, though our overall effective tax rate is lower. as a result, treasury / other reflects a credit for income taxes representing the difference between the lower actual effective tax rate and the statutory tax rate used to allocate income taxes to the business segments.

consumer and business banking reported net income of $358 million in 2016. this was an increase of $122 million, or 52%, compared to the year-ago period. the increase in net income reflected a combination of factors described below.
•   $6.2 billion, or 21%, increase in total average deposits and a 10 basis point increase in deposit spreads, as a result of an increase in the ftp rates assigned to deposits.
•   $1.6 billion or 12%, increase in total average loans combined with an 18 basis point increase in loan spreads, as a result of a reduction in the ftp rates assigned to loans and improved effective rates.
•   the migration of the acquired portfolio to the originated portfolio, which required a reserve build, portfolio growth, and a $7 million, or 12%, increase in ncos.
•   $1.2 billion, or 13%, increase in consumer loans, primarily due to the acquisition and core growth in home equity lines of credit, credit card, and residential mortgages.
•   $0.4 billion, or 10%, increase in commercial loans, primarily due to the impact of the acquisition and core portfolio growth.
•   $6.2 billion, or 21%, increase due to the acquisition and core household growth.
•   $36 million, or 16%, increase in service charges on deposits accounts cards, primarily due to new customer acquisition.
•   $35 million, or 29%, increase in cards and payment processing income, primarily due to higher debit card-related transaction volumes and an increase in the number of households.
consumer and business banking reported net income of $236 million in 2015, compared with a net income of $172 million in 2014. the $64 million increase included a $33 million, or 43%, decrease in provision for credit losses, a $68 million, or 17%, increase noninterest income, and a $115 million, or 13%, increase in net interest income partially offset by a $35 million, or 37%, increase in provision for income taxes and a $117 million, or 12%, increase in noninterest expense.

commercial banking reported net income of $197 million in 2016. this was a decrease of $1 million, or less than one percent, compared to the year-ago period. the decrease in net income reflected a combination of factors described below.
•   18 basis point increase in the net interest margin due to a 13 basis point increase in the mix and yield on earning assets, of which 5 basis point increase in the net interest margin attributed to the mix in deposits stemming from a growth of $1.0 billion, or 18%, in average non-interest bearing demand deposits.
•   the migration of the acquired portfolio to the originated portfolio, which required a reserve build, portfolio growth, and a$5 million, or 23%, increase in ncos.
•   the third quarter 2016 acquisition of firstmerit.
•   $0.7 billion, or 19%, increase in the equipment finance loan and bond financing portfolio, which primarily reflected our focus on developing vertical strategies in huntington public capital, business aircraft, rail industry, lender finance, and syndications, as well as the 2015 first quarter acquisition of huntington technology finance.
•   $1.6 billion, or 15%, increase in core deposits, which primarily reflected a $1.0 billion, or 18%, increase in noninterest-bearing demand deposits. middle market accounts contributed $1.3 billion of the overall balance growth, while large corporate accounts declined $0.3 billion.
•   $10 million, or 17%, increase in service charges on deposit accounts and other treasury management related revenue, primarily due to growth in commercial card revenue, merchant services revenue, and cash management services.
•   $5 million, or 12%, increase in capital market fees, primarily due to growth in customer interest rate derivative contracts, foreign exchange, and commodities, partially offset by a decrease in underwriting fees.
partially offset by:
•   $3 million, or 7%, decrease in equipment and technology finance related fee income, primarily reflecting reduced gains on the sale of loans/leases and income on terminated leases.
•   $3 million, or 5%, decrease in insurance related fee income, primarily reflecting a decrease in property &amp; casualty insurance, as well as an increase in fee sharing to other business segments.
•   $1 million, or 6%, decrease in all other income, primarily reflecting a decrease in fee sharing from other business segments.
•   $31 million, or 18%, increase in personnel expense, primarily reflecting the 2016 third quarter acquisition of firstmerit. the increase also reflects additional cost from annual merit salary adjustments and incentives.
•   $5 million, or 63%, increase in fdic insurance premiums, primarily reflecting the 2016 third quarter acquisition of firstmerit.
•   $7 million, or 10%, increase in all other expense, primarily reflecting the 2016 third quarter acquisition of firstmerit.
commercial banking reported net income of $198 million in 2015, compared with net income of $153 million in 2014. the $45 million increase included a $73 million, or 24%, increase in net interest income, a $50 million, or 24%, increase in noninterest income, and a $35 million, or 14%, increase in noninterest expense partially offset by $24 million, or 30%, increase in provision for income taxes and a $18 million, or 57%, increase in provision for credit losses.

crevf reported net income of $203 million in 2016. this was an increase of $38 million, or 23%, compared to the year-ago period. the increase in net income reflected a combination of factors described below.
•   $1.8 billion, or 20%, increase in average automobile loans, primarily due to continued strong origination volume, which has exceeded $1.0 billion for each of the last 8 quarters. this increase also reflected $0.6 billion of indirect automobile loans acquired from firstmerit and the $0.8 billion automobile securitization and sale completed in 2015 second quarter.
•   $0.7 billion indirect recreational loans acquired from firstmerit.
partially offset by:
•   a 1 basis point decrease in the net interest margin as the impact of competitive pricing pressures was mostly offset by higher spreads on the acquired firstmerit portfolios.
•   $2 million, 46%, increase in gains on sales of loans related to 2016 fourth quarter balance sheet optimization strategies.
•   $7 million, or 21%, increase in personnel costs due to a higher number of employees, resulting from higher production and business development activities as well as additional colleagues added from firstmerit.
crevf reported net income of $165 million in 2015, compared with a net income of $196 million in 2014. the $31 million decrease included a $58 million, or 109%, increase in the provision for credit losses, $3 million, or 10%, increase in noninterest income partially offset by a $2 million, or less than one percent, increase in net interest income and a $17 million, or 16%, decrease in provision for income taxes.

rbhpcg reported net income of $69 million in 2016. this was an increase of $31 million, or 81%, when compared to the year-ago period. the increase in net income reflected a combination of factors described below.
•   $0.9 billion, or 13%, increase in average total deposits combined with a $0.4 billion, or 11% increase in average total loans primarily due to the firstmerit acquisition. in addition, the deposit balance increase reflected strong growth in the new private client account interest checking product as well as commercial deposit balances, while the loan balance increase reflected strong growth in both commercial loans and portfolio mortgage loans.
•   $4 million, or 4%, increase in trust services, due to increased revenue from the firstmerit acquisition, partially offset by the reduction in revenue resulting from the sale of hasi and haa in the 2015 fourth quarter.
•   $3 million, or 66%, increase in amortization of intangible assets, primarily due to the firstmerit acquisition.
partially offset by:
•   $2 million, or 47%, decrease in professional services related from the 2015 fourth quarter sale of hasi and haa.

•   $6.8 billion, or 158%, increase in average savings deposits, reflecting continued banker focus across all segments on obtaining our customers' full deposit relationship.
•   $3.9 billion, or 53%, increase in average total debt, reflecting a $2.1 billion, or 402%, increase in average short-term borrowings and a $1.8 billion, or 27%, increase in average long-term debt. the increase in average long-term debt reflected the issuance of $2.0 billion of holding company-level senior debt during 2016.
•   $1.3 billion, or 46%, increase in average brokered deposits and negotiable cds, impacted by the firstmerit acquisition.
partially offset by:
•   $1.2 billion, or 6%, decrease in average money market deposits. during the 2016 third quarter, changes to commercial accounts resulted in the reclassification of $2.8 billion of deposits from money market into interest bearing demand deposits. this decrease was partially offset by the impact of the firstmerit acquisition.

reported noninterest expense for the 2016 fourth quarter increased $183 million, or 37%, from the year-ago quarter. including the impact of the firstmerit acquisition, changes in reported noninterest expense primarily reflect:
•   $71 million, or 25%, increase in personnel costs, reflecting an $84 million increase in salaries related to the may implementation of annual merit increases and a 29% increase in the number of average full-time equivalent employees, partially offset by a $13 million decrease in benefits expense related to an $18 million gain on the settlement of a portion of the firstmerit pension plan liability during the 2016 fourth quarter.
•   $8 million, or 19%, increase in other expense, primarily reflecting a $42 million reduction to litigation reserves, which was mostly offset by a $40 million contribution in the 2016 fourth quarter to achieve the philanthropic plans related to firstmerit.
•   $28 million, or 88%, increase in equipment expense, reflecting the impact of the firstmerit acquisition.
•   $25 million, or 39%, increase in outside data processing and other services expense, primarily related to ongoing technology investments and the impact of the firstmerit acquisition.
•   $10 million, or 272%, increase in amortization of intangibles reflecting the firstmerit acquisition.
•   $10 million, or 78%, increase in professional services, primarily related to $9 million of acquisition-related significant items in the 2016 fourth quarter.
•   $9 million, or 78%, increase in marketing, related to the firstmerit acquisition.
provision for income taxes the provision for income taxes in the 2016 fourth quarter was $74 million and $56 million in the 2015 fourth quarter. the effective tax rates for the 2016 fourth quarter and 2015 fourth quarter were 23.6% and 23.8%, respectively. at december 31, 2016, we had a net federal deferred tax asset of $76 million and a net state deferred tax asset of $41 million.
credit quality ncos net charge-offs (ncos) increased $22 million, or 99%, to $44 million. ncos represented an annualized 0.26% of average loans and leases in the current quarter, unchanged from the prior quarter but up from 0.18% in the year-ago quarter. commercial charge-offs continued to be positively impacted by recoveries in the cre portfolio and broader continued successful workout strategies, while consumer charge-offs remained within our expected range.
nals overall asset quality remains strong, with modest volatility. overall consumer credit metrics, led by the home equity and residential portfolios, continue to show an improving trend, while the commercial portfolios continue to experience some quarter-to-quarter volatility based on the absolute low level of problem loans. the firstmerit portfolio quality, composition, and geographic distribution was similar to the legacy huntington portfolio. the only new loan classification is the rv/marine portfolio.
nonaccrual loans and leases (nals) of $423 million represented 0.63% of total loans and leases, down from 0.74% a year ago. the decrease in the nal ratio reflected a 14% year-over-year increase in nals, more than offset by the impact of the 33% year-over-year increase in total loans. nonperforming assets (npas) of $481 million represented 0.72% of total loans and leases and oreo, down from 0.79% a year ago. the nal ratio increased 2 basis points from the prior quarter, while the npa ratio remained unchanged.
(this section should be read in conjunction with note 4 of the notes to consolidated financial statements.)
the period-end allowance for credit losses (acl) as a percentage of total loans and leases decreased to 1.10% from 1.33% a year ago, while the acl as a percentage of period-end total nals decreased to 174% from 180%. the decline in the coverage ratios is primarily a function of the purchase accounting impact associated with firstmerit.

(5)   net income applicable to common shares excluding expense for amortization of intangibles for the period divided by average tangible common shareholders' equity. average tangible common shareholders' equity equals average total common shareholders' equity less average intangible assets and goodwill. expense for amortization of intangibles and average intangible assets are net of deferred tax liability, and calculated assuming a 35% tax rate.
(6)   noninterest expense less amortization of intangibles and goodwill impairment divided by the sum of fte net interest income and noninterest income excluding securities gains (losses).
(8)   tangible common equity (total common equity less goodwill and other intangible assets) divided by tangible assets (total assets less goodwill and other intangible assets). other intangible assets are net of deferred tax, and calculated assuming a 35% tax rate.
(9)   tangible equity (total equity less goodwill and other intangible assets) divided by tangible assets (total assets less goodwill and other intangible assets). other intangible assets are net of deferred tax, and calculated assuming a 35% tax rate.
(10)   on january 1, 2015, we became subject to the basel iii capital requirements and the standardized approach for calculating risk-weighted assets in accordance with subpart d of the final capital rule.
additional disclosures forward-looking statements this report, including md&a, contains certain forward-looking statements, including, but not limited to, certain plans, expectations, goals, projections, and statements, which are not historical facts and are subject to numerous assumptions, risks, and uncertainties. statements that do not describe historical or current facts, including statements about beliefs and expectations, are forward-looking statements. forward-looking statements may be identified by words such as expect, anticipate, believe, intend, estimate, plan, target, goal, or similar expressions, or future or conditional verbs such as will, may, might, should, would, could, or similar variations. the forward-looking statements are intended to be subject to the safe harbor provided by section 27a of the securities act of 1933, section 21e of the securities exchange act of 1934, and the private securities litigation reform act of 1995.
while there is no assurance that any list of risks and uncertainties or risk factors is complete, below are certain factors which could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained or implied in the forward-looking statements: changes in general economic, political, or industry conditions; uncertainty in u.s. fiscal and monetary policy, including the interest rate policies of the federal reserve board; volatility and disruptions in global capital and credit markets; movements in interest rates; competitive pressures on product pricing and services; success, impact, and timing of our business strategies, including market acceptance of any new products or services implementing our "fair play" banking philosophy; the nature, extent, timing, and results of governmental actions, examinations, reviews, reforms, regulations, and interpretations, including those related to the dodd-frank wall street
reform and consumer protection act and the basel iii regulatory capital reforms, as well as those involving the occ, federal reserve, fdic, and cfpb; the possibility that the anticipated benefits of the merger with firstmerit corporation are not realized when expected or at all, including as a result of the impact of, or problems arising from, the integration of the two companies or as a result of the strength of the economy and competitive factors in the areas where we do business; diversion of management's attention from ongoing business operations and opportunities; potential adverse reactions or changes to business or employee relationships, including those resulting from the completion of the merger with firstmerit corporation; our ability to complete the integration of firstmerit corporation successfully; and other factors that may affect our future results.

non-gaap financial measures this document contains gaap financial measures and non-gaap financial measures where management believes it to be helpful in understanding huntington's results of operations or financial position. where non-gaap financial measures are used, the comparable gaap financial measure, as well as the reconciliation to the comparable gaap financial measure, can be found herein.
significant items from time-to-time, revenue, expenses, or taxes are impacted by items judged by us to be outside of ordinary banking activities and/or by items that, while they may be associated with ordinary banking activities, are so unusually large that their outsized impact is believed by us at that time to be infrequent or short-term in nature. we refer to such items as significant items. most often, these significant items result from factors originating outside the company; e.g., regulatory actions / assessments, windfall gains, changes in accounting principles, one-time tax assessments / refunds, litigation actions, etc. in other cases, they may result from our decisions associated with significant corporate actions outside of the ordinary course of business; e.g., merger / restructuring charges, recapitalization actions, goodwill impairment, etc.
even though certain revenue and expense items are naturally subject to more volatility than others due to changes in market and economic environment conditions, as a general rule volatility alone does not define a significant item. for example, changes in the provision for credit losses, gains / losses from investment activities, asset valuation writedowns, etc., reflect ordinary banking activities and are, therefore, typically excluded from consideration as a significant item.
we believe the disclosure of significant items provides a better understanding of our performance and trends to ascertain which of such items, if any, to include or exclude from an analysis of our performance; i.e., within the context of determining how that performance differed from expectations, as well as how, if at all, to adjust estimates of future performance accordingly. to this end, we adopted a practice of listing significant items in our external disclosure documents; e.g., earnings press releases, investor presentations, forms 10-q and 10-k.
significant items for any particular period are not intended to be a complete list of items that may materially impact current or future period performance.
fully-taxable equivalent basis interest income, yields, and ratios on a fte basis are considered non-gaap financial measures.  management believes net interest income on a fte basis provides an insightful picture of the interest margin for comparison purposes.  the fte basis also allows management to assess the comparability of revenue arising from both taxable and tax-exempt sources.  the fte basis assumes a federal statutory tax rate of 35 percent. we encourage readers to consider the consolidated financial statements and other financial information contained in this form 10-k in their entirety, and not to rely on any single financial measure.
non-regulatory capital ratios in addition to capital ratios defined by banking regulators, the company considers various other measures when evaluating capital utilization and adequacy, including:
•   tangible common equity to risk-weighted assets using basel iii definitions.
these non-regulatory capital ratios are viewed by management as useful additional methods of reflecting the level of capital available to withstand unexpected market conditions. additionally, presentation of these ratios allows readers to compare the company's capitalization to other financial services companies. these ratios differ from capital ratios defined by banking regulators principally in that the numerator excludes preferred securities, the nature and extent of which varies among different financial services companies. these ratios are not defined in generally accepted accounting principles ("gaap") or federal banking regulations. as a result, these non-regulatory capital ratios disclosed by the company are considered non-gaap financial measures.
because there are no standardized definitions for these non-regulatory capital ratios, the company's calculation methods may differ from those used by other financial services companies. also, there may be limits in the usefulness of these measures to investors. as a result, the company encourages readers to consider the consolidated financial statements and other financial information contained in this form 10-k in their entirety, and not to rely on any single financial measure.
risk factors more information on risk is set forth under the heading risk factors included in item 1a and incorporated by reference into this md&a. additional information regarding risk factors can also be found in the risk management and capital discussion, as well as the regulatory matters section included in item 1 and incorporated by reference into the md&a.
critical accounting policies and use of significant estimates our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with gaap. the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires us to establish accounting policies and make estimates that affect amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements. note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements, which is incorporated by reference into this md&a, describes the significant accounting policies we use in our consolidated financial statements.
an accounting estimate requires assumptions and judgments about uncertain matters that could have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements. estimates are made under facts and circumstances at a point in time, and changes in those facts and circumstances could produce results substantially different from those estimates. the most significant accounting policies and estimates and their related application are discussed below.
allowance for credit losses our acl of $0.7 billion at december 31, 2016, represents our estimate of probable credit losses inherent in our loan and lease portfolio and our unfunded loan commitments and letters of credit. we regularly review our acl for appropriateness by performing on-going evaluations of the loan and lease portfolio. in doing so, we consider factors such as the differing economic risk associated with each loan category, the financial condition of specific borrowers, the level of delinquent loans, the value of any collateral and, where applicable, the existence of any guarantees or other documented support. we also evaluate the impact of changes in interest rates and overall economic conditions on the ability of borrowers to meet their financial obligations when quantifying our exposure to credit losses and assessing the appropriateness of our acl at each reporting date. there is no certainty that our acl will be appropriate over time to cover losses in the portfolio because of unanticipated adverse changes in the economy, market conditions, or events adversely affecting specific customers, industries, or markets. if the credit quality of our customer base materially deteriorates, the risk profile of a market, industry, or group of customers changes materially, or if the acl is not appropriate, our net income and capital could be materially adversely affected which, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.
valuation of financial instruments assets and liabilities carried at fair value inherently result in a higher degree of financial statement volatility. assets measured at fair value include certain loans held for sale, loans held for investment, available-for-sale and trading securities, certain securitized automobile loans, msrs, derivatives, and certain short-term borrowings. at december 31, 2016, approximately $15.8 billion of our assets and $0.1 billion of our liabilities were recorded at fair value on a recurring basis. in addition to the above mentioned on-going fair value measurements, fair value is also used for recording business combinations and measuring other non-recurring financial assets and liabilities.
at the end of each quarter, we assess the valuation hierarchy for each asset or liability measured at fair value. as necessary, assets or liabilities may be transferred within fair value hierarchy levels due to changes in availability of observable market inputs to measure fair value at the measurement date.
where available, we use quoted market prices to determine fair value. if quoted market prices are not available, fair value is determined, using either internally developed or independent third-party valuation models, based on inputs that are either directly observable or derived from market data. these inputs include, but are not limited to, interest rate yield curves, option volatilities, or option adjusted spreads. where neither quoted market prices nor observable market data are available, fair value is determined using valuation models that feature one or more significant unobservable inputs based on management's expectation that market participants
would use in determining the fair value of the asset or liability. the determination of appropriate unobservable inputs requires exercise of significant judgment. a significant portion of our assets and liabilities that are reported at fair value are measured based on quoted market prices or observable market/ independent inputs.
the following is a description of the significant estimates used in the valuation of financial assets and liabilities for which quoted market prices and observable market parameters are not available.
municipal and asset-backed securities the municipal securities portion that is classified as level 3 uses significant estimates to determine the fair value of these securities which results in greater subjectivity. the fair value is determined by utilizing third-party valuation services. the third-party service provider reviews credit worthiness, prevailing market rates, analysis of similar securities, and projected cash flows. the third-party service provider also incorporates industry and general economic conditions into their analysis. huntington evaluates the analysis provided for reasonableness.
our cdo preferred securities portfolios are measured at fair value using a valuation methodology involving use of significant unobservable inputs and are thus, classified as level 3 in the fair value hierarchy. the private label cmo securities portfolio is subjected to a monthly review of the projected cash flows, while the cash flows of our cdo preferred securities portfolio is reviewed quarterly. these reviews are supported with analysis from independent third parties, and are used as a basis for impairment analysis.
cdo preferred securities are cdos backed by a pool of debt securities issued by financial institutions. the collateral generally consists of trust-preferred securities and subordinated debt securities issued by banks, bank holding companies, and insurance companies. a full cash flow analysis is used to estimate fair values and assess impairment for each security within this portfolio. we engage a third-party pricing specialist with direct industry experience in pooled-trust-preferred securities valuations to provide assistance in estimating the fair value and expected cash flows for each security in this portfolio. the pd of each issuer and the market discount rate are the most significant inputs in determining fair value. management evaluates the pd assumptions provided by the third-party pricing specialist by comparing the current pd to the assumptions used the previous quarter, actual defaults and deferrals in the current period, and trend data on certain financial ratios of the issuers. huntington also evaluates the assumptions related to discount rates. relying on cash flows is necessary because there was a lack of observable transactions in the market and many of the original sponsors or dealers for these securities are no longer able to provide a fair value that is compliant with asc 820.
derivatives used for hedging purposes derivatives designated as qualified hedges are tested for hedge effectiveness on a quarterly basis. assessments are made at the inception of the hedge and on a recurring basis to determine whether the derivative used in the hedging transaction has been and is expected to continue to be highly effective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows of the hedged item. a statistical regression analysis is performed to measure the effectiveness.
if, based on the assessment, a derivative is not expected to be a highly effective hedge or it has ceased to be a highly effective hedge, hedge accounting is discontinued as of the quarter the hedge is not highly effective. as the statistical regression analysis requires the use of estimates regarding the amount and timing of future cash flows which are sensitive to significant changes in future periods based on changes in market rates; we consider this a critical accounting estimate.
loans held for sale huntington has elected to apply the fair value option to certain residential mortgage loans that are classified as held for sale at origination. the fair value of such loans is estimated based on the inputs that include prices of mortgage backed securities adjusted for other variables such as, interest rates, expected credit defaults and market discount rates. the adjusted value reflects the price we expect to receive from the sale of such loans.
certain consumer and commercial loans are classified as held for sale and are accounted for at the lower of amortized cost or fair value. the determination of fair value for these consumer loans is based on observable prices for similar products or discounted expected cash flows, which takes into consideration factors such as future interest rates, prepayment speeds, default and loss curves, and market discount rates.
mortgage servicing rights retained rights to service mortgage loans are recognized as a separate and distinct asset at the time the loans are sold. mortgage servicing rights ("msrs") are initially recorded at fair value at the time the related loans are sold and subsequently re-measured at each reporting date under either the fair value or amortization method. the election of the fair value or amortization method is made at the time each servicing asset is established. all newly created msrs since 2009 are recorded using the amortization method. any increase or decrease in fair value of msrs accounted for under the fair value method, as well as any amortization and/or impairment of msrs recorded under the amortization method, is reflected in earnings in the period that the changes occur. msrs are subject to
interest rate risk in that their fair value will fluctuate as a result of changes in the interest rate environment. fair value is determined based upon the application of an income approach valuation model. we use an independent third-party valuation model, which incorporates assumptions in estimating future cash flows. these assumptions include prepayment speeds, payoffs, and changes in valuation inputs and assumptions. the reasonableness of these pricing models is validated on a minimum of a quarterly basis by at least one independent external service broker valuation. because the fair values of msrs are significantly impacted by the use of estimates, the use of different assumptions can result in different estimated fair values of those msrs.
contingent liabilities we are a party to various claims, litigation, and legal proceedings resulting from ordinary business activities relating to our current and/or former operations. we estimate and provide for potential losses that may arise out of litigation and regulatory proceedings to the extent that such losses are probable and can be reasonably estimated. significant judgment is required in making these estimates and our final liabilities may ultimately be more or less than the current estimate. our total estimated liability in respect of litigation and regulatory proceedings is determined on a case-by-case basis and represents an estimate of probable losses after considering, among other factors, the progress of each case or proceeding, our experience and the experience of others in similar cases or proceedings, and the opinions and views of legal counsel. litigation exposure represents a key area of judgment and is subject to uncertainty and certain factors outside of our control.
income taxes the calculation of our provision for income taxes is complex and requires the use of estimates and judgments. we have two accruals for income taxes: (1) our income tax payable represents the estimated net amount currently due to the federal, state, and local taxing jurisdictions, net of any reserve for potential audit issues and any tax refunds and the net receivable balance is reported as a component of accrued income and other assets in our consolidated balance sheet; (2) our deferred federal and state income tax and related valuation accounts, reported as a component of accrued income and other assets, represents the estimated impact of temporary differences between how we recognize our assets and liabilities under gaap, and how such assets and liabilities are recognized under federal and state tax law.
in the ordinary course of business, we operate in various taxing jurisdictions and are subject to income and non-income taxes. the effective tax rate is based in part on our interpretation of the relevant current tax laws. we believe the aggregate liabilities related to taxes are appropriately reflected in the consolidated financial statements. we review the appropriate tax treatment of all transactions taking into consideration statutory, judicial, and regulatory guidance in the context of our tax positions. in addition, we rely on various tax opinions, recent tax audits, and historical experience.
from time-to-time, we engage in business transactions that may affect our tax liabilities. where appropriate, we obtain opinions of outside experts and assess the relative merits and risks of the appropriate tax treatment of business transactions taking into account statutory, judicial, and regulatory guidance in the context of the tax position. however, changes to our estimates of accrued taxes can occur due to changes in tax rates, implementation of new business strategies, resolution of issues with taxing authorities regarding previously taken tax positions, and newly enacted statutory, judicial, and regulatory guidance. such changes could affect the amount of our accrued taxes and could be material to our financial position and/or results of operations. (see note 17 of the notes to consolidated financial statements.)
deferred tax assets at december 31, 2016, we had a net federal deferred tax asset of $76 million and a net state deferred tax asset of $41 million. a valuation allowance is provided when it is more-likely-than-not some portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. all available evidence, both positive and negative, was considered to determine whether, based on the weight of that evidence, impairment should be recognized. our forecast process includes judgmental and quantitative elements that may be subject to significant change. if our forecast of taxable income within the carryforward periods available under applicable law is not sufficient to cover the amount of net deferred tax assets, such assets may be impaired. based on our analysis of both positive and negative evidence and our ability to offset the net deferred tax assets against our forecasted future taxable income, there was no impairment of the net deferred tax assets at december 31, 2016, other than a valuation allowance relating to state net operating loss carryovers.
goodwill and intangible assets the acquisition method of accounting requires that acquired assets and liabilities are recorded at their fair values as of the date of acquisition. this often involves estimates based on third party valuations or internal valuations based on discounted cash flow analyses or other valuation techniques, all of which are inherently subjective. acquisitions typically result in goodwill, the amount by which the cost of net assets acquired in a business combination exceeds their fair value, which is subject to impairment testing at least annually. the amortization of identified intangible assets recognized in a business combination is based upon the estimated economic benefits to be received over their economic life, which is also subjective. customer attrition rates that are based on historical
experience are used to determine the estimated economic life of certain intangibles assets, including but not limited to, customer deposit intangibles. refer to note 8 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further information regarding these items.
recent accounting pronouncements and developments note 2 to consolidated financial statements discusses new accounting pronouncements adopted during 2016 and the expected impact of accounting pronouncements recently issued but not yet required to be adopted. to the extent the adoption of new accounting standards materially affect financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity, the impacts are discussed in the applicable section of this md&a and the notes to consolidated financial statements.

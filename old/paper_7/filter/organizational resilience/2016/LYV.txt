executive overview live nation had another exceptional year in 2016, a year of market and product expansion while achieving new levels in our key financial and operational metrics. our total revenue for the year was $8.4 billion, making this our eleventh consecutive year of revenue growth, so once again, live nation delivered its highest revenue ever this year. our concerts, sponsorship & advertising and ticketing segments all reported revenue growth for the sixth consecutive year as a result of both our highest level of attendance at our concerts and record ticket sales in our ticketing business. more than ever, we are seeing the unique power of the live concert experience and the importance of technology to enable fans around the world to connect with artists and each other. our overall revenue in 2016 increased by $1.1 billion on a reported basis as compared to last year, or $1.2
billion, a 17% increase, without the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates. the increase was largely driven by growth in our concerts segment with an increase in the number of events, fans, and the revenue we are generating onsite at the events. ticketing increased as well, with strong growth in concert event sales both in the united states and our international markets as well as the continued expansion of our resale business. additionally, sponsorship & advertising again delivered strong growth over 2015 due to a number of new strategic multi-year deals and continued growth of our festival sales. as the leading global live event and ticketing company, we believe that we are well-positioned to provide the best service to artists, teams, fans and venues and therefore drive growth across all our businesses. we believe that by leveraging our leadership position in the entertainment industry to reach fans through the live concert experience, we will sell more tickets and uniquely engage more advertising partners. by advancing innovation in ticketing technology, we will continue to improve the fan experience by offering increased and more diversified choices in an expanded ticketing marketplace. this gives us a compelling opportunity to grow our fan base and our results.
our concerts segment was the largest contributor to our overall revenue growth, with an increase of $909.1 million on a reported basis as compared to last year, or $1.0 billion, a 20% increase, without the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates. this higher revenue was partially due to additional stadium and arena shows both in the united states and internationally, including tours by beyonceÃÅ, rihanna, coldplay and guns n' roses. we continued to expand our global festival portfolio in 2016, adding brands like governors ball to our leading roster and growing total festival attendance by 15%. nearly 17 million fans attended our amphitheater shows throughout the year, a record for live nation, with florida georgia line, dave matthews band and luke bryan all playing to sold out audiences over the summer. the results of our amphitheater onsite business accelerated in 2016 with the introduction of higher-end beer and wine options, premium brand-name food kiosks and restaurants, and "grab and go" options. these programs helped grow our ancillary revenue per fan by over 9% in 2016. in our international business, our new promotions business in germany had an outstanding first year, adding three quarters of a million new fans. we also launched 20 festival apps in europe and saw our festival attendance grow by 18% year-over-year internationally. our operating income for the year improved over 2015 largely due to the impact of these business improvements and strategic initiatives mentioned above. we will continue to look for expansion opportunities, both domestically and internationally, as well as ways to market our events more effectively, in order to continue to expand our fan base and geographic reach and to sell more tickets and onsite products.
our sponsorship & advertising segment revenue for the year was up $43.9 million on a reported basis as compared to last year, or $50.7 million, a 15% increase, without the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates. higher revenue resulted from new clients and increased festival sponsorships. in 2016, we extended agreements with several major clients for multi-year deals that utilize our venue, media and ticketing assets, providing our clients with a unique opportunity to advertise their brands and reward their customers with the rich diversity of live music. we believe this was driven in part by our focus on introducing new amphitheater and festival products as well as adding new sales categories. operating income for the year improved by 4% on a reported basis which was driven by higher revenue, partially offset by the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates. we believe that our extensive onsite and online reach, global venue distribution network, artist relationships, ticketing operations and live entertainment content are the key to securing long-term sponsorship agreements with major brands, and we plan to expand these assets while extending further into new markets internationally.
our ticketing segment revenue for the year increased by $188.4 million on a reported basis as compared to last year, or $212.0 million, a 13% increase, without the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates. this increase was largely due to a 7% growth in primary ticket sales globally, largely driven by increased sales for concert events in north america as well as europe. as we continued to improve our platform and provide consumers with a broader range of secure ticketing options, visits to our websites increased by 9% in 2016 with 63% of these visits occurring on mobile devices. our resale business also grew during the year in north america, europe and australia, with gross transaction value, or gtv, improving by 24% on a reported basis year-over-year. on the mobile front, 27% of our total tickets were sold via mobile and tablet devices compared to 21% in 2015. our total mobile ticket sales increased by 36% year-over-year driven, at least in part, by several major improvements we made to our apps and mobile web experience in the year. in 2016, we continued to invest and innovate our ticketing portfolio, opening our platform to new distribution partners and providing clients with new tools. operating results for the year increased over 2015, largely as a result of strong primary ticket sales as well as our growing resale ticketing business. we will continue to implement new features to drive further expansion of mobile ticket transactions and invest in initiatives aimed at improving the ticket search, purchase and transfer process. as a result, we expect to continue to attract more ticket buyers and enhance the overall fan and venue client experience.
our artist nation segment revenue for the year decreased by $12.5 million on a reported basis as compared to last year, or $7.6 million, a 2% decrease, without the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates, largely driven by the timing of event activity. artist nation's operating results were lower than 2015, again driven by lower event activity. our artist nation segment is focused on managing its existing clients as well as developing new relationships with top artists and extending the various services it provides.
we continue to be optimistic about the long-term potential of our company and are focused on the key elements of our business model: expand our concert platform, sell more tickets and invest in product improvements, grow resale ticket volume and expand sponsorship and advertising results.
concerts our concerts segment principally involves the global promotion of live music events in our owned or operated venues and in rented third-party venues, the operation and management of music venues, the production of music festivals across the world and the creation of associated content. while our concerts segment operates year-round, we experience higher revenue during the second and third quarters due to the seasonal nature of shows at our outdoor amphitheaters and festivals, which primarily occur from may through october. revenue and related costs for events are generally deferred and recognized when the event occurs. all advertising costs incurred during the year for shows in future years are expensed at the end of the year.
concerts direct operating expenses include artist fees, event production costs, show-related marketing and advertising expenses, along with other costs.
to judge the health of our concerts segment, we primarily monitor the number of confirmed events in our network of owned or operated and third-party venues, talent fees, average paid attendance and advance ticket sales. in addition, at our owned or operated venues and festivals, we monitor ancillary revenue per fan and premium ticket sales. for business that is conducted in foreign markets, we also compare the operating results from our foreign operations to prior periods without the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates.
sponsorship & advertising our sponsorship & advertising segment employs a sales force that creates and maintains relationships with sponsors through a combination of strategic, international, national and local opportunities that allow businesses to reach customers through our concerts, venue, artist relationship and ticketing assets, including advertising on our websites. we drive increased advertising scale to further monetize our concerts platform through rich media offerings including advertising associated with live streaming and music-related content. we work with our corporate clients to help create marketing programs that drive their business goals and connect their brands directly with fans and artists. we also develop, book and produce custom events or programs for our clients' specific brands which are typically experienced exclusively by the clients' consumers. these custom events can involve live music events with talent and media, using both online and traditional outlets. we typically experience higher revenue in the second and third quarters, as a large portion of sponsorships are associated with shows at our outdoor amphitheaters and festivals which primarily occur from may through october.
to judge the health of our sponsorship & advertising segment, we primarily review the revenue generated through sponsorship arrangements, the percentage of expected revenue under contract and online advertising revenue through our websites. for business that is conducted in foreign markets, we also compare the operating results from our foreign operations to prior periods without the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates.
ticketing our ticketing segment is primarily an agency business that sells tickets for events on behalf of our clients and retains a portion of the service charge for these services. we sell tickets through websites, mobile apps, ticket outlets and telephone call centers. our ticketing sales are impacted by fluctuations in the availability of events for sale to the public, which may vary depending upon scheduling by our clients. we also offer ticket resale services, sometimes referred to as secondary ticketing, primarily through our integrated inventory platform, league/team platforms and other platforms internationally. our ticketing segment also manages our online activities including enhancements to our websites and product offerings. through our websites, we sell tickets to our own events as well as tickets for our clients and provide event information. revenue related to ticketing service charges is recognized when the ticket is sold except for our own events where our concert promoters control ticketing and then the revenue is deferred and recognized as the event occurs.
to judge the health of our ticketing segment, we primarily review the gross transaction value and the number of tickets sold through our primary and secondary ticketing operations, the number of clients renewed or added and the average royalty rate paid to clients who use our ticketing services. in addition, we review the number of visits to our websites, the overall number of customers in our database, the number and percentage of tickets sold via mobile, the number of app installs and gross transaction value and fees related to secondary ticket sales. for business that is conducted in foreign markets, we also compare the operating results from our foreign operations to prior periods without the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates.
artist nation our artist nation segment primarily provides management services to music artists and other clients in exchange for a commission on the earnings of these artists. revenue earned from our artist nation segment is impacted to a large degree by the touring schedules of the artists we represent and generally we experience higher revenue during the second and third quarters as the period from may through october tends to be a popular time for touring events.
to judge the health of our artist nation segment, we primarily review the number of major clients represented. for business that is conducted in foreign markets, we also compare the operating results from our foreign operations to prior periods without the impact of foreign exchange rates.
key operating metrics year ended december 31,
(in thousands except estimated events)
estimated events:
total estimated events                    26,262                  25,511                  22,794
number of fee-bearing tickets sold       185,543                 173,871                 163,184

(1)   events generally represent a single performance by an artist. fans generally represent the number of people who attend an event. festivals are counted as one event in the quarter in which the festival begins, but the number of fans is based on the days the fans were present at the festival and thus can be reported across multiple quarters. events and fan attendance metrics are estimated each quarter.
(2)   the number of fee-bearing tickets sold includes primary and secondary tickets that are sold using our ticketmaster systems or that we issue through affiliates. this metric includes primary tickets sold during the year regardless of event timing except for our own events where our concert promoters control ticketing which are reported as the events occur. the non-fee-bearing tickets sold reported above includes primary tickets sold using our ticketmaster systems, through season seat packages and our venue clients' box offices, along with tickets sold on our 'do it yourself' platform.
non-gaap measures reconciliation of segment adjusted operating income (loss)
aoi is a non-gaap financial measure that we define as operating income (loss) before acquisition expenses (including transaction costs, changes in the fair value of accrued acquisition-related contingent consideration obligations, and acquisition-related severance and compensation), depreciation and amortization (including goodwill impairment), loss (gain) on disposal of operating assets and certain stock-based compensation expense. we use aoi to evaluate the performance of our operating segments. we believe that information about aoi assists investors by allowing them to evaluate changes in the operating results of our portfolio of businesses separate from non-operational factors that affect net income, thus providing insights into both operations and the other factors that affect reported results. aoi is not calculated or presented in accordance with gaap. a limitation of the use of aoi as a performance measure is that it does not reflect the periodic costs of certain amortizing assets used in generating revenue in our business. accordingly, aoi should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for, operating income (loss), net income (loss), and other measures of financial performance reported in accordance with gaap. furthermore, this measure may vary among other companies; thus, aoi as presented herein may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies.
the following table sets forth the reconciliation of aoi to operating income (loss):

constant currency constant currency is a non-gaap financial measure. we calculate currency impacts as the difference between current period activity translated using the current period's currency exchange rates and the comparable prior period's currency exchange rates. we present constant currency information to provide a framework for assessing how our underlying businesses performed excluding the effect of foreign currency rate fluctuations.

revenue concerts revenue increased $909.1 million, or 18%, during the year ended december 31, 2016 as compared to the prior year. excluding the decrease of $87.8 million related to currency impacts, revenue increased $996.9 million, or 20%, primarily due to more shows and higher average ticket prices in our worldwide stadium, arena and theater and club events and our north america amphitheaters, increased festival activity globally and higher vip package sales. additionally, ancillary onsite revenue for our north america amphitheaters increased due to higher attendance and enhanced concession offerings. concerts had incremental revenue of $204.3 million from the acquisitions of various concert and festival promotion businesses.
operating results the improved operating results for concerts for the year ended december 31, 2016 was primarily driven by strong operating results for our worldwide stadium events and north america amphitheaters and festivals partially offset by higher compensation costs associated with annual salary increases and incentive compensation as a result of the increased operating results, and loss of certain rent credits received in 2015.
revenue concerts revenue increased $238.1 million, or 5%, during the year ended december 31, 2015 as compared to the prior year. excluding the decrease of $260.6 million related to currency impacts, revenue increased $498.7 million, or 11%, primarily due to more shows in our north america arenas and amphitheaters, touring events in asia and australia, and incremental revenue of $203.3 million from the acquisitions of various festival and concert promoters. these increases were partially offset by fewer shows in north america stadiums.
operating results the improved operating results for concerts for the year ended december 31, 2015 was primarily driven by a goodwill impairment of $117.0 million related to our international concerts business that was recorded in the fourth quarter of 2014 in connection with our annual impairment test. this was partially offset by higher amortization associated with certain revenue generating contracts due to the timing of artists touring, acceleration of depreciation and amortization associated with a change in the estimated useful lives of certain intangible assets and leasehold improvements along with increased compensation costs associated with annual salary increases and headcount growth and higher valuation allowances.

operating results ticketing operating income increased for the year ended december 31, 2015 primarily due to increased primary and resale ticket sales and lower amortization associated with certain technology intangible assets that were fully amortized by the fourth quarter of 2014 and lower amortization associated with the 2014 impairment of certain indefinite-lived intangible assets. in 2014, we recorded impairment charges of $9.2 million associated with an indefinite-lived trade name in connection with the decision to rebrand certain markets that were not currently using the ticketmaster trade name along with the impairment of certain technology intangible assets as it was determined that the estimated undiscounted cash flows associated with the respective intangible asset were less than their carrying value. there were no impairment charges recorded in 2015. these increases were partially offset by higher compensation costs and currency impacts.

***   in accounting for the merger between live nation and ticketmaster in january 2010, the nonrecoupable ticketing contract advances that existed at the date of the merger were written off in acquisition accounting in accordance with gaap. had we continued amortizing the net book value of these nonrecoupable ticketing contract advances, the amortization above would have been $1.3 million, $1.7 million and $7.5 million higher for the years ended december 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.
corporate corporate expenses increased $17.1 million, or 16%, during the year ended december 31, 2016 as compared to the prior year primarily due to costs incurred during 2016 associated with the relocation of an office and higher compensation costs driven by higher headcount.
loss on extinguishment of debt we recorded a loss on extinguishment of debt of $14.0 million for the year ended december 31, 2016 in connection with the refinancing of the term loans under our senior secured credit facility and the redemption of our 7.0% senior notes in october 2016. these obligations were paid with proceeds from the amended senior secured credit facility and the issuance of 4.875% senior notes due 2024. there were no significant gains or losses on extinguishment of debt recorded in 2015 and 2014.
equity in losses (earnings) of nonconsolidated affiliates equity in losses (earnings) of nonconsolidated affiliates for the year ended december 31, 2016 includes impairment charges of $16.5 million primarily related to investments in a digital content company and an online merchandise company both located in the united states.
other expense, net other expense, net was $10.8 million, $27.2 million and $8.3 million for the years ended december 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively, and includes net foreign exchange rate losses of $8.8 million, $35.3 million and $28.9 million, respectively, primarily from revaluation of certain foreign currency denominated net assets held internationally. the 2015 net loss was partially offset by remeasurement gains of $9.1 million recorded in connection with the consolidation of a festival promotion business, a ticketing company and an artist management business that were all previously accounted for as equity investments, due to the acquisition of additional interests in the companies. the 2014 net loss was partially offset by a remeasurement gain of $17.1 million recorded in connection with the consolidation of an artist management business that had been previously accounted for as an equity investment, due to a change in the governing agreements.
income taxes for the year ended december 31, 2016, we had a net tax expense of $28.0 million on income before income taxes of $48.3 million compared to a net tax expense of $22.1 million on income before income taxes of $6.4 million for 2015. in 2016, income tax expense consisted of $18.2 million related to foreign entities, $5.7 million related to united states federal income taxes and $4.1 million related to state and local income taxes. the net increase is due primarily to expense for valuation allowances established for certain foreign entities and a reduced benefit in 2016 for valuation allowance release in the united states related to acquired deferred tax liabilities.
for the year ended december 31, 2015, we had a net tax expense of $22.1 million on income before income taxes of $6.4 million compared to a net tax expense of $4.6 million on a loss before income taxes of $99.8 million for 2014. in 2015, income
tax expense consisted of $15.5 million related to tax expense for foreign entities and $6.4 million related to state and local income taxes. the net increase is due to an increase in earnings in our foreign tax jurisdictions along with lower reversals of valuation allowances in 2015.
net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests increased $30.4 million to income of $16.7 million during the year ended december 31, 2015 as compared to the prior year primarily due to improved operating results from certain festival businesses and the portion of a 2014 goodwill impairment attributable to noncontrolling interests, partially offset by the prospective consolidation of an artist management company that occurred in 2014.
liquidity and capital resources our working capital requirements and capital for our general corporate purposes, including acquisitions and capital expenditures, are funded from operations or from borrowings under our senior secured credit facility described below. our cash is centrally managed on a worldwide basis. our primary short-term liquidity needs are to fund general working capital requirements, capital expenditures and debt service requirements while our long-term liquidity needs are primarily related to acquisitions and debt repayment. our primary sources of funds for our short-term liquidity needs will be cash flows from operations and borrowings under our senior secured credit facility, while our long-term sources of funds will be from cash flows from operations, long-term bank borrowings and other debt or equity financings. we may from time to time engage in open market purchases of our outstanding debt securities or redeem or otherwise repay such debt.
our balance sheet reflects cash and cash equivalents of $1.5 billion at december 31, 2016 and $1.3 billion at december 31, 2015. included in the december 31, 2016 and 2015 cash and cash equivalents balance is $591.0 million and $549.0 million, respectively, of cash received that includes the face value of tickets sold on behalf of our ticketing clients and their share of service charges that we refer to as client cash. we generally do not utilize client cash for our own financing or investing activities as the amounts are payable to clients on a regular basis. our foreign subsidiaries held approximately $712.5 million in cash and cash equivalents, excluding client cash, at december 31, 2016. we do not intend to repatriate these funds, but if we did, we would need to accrue and pay united states federal and state income taxes on any future repatriations, net of applicable foreign tax credits. we may from time to time enter into borrowings under our revolving credit facility. if the original maturity of these borrowings is 90 days or less, we present the borrowings and subsequent repayments on a net basis in the statement of cash flows to better represent our financing activities. our balance sheet reflects total net debt of $2.3 billion and $2.0 billion at december 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. our weighted-average cost of debt, excluding the unamortized debt discounts and debt issuance costs on our term loans and notes, was 3.8% at december 31, 2016.
our cash and cash equivalents are held in accounts managed by third-party financial institutions and consist of cash in our operating accounts and invested cash. cash held in interest-bearing operating accounts in many cases exceeds the federal deposit insurance corporation insurance limits. the invested cash is in interest-bearing funds consisting primarily of bank deposits and money market funds. while we monitor cash and cash equivalent balances in our operating accounts on a regular basis and adjust the balances as appropriate, these balances could be impacted if the underlying financial institutions fail. to date, we have experienced no loss or lack of access to our cash and cash equivalents; however, we can provide no assurances that access to our cash and cash equivalents will not be impacted by adverse conditions in the financial markets.
for our concerts segment, we generally receive cash related to ticket revenue at our owned or operated venues and festivals in advance of the event, which is recorded in deferred revenue until the event occurs. with the exception of some upfront costs and artist deposits, which are recorded in prepaid expenses until the event occurs, we pay the majority of event-related expenses at or after the event.
we view our available cash as cash and cash equivalents, less ticketing-related client cash, less event-related deferred revenue, less accrued expenses due to artists and cash collected on behalf of others, plus event-related prepaid expenses. this is essentially our cash available to, among other things, repay debt balances, make acquisitions and finance capital expenditures.
our intra-year cash fluctuations are impacted by the seasonality of our various businesses. examples of seasonal effects include our concerts and artist nation segments, which report the majority of their revenue in the second and third quarters. cash inflows and outflows depend on the timing of event-related payments but the majority of the inflows generally occur prior to the event. see "-seasonality" below. we believe that we have sufficient financial flexibility to fund these fluctuations and to access the global capital markets on satisfactory terms and in adequate amounts, although there can be no assurance that this will be the case, and capital could be less accessible and/or more costly depending on economic conditions at the time. we expect cash flows from operations and borrowings under our senior secured credit facility, along with other financing alternatives, to satisfy working capital requirements, capital expenditures and debt service requirements for at least the succeeding year.
we may need to incur additional debt or issue equity to make other strategic acquisitions or investments. there can be no assurance that such financing will be available to us on acceptable terms or at all. we may make significant acquisitions in the near term, subject to limitations imposed by our financing agreements and market conditions.
the lenders under our revolving loans and counterparties to our interest rate hedge agreements consist of banks and other third-party financial institutions. while we currently have no indications or expectations that such lenders and counterparties will be unable to fund their commitments as required, we can provide no assurances that future funding availability will not be impacted by adverse conditions in the financial markets. should an individual lender default on its obligations, the remaining lenders would not be required to fund the shortfall, resulting in a reduction in the total amount available to us for future borrowings, but would remain obligated to fund their own commitments. should any counterparty to our interest rate hedge agreements default on its obligations, we could experience higher interest rate volatility during the period of any such default.
sources of cash senior secured credit facility in october 2016, we amended our senior secured credit facility. the amended senior secured credit facility provides for (i) a $190 million term loan a, (ii) a $975 million term loan b and (iii) a $365 million revolving credit facility. subject to certain conditions, we have the right to increase the facility by an amount equal to the sum of $625 million and the aggregate principal amount of voluntary prepayments of the term b loans and permanent reductions of the revolving credit facility commitments, in each case, other than from proceeds of long-term indebtedness, and additional amounts so long as the senior secured leverage ratio calculated on a pro-forma basis (as defined in the credit agreement) is no greater than 3.25x. the revolving credit facility provides for borrowings up to the amount of the facility with sublimits of up to (i) $150 million for the issuance of letters of credit, (ii) $50 million for swingline loans, (iii) $200 million for borrowings in euros or british pounds and (iv) $50 million for borrowings in one or more other approved currencies. the senior secured credit facility is secured by (i) a first priority lien on substantially all of the tangible and intangible personal property of our domestic subsidiaries that are guarantors and (ii) a pledge of substantially all of the shares of stock, partnership interests and limited liability company interests of our direct and indirect domestic subsidiaries and 65% of each class of capital stock of any first-tier foreign subsidiaries, subject to certain exceptions.
the interest rates per annum applicable to revolving credit facility loans and term loan a under the senior secured credit facility are, at our option, equal to either libor plus 2.25% or a base rate plus 1.25%, subject to stepdowns based on our net leverage ratio. the interest rates per annum applicable to the term loan b are, at our option, equal to either libor plus 2.50% or a base rate plus 1.50%. we are required to pay a commitment fee of 0.5% per year on the undrawn portion available under the revolving credit facility, subject to a stepdown based on our net leverage ratio, and variable fees on outstanding letters of credit.
for the term loan a, we are required to make quarterly payments increasing over time from $2.4 million to $28.5 million with the balance due at maturity in october 2021. for the term loan b, we are required to make quarterly payments of $2.4 million with the balance due at maturity in october 2023. the revolving credit facility matures in october 2021. we are also required to make mandatory prepayments of the loans under the credit agreement, subject to specified exceptions, from excess cash flow, and with the proceeds of asset sales, debt issuances and specified other events.
during the year ended december 31, 2016, we made principal payments totaling $123.3 million primarily to lenders electing not to convert their outstanding term loans in connection with the october 2016 amendment. at december 31, 2016, the outstanding balances on these term loans, excluding discounts and debt issuance costs, were $1.2 billion. there were no borrowings under the revolving credit facility as of december 31, 2016. based on our letters of credit of $85.3 million, $279.7 million was available for future borrowings.
4.875% senior notes in october 2016, we issued $575 million of 4.875% senior notes due 2024. interest on the notes is payable semi-annually in cash in arrears on may 1 and november 1 of each year beginning on may 1, 2017, and will mature in november 2024. we may redeem some or all of the notes, at any time prior to november 1, 2019, at a price equal to 100% of the aggregate principal amount, plus any accrued and unpaid interest to the date of redemption, plus a 'make-whole' premium. we may redeem up to 35% of the aggregate principal amount of the notes from the proceeds of certain equity offerings prior to november 1, 2019, at a price equal to 104.875% of the aggregate principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon, if any, to the date of redemption. in addition, on or after november 1, 2019, we may redeem some or all of the notes at any time at the redemption prices that start at 103.656% of their principal amount, plus any accrued and unpaid interest to the date of redemption. we must make an offer to redeem the notes at 101% of their aggregate principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the repurchase date, if we experience certain defined changes of control.
5.375% senior notes in may 2014, we issued $250 million of 5.375% senior notes due 2022. interest on the notes is payable semiannually in arrears on june 15 and december 15, and the notes will mature in june 2022. we may redeem some or all of the notes at any time prior to june 15, 2017 at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount, plus any accrued and unpaid interest to the date of redemption, plus a 'make-whole' premium. we may also redeem up to 35% of the aggregate principal amount of the notes from the proceeds of certain equity offerings prior to june 15, 2017, at a price equal to 105.375% of the principal amount, plus any accrued and unpaid interest. in addition, on or after june 15, 2017, we may redeem at our option some or all of the notes at redemption prices that start at 104.0313% of their principal amount, plus any accrued and unpaid interest to the date of redemption. we must make an offer to redeem the notes at 101% of the aggregate principal amount, plus any accrued and unpaid interest to the repurchase date, if we experience certain defined changes of control.
2.5% convertible senior notes in may 2014, we issued $275 million of convertible senior notes due 2019. the notes pay interest semiannually in arrears on may 15 and november 15 at a rate of 2.5% per annum. the notes will mature in may 2019 and may not be redeemed by us prior to the maturity date. the notes will be convertible, under certain circumstances, until november 15, 2018, and on or after such date without condition, at an initial conversion rate of 28.8363 shares of our common stock per $1,000 principal amount of notes, subject to adjustment, which represents a 52.5% conversion premium based on the last reported sale price for our common stock of $22.74 on may 19, 2014. upon conversion, the notes may be settled in shares of common stock or, at our election, cash or a combination of cash and shares of common stock. assuming we fully settled the notes in shares, the maximum number of shares that could be issued to satisfy the conversion is currently 7.9 million.
if we experience a fundamental change, as defined in the indenture governing the notes, the holders of the 2.5% convertible senior notes may require us to purchase for cash all or a portion of their notes, subject to specified exceptions, at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the notes plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any.
extinguishment of debt in connection with our debt refinancing in october 2016, we issued $575 million of 4.875% senior notes due 2024 and amended our senior secured credit facility. the amendment to the senior secured credit facility provided the existing term loan a and term loan b lenders with an option to convert their outstanding principal amounts into the new term loans. excluding the outstanding principal amounts for lenders who elected to convert their outstanding term loans, total proceeds of $858.5 million were used to repay $123.3 million outstanding principal amount of our borrowings under the senior secured credit facility, to repay the entire $425 million principal amount of our 7% senior notes due 2020 and to pay the related redemption premium of $14.9 million on the 7% senior notes and accrued interest and fees of $38.4 million, leaving $256.9 million in additional cash available for general corporate purposes. we recorded $14.0 million as a loss on extinguishment of debt related to this refinancing in 2016.
debt covenants our senior secured credit facility contains a number of restrictions that, among other things, require us to satisfy a financial covenant and restrict our and our subsidiaries' ability to incur additional debt, make certain investments and acquisitions, repurchase our stock and prepay certain indebtedness, create liens, enter into agreements with affiliates, modify the nature of our business, enter into sale-leaseback transactions, transfer and sell material assets, merge or consolidate, and pay dividends and make distributions (with the exception of subsidiary dividends or distributions to the parent company or other subsidiaries on at least a pro-rata basis with any noncontrolling interest partners). non-compliance with one or more of the covenants and restrictions could result in the full or partial principal balance of the credit facility becoming immediately due and payable. the senior secured credit facility agreement has one covenant, measured quarterly, that relates to total leverage. the consolidated total leverage covenant requires us to maintain a ratio of consolidated total funded debt to consolidated ebitda (both as defined in the credit agreement) of 5.50x over the trailing four consecutive quarters through september 30, 2017. the consolidated total leverage ratio will reduce to 5.25x on december 31, 2017, 5.0x on december 31, 2018, 4.75x on december 31, 2019 and 4.50x on december 31, 2020.
the indentures governing our 4.875% senior notes and 5.375% senior notes contain covenants that limit, among other things, our ability and the ability of our restricted subsidiaries to incur certain additional indebtedness and issue preferred stock, make certain distributions, investments and other restricted payments, sell certain assets, agree to any restrictions on the ability of restricted subsidiaries to make payments to us, merge, consolidate or sell all of our assets, create certain liens, and engage in transactions with affiliates on terms that are not on an arms-length basis. certain covenants, including those pertaining to incurrence of indebtedness, restricted payments, asset sales, mergers, and transactions with affiliates will be suspended during any period in which the notes are rated investment grade by both rating agencies and no default or event of default under the indenture has occurred and is continuing. the 4.875% senior notes and the 5.375% senior notes contain two incurrence-based
financial covenants, as defined, requiring a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio of 2.0x and a maximum secured indebtedness leverage ratio of 3.50x.
some of our other subsidiary indebtedness includes restrictions on entering into various transactions, such as acquisitions and disposals, and prohibits payment of ordinary dividends. they also have financial covenants including minimum consolidated ebitda to consolidated net interest payable, minimum consolidated cash flow to consolidated debt service and maximum consolidated debt to consolidated ebitda, all as defined in the applicable debt agreements.
as of december 31, 2016, we believe we were in compliance with all of our debt covenants. we expect to remain in compliance with all of our debt covenants throughout 2017.
stock option exercises during 2016, 2015 and 2014 we received $20.3 million, $16.3 million and $21.8 million, respectively, of proceeds from the exercise of stock options.
uses of cash acquisitions when we make acquisitions, the acquired entity may have cash at the time of acquisition. all amounts related to the use of cash for acquisitions discussed in this section are presented net of any cash acquired. during 2016, we used $211.6 million of cash primarily for the acquisitions of a concert promoter in germany, controlling interests in festival and concert promoters in the united kingdom, united states and sweden and an artist management business with locations in the united states and canada. these businesses had a total of $39.0 million of cash on their balance sheets primarily related to deferred revenue for future events.
during 2015, we used $89.8 million of cash primarily for the acquisitions of all or part of festival promoters located in the united states, the united kingdom, and sweden and a ticketing business located in canada. as of the date of acquisition, these businesses had a total of $114.6 million of cash on their balance sheets primarily related to deferred revenue for future events.
during 2014, we used $210.2 million of cash primarily for acquisitions of a controlling interest in a festival and concert promoter located in the united states and acquisitions of artist management businesses located in the united states. as of the date of acquisition, these businesses had a total of $34.6 million of cash on their balance sheets, primarily related to deferred revenue for future events.
purchases and sales of noncontrolling interests, net in 2016, we used $69.1 million of cash primarily for the acquisition of all or additional equity interests in two artist management businesses located in the united states and a festival and concert promoter located in australia.
capital expenditures venue and ticketing operations are capital intensive businesses, requiring continual investment in our existing venues and ticketing systems in order to address audience and artist expectations, technological industry advances and various federal, state and/or local regulations.
we categorize capital outlays between maintenance capital expenditures and revenue generating capital expenditures. maintenance capital expenditures are associated with the renewal and improvement of existing venues and technology systems, web development and administrative offices. revenue generating capital expenditures generally relate to the construction of new venues, major renovations to existing buildings or buildings that are being added to our venue network, the development of new ticketing tools and technology enhancements. revenue generating capital expenditures can also include smaller projects whose purpose is to increase revenue and/or improve operating income. capital expenditures typically increase during periods when our venues are not in operation since that is the time that such improvements can be completed.
our capital expenditures, including accruals but excluding expenditures funded by outside parties such as landlords or replacements funded by insurance proceeds, consisted of the following:
maintenance capital expenditures              $92,125                 $79,008                 $60,320
revenue generating capital expenditures        94,702                  65,726                  73,476
total capital expenditures                   $186,827                $144,734                $133,796
maintenance capital expenditures for 2016 increased from the prior year primarily associated with technology system enhancements and venue-related projects.
revenue generating capital expenditures for 2016 increased from the prior year primarily due to development and enhancement of certain venues.
maintenance capital expenditures for 2015 increased from the prior year primarily due to technology product enhancements.
revenue generating capital expenditures for 2015 decreased from the prior year primarily due to lower expenditures related to the re-platforming of our ticketing system and development of our integrated resale and primary product.
for the years ended december 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, $2.8 million, $0.4 million and $4.4 million, respectively, of insurance proceeds and landlord reimbursements have been excluded from capital expenditures in the table above.
we currently expect capital expenditures to be approximately $220 million for the year ending december 31, 2017.
contractual obligations and commitments firm commitments in addition to the scheduled maturities on our debt, we have future cash obligations under various types of contracts. we lease office space, certain equipment and many of the venues used in our concert operations under long-term operating leases. some of our lease agreements contain renewal options and annual rental escalation clauses (generally tied to the consumer price index), as well as provisions for our payment of utilities and maintenance. we also have minimum payments associated with non-cancelable contracts related to our operations such as artist guarantee contracts and client ticketing agreements. as part of our ongoing capital projects, we will enter into construction-related commitments for future capital expenditure work. the scheduled maturities discussed below represent contractual obligations as of december 31, 2016 and thus do not represent all expected expenditures for those periods.
the scheduled maturities of our outstanding long-term debt (excluding unamortized debt discounts and issuance costs), future minimum rental commitments under non-cancelable operating lease agreements, minimum payments under other non-cancelable contracts, capital expenditure commitments and expected payments of contingent and deferred consideration liabilities as of december 31, 2016 are as follows:
non-cancelable operating leases (3)                              2,024,722                              163,058                 302,374                 235,171                   1,324,119
capital expenditures                                                62,624                               34,179                   2,600                   1,769                      24,076
(2) does not include interest on the revolving credit facility as the balance was zero as of december 31, 2016.
(3)  commitment amounts for non-cancelable operating leases and non-cancelable contracts which stipulate an increase in the commitment amount based on an inflationary index have been estimated using an inflation factor of 1.9% for north america, 3.0% for the united kingdom, 1.8% for denmark and 1.7% for the netherlands.
(4) does not include $8.3 million of uncertain tax positions due to the unpredictable timing of the future payments.
during 2006, in connection with our acquisition of a theatrical business, we guaranteed obligations related to a lease agreement. in the event of default, we could be liable for obligations which have future lease payments (undiscounted) of approximately $16.9 million through the end of 2035 which are not reflected in the table above. the scheduled future minimum rentals for this lease for the years 2017 through 2021 are $1.6 million each year. the venues under the lease agreement were included in the sale of our north american theatrical business in 2008. the buyer assumed our obligations under the guaranty, however we remain contingently liable to the lessor. we believe that the likelihood of a material liability being triggered under this lease is remote, and no liability has been accrued for these contingent lease obligations as of december 31, 2016.
aggregate minimum rentals of $57.4 million to be paid to us in years 2017 through 2023 under non-cancelable subleases are excluded from the commitment amounts in the above table.
guarantees of third-party obligations as of december 31, 2016 and 2015, we guaranteed the debt of third parties of approximately $18.0 million and $13.4 million, respectively, primarily related to maximum credit limits on employee and tour-related credit cards and obligations under a venue management agreement.
operating activities          $597,490                $307,854                $292,166
operating activities year ended 2016 compared to year ended 2015
cash provided by operating activities increased $289.6 million for the year ended december 31, 2016 as compared to the prior year. during 2016, our accounts payable and accrued liabilities increased based on the timing of payments, we delivered higher cash-related net income and received more cash for future events, increasing deferred revenue, partially offset by a larger increase in accounts receivable as compared to the prior year.
cash provided by operating activities increased $15.7 million for the year ended december 31, 2015 as compared to the prior year. during 2015, we made less advances to artists for future events, decreasing our prepaid expenses and other assets, partially offset by a larger increase in accounts receivable and a decrease in accounts payable and accrued liabilities based on the timing of payments as compared to the prior year.
cash used in investing activities increased $135.5 million for the year ended december 31, 2016 as compared to the prior year due to higher acquisition activity and higher purchases of property, plant and equipment partially offset by lower advances of notes receivable. see "-uses of cash" above for further discussion.
cash used in investing activities decreased $101.2 million for the year ended december 31, 2015 as compared to the prior year primarily due to lower net acquisition expenditures in 2015 as compared to the prior year. see "-uses of cash" above for further discussion.
cash provided by financing activities increased $143.3 million for the year ended december 31, 2016 as compared to the prior year primarily due to net proceeds of $267.3 million received in 2016 from the issuance of the 4.875% senior notes and increased term loan a and term loan b borrowings, after repayment of the 7% senior notes and related costs. the higher net proceeds from the debt issuance were partially offset by higher purchases of noncontrolling interests and distributions to noncontrolling interest partners along with higher payments for deferred and contingent consideration due to past acquisitions.
cash used in financing activities increased $270.1 million for the year ended december 31, 2015 as compared to the prior year primarily as a result of net proceeds of $293.8 million received in 2014 from the issuance of the 5.375% senior notes and 2.5% convertible senior notes after repayment of the 2.875% convertible senior notes.
seasonality our concerts, sponsorship & advertising and artist nation segments typically experience higher operating income in the second and third quarters as our outdoor venues and festivals are primarily used in or occur from may through october, and our artist touring activity is higher. in addition, the timing of when tickets are sold and the tours of top-grossing acts can impact comparability of quarterly results year over year, although annual results may not be impacted. our ticketing segment revenue is impacted by fluctuations in the availability of events for sale to the public, which vary depending upon scheduling by our clients.
cash flows from our concerts segment typically have a slightly different seasonality as payments are often made for artist performance fees and production costs for tours in advance of the date the related event tickets go on sale. these artist fees and production costs are expensed when the event occurs. once tickets for an event go on sale, we generally begin to receive payments from ticket sales at our owned or operated venues and festivals in advance of when the event occurs. we record these ticket sales as revenue when the event occurs.
we expect these trends to continue in the future. see item 1a.-risk factors-"our operations are seasonal and our results of operations vary from quarter to quarter and year over year, so our financial performance in certain financial quarters or years may not be indicative of, or comparable to, our financial performance in subsequent quarters or years."
market risk we are exposed to market risks arising from changes in market rates and prices, including movements in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates.
foreign currency risk we have operations in countries throughout the world. the financial results of our foreign operations are measured in their local currencies. our foreign subsidiaries also carry certain net assets or liabilities that are denominated in a currency other than that subsidiary's functional currency. as a result, our financial results could be affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in the foreign markets in which we have operations. currently, we do not operate in any hyper-inflationary countries. our foreign operations reported operating income of $72.0 million for the year ended december 31, 2016. we estimate that a 10% change in the value of the united states dollar relative to foreign currencies would change our operating income for the year ended december 31, 2016 by $7.2 million. as of december 31, 2016, our most significant foreign exchange exposure included the euro, british pound, australian dollar and canadian dollar. this analysis does not consider the implication such currency fluctuations could have on the overall economic conditions of the united states or other foreign countries in which we operate or on the results of operations of our foreign entities. in addition, the reported carrying value of our assets and liabilities, including the total cash and cash equivalents held by our foreign operations, will also be affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates.
we primarily use forward currency contracts, in addition to options, to reduce our exposure to foreign currency risk associated with short-term artist fee commitments. we also may enter into forward currency contracts to minimize the risks and/or costs associated with changes in foreign currency rates on forecasted operating income. at december 31, 2016, we had forward currency contracts and options outstanding with a notional amount of $173.8 million.
interest rate risk our market risk is also affected by changes in interest rates. we had $2.4 billion of total debt, excluding unamortized debt discounts and issuance costs, outstanding as of december 31, 2016. of the total amount, taking into consideration existing interest rate hedges, we had $1.2 billion of fixed-rate debt and $1.2 billion of floating-rate debt.
based on the amount of our floating-rate debt as of december 31, 2016, each 25-basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would increase or decrease our annual interest expense and cash outlay by approximately $3.0 million when the floor rate is not applicable. this potential increase or decrease is based on the simplified assumption that the level of floating-rate debt remains constant with an immediate across-the-board increase or decrease as of december 31, 2016 with no subsequent change in rates for the remainder of the period.
we have one interest rate cap agreement with an aggregate notional amount of $6.3 million at december 31, 2016. the interest rate cap agreement ensures that a portion of our floating-rate debt does not exceed 4.25% and expires in june 2018. this agreement has not been designated as a hedging instrument. therefore, any change in fair value is recorded in earnings during the period of the change.
recent accounting pronouncements information regarding recent accounting pronouncements can be found in item 8.- financial statements and supplementary data-note 1-the company and summary of significant accounting policies.
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of our financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. on an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates that are based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. the result of these evaluations forms the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the reported amount of revenue and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources. because future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty, actual results could differ from our assumptions and estimates, and such difference could be material. management believes that the following accounting estimates are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results, and they require management's most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, resulting from the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. the following narrative describes these critical accounting estimates, the judgments and assumptions and the effect if actual results differ from these assumptions where applicable.
consolidation typically we consolidate entities in which we own more than 50% of the voting common stock and control operations and also vies for which we are the primary beneficiary. investments in nonconsolidated affiliates in which we own more than 20% of the voting common stock or otherwise exercise significant influence over operating and financial policies, but not control of the nonconsolidated affiliate, are accounted for using the equity method of accounting. investments in nonconsolidated affiliates in which we own less than 20% of the voting common stock are accounted for using the cost method of accounting. intercompany accounts among the consolidated businesses have been eliminated in consolidation. net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests is reflected in the statements of operations for consolidated affiliates.
business combinations we account for our business combinations under the acquisition method of accounting. identifiable assets acquired, liabilities assumed and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree are recognized and measured as of the acquisition date at fair value. additionally, contingent consideration is recorded at fair value on the acquisition date and classified as a liability. goodwill is recognized to the extent by which the aggregate of the acquisition-date fair value of the consideration transferred and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree exceeds the recognized basis of the identifiable assets acquired, net of assumed liabilities. determining the fair value of assets acquired, liabilities assumed and noncontrolling interest requires management's judgment and often involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions, including assumptions with respect to future cash flows, discount rates and asset lives among other items.
property, plant and equipment we test for possible impairment of property, plant and equipment whenever events or circumstances change, such as a current period operating cash flow loss combined with a history of, or projected, operating cash flow losses or a significant adverse change in the manner in which the asset is intended to be used, which may indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. if indicators exist, we compare the estimated undiscounted future cash flows related to the assets to the carrying amount of those assets. if the carrying value is greater than the estimated undiscounted future cash flows, the cost basis of the asset is reduced to reflect the current fair value. we use various assumptions in determining the current fair value of these assets, including future expected cash flows and discount rates, as well as future salvage values and other fair value measures. our impairment loss calculations require us to apply judgment in estimating future cash flows, including forecasting useful lives of the assets and selecting the discount rate that reflects the risk inherent in future cash flows.
if actual results are not consistent with our assumptions and judgments used in estimating future cash flows and asset fair values, we may be exposed to future impairment losses that could be material to our results of operations.
intangibles we test for possible impairment of definite-lived intangible assets whenever events or circumstances change, such as a current period operating cash flow loss combined with a history of, or projected, operating cash flow losses or a significant adverse change in the manner in which the asset is intended to be used, which may indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. when specific assets are determined to be unrecoverable, the cost basis of the asset is reduced to reflect the current fair value.
we test for possible impairment of indefinite-lived intangible assets on at least an annual basis. based on facts and circumstances, we perform either a qualitative or a quantitative assessment for impairment. if a qualitative assessment is performed, and the existence of events and circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that an indefinite-lived intangible asset is impaired, we perform the quantitative impairment test by comparing the fair value with the carrying amount. when specific assets are determined to be impaired, the cost basis of the asset is reduced to reflect the current fair value.
when performing quantitative assessments for impairment, we use various assumptions in determining the current fair value of these definite-lived and indefinite-lived intangible assets, including future expected cash flows, discount rates and royalty rates as well as other fair value measures. for intangibles related to artist rights, we use assumptions about future revenue and operating income for the rights acquired. these projections are based on information about the artists' past results and expectations about future results. our impairment loss calculations require us to apply judgment in estimating future cash flows, including forecasting useful lives of the assets and selecting the discount rate that reflects the risk inherent in future cash flows.
if actual results are not consistent with our assumptions and judgments used in estimating future cash flows and asset fair values, we may be exposed to future impairment losses that could be material to our results of operations.
goodwill we currently have seven reporting units with goodwill balances: international concerts and north america concerts within the concerts segment; sponsorship & advertising; international ticketing and north america ticketing within the ticketing segment; and artist management and artist services (non-management) within the artist nation segment.
we review goodwill for impairment annually, as of october 1, using a three-step process. we also test goodwill for impairment in other periods if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount or when we change our operating segments or reporting units.
the first step is a qualitative evaluation as to whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of any of our reporting units is less than its carrying value using an assessment of relevant events and circumstances. examples of such events and circumstances include historical financial performance, industry and market conditions, macroeconomic conditions, reporting unit-specific events, historical results of goodwill impairment testing, and the timing of the last performance of a quantitative assessment. if any reporting units are concluded to be more likely than not impaired, or if that conclusion cannot be determined qualitatively, a second step is performed for that reporting unit. regardless, it is our policy that all reporting units undergo a second step at least once every five years. this second step, used to quantitatively screen for potential impairment, compares the fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying amount, including goodwill. the third step, employed for any reporting unit that fails the second step, is used to measure the amount of any potential impairment and compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit's goodwill with the carrying amount of goodwill. if a reporting unit's carrying value is negative, we do not follow this three-step process. in this case, a qualitative evaluation is performed to determine whether it is more likely than not that the reporting unit's goodwill is impaired. if it is, the comparison of the implied fair value of the reporting unit's goodwill with the carrying amount of goodwill described above is performed. in all three steps, discount rates, market multiples and sensitivity tests are derived and/or computed with the assistance of external valuation consultants. we perform sensitivity analyses when the most likely result is unclear in the first step and for both the second and third steps in our process. generally, we test for sensitivities to discount rate, revenue growth, market multiples and customer attrition, which are the most significant assumptions.
the second and third steps that we use to evaluate goodwill for impairment involve the determination of the fair value of our reporting units. inherent in such fair value determinations are certain judgments and estimates relating to future cash flows, including our interpretation of current economic indicators and market valuations, and assumptions about our strategic plans with regard to our operations. due to the uncertainties associated with such estimates, actual results could differ from such estimates.
in developing fair values for our reporting units, we may employ a market multiple or a discounted cash flow methodology, or a combination thereof. the market multiple methodology compares us to similar companies on the basis of risk characteristics to determine our risk profile relative to those companies as a group. this analysis generally focuses on both quantitative considerations, which include financial performance and other quantifiable data, and qualitative considerations, which include any factors which are expected to impact future financial performance. the most significant assumptions affecting the market multiple methodology are the market multiples and control premium. a control premium represents the additional value an investor would pay in order to obtain a controlling interest in the respective reporting unit.
the discounted cash flow methodology establishes fair value by estimating the present value of the projected future cash flows to be generated from the reporting unit less those cash flows attributable to noncontrolling interests. it is important to note that items such as depreciation, amortization and stock-based compensation expense are not part of cash flows which is
more akin to our aoi metric. the discount rate applied to the projected future cash flows to arrive at the present value is intended to reflect all risks of ownership and the associated risks of realizing the stream of projected future cash flows. the discounted cash flow methodology uses our estimates of future financial performance. the most significant assumptions used in the discounted cash flow methodology are the discount rate, the attrition rate and expected future revenue, which vary among reporting units.
if actual results are not consistent with our assumptions and judgments used in estimating future cash flows and asset fair values, we may be exposed to future impairment losses that could be material to our results of operations.
in 2016, all of our reporting units with goodwill were assessed under the first qualitative step. five of the reporting units did not advance to the second step. three of these five reporting units had improved discount rates and considerable excess of fair value over their carrying value in the most recent quantitative tests, while also having mixed results on market multiples and financial results when compared to recent financial expectations. two out of the five reporting units had varying financial results as compared to recent financial expectations for the current year with slight decreases in market multiples, but both had a significant excess of fair value over their carrying value in the most recent quantitative tests along with improved discount rates. any further review of these reporting units with sensitivity tests did not change our first step conclusions.
the artist management and artist services reporting units advanced to the second step and their excess of fair value over carrying value ranged from 20% to 31%. although both of these reporting units had lower financial results in the current year and mixed results on their market multiples, they had improvements on discount rates. sensitivity tests on the artist management reporting unit showed that a 300-basis point change in the discount rate, an 81% decline in the revenue growth rate, or a 235-basis point change in market multiples was needed to change the conclusion. sensitivity tests on the artist services reporting unit showed that a 220-basis point change in the discount rate, a 71% decline in the revenue growth rate, or a 306-basis point change in market multiples was needed to change the conclusion.
given the results of the tests performed, although we cannot predict future performance or market conditions, we do not currently believe any of our reporting units are at risk of failing the second step in the near future.
revenue recognition revenue from the promotion and production of an event is recognized after the show occurs. revenue related to larger global tours is also recognized after the show occurs; however, any profits related to these tours, primarily related to music tour production and tour management services, is recognized after minimum revenue thresholds, if any, have been achieved. revenue collected in advance of the event is recorded as deferred revenue until the event occurs. revenue collected from sponsorships and other revenue, which is not related to any single event, is classified as deferred revenue and generally recognized over the operating season or the term of the contract.
revenue from our ticketing operations primarily consists of convenience and order processing fees charged at the time a ticket for an event is sold and is recorded on a net basis (net of the face value of the ticket). for tickets sold for events at our owned or operated venues in the united states, and where we control the tickets internationally, revenue is recognized after the show occurs. revenue for these ticket service charges collected in advance of the event is recorded as deferred revenue until the event occurs and these service charges will be shared between our ticketing and concerts segments. for tickets sold for events at third-party venues, this revenue is recognized at the time of the sale and is recorded by our ticketing segment.
we account for taxes that are externally imposed on revenue producing transactions on a net basis, as a reduction of revenue.
litigation accruals we are currently involved in certain legal proceedings and, as required, have accrued our estimate of the probable costs for the resolution of these claims. management's estimates used have been developed in consultation with counsel and are based upon an analysis of potential results, assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies. it is possible, however, that future results of operations for any particular period could be materially affected by changes in our assumptions or the effectiveness of our strategies related to these proceedings.
income taxes we account for income taxes using the liability method in accordance with the fasb guidance for income taxes. under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between financial reporting bases and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the periods in which the deferred tax asset or liability is expected to be realized or settled. deferred tax assets are reduced by valuation allowances if we believe it is more likely than not that some portion or the entire asset will not be realized. as almost all earnings from our continuing foreign operations are permanently reinvested and not distributed, our income tax provision does not include additional united states taxes on those foreign operations. the amount of earnings at december 31, 2016 that has been earned over time, and permanently reinvested, was approximately $1.4 billion. it is not practical to determine the amount
of federal and state income taxes, if any, that might become due in the event that any remaining available cash associated with these earnings were distributed.
the fasb guidance for income taxes prescribes a recognition threshold and a measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. for those benefits to be recognized, a tax position must be more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by taxing authorities. the amount recognized is measured as the largest amount of benefit that is more likely than not to be realized upon ultimate settlement.
ratio of earnings to fixed charges the ratio of earnings to fixed charges is as follows:
the ratio of earnings to fixed charges was computed on a total company basis. earnings represent income from continuing operations before income taxes less equity in undistributed net income (loss) of nonconsolidated affiliates plus fixed charges. fixed charges represent interest, amortization of debt discounts, debt issuance costs and premium and the estimated interest portion of rental charges. rental charges exclude variable rent expense for events in third-party venues.

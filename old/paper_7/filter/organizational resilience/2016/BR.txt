basis of presentation the consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles ("gaap") in the united states of america ("u.s."). these financial statements present the consolidated position of the company and include the entities in which the company directly or indirectly has a controlling financial interest as well as various entities in which the company has investments recorded under either the cost or equity methods of accounting. intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated. amounts presented may not sum due to rounding.
in presenting the consolidated financial statements, management makes estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported and related disclosures. estimates, by their nature, are based on judgment and available information. accordingly, actual results could differ from those estimates. in management's opinion, the consolidated financial statements contain all normal recurring adjustments necessary for a fair presentation of results reported. the results of operations reported for the periods presented are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations for subsequent periods.
effective in the first quarter of fiscal year 2016, we have revised our presentation in the consolidated statements of earnings to separately present operating expenses, operating income, and non-operating expenses, net. previously, we reported other expenses, net, as part of total expenses and did not separately present operating income in our consolidated statements of earnings. all prior period information has been conformed to the current period presentation. see note 4, "non-operating expenses, net," to our consolidated financial statements under item 8 of part ii of this annual report on form 10-k for details of the company's non-operating expenses, net and note 18, "quarterly financial results (unaudited)," to our consolidated financial statements under item 8 of part ii of this annual report on form 10-k for details of the company's operating income.
critical accounting policies we continually evaluate the accounting policies and estimates used to prepare the consolidated financial statements. the estimates, by their nature, are based on judgment, available information, and historical experience and are believed to be reasonable. however, actual amounts and results could differ from these estimates made by management. certain accounting policies that require significant management estimates and are deemed critical to our results of operations or financial position are discussed below.
goodwill. we review the carrying value of all our goodwill by comparing the carrying value of our reporting units to their fair values. we are required to perform this comparison at least annually or more frequently if circumstances indicate a possible impairment. when determining fair value of a reporting unit, we utilize the income approach which considers future cash flows using various assumptions, including projections of revenues based on assumed long-term growth rates, estimated costs and appropriate discount rates based on the particular business' weighted-average cost of capital. the principal factors used in the discounted cash flow analysis requiring judgment are the projected future operating cash flows, the weighted-average cost of capital and the terminal value growth rate assumptions. the weighted-average cost of capital takes into account the relative weight of each component of our consolidated capital structure (equity and long-term debt). our estimates of long-term growth and costs are based on historical data, various internal estimates and a variety of external sources, and are developed as part of our routine, long-range planning process. changes in economic and operating conditions impacting these assumptions could result in goodwill impairments in future periods. we had $999.3 million of goodwill as of june 30, 2016. given the significance of our goodwill, an adverse change to the fair value of one of our reporting units could result in an impairment charge, which could be material to our earnings.
the company performs a sensitivity analysis under step 1 of the goodwill impairment test assuming hypothetical reductions in the fair values of our reporting units. a 10% change in our estimates of projected future operating cash flows, discount rates, or terminal value growth rates used in our calculations of the fair values of the reporting units would not result in an impairment of our goodwill.
income taxes. the objectives of accounting for income taxes are to recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in an entity's financial statements or tax returns. judgment is required in addressing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our consolidated financial statements or tax returns (e.g., realization of deferred tax assets, changes in tax laws or interpretations thereof). the company is subject to regular examination of its income tax returns by the u.s. federal, state and foreign tax authorities. a change in the assessment of the outcomes of such matters could materially impact
our consolidated financial statements. as of june 30, 2016, we had estimated foreign net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $13.7 million, of which $1.2 million expires in 2017 through 2027, and $12.5 million which has an indefinite utilization period. in addition, the company has estimated u.s. federal net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $31.4 million, which expire in 2017 through 2030.
valuation allowances are recognized to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that the company will not be able to utilize the deferred tax assets attributable to net operating and capital loss carryforwards of certain subsidiaries to offset future taxable earnings. the company has recorded valuation allowances of $9.8 million and $9.2 million at june 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. the determination as to whether a deferred tax asset will be recognized is made on a jurisdictional basis and is based on the evaluation of historical taxable income or loss, projected future taxable income, carryforward periods, scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities and tax planning strategies. projected future taxable income is based on expected results and assumptions as to the jurisdiction in which the income will be earned. the assumptions used to project future taxable income requires significant judgment and are consistent with the plans and estimates used to manage the underlying businesses.
share-based payments. accounting for stock-based compensation requires the measurement of stock-based compensation expense based on the fair value of the award on the date of grant. we determine the fair value of stock options issued by using a binomial option-pricing model. the binomial option-pricing model considers a range of assumptions related to volatility, dividend yield, risk-free interest rate and employee exercise behavior. expected volatilities utilized in the binomial option-pricing model are based on a combination of implied market volatilities, historical volatility of our stock price and other factors. similarly, the dividend yield is based on historical experience and expected future changes. the risk-free rate is derived from the u.s. treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant. the binomial option-pricing model also incorporates exercise and forfeiture assumptions based on an analysis of historical data. the expected life of the stock option grants is derived from the output of the binomial model and represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding. determining these assumptions are subjective and complex, and therefore, a change in the assumptions utilized could impact the calculation of the fair value of our stock options. a hypothetical change of five percentage points applied to the volatility assumption used to determine the fair value of the fiscal year 2016 stock option grants would result in approximately a $1.5 million change in total pre-tax stock-based compensation expense for the fiscal year 2016 grants, which would be amortized over the vesting period. a hypothetical change of one year in the expected life assumption used to determine the fair value of the fiscal year 2016 stock option grants would result in approximately a $0.4 million change in the total pre-tax stock-based compensation expense for the fiscal year 2016 grants, which would be amortized over the vesting period. a hypothetical change of one percentage point in the forfeiture rate assumption used for the fiscal year 2016 stock option grants would result in approximately a $0.1 million change in the total pre-tax stock-based compensation expense for the fiscal year 2016 grants, which would be amortized over the vesting period. a hypothetical one-half percentage point change in the dividend yield assumption used to determine the fair value of the fiscal year 2016 stock option grants would result in approximately a $0.6 million change in the total pre-tax stock-based compensation expense for the fiscal year 2016 grants, which would be amortized over the vesting period.
results of operations the following discussions of analysis of consolidated statements of earnings and analysis of reportable segments refer to the fiscal year ended june 30, 2016 compared to the fiscal year ended june 30, 2015, and the fiscal year ended june 30, 2015 compared to the fiscal year ended june 30, 2014. the analysis of consolidated statements of earnings should be read in conjunction with the analysis of reportable segments, which provides more detailed discussions concerning certain components of the consolidated statements of earnings.
the following references are utilized in the discussions of analysis of consolidated statements of earnings and analysis of reportable segments:
"net new business" refers to recurring revenue from closed sales less recurring revenue from client losses.
fee revenues in the investor communication solutions segment are derived from both recurring and event-driven activity. in addition, the level of recurring and event-driven activity we process directly impacts distribution revenues. while event-driven activity is highly repeatable, it may not recur on an annual basis. the types of services we provide that comprise event-driven activity are:
â¢   mutual fund proxy: the proxy and related services we provide to mutual funds when certain events occur requiring a shareholder vote including changes in directors, sub-advisors, fee structures, investment restrictions, and mergers of funds.
â¢   mutual fund communications: mutual fund communications services consist primarily of the distribution on behalf of mutual funds of supplemental information required to be provided to the annual mutual fund prospectus as a result of certain triggering events such as a change in portfolio managers. in addition, mutual fund communications consist of notices and marketing materials such as newsletters.
â¢   proxy contests and specials, corporate actions, and other: the proxy services we provide in connection with shareholder meetings driven by special events such as proxy contests, mergers and acquisitions, and tender/exchange offers.
event-driven fee revenues are based on the number of special events and corporate transactions we process. event-driven activity is impacted by financial market conditions and changes in regulatory compliance requirements, resulting in fluctuations in the timing and levels of event-driven fee revenues. as such, the timing and level of event-driven activity and its potential impact on revenues and earnings are difficult to forecast.
generally, mutual fund proxy activity has been subject to a greater level of volatility than the other components of event-driven activity. during fiscal year 2016, mutual fund proxy fee revenues were 22% higher than the prior fiscal year while during fiscal years 2015 and 2014, mutual fund proxy revenues were 2% lower and 31% higher than the prior fiscal year, respectively. although it is difficult to forecast the levels of event-driven activity, we expect that the portion of fee revenues derived from mutual fund proxy activity may continue to experience volatility in the future.
distribution revenues primarily include revenues related to the physical mailing of proxy materials, interim communications, transaction reporting, customer communications and fulfillment services as well as matrix administrative services.
distribution cost of revenues consists primarily of postage-related expenses incurred in connection with our investor communication solutions segment, as well as matrix administrative services expenses. these costs are reflected in cost of revenues.
closed sales represent the expected recurring annual revenue for new client contracts that were signed by broadridge during the periods referenced. these types of sales were previously described by the company as recurring revenue closed sales. closed sales are a key indicator of broadridge's expected future revenue growth. the amount of the closed sale is an estimate of annual revenues based on client volumes or activity, it excludes distribution revenues. the inherent variability of transaction volumes and activity levels can result in some variability of amounts reported as closed sales. larger closed sales can take up to 12 to 24 months or longer to convert to revenues, particularly for the services provided by our global technology and operations segment.
the company tracks actual revenues achieved during the first year that the client contract is fully implemented and compares this to the amount that was included in the company's previously reported closed sales amount. the company adjusts the current year closed sales amount for differences between the prior years' reported closed sales amount and the actual revenues achieved in the first year of the applicable contract. closed sales were adjusted by $(10.5) million, $(2.9) million and $(1.0) million for the fiscal years ended june 30, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.

basic and diluted earnings per share for the fiscal year ended june 30, 2015 were $2.39, an increase of $0.19, or 9%, and $2.32, an increase of $0.20, or 9%, respectively, compared to $2.20 and $2.12 for the fiscal year ended june 30, 2014, respectively analysis of reportable segments broadridge has two reportable business segments: (1) investor communication solutions and (2) global technology and operations.
the primary components of "other" are the elimination of intersegment revenues and profits as well as certain unallocated expenses. foreign currency exchange is a reconciling item between the actual foreign currency exchange rates and the constant foreign exchange rates used for internal management reporting.
certain corporate expenses, as well as certain centrally managed expenses, are allocated based upon budgeted amounts in a reasonable manner. because the company compensates the management of its various businesses on, among other factors, segment profit, the company may elect to record certain segment-related expense items in other rather than reflect such items in segment profit.

explanation and reconciliation of the company's use of non-gaap financial measures the company's results in this annual report on form 10-k are presented in accordance with u.s. gaap except where otherwise noted. in certain circumstances, results have been presented that are not generally accepted accounting principles measures ("non-gaap"). these non-gaap measures are adjusted operating income, adjusted net earnings, adjusted diluted earnings per share, and free cash flows. these non-gaap financial measures should be viewed in addition to, and not as a substitute for, the company's reported results.
the company believes our non-gaap financial measures help investors understand how management plans, measures and evaluates the company's business performance. management believes that non-gaap measures provide consistency in its financial reporting and facilitates investors' understanding of the company's historical operating trends by providing an additional basis for comparisons to prior periods. management uses these non-gaap financial measures to, among other things, evaluate our ongoing operations, for internal planning and forecasting purposes and in the calculation of performance-based compensation. in addition, and as a consequence of the importance of these non-gaap financial measures in managing our business, the company's compensation committee of the board of directors incorporates non-gaap financial measures in the evaluation process for determining management compensation.
adjusted operating income, adjusted net earnings and adjusted diluted earnings per share these non-gaap measures reflect operating income, net earnings, and diluted earnings per share, as adjusted to exclude the impact of certain costs, expenses, gains and losses and other specified items that management believes are not indicative of our ongoing performance. these adjusted measures exclude the impact of acquisition amortization and other costs, which represent the amortization of acquired intangibles as well as other transaction costs and certain integration costs associated with the company's acquisition activities. we exclude acquisition amortization and other costs from these measures because excluding such information provides us with an understanding of the results from the primary operations of our business and these items do not reflect ordinary operations or earnings. management believes that these measures may be useful to an investor in evaluating the underlying operating performance of our business.
free cash flows in addition to the non-gaap financial measures discussed above, we provide free cash flow information because we consider free cash flows to be a liquidity measure that provides useful information to management and investors about the amount of cash generated that could be used for dividends, share repurchases, strategic acquisitions and other discretionary investments. free cash flows is a non-gaap financial measure and is defined by the company as net cash flows provided by operating activities less capital expenditures, software purchases and capitalized internal use software.

in july 2016, shortly after the end of the 2016 fiscal year, we completed the acquisition of the nacc business of dst systems, inc. the aggregate purchase price was $410.0 million in cash, subject to customary working capital and other closing adjustments. on july 5, 2016, we converted $111.5 million canadian dollars to u.s. dollars as part of the funding for this acquisition.
as of june 30, 2016, $174.3 million of the $727.7 million of cash and cash equivalents was held by our foreign subsidiaries, and $56.1 million of cash and cash equivalents were held by regulated entities. we expect existing domestic cash, cash equivalents, and cash flows from operations to continue to be sufficient to fund our domestic operating activities and cash commitments for investing and financing activities, such as regular quarterly dividends, debt repayment schedules, and material capital expenditures, for at least the next 12 months and thereafter for the foreseeable future. in addition, we expect existing foreign cash, cash equivalents, and cash flows from operations to continue to be sufficient to fund our foreign operating activities and cash commitments for investing activities, such as material capital expenditures, for at least the next 12 months and thereafter for the foreseeable future. if these funds are needed for our operations in the u.s., we would be required to accrue and pay u.s. taxes to repatriate these funds. however, our current plans do not demonstrate a need to repatriate them to fund our u.s. operations, as we consider these funds to be permanently reinvested outside the u.s.

capital expenditures, software purchases and capitalized internal use software       (75.5   )           (66.0   )            (9.5    )
the increase in cash provided by operating activities of $6.3 million was due to: (a) $42.4 million of increased cash provided by (i) an increase in net earnings of $20.4 million; combined with (ii) an increase in non-cash expense add-backs and other adjustments of $10.5 million; and (iii) a decrease in working capital of $11.5 million, notwithstanding the collection of a $26.1 million tax refund by a canadian subsidiary in the prior year that did not recur; offset by: (b) $36.1 million of increased cash used in non-current assets and liabilities due primarily to long-term client contracts.
the decrease in free cash flows of $3.2 million was driven by an increase in net cash flows provided by operating activities of $6.3 million, partially offset by increased capital expenditures, software purchases and capitalized internal use software of $9.5 million.
the decrease in cash used in investing activities of $139.5 million primarily reflects lower spending of $149.9 million on acquisitions in the current fiscal year as compared to the prior fiscal year, partially offset by higher capital expenditures and purchases of intangibles of $9.5 million in the current fiscal year as compared to the prior fiscal year.
the increased cash provided by financing activities of $266.9 million reflects a $181.9 million decrease in the purchases of common stock in the current fiscal year compared to the prior fiscal year and an increase in net proceeds from borrowings of
$167.9 million in the current year compared to the prior fiscal year, partially offset by a decrease of $37.3 million in proceeds from stock options the current fiscal year as compared to the prior fiscal year, a decrease of $19.2 million in excess tax benefits from the issuance of stock-based compensation awards and a $15.9 million increase in dividends paid.
2015                                                                                             2014                          $ change

net cash flows provided by operating activities (gaap)                              $431.4              $387.7               $43.7
capital expenditures, software purchases and capitalized internal use software       (66.0   )           (53.4   )           (12.6    )
the increase in cash provided by operating activities is primarily due to higher net earnings and changes in working capital resulting from the timing of accounts receivable collections and vendor payments, which includes the collection of a $26.1 million tax refund by a canadian subsidiary resulting from the prior settlement and execution of the advanced pricing agreement with the internal revenue service and canadian revenue authority.
the increase in free cash flows of $31.1 million was driven by an increase in net cash flows provided by operating activities of $43.7 million, partially offset by increased capital expenditures and purchases of intangibles of $12.6 million.
the increase in net cash flows used in investing activities primarily reflects higher spending of $106.0 million on acquisitions during the fiscal year ended june 30, 2015, compared to the fiscal year ended june 30, 2014, as well as higher capital expenditures and purchases of intangibles of $12.6 million in the current fiscal year as compared to the prior fiscal year.
the decreased use of net cash flows used in financing activities reflects net proceeds from borrowings on the revolving credit facility of $165.0 million in the current year coupled with an increase of $17.7 million in excess tax benefits from the issuance of stock-based compensation awards and an increase of $12.6 million in proceeds from stock options in the current fiscal year as compared to the prior fiscal year. the increased sources were offset by a $172.0 million increase in the purchases of common stock in the current fiscal year compared to the prior fiscal year and a $25.6 million increase in dividends paid.
income taxes the company, headquartered in the u.s., is routinely examined by the irs and is also routinely examined by the tax authorities in the u.s. states and foreign countries in which it conducts business. the tax years under audit examination vary by tax jurisdiction. the company regularly considers the likelihood of assessments in each of the jurisdictions resulting from examinations. to the extent the company determines it has potential tax assessment in particular tax jurisdictions, the company has established tax reserves which it believes are adequate in relation to the potential assessments. once established, reserves are adjusted when there is more information available, when an event occurs necessitating a change to the reserves or the statute of limitations for the relevant taxing authority to examine the tax position has expired. the resolution of tax matters should not have a material effect on the financial condition of the company or on the company's consolidated statements of earnings for a particular future period.

item 7.   management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our historical financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10-k, as well as the discussion under "selected consolidated financial data." this discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. our actual results may differ materially from those discussed in or implied by any of the forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including but not limited to those listed under "risk factors" and "special note regarding forward-looking statements."
we enable our customers to make better decisions about risk, investments, and operations with greater precision, efficiency, and discipline. we also help customers across the globe protect and grow the value of people, property and financial assets. we provide value to our customers by supplying proprietary data that, combined with our analytic methods, creates embedded decision support solutions. we are one of the largest aggregators and providers of data pertaining to u.s. property and casualty, or p&c, insurance risks. we offer predictive analytics and decision support solutions to customers in rating, underwriting, claims, catastrophe and weather risk, global risk analytics, natural resources intelligence, and many other fields. refer to item 1. business for further discussion.
our customers use our solutions to make better decisions with greater efficiency and discipline. we refer to these products and services as "solutions" due to the integration among our products and the flexibility that enables our customers to purchase components or the comprehensive package of products. these solutions take various forms, including data, statistical models or tailored analytics, all designed to allow our customers to make more logical decisions. we believe our solutions for analyzing risk positively impact our customers' revenues and help them better manage their costs.
we organize our business in two segments: risk assessment and decision analytics. our risk assessment segment provides statistical, actuarial and underwriting data for the u.s. p&c insurance industry. our risk assessment segment revenues represented 36.3% and 39.1% of our revenues for the years ended december 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. our decision analytics segment provides solutions to our customer in insurance, energy and specialized markets, and financial services. our decision analytics segment revenues represented approximately 63.7% and 60.9% of our revenues for the years ended december 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
on june 1, 2016 and march 11, 2014, we sold our healthcare business, verisk health, and mortgage services business, interthinx, respectively. results of operations for the healthcare and mortgage services businesses are reported as discontinued operations for the year ended december 31, 2016 and for all prior periods presented. see note 10 of our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10-k. as necessary, the amounts have been retroactively adjusted in all periods presented to give recognition to the discontinued operations.
executive summary key performance metrics we believe our business's ability to grow recurring revenue and generate positive cash flow is the key indicator of the successful execution of our business strategy. we use year-over-year revenue and ebitda growth as metrics to measure our performance. ebitda and ebitda margin are non-gaap financial measures (see note 2 within item 6. selected financial data section of management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations). the respective gaap financial measures are net income and net income margin.
revenue growth. we use year-over-year revenue growth as a key performance metric. we assess revenue growth based on our ability to generate increased revenue through increased sales to existing customers, sales to new customers, sales of new or expanded solutions to existing and new customers, and strategic acquisitions of new businesses.
ebitda growth. we use ebitda growth as a proxy for the cash generated by the business. ebitda growth serves as a measure of our ability to balance the size of revenue growth with cost management and investing for future growth.
ebitda margin. we use ebitda margin as a metric to assess segment performance and scalability of our business. we assess ebitda margin based on our ability to increase revenues while controlling expense growth.
revenues we earn revenues through subscriptions, long-term agreements and on a transactional basis, recurring and non-recurring. subscriptions for our solutions are generally paid in advance of rendering services either quarterly or in full upon commencement of the subscription period, which is usually for one year and automatically renewed each year. as a result, the timing of our cash flows generally precedes our recognition of revenues and income and our cash flow from operations tends to be higher in the first quarter as we receive subscription payments. examples of these arrangements include subscriptions that allow our customers to access our standardized coverage language, our claims fraud database or our actuarial services throughout the subscription period. in general, we experience minimal revenue seasonality within the business. our long-term agreements are generally for periods of three to five years. we recognize revenue from subscriptions ratably over the term of the subscription and most long-term agreements are recognized ratably over the term of the agreement.
certain of our solutions are also paid for by our customers on a transactional basis. for example, we have solutions that allow our customers to obtain property-specific rating and underwriting information to price a policy on a commercial building, or compare a p&c insurance, medical or workers' compensation claim with information in our databases. we also provide advisory services, which help our customers get more value out of our analytics and their subscriptions. for the years ended december 31, 2016 and 2015, 16.5% and 17.2% of our revenues were derived from providing transactional recurring and non-recurring solutions, respectively. we earn these revenues as our solutions are delivered or services performed. in general, they are billed monthly at the end of each month.
for the the years ended december 31, 2016 and 2015, 92.0% and 90.1% of the revenues in our risk assessment segment were derived from subscriptions and long-term agreements for our solutions, respectively. our customers in this segment include most of the p&c insurance providers in the u.s. for the years ended december 31, 2016 and 2015, 78.6% and 78.1% of the revenues in our decision analytics segment were derived from subscriptions and long-term agreements for our solutions, respectively.
principal operating costs and expenses personnel expenses are a major component of both our cost of revenues and selling, general and administrative expenses. personnel expenses, which represented 47.7% and 46.5% of our total expenses for the years ended december 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, include salaries, benefits, incentive compensation, equity compensation costs, sales commissions, employment taxes, recruiting costs, and outsourced temporary agency costs.
we allocate personnel expenses between two categories, cost of revenues and selling, general and administrative costs, based on the actual costs associated with each employee. we categorize employees who maintain our solutions as cost of revenues, and all other personnel, including executive managers, sales people, marketing, business development, finance, legal, human resources, and administrative services, as selling, general and administrative expenses. a significant portion of our other operating costs, such as facilities and communications, are either captured within cost of revenues or selling, general and administrative expense based on the nature of the work being performed.
while we expect to grow our headcount over time to take advantage of our market opportunities, we believe that the economies of scale in our operating model will allow us to grow our personnel expenses at a lower rate than revenues.
historically, our ebitda margin has improved because we have been able to increase revenues without a proportionate corresponding increase in expenses. however, part of our corporate strategy is to invest in new solutions, which may offset margin expansion.
cost of revenues. our cost of revenues consists primarily of personnel expenses. cost of revenues also includes the expenses associated with the acquisition and verification of data, the maintenance of our existing solutions and the development and enhancement of our next-generation solutions. our cost of revenues excludes depreciation and amortization.
selling, general and administrative expense. our selling, general and administrative expense also consists primarily of personnel costs. a portion of the other operating costs such as facilities, insurance and communications are allocated to selling, general and administrative costs based on the nature of the work being performed by the employee. our selling, general and administrative expenses excludes depreciation and amortization.
trends affecting our business we serve customers in three primary vertical markets: p&c insurance, energy, and financial services. the industry trends in each of those markets can affect our business.
a significant change in  p&c insurers' profitability could affect the demand for our solutions. for insurers, the keys to profitability include investment income and premium growth. investment income remains under pressure as a result of low interest rates.  growth in p&c insurers' direct written premiums is cyclical, with total industry premium growth receding from a peak of 14.8% in 2002 to a trough of negative 3.1% in 2009 and subsequently recovering to 4.4% in 2012, 4.3% in 2013, 4.4% in 2014 and 3.7% in 2015. based on our experience, insurers more closely scrutinize their spending in periods of more challenging growth. in recent years,  we have signed multi-year contracts with certain customers, and pricing is fixed at the beginning of each multi-year period; pricing for other customers is still linked to prior years' premiums.
trends in catastrophe and non-catastrophe weather losses can have an effect on our customers' profitability, and therefore, their appetite for buying analytics to help them manage their risks. any increase or decrease in frequency or severity of weather events over time could lead to an increased or decreased demand for our catastrophe modeling, catastrophe loss information, and repair cost solutions. likewise, any structural changes in the reinsurance and related brokerage industry from the recent influx of alternative capital or newer technologies could affect demand for our products. we also have a portion of our revenue related to the number of claims processed due to losses, which can be impacted by seasonal storm activity. the need by our customers to fight insurance fraud - both in claims and at policy inception - could lead to increased demand for our underwriting and claims solutions.
trends in the energy, chemicals, and metals and mining sectors and activity in financial markets can influence our revenues. movements of commodity prices affect the profitability of our customers, which include energy, chemicals, and metals and mining companies, while stock markets and mergers and acquisitions, or m&a, are some of the principal drivers affecting our financial institution customers. among the trends influencing commodity prices are supply and demand factors, regulatory requirements, fiscal impacts, regional market structures, and geopolitical risks. following the organization of the petroleum exporting countries, or opec, meeting in november 2016, oil prices have begun to recover indicating an uplift across the energy sector.  after a prolonged slump in the metals and mining sector, there are emerging signs of optimism in the copper, aluminum and lithium markets among others. m&a activity is also beginning to improve with high profile asset sales from shell, total, and bp among others. in addition, we have seen some large investments being made, notably the glencore and qatar deal with rosneft, and the separate ge-baker hughes proposed transaction. furthermore, wood mackenzie expects final investment decisions in the oil and gas sector to significantly increase in 2017, albeit from recent lows. however, volatility in commodity prices means uncertainty for our customers, which can impact their demand for our data and services. notwithstanding the unsettled view of the u.s. leadership towards the paris global accord on climate change, over the longer term wood mackenzie expects a period of change in the energy mix. the ongoing incentivizing of growth in renewable energy and other low carbon technologies around the world will help drive this, while fossil fuels are expected to remain a core part of energy demand for the foreseeable future. we will continue to evolve our offerings to meet the needs of our customers in an increasingly complex market.
market trends continue to influence our financial services vertical in important ways.  most notable among the recent trends affecting the vertical includes a significant increase in the number of alternative lenders and alternative payment instruments in the market.  we are adapting our offerings to address the needs of alternative lenders, backed by our deep expertise and datasets covering the performance of customers across a full range of credit histories.  as well, our unique ability to analyze the customer adoption rates of new alternative payment instruments from our syndicated study datasets is enabling us to serve as the "go to" solution for the industry's analytic needs in the space. a strengthening of the u.s. dollar relative to the currencies of our international customers and a softening of the global economy is putting an even greater level of
downward pressure on our revenues from such customers.  however, we are also observing a growing appetite for our expense-focused solutions and regulatory-focused solutions among those customers.  lastly, we are seeing a greater number of companies entering the media effectiveness space, which encourages potential competitors to challenge our position in this space.  we stand confident of our position at this stage, given the unique nature and strength of our partnerships coupled by the comprehensiveness of our data, particularly as it relates to seeing the full wallet spend of a consumer.

quarterly results of operations the following table sets forth our quarterly unaudited consolidated statement of operations data for each of the eight quarters in the period ended december 31, 2016. in management's opinion, the quarterly data has been prepared on the same basis as the audited consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10-k, and reflects all necessary adjustments for a fair presentation of this data. the results of historical periods are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations for a full year or any future period.
statement of operations data:
operating income                          $192.6              $191.1                $198.4                  $185.5                 $767.6
statement of operations data:
operating income                          $174.0              $146.0                $197.2                  $186.2                 $703.4
liquidity and capital resources as of december 31, 2016 and 2015, we had cash and cash equivalents and available-for-sale securities of $138.5 million and $141.9 million, respectively. subscriptions for our solutions are billed and generally paid in advance of rendering services either quarterly or in full upon commencement of the subscription period, which is usually for one year. subscriptions are automatically renewed at the beginning of each calendar year. we have historically generated significant cash flows from operations. as a result of this factor, as well as the availability of funds under our syndicated revolving credit facility, we believe we will have sufficient cash to meet our working capital and capital expenditure needs, and to fuel our future growth plans.
we have historically managed the business with a working capital deficit due to the fact that, as described above, we offer our solutions and services primarily through annual subscriptions or long-term contracts, which are generally prepaid quarterly or annually in advance of the services being rendered. when cash is received for prepayment of invoices, we record an asset (cash and cash equivalents) on our balance sheet with the offset recorded as a current liability (deferred revenues). this current liability is deferred revenue that does not require a direct cash outflow since our customers have prepaid and are obligated to purchase the services. in most businesses, growth in revenue typically leads to an increase in the accounts receivable balance causing a use of cash as a company grows. unlike these businesses, our cash position is favorably affected by revenue growth, which results in a source of cash due to our customers prepaying for most of our services.
our consolidated capital expenditures as a percentage of consolidated revenues for the years ended december 31, 2016 and 2015, were 7.4% and 8.0%, respectively. we estimate our capital expenditures for 2017 will be approximately $160.0 million, which primarily consists of expenditures on our technology infrastructure and our continuing investments in developing and enhancing our solutions. expenditures related to developing and enhancing our solutions are predominately related to internal-use software and are capitalized in accordance with asc 350-40, "accounting for costs of computer software developed or obtained for internal use." we also capitalize amounts in accordance with asc 985-20, "software to be sold, leased or otherwise marketed."
we have also historically used a portion of our cash for repurchases of our common stock from our stockholders. for the years ended december 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, we repurchased $326.8 million, $20.4 million and $778.5 million, respectively, of our common stock.
financing and financing capacity we had total debt, excluding capital lease obligations, the discounts and debt issuance costs on our senior notes and our committed senior unsecured syndicated revolving credit facility, or the credit facility, of $2,400.0 million and $3,170.0 million at december 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. the debt at december 31, 2016 primarily consists of senior notes issued in 2015, 2012 and 2011 and borrowings outstanding under the credit facility described below. interest on the senior notes is payable semi-annually each year. the discount and debt issuance costs were recorded as "long-term debt" in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets, and will be amortized to "interest expense" in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations within this form 10-k over the life of the respective senior note. the indenture governing the senior notes restricts our ability to, among other things, create certain liens, enter into sale/leaseback transactions and consolidate with, sell, lease, convey, or otherwise transfer all or substantially all of our assets, or merge with or into, any other person or entity. as of december 31, 2016, we had senior notes with an aggregate principal amount of $2,300.0 million outstanding, and we were in compliance with our debt covenants.

the credit facility may be used for general corporate purposes, including working capital needs and capital expenditures, acquisitions and the share repurchase program, or the repurchase program. the credit facility contains certain financial and other covenants that, among other things, impose certain restrictions on indebtedness, liens, investments, and capital expenditures. these covenants also place restrictions on mergers, asset sales, sale/leaseback transactions, payments between us and our subsidiaries, and certain transactions with affiliates. the financial covenants require that, at the end of any fiscal quarter, we have a consolidated interest coverage ratio of at least 3.0 to 1.0 and that we maintain, during any period of four fiscal quarters, a consolidated funded debt leverage ratio of 3.5 to 1.0. we were in compliance with all covenants under the credit facility as of december 31, 2016. interest on borrowings under the credit facility is payable at an interest rate of libor plus 1.125% to 1.625%, depending upon the consolidated funded debt leverage ratio. during the year ended december 31, 2016, we had borrowings of $140.0 million and repayments of $910.0 million under the credit facility. as of december 31, 2016 and 2015, we had outstanding borrowings under the credit facility of $100.0 million and $870.0 million, respectively. in january and february 2017, we repaid a total of $70.0 million of the $100.0 million outstanding borrowings at december 31, 2016 under the credit facility.
on march 10, 2015, in connection with our agreement to acquire wood mackenzie, we entered into a commitment letter for a $2,300.0 million 364-day bridge financing arrangement with bank of america n.a. and morgan stanley bank n.a. acting as joint lead arrangers. this financing arrangement was only to be utilized in the event we did not complete the debt and equity offerings relating to its acquisition of wood mackenzie by a certain date, and was terminated upon the closing of the acquisition. see note 9 to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10-k. we paid fees associated with this financing arrangement of $9.1 million. due to the completion of the debt and equity offerings, this arrangement was terminated and the full $9.1 million of fees were recorded to "interest expense" for the year ended december 31, 2015.

critical accounting policies and estimates our management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states. the preparation of these financial statements require management to make estimates and judgments that affect reported amounts of assets and liabilities and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and revenue and expenses during the reporting periods. these estimates are based on historical experience and on
other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. on an ongoing basis, management evaluates its estimates, including those related to revenue recognition, goodwill and intangible assets, pension and other post retirement benefits, stock based compensation, and income taxes. actual results may differ from these assumptions or conditions.
revenue recognition the company's revenues are primarily derived from sales of services and revenue is recognized as services are performed and information is delivered to our customers. revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred or services have been rendered, fees and/or price are fixed or determinable, and collectability is reasonably assured. revenues for subscription services are recognized ratably over the subscription term, usually one year. revenues from transaction-based fees are recognized as information is delivered to customers, assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met.
the company also has term-based software licenses where the only remaining undelivered element is post-contract customer support, or pcs, including unspecified upgrade rights on a when-and-if available basis. the company recognizes revenue for these licenses ratably over the duration of the license term. the pcs associated with these arrangements is coterminous with the duration of the license term. the company also provides hosting or software solutions that provide continuous access to information and include pcs and recognizes revenue ratably over the duration of the license term. in addition, the determination of certain of our services revenues requires the use of estimates, principally related to transaction volumes in instances where these volumes are reported to us by our customers on a monthly basis in arrears. in these instances, we estimate transaction volumes based on average actual volumes reported by our customers in the past. differences between our estimates and actual final volumes reported are recorded in the period in which actual volumes are reported. we have not experienced significant variances between our estimates of these services revenues reported to us by our customers and actual reported volumes in the past.
we invoice our customers in annual, quarterly, or monthly installments. amounts billed and collected in advance are recorded as deferred revenues on the balance sheet and are recognized as the services are performed and revenue recognition criteria are met.
stock-based compensation the fair value of equity awards is measured on the date of grant using a black-scholes option-pricing model, which requires the use of several estimates, including expected term, expected risk-free interest rate, expected volatility, and expected dividend yield.
stock-based compensation cost is measured at the grant date, based on the fair value of the awards granted, and is recognized as expense over the requisite service period. option grants and restricted stock awards are generally expensed ratably over the four-year vesting period. we follow the substantive vesting period approach for awards granted after january 1, 2005, which requires that stock-based compensation expense be recognized over the period from the date of grant to the date when the award is no longer contingent on the employee providing additional service.
we estimate expected forfeitures of equity awards at the date of grant and recognize compensation expense only for those awards expected to vest. the forfeiture assumption is ultimately adjusted to the actual forfeiture rate.
goodwill and intangibles goodwill represents the excess of acquisition costs over the fair value of tangible net assets and identifiable intangible assets of the businesses acquired. goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are not amortized. intangible assets determined to have definite lives are amortized over their useful lives. goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are subject to impairment testing annually as of june 30, or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be fully recoverable, using the guidance and criteria described in the accounting standard for goodwill and other intangible assets. this testing compares carrying values to fair values and, when appropriate, the carrying value of these assets is reduced to fair value.
as of december 31, 2016, we had goodwill and net intangible assets of $3,588.9 million, which represents 77.5% of our total assets. during 2016, we performed an impairment test as of june 30, 2016 and confirmed that no impairment charge was necessary. there are many assumptions and estimates used that directly impact the results of impairment testing, including an estimate of future expected revenues, earnings and cash flows, useful lives and discount rates applied to such expected cash flows in order to estimate fair value. we have the ability to influence the outcome and ultimate results based on the assumptions and estimates we choose for determining the fair value of our reporting units. to mitigate undue influence, we set criteria and benchmarks that are reviewed and approved by various levels of management and reviewed by other independent parties. the
determination of whether or not goodwill or indefinite-lived acquired intangible assets have become impaired involves a significant level of judgment in the assumptions and estimates underlying the approach used to determine the value of our reporting units. changes in our strategy or market conditions could significantly impact these judgments and require an impairment to be recorded to intangible assets and goodwill. there have been no goodwill impairment indicators subsequent to the impairment test performed as of june 30, 2016. for the year ended december 31, 2016, there were no impairment indicators related to our intangible assets.
pension and postretirement we account for our pension and postretirement benefit plans in accordance with the accounting standard for employers' accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans. this standard requires that employers recognize on a prospective basis the funded status of their defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans on their consolidated balance sheets and recognize as a component of other comprehensive loss, net of tax, the gains or losses and prior service costs or credits that arise during the period but are not recognized as components of net periodic benefit (credit) cost.
certain assumptions are used in the determination of our annual net period benefit (credit) cost and the disclosure of the funded status of these plans. the principal assumptions concern the discount rate used to measure the projected benefit obligation and the expected return on plan assets. we revise these assumptions based on an annual evaluation of long-term trends and market conditions that may have an impact on the cost of providing retirement benefits.
in determining the discount rate, we utilize quoted rates from long-term bond indices, and changes in long-term bond rates over the past year, cash flow models and other data sources we consider reasonable based upon the life expectancy and mortality rate of eligible employees. as part of our evaluation, we calculate the approximate average yields on securities that were selected to match our separate projected cash flows for both the pension and postretirement plans. our separate benefit plan cash flows are input into actuarial models that include data for corporate bonds rated aa or better at the measurement date. the output from the actuarial models are assessed against the prior year's discount rate and quoted rates for long-term bond indices. for our pension plans at december 31, 2016, we determined this rate to be 3.99%, a decrease of 0.74% from the 4.73% rate used at december 31, 2015. our postretirement rate is 3.25% at december 31, 2016 and 2015.
the expected return on plan assets is determined by taking into consideration our analysis of our actual historical investment returns to a broader long-term forecast adjusted based on our target investment allocation, and the current economic environment. our pension asset investment guidelines target an investment portfolio allocation of 40.00% debt securities and 60.00% equity securities. as of december 31, 2016, the pension plan assets were allocated 37.80% debt, 61.60% equity securities and 0.60% other. the veba plan target allocation is 100% debt. we have used our target investment allocation to derive the expected return as we believe this allocation will be retained on an ongoing basis that will be commensurate with the projected cash flows of the plan. the expected return for each investment category within our target investment allocation is developed using average historical rates of return for each targeted investment category, considering the projected cash flow of the qualified pension plan and postretirement plan. the difference between this expected return and the actual return on plan assets is generally deferred and recognized over subsequent periods through future net periodic benefit (credits) costs. we believe these considerations provide the basis for reasonable assumptions with respect to the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets.
the measurement date used to determine the benefit obligation and plan assets is december 31. the future benefit payments for the postretirement plan are net of the federal medical subsidy. as a result of the patient protection and affordable care act and the health care and education reconciliation act of 2010, the tax treatment of federal subsidies paid to sponsors of retiree health benefit plans that provide prescription drug benefits that are at least actuarially equivalent to the corresponding benefits provided under medicare part d was effectively changed. this legislative change reduces future tax benefits of the coverage we provided to participants in the postretirement plan. we are required to account for this change in the period during which the law is enacted.
a one percent change in discount rate and future rate of return on plan assets would have the following effects:
1% decrease                                        1% increase                                         1% decrease                                  1% increase benefit                    projected               benefit                     projected               benefit              projected               benefit                projected

income taxes in projecting future taxable income, we develop assumptions including the amount of future state, federal and foreign pretax operating income, the reversal of temporary differences, and the implementation of feasible and prudent tax planning strategies. these assumptions require significant judgment about the forecasts of future taxable income and are consistent with the plans and estimates we use to manage the underlying businesses. the calculation of our tax liabilities also involves dealing with uncertainties in the application and evolution of complex tax laws and regulations in other jurisdictions.
we account for uncertain tax positions in accordance with accounting for uncertainty in income taxes - an interpretation of asc 740, which addresses the determination of whether tax benefits claimed or expected to be claimed on a tax return should be recorded in the financial statements. under this interpretation, we may recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position.
we recognize and adjust our liabilities when our judgment changes as a result of the evaluation of new information not previously available. due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the tax liabilities. these differences will be reflected as increases or decreases to income tax expense in the period in which they are determined.
we estimate unrecognized tax positions of $0.8 million that may be recognized by december 31, 2017, due to expiration of statutes of limitations and resolution of audits with taxing authorities, net of additional uncertain tax positions.
as of december 31, 2016, we have gross federal, state, and foreign income tax net operating loss carryforwards of $142.5 million, which will expire at various dates from 2017 through 2036. such net operating loss carryforwards expire as follows:
the net deferred income tax liability of $306.6 million consists primarily of timing differences involving depreciation and amortization.

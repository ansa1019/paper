item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations corporate developments introduction we are a diversified holding company with natural gas and electric utility operations (serving customers in wisconsin, illinois, michigan, and minnesota), an approximately 60% equity ownership interest in atc (a federally regulated electric transmission company), and non-utility electric operations through our we power business. see note 24, segment information, for information on our reportable business segments.
corporate strategy our goal is to continue to create long-term value for our shareholders and our customers by focusing on the following:
reliability we have made significant reliability-related investments in recent years, and plan to continue making significant capital investments to strengthen and modernize the reliability of our generation and distribution networks. below are a few examples of reliability projects that are currently underway.
•   umerc, our newly created michigan electric and natural gas utility, is proposing a long-term generation solution for electric reliability in the upper peninsula of michigan. the plan calls for umerc to construct and operate approximately 180 mw of natural gas-fired generation that will be located in the upper peninsula of michigan. the new generation would provide the region with affordable, reliable electricity that generates less emissions than pipp. subject to regulatory approval, the new generation is expected to achieve commercial operation in 2019 and should allow for the retirement of pipp no later than 2020. for more information, see note 22, regulatory environment.
•   pgl is continuing to work on its smp, which primarily involves replacing old cast and ductile iron gas pipes and facilities in the city of chicago's natural gas delivery system with modern polyethylene pipes to reinforce the long-term safety and reliability of the system.
•   wps continues work on its smrp, which involves modernizing parts of its electric distribution system by burying or upgrading lines. the project focuses on electric lines that currently have the lowest reliability in its system, primarily in rural areas that are heavily forested. wps is planning to expand the scope of this project with smrp phase ii. if approved, smrp phase ii will address areas of wps's service territory where reliability is sub-standard to a lesser degree than the areas addressed in the initial phase of the smrp.
operating efficiency we continually look for ways to optimize the operating efficiency of our company. for example, we received approval from the pscw to make changes at ergs to enable the facility to burn coal from the powder river basin located in the western united states. the coal plant was originally designed to burn coal mined from the eastern united states. this project is creating flexibility and has enabled the plant to operate at lower costs, placing it in a better position to be called upon in the miso energy markets, resulting in lower fuel costs for our customers.
post merger, we continue to focus on integrating and improving business processes and consolidating our it infrastructure. we expect the emphasis we are placing on these integration efforts to continue to drive operational efficiency and to put us in position to effectively support plans for future growth.
financial discipline a strong adherence to financial discipline is essential to meeting our earnings projections and maintaining a strong balance sheet, stable cash flows, attractive dividends, and quality credit ratings.
we follow an asset management strategy that focuses on investing in and acquiring assets consistent with our strategic plans, as well as disposing of assets, including property, plant, and equipment and entire business units, that are no longer strategic to operations, are not performing as intended, or have an unacceptable risk profile.
•   see note 2, acquisitions, for information about our acquisition of integrys and the pending acquisition of a natural gas storage facility in michigan.
•   see note 3, dispositions, for information on the sale of itf and the mcpp.
our primary investment opportunities are in three areas: our regulated utility business, our investment in atc, and our generation plants within our we power segment. over the next five years, we expect capital contributions to atc and atc holdco to be approximately $350 million. capital investments will be funded utilizing these capital contributions, in addition to cash generated from operations and debt. we currently forecast that our share of atc's and atc holdco's projected capital expenditures over the next five years will be $1.4 billion inside the traditional atc footprint and $300 million outside of the traditional atc footprint.
excluding atc, we expect total capital expenditures for our retail utilities to be approximately $9.7 billion over the next five years. ongoing projects are discussed in more detail within item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations - liquidity and capital resources.
exceptional customer care our approach is driven by an intense focus on delivering exceptional customer care every day. we strive to provide the best value for our customers by embracing constructive change, leveraging our capabilities and expertise, and using creative solutions to meet or exceed our customers' expectations.
one example of how we obtain feedback from our customers is through our "we care" calls, where employees of our utility subsidiaries contact customers after a completed service call. this program began many years ago at we energies (the trade name of we and wg), and is now being rolled out to the integrys utilities. customer satisfaction is a priority, and making "we care" calls is one of the main methods we use to gauge our performance in order to improve customer satisfaction.
results of operations consolidated earnings the following table compares our consolidated results:
total operating income                                 1,682.1               1,250.5               1,112.1
equity in earnings of transmission affiliate             146.5                  96.1                  66.0
preferred stock dividends of subsidiary                    1.2                   1.8                   1.2
earnings increased $300.5 million in 2016, driven by a $201.7 million increase in earnings due to the inclusion of a full year of integrys's results for 2016, compared to six months of integrys's results for 2015. integrys was acquired on june 29, 2015. see note 2, acquisitions, for more information.
the most significant factor driving the remaining $98.8 million increase in earnings was a $104.1 million pre-tax ($80.1 million after tax) decrease in acquisition costs in 2016.
earnings increased $50.2 million in 2015, driven by a $30.1 million net increase in earnings due to the inclusion of integrys's results for the last six months of 2015, partially offset by acquisition costs recorded by us and our subsidiaries. also contributing to the increase was a $20.8 million pre-tax gain ($12.5 million after tax) from the sale of minergy llc and its remaining financial assets in june 2015.
non-gaap financial measure the discussions below address the operating income contribution of each of our segments and include financial information prepared in accordance with gaap, as well as electric margins and natural gas margins, which are not measures of financial performance under gaap. electric margin (electric revenues less fuel and purchased power costs) and natural gas margin (natural gas revenues less cost of natural gas sold) are non-gaap financial measures because they exclude other operation and maintenance expense, depreciation and amortization, and property and revenue taxes.
we believe that electric and natural gas margins provide a more meaningful basis for evaluating utility operations than operating revenues since the majority of prudently incurred fuel and purchased power costs, as well as prudently incurred natural gas costs, are passed through to customers in current rates. as a result, management uses electric and natural gas margins internally when assessing the operating performance of our segments as these measures exclude the majority of revenue fluctuations caused by changes in these expenses. similarly, the presentation of electric and natural gas margins herein is intended to provide supplemental information for investors regarding our operating performance.
our electric margins and natural gas margins may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies.  furthermore, these measures are not intended to replace operating income as determined in accordance with gaap as an indicator of our segment operating performance.  operating income for each of the last three fiscal years for each of our segments is presented in the "consolidated earnings" table above.
each applicable segment operating income discussion below includes a table that provides the calculation of electric margins and natural gas margins, as applicable, along with a reconciliation to segment operating income.
wisconsin segment contribution to operating income for the periods presented in this annual report on form 10-k, our wisconsin operations included operations of we and wg for all periods, and operations of wps beginning july 1, 2015, due to the acquisition of integrys and its subsidiaries on june 29, 2015.

(1)   represents costs associated with the we power generation units, including operating and maintenance, as well as the lease payments that are billed from we power to we and then recovered in we's rates. during 2016, 2015, and 2014, $528.4 million, $483.4 million, and $475.7 million, respectively, of both lease and operating and maintenance costs were billed to we, with the difference in costs billed and expenses incurred deferred or deducted from the regulatory asset.
(2)   the pscw has approved escrow accounting for atc and miso network transmission expenses for our wisconsin electric utilities. as a result, we and wps defer as a regulatory asset or liability the differences between actual transmission costs and those included in rates until recovery or refund is authorized in a future rate proceeding. during 2016, 2015, and 2014, $486.0 million, $388.6 million, and $302.4 million, respectively, of costs were billed by transmission providers to our electric utilities.
(3)   regulatory amortizations and other pass through expenses are substantially offset in margins and therefore do not have a significant impact on operating income.
the following tables provide information on delivered volumes by customer class and weather statistics:
customer class residential                              10,998.9              9,218.9              7,946.3
*   includes distribution sales for customers who have purchased power from an alternative electric supplier in michigan.

(1)   normal heating and cooling degree days are based on a 20-year moving average of monthly temperatures from mitchell international airport in milwaukee, wisconsin.
(2)   normal heating and cooling degree days are based on a 20-year moving average of monthly temperatures from the green bay, wisconsin weather station. degree days for 2015 have been included for the period from july 1, 2015, through december 31, 2015.
electric utility margins electric utility margins at the wisconsin segment increased $455.8 million during 2016, compared with 2015. the increase was primarily driven by a $386.4 million margin contribution from wps during the first six months of 2016, compared with no margin contribution from wps for the first six months of 2015.
the significant factors impacting the remaining $69.4 million increase in electric utility margins at the wisconsin segment were:
•   the expiration of $12.5 million of bill credits refunded to customers in 2015 related to the treasury grant we received in connection with its biomass facility.
•   an $11.3 million increase in the last six months of 2016 as a result of wps's pscw rate order, effective january 1, 2016. see note 22, regulatory environment, for more information.
these increases were partially offset by a $12.9 million decrease in wholesale margins driven by a reduction in capacity sales year-over-year at we in addition to a reduction in sales volumes at wps for the second half of 2016, compared with the same period in 2015. certain wholesale customers have provisions in their contracts, which allowed them to reduce the amount of energy we provided to them.
natural gas utility margins natural gas utility margins at the wisconsin segment increased $74.3 million during 2016, compared with 2015. the increase in natural gas utiilty margins was driven by a $63.6 million margin contribution from wps during the first six months of 2016, compared with no margin contribution from wps for the first six months of 2015.
the most significant factor impacting the remaining $10.7 million increase in natural gas utility margins at the wisconsin segment was an $18.1 million net increase from both wg's rate order effective january 1, 2016, and a partially offsetting negative impact from wps's rate order during the last six months of 2016. see note 22, regulatory environment, for more information. this net increase was partially offset by a $3.2 million decrease related to lower sales volumes during 2016, primarily driven by warmer winter weather. as measured by heating degree days, 2016 was 6.2% warmer than 2015 in the milwaukee area.
operating income operating income at the wisconsin segment increased $142.8 million during 2016, compared with 2015. the increase was driven by the $530.1 million increase in margins discussed above, partially offset by $387.3 million of higher operating expenses (which include other operation and maintenance, depreciation and amortization, and property and revenues taxes). higher operating expenses were driven by $321.6 million of operating expenses from wps during the first six months of 2016, compared with no operating expenses from wps for the first six months of 2015.
the significant factors impacting the remaining $65.7 million increase in operating expenses at the wisconsin segment were:
•   a $27.0 million increase in depreciation and amortization, driven by an overall increase in utility plant in service. in november 2015, wg completed the western gas lateral project, and we completed the conversion of the fuel source for vapp from coal to natural gas.
•   a $25.3 million increase in expenses in 2016 related to a focus on projects that were beneficial to customers and the communities within our service territories.
•   a $24.4 million expense related to the earnings sharing mechanisms in place at we and wg, effective january 1, 2016. see the pscw conditions of approval related to the integrys acquisition in note 2, acquisitions, for more information.
these increases in operating expenses were partially offset by a $16.4 million positive impact at we from the sale of the mcpp in april 2016, including a gain on sale and lower operating costs in 2016. see note 3, dispositions, for more information.
electric utility margins electric utility margins at the wisconsin segment increased $482.1 million during 2015, compared with 2014. the increase was primarily driven by a $399.1 million margin contribution from wps during the last six months of 2015, compared with no margin contribution from wps during 2014.
•   a $38.4 million increase as a result of the pscw rate order, effective january 1, 2015. see note 22, regulatory environment, for more information.
•   a $35.0 million increase driven by the escrow accounting treatment of the ssr revenues in the pscw rate order, effective january 1, 2015. see note 22, regulatory environment, for more information.
•   a $24.2 million increase due to the return of the iron ore mines as customers in february 2015. the two iron ore mines, which we served on an interruptible tariff rate, switched to an alternative electric supplier effective september 1, 2013. effective february 1, 2015, the owner of the two mines returned them as retail customers. in 2015, we deferred, and expect to continue to defer, the margin from those sales and apply these amounts for the benefit of wisconsin retail electric customers in a future rate proceeding. michigan state law allows the mines to switch to an alternative electric supplier after sufficient notice. a large portion of this increase in margins was offset by higher transmission expense included in other operation and maintenance expense at we.
•   a $10.4 million positive impact from collections of fuel and purchased power costs compared with costs approved in rates in 2015, compared with 2014. under the wisconsin fuel rules, the margins of our electric utilities are impacted by under or over-collections of certain fuel and purchased power costs that are less than a 2% price variance from the costs included in rates, and the remaining variance that exceeds the 2% variance is deferred.
•   a partially offsetting $22.3 million decrease related to sales volume variances in 2015. this decrease was driven by lower margins from residential customers in 2015, primarily due to lower weather-normalized use per customer and warmer weather during the heating season.
•   a partially offsetting $10.8 million decrease in wholesale margins driven by a reduction in sales volumes in 2015.
natural gas utility margins natural gas utility margins at the wisconsin segment increased $22.1 million during 2015, compared with 2014. the increase was related to a $57.9 million margin contribution from wps during the last six months of 2015, compared with no margin contribution from wps during 2014. this increase was partially offset by a decrease in natural gas margins at we and wg of $35.8 million in 2015.
the most significant factor impacting the $35.8 million lower natural gas utility margins at we and wg was a $42.7 million decrease in sales volumes in 2015, largely related to warmer weather during the heating season as well as lower weather-normalized use per customer. as measured by heating degree days, 2015 was 15.1% warmer than 2014. this decrease in margins was partially offset by a $6.4 million net increase in margins as a result of the impact of the we and wg pscw rate orders, effective january 1, 2015. see note 22, regulatory environment, for more information.
operating income operating income at the wisconsin segment increased $114.0 million during 2015, compared with 2014. the increase was driven by the $504.2 million increase in margins discussed above, partially offset by $390.2 million of higher operating expenses (which include other operation and maintenance, depreciation and amortization, and property and revenues taxes). higher operating expenses were driven by $334.2 million of operating expenses from wps during the last six months of 2015, compared with no operating expenses from wps during 2014.
the significant factors impacting the remaining $56.0 million of higher operating expenses at we and wg were:
•   a $48.6 million increase from higher lease expense related to the we power leases and associated operating and maintenance expenses as approved in we's pscw rate order, effective january 1, 2015.
◦   an overall increase in utility plant in service in 2015. in november 2015, wg completed the western gas lateral project, and we completed the conversion of the fuel source for vapp from coal to natural gas.
◦   a $7.7 million reduction in income received in 2015 from the treasury grant we received in connection with the completion of its biomass plant in november 2013. the lower grant income corresponds to lower bill credits provided to we's retail electric customers in wisconsin.
•   a $16.0 million increase in transmission expense from miso and atc related to the iron ore mines returning as customers in february 2015.
these increases in operating expenses were partially offset by:
•   a $16.1 million decrease in employee benefit costs in 2015 driven by lower performance units share-based compensation, deferred compensation, and medical costs.
•   a $9.3 million decrease in electric and natural gas distribution costs in 2015, related to amortization of design software and maintenance costs.

*   normal heating degree days are based on a 12-year moving average of monthly temperatures from chicago's o'hare airport.
we did not have any operations in illinois until our acquisition of integrys on june 29, 2015. since the majority of pgl and nsg customers use natural gas for heating, operating income is sensitive to weather and is generally higher during the winter months.
natural gas utility margins natural gas utility margins at the illinois segment increased $506.8 million during 2016, compared with 2015. the increase was primarily driven by a $467.8 million margin contribution from the illinois segment during the first six months of 2016, compared to no margin contribution from this segment for the first six months of 2015.
the significant factors impacting the remaining $39.0 million increase in natural gas utility margins at the illinois segment were:
•   a $26.3 million increase in margins related to the riders included in the table above during the last six months of 2016, compared with the last six months of 2015. pgl and nsg recover certain operating expenses directly through separate riders, resulting in no impact on operating income as increases in operating expenses are offset by equal increases in margins.
•   a $10.8 million increase in revenue at pgl due to continued capital investment in projects under its qualifying infrastructure plant rider. pgl currently recovers the costs related to the smp through a surcharge on customer bills pursuant to an icc approved qualifying infrastructure plant rider, which is in effect through 2023.
operating income operating income at the illinois segment increased $161.5 million during 2016, compared with 2015. the increase was primarily driven by the $506.8 million increase in margin discussed above, partially offset by:
•   operating expenses of $308.2 million during the first six months of 2016, compared with no operating expenses during the first six months of 2015.
•   a $26.3 million increase in other operation and maintenance expenses related to the riders included in the table above during the last six months of 2016, compared with the last six months of 2015.
•   a $9.7 million increase in other operation and maintenance expenses during the last six months of 2016 compared with the last six months of 2015, due to an increase in expenses related to a focus on projects that were beneficial to customers and the communities within our service territory.

*   normal heating degree days for merc and mgu are based on a 20-year moving average and 15-year moving average, respectively, of monthly temperatures from various weather stations throughout their respective territories.
we did not have any operations in this segment until our acquisition of integrys on june 29, 2015. since the majority of merc and mgu customers use natural gas for heating, operating income is sensitive to weather and is generally higher during the winter months.
natural gas utility margins natural gas utility margins at the other states segment increased $121.8 million during 2016, compared with 2015. the increase was primarily driven by a $110.4 million margin contribution from the other states segment during the first six months of 2016, compared to no margin contribution from this segment for the first six months of 2015.
the significant factors impacting the remaining $11.4 million increase in natural gas utility margins at the other states segment were:
•   a $3.9 million increase in the last six months of 2016 as a result of various rate orders. the merc interim rate order was effective january 1, 2016, and accounted for $2.5 million of the rate increase. the mgu rate order was also effective january 1, 2016, and accounted for $1.4 million to the rate increase. see note 22, regulatory environment, for more information.
•   a $3.0 million increase related to higher sales volumes during the last six months of 2016, driven by colder weather. as measured by heating degree days, the last six months of 2016 were 8.2% colder than the last six months of 2015 for these respective territories.
•   a $1.6 million increase related to the merc conservation improvement program financial incentive as a result of exceeding certain energy savings goals.
operating income operating income at the other states segment increased $43.9 million during 2016, compared with 2015. the increase was driven by the $121.8 million increase in margins discussed above, partially offset by $77.9 million of higher operating expenses. higher operating expenses were driven primarily by $76.3 million of operating expenses from the other states segment during the first six months of 2016, compared with no operating expenses during the first six months of 2015.

earnings from our ownership interest in atc increased $50.4 million when compared to 2015, primarily driven by the increase in our ownership interest from 26.2% to approximately 60% as a result of the acquisition of integrys on june 29, 2015. in addition, lower equity earnings in 2015 were driven by an alj initial decision in december 2015 related to the atc roe reviews, which was later affirmed by a ferc order in 2016. see item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations - factors affecting results, liquidity, and capital resources - other matters - american transmission company allowed return on equity complaints below for more information on these decisions.
earnings from our ownership interest in atc increased $30.1 million when compared to 2014, primarily driven by the increase in our ownership interest from 26.2% to approximately 60% as a result of the acquisition of integrys. this increase was partially offset by lower earnings recognized by atc, as atc further reduced earnings in 2015 related to an anticipated refund to customers resulting from a complaint filed with the ferc requesting a lower roe for certain transmission owners.

other income, net increased by $21.9 million when compared to 2015. this increase was primarily due to the repurchase of a portion of integrys's 6.11% junior notes at a discount in february 2016, as well as higher afudc due to the inclusion of afudc from the integrys companies post acquisition. see note 14, long-term debt and capital lease obligations, for more information on the repurchase. partially offsetting this increase was a $19.6 million gain recorded in april 2016 from the sale of the chilled water generation and distribution assets of wisvest, compared with a $20.8 million gain from the sale of minergy llc and its remaining financial assets in june 2015, as well as excise tax credits recognized by itf in 2015. itf was sold in the first quarter of 2016. see note 3, dispositions, for more information on our asset sales.
other income, net increased by $45.5 million when compared to 2014. this increase was primarily due to the $20.8 million gain from the sale of minergy llc and its remaining financial assets in june 2015, as well as higher afudc - equity due to the inclusion of afudc from the integrys companies post acquisition.
interest expense increased $71.3 million, or 21.5%, when compared to 2015. the increase was primarily driven by $68.5 million of interest expense from integrys and its subsidiaries during the first six months of 2016, compared to no interest expense from these companies during the same period in 2015. additionally, we issued $1.2 billion of long-term debt in june 2015 to finance a portion of the cash consideration for the acquisition of integrys. this was offset, in part, by the repurchase of a portion of the 6.11% junior notes in february 2016. these notes were replaced with lower-interest rate short-term debt.
interest expense increased $91.1 million, or 37.9%, when compared to 2014, primarily due to higher debt levels. we assumed approximately $3.0 billion of debt from integrys and its subsidiaries upon the closing of the acquisition on june 29, 2015. additionally, we issued $1.2 billion of long-term debt in june 2015 to finance a portion of the cash consideration for the acquisition of integrys.
our effective tax rate was 37.6% in 2016 compared to 40.4% in 2015. this decrease was primarily related to a charge in 2015 to remeasure our state deferred income taxes as a result of the acquisition of integrys. see note 15, income taxes, for more information. we expect our 2017 annual effective tax rate to be between 37.0% and 38.0%.
our effective tax rate was 40.4% in 2015 compared to 38.0% in 2014. this increase in our effective tax rate was primarily related to a charge in 2015 to remeasure our state deferred income taxes as a result of the acquisition of integrys.
liquidity and capital resources cash flows the following table summarizes our cash flows for the years ended december 31:
(in millions)                 2016                  2015                  2014                        change in 2016 over 2015         change in 2015 over 2014
operating activities                 $2,103.5              $1,293.6              $1,198.9                    $809.9                            $94.7
operating activities
net cash provided by operating activities increased $809.9 million during 2016. this increase was driven by $466.6 million of net cash flows from the operating activities of integrys during the first six months of 2016, since integrys was acquired on june 29, 2015. see note 2, acquisitions, for more information.
the remaining $343.3 million increase in net cash provided by operating activities was driven by:
•   a $377.9 million increase in cash resulting from lower payments for natural gas and fuel and purchased power, due to lower commodity prices and warmer weather during the 2016 heating season. the average per-unit cost of natural gas sold decreased 18.5% in 2016.
•   a $44.1 million increase in cash due to lower collateral requirements during 2016, driven by an increase in the fair value of our derivative instruments. see note 20, derivative instruments, for more information.
•   a $29.2 million increase in cash received for income taxes, primarily due to a wisconsin state income tax refund received in the fourth quarter of 2016.
these increases in net cash provided by operating activities were partially offset by a $210.8 million decrease in cash related to lower overall collections from customers. collections from customers decreased primarily because of lower commodity prices and warmer weather during the 2016 heating season.
net cash provided by operating activities increased $94.7 million during 2015, driven by a $141.6 million increase related to net cash flows from the operating activities of integrys during the last six months of 2015.
the $46.9 million decrease in net cash provided by operating activities from the legacy wisconsin energy corporation companies was driven by:
•   a $418.0 million decrease in cash related to lower overall collections from customers during 2015. collections from customers decreased primarily because of lower commodity prices and warmer weather during the 2015 heating season. the average per-unit cost of natural gas sold decreased 33.1% in 2015.
•   a $141.4 million decrease in cash related to higher payments for operating and maintenance costs during 2015, primarily due to costs related to the acquisition of integrys.
these decreases in net cash provided by operating activities from the legacy wisconsin energy corporation companies were partially offset by a $592.4 million increase in cash resulting from lower payments for natural gas and fuel and purchased power, due to lower commodity prices and warmer weather during the 2015 heating season.
•   an investment of $1,329.9 million in june 2015 related to the acquisition of integrys, which is net of cash acquired of $156.3 million. see note 2, acquisitions, for more information.
•   a $137.4 million increase in the proceeds received from the sale of certain assets and businesses during 2016. see note 3, dispositions, for more information.
these decreases in net cash used in investing activities were partially offset by:
•   a $157.5 million increase in cash paid for capital expenditures, which is discussed in more detail below.
•   a $33.6 million increase in our capital contributions to atc, driven by both the continued investment in equipment and facilities by atc to improve reliability and the increase in our atc ownership interest as a result of the june 2015 integrys acquisition. see note 4, investment in american transmission company, for more information.
•   an investment of $1,329.9 million in june 2015 related to the acquisition of integrys, which is net of cash acquired of $156.3 million.
•   a $505.0 million increase in cash paid for capital expenditures during 2015, which is discussed in more detail below.
these increases in cash used for investing activities were partially offset by:
•   a $17.3 million increase in cash related to the receipt of the cash surrender value of integrys corporate-owned life insurance policies in 2015.
•   a $15.0 million increase in proceeds from asset sales, driven by the sale of minergy llc and its remaining financial assets in 2015.
capital expenditures capital expenditures by segment for the years ended december 31 were as follows:
reportable segment(in millions)                  2016                  2015                2014             change in 2016 over 2015             change in 2015 over 2014
total capital expenditures               $1,423.7              $1,266.2              $761.2                        $157.5                               $505.0
the decrease in cash paid for capital expenditures at the wisconsin segment during 2016 was driven by lower capital expenditures as a result of the november 2015 completion of both wg's western gas lateral project, which improved the reliability of wg's natural gas distribution network in the western part of wisconsin, and we's coal to natural gas conversion project at vapp. also contributing to the decrease were lower payments at we for environmental compliance projects and electric distribution upgrades. the inclusion of wps for all of 2016, as compared with only the last six months of 2015, substantially offset these lower capital expenditures. wps's capital expenditures of $154.1 million during the first six months of 2016 related to the reacttm emission control technology project at weston unit 3, a combustion turbine project at the fox energy center, and the smrp, a project to underground and upgrade certain electric distribution facilities in northern wisconsin.
the increase in cash paid for capital expenditures at the illinois segment during 2016 was due to the inclusion of pgl and nsg for all of 2016, compared with only the last six months of 2015. capital expenditures at the illinois segment were driven primarily by the smp at pgl.
the increase in cash paid for capital expenditures at the other states segment during 2016 was due to the inclusion of merc and mgu for all of 2016, compared with only the last six months of 2015. merc's and mgu's capital expenditures of $22.7 million during the first six months of 2016 primarily related to natural gas distribution systems and mains.
the increase in cash paid for capital expenditures at the corporate and other segment during 2016 was driven by a project to implement a new enterprise resource planning system and an information technology project created to improve the billing, call center, and credit collection functions of the integrys subsidiaries.
see item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations - liquidity and capital resources - capital requirements - capital expenditures and significant capital projects for more information.
the increase in capital expenditures at the wisconsin segment during 2015 was primarily due to the inclusion of wps as a result of the integrys acquisition on june 29, 2015. significant projects included in wps's 2015 capital expenditures were the reacttm emission control technology project at weston unit 3 and the smrp. the wisconsin segment also included increased expenditures in 2015 related to wg's western gas lateral project. these increases were partially offset by lower capital expenditures in 2015 for we's conversion of the fuel source for vapp from coal to natural gas, as most of the capital expenditures related to this project were incurred in 2014.
the illinois segment includes capital expenditures from pgl and nsg as a result of the integrys acquisition on june 29, 2015. in 2015, pgl incurred significant capital expenditures related to the smp.
the other states segment includes capital expenditures from merc and mgu as a result of the integrys acquisition on june 29, 2015.
•   a $1,526.4 million net decrease in cash due to a $1,750.0 million decrease in the issuance of long-term debt during 2016, partially offset by $223.6 million of lower repayments of long-term debt during 2016. we issued $1,200.0 million of long-term debt during 2015 in connection with the acquisition of integrys.
•   a $397.8 million net decrease in cash due to $234.8 million of net repayments of commercial paper during 2016 compared with $163.0 million of net borrowings of commercial paper during 2015.
•   a $169.5 million increase in dividends paid on common stock during 2016, due to the issuance of 90.2 million shares of our common stock in june 2015 as a result of the integrys acquisition and increases to our quarterly dividend rate. see note 2, acquisitions, for more information.
•   a $33.3 million increase in cash used to purchase shares of our common stock during 2016 to satisfy requirements of our stock-based compensation plans.
these decreases in net cash related to financing activities were partially offset by a $52.7 million increase in cash due to the redemption of all of wps's preferred stock during 2015.
•   a $1,900.0 million increase in the issuance of long-term debt during 2015, of which $1,200.0 million related to the acquisition of integrys.
•   an $82.8 million increase in net borrowings of commercial paper during 2015.
these increases in net cash related to financing activities were partially offset by:
•   a $205.3 million increase in retirements of long-term debt during 2015, of which $130.1 million related to legacy integrys and its subsidiaries.
•   a $103.4 million increase in dividends paid on common stock due to the issuance of 90.2 million shares of our common stock in june 2015 as a result of the integrys acquisition and an increase in our quarterly dividend rate effective with the closing of the acquisition.
•   a $52.7 million decrease in cash due to the redemption of all of wps's preferred stock during 2015.
significant financing activities for more information on our financing activities, see note 13, short-term debt and lines of credit, and note 14, long-term debt and capital lease obligations.
capital resources and requirements capital resources liquidity we anticipate meeting our capital requirements for our existing operations through internally generated funds and short-term borrowings, supplemented by the issuance of intermediate or long-term debt securities, depending on market conditions and other factors.
we currently have access to the capital markets and have been able to generate funds internally and externally to meet our capital requirements. our ability to attract the necessary financial capital at reasonable terms is critical to our overall strategic plan. we currently believe that we have adequate capacity to fund our operations for the foreseeable future through our existing borrowing arrangements, access to capital markets, and internally generated cash.
wec energy group, we, wg, wps, and pgl maintain bank back-up credit facilities, which provide liquidity support for each company's obligations with respect to commercial paper and for general corporate purposes. we review our bank back-up credit facility needs on an ongoing basis and expect to be able to maintain adequate credit facilities to support our operations. see note 13, short-term debt and lines of credit, for more information about these credit facilities.
the following table shows our capitalization structure as of december 31, 2016 and 2015, as well as an adjusted capitalization structure that we believe is consistent with how the rating agencies currently view our 2007 6.25% series a junior subordinated notes due 2067 (6.25% junior notes):
preferred stock of subsidiary                              30.4                   30.4                   30.4                   30.4
total capitalization                                  $19,135.8              $19,135.8              $19,062.0              $19,062.0
ratio of debt to total capitalization                      53.2    %              51.9    %              54.4    %              53.1    %
included in long-term debt on our balance sheets as of december 31, 2016 and 2015, is $500.0 million principal amount of 6.25% junior notes. the adjusted presentation attributes $250.0 million of the 6.25% junior notes to common equity and $250.0 million to long-term debt. as a result of integrys's repurchase and retirement of some of its 6.11% junior notes, we were informed by one rating agency that it will no longer attribute equity credit to integrys's remaining junior subordinated notes, consisting of $114.9 million aggregate principal amount of the 6.11% junior notes, and $400.0 million aggregate principal amount of its 6.00% junior subordinated notes due 2073. therefore, the integrys junior subordinated notes are no longer being adjusted in the table above. for additional information on the repurchase of the 6.11% junior notes, see note 14, long-term debt and capital lease obligations.
the adjusted presentation of our consolidated capitalization structure is presented as a complement to our capitalization structure presented in accordance with gaap. management evaluates and manages our capitalization structure, including our total debt to total capitalization ratio, using the gaap calculation as adjusted by the rating agency treatment of the 6.25% junior notes. therefore, we believe the non-gaap adjusted presentation reflecting this treatment is useful and relevant to investors in understanding how management and the rating agencies evaluate our capitalization structure.
for a summary of the interest rate, maturity, and amount outstanding of each series of our long-term debt on a consolidated basis, see our capitalization statements.
as described in note 11, common equity, certain restrictions exist on the ability of our subsidiaries to transfer funds to us. we do not expect these restrictions to have any material effect on our operations or ability to meet our cash obligations.
at december 31, 2016, we were in compliance with all covenants related to outstanding short-term and long-term debt. we expect to be in compliance with all such debt covenants for the foreseeable future. see note 13, short-term debt and lines of credit, for more information about our credit facilities and other short-term credit agreements. see note 14, long-term debt and capital lease obligations, for more information about our long-term debt.
working capital as of december 31, 2016, our current liabilities exceeded our current assets by approximately $262.9 million. we do not expect this to have any impact on our liquidity since we believe we have adequate back-up lines of credit in place for ongoing operations. we also can access the capital markets to finance our construction programs and to refinance current maturities of long-term debt, if necessary.
credit rating risk we do not have any credit agreements that would require material changes in payment schedules or terminations as a result of a credit rating downgrade. however, we have certain agreements in the form of commodity contracts and employee benefit plans that could require collateral or a termination payment in the event of a credit rating change to below bbb- at s&p global ratings and/or baa3 at moody's investors service. we also have other commodity contracts that, in the event of a credit rating downgrade, could result in a reduction of our unsecured credit granted by counterparties.
in addition, access to capital markets at a reasonable cost is determined in large part by credit quality. any credit ratings downgrade could impact our ability to access capital markets.
subject to other factors affecting the credit markets as a whole, we believe our current ratings should provide a significant degree of flexibility in obtaining funds on competitive terms. however, these security ratings reflect the views of the rating agency only. an explanation of the significance of these ratings may be obtained from the rating agency. such ratings are not a recommendation to buy, sell, or hold securities. any rating can be revised upward or downward or withdrawn at any time by a rating agency.
capital requirements contractual obligations we have the following contractual obligations and other commercial commitments as of december 31, 2016:
capital lease obligations (3)                                   85.3                    13.9                      30.2                    33.6                       7.6
operating lease obligations (4)                                 95.5                     9.9                      14.7                    10.8                      60.1
capital contributions to equity method investments              24.1                    24.1                         -                       -                         -
(1)   the amounts included in the table are calculated using current market prices, forward curves, and other estimates.
(2)   principal and interest payments on long-term debt (excluding capital lease obligations).
(3)   capital lease obligations for power purchase commitments. this amount does not include we power leases to we which are eliminated upon consolidation.
(4)   operating lease obligations for power purchase commitments and rail car leases.
(5)   energy and transportation purchase obligations under various contracts for the procurement of fuel, power, gas supply, and associated transportation related to utility operations.
(6)   purchase obligations related to normal business operations, information technology, and other services.
the table above does not include liabilities related to the accounting treatment for uncertainty in income taxes because we are not able to make a reasonably reliable estimate as to the amount and period of related future payments at this time. for additional information regarding these liabilities, refer to note 15, income taxes.
aros in the amount of $557.7 million are not included in the above table. settlement of these liabilities cannot be determined with certainty, but we believe the majority of these liabilities will be settled in more than five years.
obligations for utility operations have historically been included as part of the rate-making process and therefore are generally recoverable from customers.
capital expenditures and significant capital projects we have several capital projects that will require significant capital expenditures over the next three years and beyond. all projected capital requirements are subject to periodic review and may vary significantly from estimates, depending on a number of factors. these factors include environmental requirements, regulatory restraints and requirements, changes in tax laws and regulations, acquisition and development opportunities, market volatility, and economic trends. our estimated capital expenditures for the next three years are as follows:
wps is continuing work on the smrp. this project includes converting more than 1,000 miles of overhead distribution power lines to underground in northern wisconsin and adding distribution automation equipment on 400 miles of lines. wps expects to invest approximately $45 million annually through 2018. subject to regulatory review, phase ii of the smrp will expand the scope and cost of the original smrp and will consist of over 900 miles of underground circuit installation. wps expects to invest approximately $200 million between 2018 and 2021 related to phase ii. we, wps, and wg will also continue to upgrade their electric and natural gas distribution systems to enhance reliability.
in connection with the formation of umerc, we entered into an agreement with tilden mining company under which it will purchase electric power from umerc for 20 years. the agreement calls for umerc to construct and operate approximately 180 mw of natural gas-fired generation located in the upper peninsula of michigan. the estimated cost of this project is approximately $265 million ($275 million including afudc). see note 22, regulatory environment, for more information about umerc and this new generation.
in january 2017, we signed an agreement for the acquisition of a natural gas storage facility in michigan for $225 million that would provide approximately one-third of the storage needs for our wisconsin natural gas utilities. in addition, we expect to incur approximately $5 million of acquisition related costs. see note 2, acquisitions, for more information on this transaction.
pgl is continuing work on the smp, a project under which pgl is replacing approximately 2,000 miles of chicago's aging natural gas pipeline infrastructure. pgl currently recovers these costs through a surcharge on customer bills pursuant to an icc approved qualifying infrastructure plant rider, which is in effect through 2023. pgl's projected average annual investment through 2019 is between $280 million and $300 million.
we expect to provide capital contributions to atc (not included in the above table) of approximately $226 million from 2017 through 2019.
common stock matters for information related to our common stock matters, see note 11, common equity.
on january 19, 2017, our board of directors increased our quarterly dividend to $0.52 per share effective with the first quarter of 2017 dividend payment, which equates to an annual dividend of $2.08 per share. in addition, the board of directors affirmed our dividend policy that continues to target a dividend payout ratio of 65-70% of earnings.
investments in outside trusts we use outside trusts to fund our pension and certain opeb obligations. these trusts had investments of approximately $3.5 billion as of december 31, 2016. these trusts hold investments that are subject to the volatility of the stock market and interest rates. we contributed $28.7 million, $121.0 million, and $13.9 million to our pension and opeb plans in 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively. in january 2017, we contributed $100.0 million to the pension plans. future contributions to the plans will be dependent upon many factors, including the performance of existing plan assets and long-term discount rates. for additional information, see note 17, employee benefits.
off-balance sheet arrangements we are a party to various financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk as a part of our normal course of business, including financial guarantees and letters of credit that support construction projects, commodity contracts, and other payment obligations. we believe that these agreements do not have, and are not reasonably likely to have, a current or future material effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures, or capital resources. for additional information, see note 13, short-term debt and lines of credit, note 16, guarantees, and note 21, variable interest entities.
factors affecting results, liquidity, and capital resources market risks and other significant risks we are exposed to market and other significant risks as a result of the nature of our businesses and the environments in which those businesses operate. these risks, described in further detail below, include but are not limited to:
regulatory recovery our utilities account for their regulated operations in accordance with accounting guidance under the regulated operations topic of the fasb asc. our rates are determined by various regulatory commissions. see item 1. business - d. regulation for more information on these commissions.
regulated entities are allowed to defer certain costs that would otherwise be charged to expense if the regulated entity believes the recovery of those costs is probable. we record regulatory assets pursuant to specific orders or by a generic order issued by our regulators. recovery of these deferred costs in future rates is subject to the review and approval by those regulators. we assume the risks and benefits of ultimate recovery of these items in future rates. if the recovery of these deferred costs, including those referenced below, is not approved by our regulators, the costs would be charged to income in the current period. in general, our regulatory assets are recovered over a period of between one to six years. regulators can impose liabilities on a prospective basis for amounts previously collected from customers and for amounts that are expected to be refunded to customers. we record these items as regulatory liabilities. as of december 31, 2016, our regulatory assets were $3,138.3 million, and our regulatory liabilities were $1,597.2 million.
we expect to request or have requested recovery of the costs related to the following projects discussed in recent or pending rate proceedings, orders, and investigations involving our utilities:
•   in june 2016, the pscw approved deferral of costs related to wps's reacttm project above the originally authorized $275.0 million level through 2017. wps will be required to obtain a separate approval for collection of these deferred costs.
•   prior to its acquisition, integrys initiated an information technology project with the goal of improving the customer experience at its subsidiaries. specifically, the project is expected to provide functional and technological benefits to the billing, call center, and credit collection functions. as of december 31, 2016, we had received no significant disallowances of the costs incurred for this project. we will be required to obtain approval for the recovery of additional costs incurred through the completion of this long-term project.
•   in january 2014, the icc approved pgl's use of the qualifying infrastructure plant rider as a recovery mechanism for costs incurred related to investments in qualifying infrastructure plant. this rider is subject to an annual reconciliation whereby costs are reviewed for accuracy and prudency. no schedule has been set for the 2015 reconciliation. the alj has placed the 2014 reconciliation on a stay, pending resolution of the icc ordered stakeholder workshops and the icc investigative docket regarding anonymous letters it received, both related to pgl's smp. although schedules have not been set for the reconciliations, discovery has continued for both the 2014 and 2015 reconciliations. as of december 31, 2016, there can be no assurance that all costs incurred under the qualifying infrastructure plant rider will be recoverable.
see note 22, regulatory environment, for more information regarding recent and pending rate proceedings, orders, and investigations involving our utilities.
commodity costs in the normal course of providing energy, we are subject to market fluctuations in the costs of coal, natural gas, purchased power, and fuel oil used in the delivery of coal. we manage our fuel and natural gas supply costs through a portfolio of short and long-term procurement contracts with various suppliers for the purchase of coal, natural gas, and fuel oil. in addition, we manage the risk of price volatility through natural gas and electric hedging programs.
embedded within our utilities' rates are amounts to recover fuel, natural gas, and purchased power costs. our utilities have recovery mechanisms in place that allow them to recover or refund all or a portion of the changes in prudently incurred fuel, natural gas, and purchased power costs from rate case-approved amounts. see item 1. business - d. regulation for more information on these mechanisms.
higher commodity costs can increase our working capital requirements, result in higher gross receipts taxes, and lead to increased energy efficiency investments by our customers to reduce utility usage and/or fuel substitution. higher commodity costs combined with slower economic conditions also expose us to greater risks of accounts receivable write-offs as more customers are unable to pay their bills. see note 1(d), revenues and customer receivables, for more information on riders and other mechanisms that allow for cost recovery or refund of uncollectible expense.
weather our utilities' rates are based upon estimated normal temperatures. our electric utility margins are unfavorably sensitive to below normal temperatures during the summer cooling season, and to some extent, to above normal temperatures during the winter heating season. our natural gas utility margins are unfavorably sensitive to above normal temperatures during the winter heating season. pgl, nsg, and merc have decoupling mechanisms in place that help reduce the impacts of weather. decoupling mechanisms differ by state and allow utilities to recover or refund certain differences between actual and authorized margins. a summary of actual weather information in our utilities' service territories during 2016, 2015, and 2014, as measured by degree days, may be found in item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations - results of operations.
interest rates we are exposed to interest rate risk resulting from our short-term and long-term borrowings and projected near-term debt financing needs. we manage exposure to interest rate risk by limiting the amount of our variable rate obligations and continually monitoring the effects of market changes on interest rates. when it is advantageous to do so, we enter into long-term fixed rate debt. we may also enter into derivative financial instruments, such as swaps, to mitigate interest rate exposure.
based on the variable rate debt outstanding at december 31, 2016, and december 31, 2015, a hypothetical increase in market interest rates of one percentage point would have increased annual interest expense by $9.8 million and $11.0 million in 2016 and
2015, respectively. this sensitivity analysis was performed assuming a constant level of variable rate debt during the period and an immediate increase in interest rates, with no other changes for the remainder of the period.
marketable securities return we use various trusts to fund our pension and opeb obligations. these trusts invest in debt and equity securities. changes in the market prices of these assets can affect future pension and opeb expenses. additionally, future contributions can also be affected by the investment returns on trust fund assets. we believe that the financial risks associated with investment returns would be partially mitigated through future rate actions by our various utility regulators.
the fair value of our trust fund assets and expected long-term returns were approximately:
(in millions)             as of december 31, 2016          expected return on assets in 2017
pension trust funds            $2,709.2                              7.11                  %
opeb trust funds                 $773.5                              7.25                  %
fiduciary oversight of the pension and opeb trust fund investments is the responsibility of an investment trust policy committee. the committee works with external actuaries and investment consultants on an ongoing basis to establish and monitor investment strategies and target asset allocations. forecasted cash flows for plan liabilities are regularly updated based on annual valuation results. target asset allocations are determined utilizing projected benefit payment cash flows and risk analyses of appropriate investments. the targeted asset allocations are intended to reduce risk, provide long-term financial stability for the plans, and maintain funded levels which meet long-term plan obligations while preserving sufficient liquidity for near-term benefit payments. investment strategies utilize a wide diversification of asset types and qualified external investment managers.
we consult with our investment advisors on an annual basis to help us forecast expected long-term returns on plan assets by reviewing actual historical returns and calculating expected total trust returns using the weighted-average of long-term market returns for each of the major target asset categories utilized in the fund.
economic conditions we have electric and natural gas utility operations that serve customers in wisconsin, illinois, michigan, and minnesota. as such, we are exposed to market risks in the regional midwest economy. in addition, any economic downturn or disruption of national or international markets could adversely affect the financial condition of our customers and demand for their products, which could affect their demand for our products.
inflation we continue to monitor the impact of inflation, especially with respect to the costs of medical plans, fuel, transmission access, construction costs, and regulatory and environmental compliance in order to minimize its effects in future years through pricing strategies, productivity improvements, and cost reductions. we do not believe the impact of general inflation will have a material impact on our future results of operations.

industry restructuring electric utility industry the regulated energy industry continues to experience significant changes. the ferc continues to support large rtos, which affects the structure of the wholesale market. to this end, miso implemented the miso energy markets, including the use of lmp to value electric transmission congestion and losses. increased competition in the retail and wholesale markets, which may result from restructuring efforts, could have a significant and adverse financial impact on us. it is uncertain when retail choice might be implemented, if at all, in wisconsin. however, michigan has adopted a limited retail choice program.
restructuring in wisconsin electric utility revenues in wisconsin are regulated by the pscw. the pscw has been focused on electric reliability infrastructure issues for the state of wisconsin in recent years. the pscw continues to maintain the position that the question of whether to implement electric retail competition in wisconsin should ultimately be decided by the wisconsin legislature. no such legislation has been introduced in wisconsin to date.
restructuring in michigan under michigan law, our retail customers may choose an alternative electric supplier to provide power supply service. some of our small retail customers have switched to an alternative electric supplier. as of december 31, 2016, the law limited customer choice to 10% of our michigan retail load. due to the december 2016 passage of michigan act 341, this cap could potentially be reduced in future years. the iron ore mine in our service territory and certain load increases by facilities already using an alternative electric supplier are excluded from this cap, if various conditions are met. when a customer switches to an alternative electric supplier, we continue to provide distribution and customer service functions for the customer.
natural gas utility industry we offer natural gas transportation services to our customers that elect to purchase natural gas from an alternative retail natural gas supplier. since these transportation customers continue to use our distribution systems to transport the natural gas to their facilities, we earn distribution revenues from them. as such, the loss of revenue associated with the natural gas that transportation customers purchase from an alternative retail natural gas supplier has little impact on our net income, since it is offset by an equal reduction to natural gas costs.
restructuring in wisconsin the pscw previously instituted generic proceedings to consider how its regulation of natural gas distribution utilities should change to reflect a competitive environment in the natural gas industry. to date, the pscw has made a policy decision to provide customer classes with workably competitive market choices the option to choose an alternative retail natural gas supplier. the pscw has also adopted standards for transactions between a utility and its natural gas marketing affiliates. all of our wisconsin customer classes have workably competitive market choices and, therefore, can purchase natural gas directly from either an alternative retail natural gas supplier or their local natural gas utility. currently, we are unable to predict the impact of potential future industry restructuring on our results of operations or financial position.
restructuring in illinois since 2002, pgl and nsg have provided their customers with the option to choose an alternative retail natural gas supplier. we are not required by the icc or state law to make this option available to customers, but since this option is currently provided to our illinois customers, we would need icc approval to eliminate it.
restructuring in minnesota merc has provided its commercial and industrial customers with the option to choose an alternative retail natural gas supplier since 2006. we are not required by the mpuc or state law to make this option available to customers, but since this option is currently provided to our minnesota commercial and industrial customers, we would need mpuc approval to eliminate it.
restructuring in michigan the option to choose an alternative retail natural gas supplier has been provided to wps's michigan customers since the late 1990s and mgu's customers since 2005. we are not required by the mpsc or state law to make this option available to customers, but since this option is currently provided to our michigan customers, we would need mpsc approval to eliminate it.
environmental matters see note 18, commitments and contingencies, for a discussion of certain environmental matters affecting us, including rules and regulations relating to air quality, water quality, land quality, and climate change.
other matters american transmission company allowed return on equity complaints in november 2013, a group of miso industrial customer organizations filed a complaint with the ferc requesting to reduce the base roe used by miso transmission owners, including atc, from 12.2% to 9.15%. in october 2014, the ferc issued an order to hear the complaint on roe and set a refund effective date retroactive to november 2013. in december 2015, the alj issued an initial decision recommending that atc and all other miso transmission owners be authorized to collect a base roe of 10.32%, as well as the 0.5% incentive adder approved by the ferc in january 2015 for miso transmission owners. the incentive adder only applies to revenues collected after january 6, 2015. in september 2016, the ferc issued a final order related to this complaint affirming the use of the roes stated in the alj's initial decision, effective as of the order date, on a going-forward basis. the order also requires atc to provide refunds, with interest, for the 15-month refund period from november 13, 2013, through february 11, 2015. as of december 31, 2016, atc had started to provide refunds to we and wps for transmission costs paid during the refund period, and we expect the refund process to be completed by july 2017. as these refunds are received, we and wps reduce the regulatory assets recorded under the pscw-approved escrow accounting for transmission expense.
in february 2015, a second complaint was filed with the ferc requesting a reduction in the base roe used by miso transmission owners, including atc, to 8.67%, with a refund effective date retroactive to february 12, 2015. in june 2016, the alj issued an initial decision recommending that atc and all other miso transmission owners be authorized to collect a base roe of 9.7%, as well as the 0.5% incentive adder approved for miso transmission owners. the alj's initial decision is not binding on the ferc and applies to revenues collected from february 12, 2015, through may 11, 2016. we are not certain when a ferc order related to this matter will be issued.
miso transmission owners have filed various appeals related to several of the ferc orders with the d.c. circuit court of appeals as well as requests for rehearing.
the decrease in atc's roe resulting from the ferc's final order will have a negative impact on our equity earnings and distributions from atc in the future.
bonus depreciation provisions the protecting americans from tax hikes act of 2015 was signed into law on december 18, 2015. this act extended 50% bonus depreciation to assets placed in service during 2015 through 2017, 40% bonus depreciation to assets placed in service during 2018, and 30% bonus depreciation to assets placed in service during 2019. bonus depreciation is an additional amount of tax deductible depreciation that is awarded above what would normally be available. due to the resulting increase in federal tax depreciation, we did not make federal income tax payments for 2016, 2015, or 2014.
critical accounting policies and estimates preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in compliance with gaap requires the application of appropriate technical accounting rules and guidance as well as the use of estimates. the application of these policies necessarily involves judgments regarding future events, including the likelihood of success of particular projects, legal and regulatory challenges, and anticipated recovery of costs. these judgments, in and of themselves, could materially impact the financial statements and disclosures based on varying assumptions. in addition, the financial and operating environment may also have a significant effect, not only on the operation of our business, but on our results reported through the application of accounting measures used in preparing the financial statements and related disclosures, even if the nature of the accounting policies applied have not changed.
the following is a list of accounting policies that are most significant to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and that require management's most difficult, subjective, or complex judgments.
goodwill impairment we completed our annual goodwill impairment tests for all of our reporting units that carried a goodwill balance as of july 1, 2016. no impairments were recorded as a result of these tests. for all of our reporting units, the fair value calculated in step one of the test was greater than carrying value. the fair value of each reporting unit was calculated using a combination of the income approach and the market approach.
for the income approach, we used internal forecasts to project cash flows. any forecast contains a degree of uncertainty, and changes in these cash flows could significantly increase or decrease the fair value of a reporting unit. since all of our reporting units are regulated, a fair recovery of and return on costs prudently incurred to serve customers is assumed. an unfavorable outcome in a rate case could cause the fair values of our reporting units to decrease.
key assumptions used in the income approach include roes, long-term growth rates used to determine terminal values at the end of the discrete forecast period, and discount rates. the discount rate is applied to estimated future cash flows and is one of the most significant assumptions used to determine fair value under the income approach. as interest rates rise, the calculated fair values will decrease. the discount rate is based on the weighted-average cost of capital for each reporting unit, taking into account both the after-tax cost of debt and cost of equity. the terminal year roe for each utility is driven by its current allowed roe. the terminal growth rate is based primarily on a combination of historical and forecasted statistics for real gross domestic product and personal income for each utility service area.
for the market approach, we used an equal weighting of the guideline public company method and the guideline merged and acquired company method. the guideline public company method uses financial metrics from similar publicly traded companies to determine fair value. the guideline merged and acquired company method calculates fair value by analyzing the actual prices paid for recent mergers and acquisitions in the industry. we applied multiples derived from these two methods to the appropriate operating metrics for our reporting units to determine fair value.
the underlying assumptions and estimates used in the impairment tests were made as of a point in time. subsequent changes in these assumptions and estimates could change the results of the tests.
the fair values of our reporting units exceeded their carrying values by a substantial amount. based on these results, our reporting units are not at risk of failing step one of the goodwill impairment test.

pension and other postretirement employee benefits the costs of providing non-contributory defined pension benefits and opeb, described in note 17, employee benefits, are dependent upon numerous factors resulting from actual plan experience and assumptions of future experience.
pension and opeb costs are impacted by actual employee demographics (including age, compensation levels, and employment periods), the level of contributions made to the plans, and earnings on plan assets. pension and opeb costs may also be significantly affected by changes in key actuarial assumptions, including anticipated rates of return on plan assets, mortality and discount rates, and expected health care cost trends. changes made to the plan provisions may also impact current and future pension and opeb costs.
pension and opeb plan assets are primarily made up of equity and fixed income investments. fluctuations in actual equity and fixed income market returns, as well as changes in general interest rates, may result in increased or decreased benefit costs in future periods. we believe that such changes in costs would be recovered or refunded at our utilities through the ratemaking process.
the following table shows how a given change in certain actuarial assumptions would impact the projected benefit obligation and the reported net periodic pension cost. each factor below reflects an evaluation of the change based on a change in that assumption only.

the discount rates are selected based on hypothetical bond portfolios consisting of noncallable (or callable with make-whole provisions), noncollateralized, high-quality corporate bonds across the full maturity spectrum. the bonds are generally rated "aa" with a minimum amount outstanding of $50.0 million. from the hypothetical bond portfolios, a single rate is determined that equates the market value of the bonds purchased to the discounted value of the plans' expected future benefit payments.
we establish our expected return on assets based on consideration of historical and projected asset class returns, as well as the target allocations of the benefit trust portfolios. the assumed long-term rate of return on pension plan assets was 7.12% in 2016, 7.37% in 2015, and 7.25% in 2014. the actual rate of return on pension plan assets, net of fees, was 7.75%, (3.85)%, and 6.17%, in 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively.
in selecting assumed health care cost trend rates, past performance and forecasts of health care costs are considered. for more information on health care cost trend rates and a table showing future payments that we expect to make for our pension and opeb, see note 17, employee benefits.
regulatory accounting our utility operations follow the guidance under the regulated operations topic of the fasb asc. our financial statements reflect the effects of the ratemaking principles followed by the various jurisdictions regulating us. certain items that would otherwise be immediately recognized as revenues and expenses are deferred as regulatory assets and regulatory liabilities for future recovery or refund to customers, as authorized by our regulators. future recovery of regulatory assets is not assured and is generally subject to review by regulators in rate proceedings for matters such as prudence and reasonableness. once approved, the regulatory assets and liabilities are amortized into earnings over the rate recovery period. if recovery or refund of costs is not approved or is no longer considered probable, these regulatory assets or liabilities are recognized in current period earnings. management regularly assesses whether these regulatory assets and liabilities are probable of future recovery or refund by considering factors such as changes in the regulatory environment, earnings from our electric and natural gas utility operations, and the status of any pending or potential deregulation legislation.
the application of the regulated operations topic of the fasb asc would be discontinued if all or a separable portion of our utility operations no longer met the criteria for application. our regulatory assets and liabilities would be written off as a charge to income as an unusual or infrequently occurring item in the period in which discontinuation occurred. as of december 31, 2016, we had $3,138.3 million in regulatory assets and $1,597.2 million in regulatory liabilities. see note 6, regulatory assets and liabilities, for more information.
unbilled revenues we record utility operating revenues when energy is delivered to our customers. however, the determination of energy sales to individual customers is based upon the reading of their meters, which occurs on a systematic basis throughout the month. at the end of each month, amounts of energy delivered to customers since the date of their last meter reading are estimated and corresponding unbilled revenues are calculated. this unbilled revenue is estimated each month based upon actual generation and throughput volumes, recorded sales, estimated customer usage by class, weather factors, estimated line losses, and applicable customer rates. significant fluctuations in energy demand for the unbilled period or changes in the composition of customer classes could impact the accuracy of the unbilled revenue estimate. total utility operating revenues during 2016 of approximately $7.4 billion included accrued utility revenues of $509.8 million as of december 31, 2016.
income tax expense we are required to estimate income taxes for each of the jurisdictions in which we operate as part of the process of preparing financial statements. this process involves estimating current income tax liabilities together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items, such as depreciation, for income tax and accounting purposes. these differences result in deferred income tax assets and liabilities, which are included within our balance sheets. we also assess the likelihood that our deferred income tax assets will be recovered through future taxable income. to the extent we believe that realization is not likely, we establish a valuation allowance, which is offset by an adjustment to the provision for income taxes in the income statements.
uncertainty associated with the application of tax statutes and regulations and the outcomes of tax audits and appeals requires that judgments and estimates be made in the accrual process and in the calculation of effective tax rates. only income tax benefits that meet the "more likely than not" recognition threshold may be recognized or continue to be recognized. unrecognized tax benefits are re-evaluated quarterly and changes are recorded based on new information, including the issuance of relevant guidance by the courts or tax authorities and developments occurring in the examinations of our tax returns.
significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes, deferred income tax assets and liabilities, the liability for unrecognized tax benefits, and any valuation allowance recorded against deferred income tax assets. the assumptions involved are supported by historical data, reasonable projections, and interpretations of applicable tax laws and regulations across multiple taxing jurisdictions. significant changes in these assumptions could have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations. see note 1(n), income taxes, and note 15, income taxes, for a discussion of accounting for income taxes.

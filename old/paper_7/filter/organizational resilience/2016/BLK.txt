gaap.    operating income of $4,570 million decreased $94 million from 2015. operating income was impacted by lower performance fees, partially offset by expense discipline and growth in aladdin revenue.  operating income also reflected a restructuring charge of $76 million recorded in the first quarter of 2016 in connection with a project to streamline and simplify the organization.  operating margin of 41% increased 10 bps from 2015 driven by continued expense discipline. nonoperating income (expense), less net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests ("nci"), decreased $39 million from 2015 due to lower net gains on investments, partially offset by higher interest and dividend income during 2016.  net gains on investments in 2015 included a $40 million noncash gain related to the blackrock kelso capital advisors llc ("bkca") transaction and a $35 million unrealized gain on a private equity investment.
income tax expense for 2016 included a $30 million net noncash tax benefit associated with the revaluation of certain deferred income tax liabilities, including the effect of tax legislation enacted in the united kingdom, and state and local income tax changes.  income tax expense for 2016 also included nonrecurring tax benefits of $65 million.  income tax expense for 2015 included a $54 million net noncash benefit associated with the revaluation of certain deferred income tax liabilities and nonrecurring tax benefits of $75 million.
diluted earnings per common share decreased $0.75, or 4%, compared with the prior year period, reflecting lower nonoperating income and a higher tax rate in 2016, partially offset by the benefit of share repurchases.
as adjusted.    operating income of $4,674 million decreased $21 million, and operating margin of 43.7% increased 80 bps, from 2015. the pre-tax restructuring charge of $76 million described above was excluded from as adjusted results.  income tax expense for 2016 and 2015 excluded the previously described net noncash benefits of $30 million and $54 million, respectively, and included the nonrecurring tax benefits described above.  diluted earnings per common share decreased $0.31, or 2%, from 2015.
gaap.    operating income of $4,664 million increased $190 million and operating margin of 40.9% increased 50 bps from 2014. operating income reflected growth in base fees and performance fees, partially offset by higher expense. the company's 2015 expense reflected higher revenue-related expense, including compensation, and distribution and servicing costs, partially offset by lower general and administration expense, and lower amortization of intangible assets.  in connection with the barclays global investors ("bgi") acquisition, blackrock recorded a $50 million indemnification asset for unrecognized tax benefits. due to the resolution of outstanding tax matters in 2014, blackrock recorded $50 million of general and administration expense in 2014 to reflect the reduction of the indemnification asset and an offsetting $50 million tax benefit.  results for 2014 also included $11 million of closed-end fund launch costs. nonoperating income (expense), less net income (loss) attributable to nci, decreased $20 million from 2014 due to lower net gains on investments in 2015.
income tax expense for 2015 included a $54 million net noncash benefit described above and nonrecurring tax benefits of $75 million.  income tax expense for 2014 included $94 million of tax benefits, including the $50 million tax benefit mentioned above, a $9 million net noncash benefit, primarily associated with the revaluation of certain deferred income tax liabilities as a result of domestic state and local tax changes, and a $73 million net tax benefit related to several favorable nonrecurring items.
diluted earnings per common share rose $0.54, or 3%, compared with the prior year period, reflecting higher operating income and the benefit of share repurchases, partially offset by the impact of a higher 2015 effective tax rate and lower nonoperating income.
as adjusted.    operating income of $4,695 million increased $132 million from 2014 and the operating margin for both 2015 and 2014 was 42.9%. income tax expense on an as adjusted basis for 2015 included a $75 million net benefit and excluded the net noncash benefit of $54 million described above. general and administration expense for 2014 excluded the $50 million related to the reduction of the indemnification asset described above.  income tax expense for 2014 included a $73 million net benefit and excluded a $50 million tax benefit associated with the reduction of the same indemnification asset and $9 million of net noncash benefits described above.  diluted earnings per common share rose $0.26, or 1%, from 2014.

for further discussion of blackrock's revenue, expense, nonoperating results and income tax expense, see discussion of financial results herein.
non-gaap financial measures blackrock reports its financial results in accordance with gaap; however, management believes evaluating the company's ongoing operating results may be enhanced if investors have additional non-gaap financial measures. management reviews non-gaap financial measures to assess ongoing operations and, for the reasons described below, considers them to be effective indicators, for both management and investors, of blackrock's financial performance over time. management also uses non-gaap financial measures as a benchmark to compare its performance with other companies and to enhance the comparability of this information for the reporting periods presented. non-gaap measures may pose limitations because they do not include all of blackrock's revenue and expense. blackrock's management does not advocate that investors consider such non-gaap financial measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with gaap.
management uses both gaap and non-gaap financial measures in evaluating blackrock's financial performance. adjustments to gaap financial measures ("non-gaap adjustments") include certain items management deems nonrecurring or that occur infrequently, transactions that ultimately will not impact blackrock's book value or certain tax items that do not impact cash flow.
computations for all periods are derived from the consolidated statements of income as follows:
(1) operating income, as adjusted, and operating margin, as adjusted:
management believes operating income, as adjusted, and operating margin, as adjusted, are effective indicators of blackrock's financial performance over time and, therefore, provide useful disclosure to investors.
operating income, gaap basis                                                       $4,570                $4,664                $4,474
non-gaap expense adjustments:
compensation plans reduction of indemnification asset                                                      -                     -                    50
operating income, as adjusted                                                       4,674                 4,695                 4,563
operating income used for operating margin measurement                             $4,674                $4,700                $4,574
non-gaap adjustments:
amortization of deferred sales commissions                                            (34   )               (48   )               (56   )
revenue used for operating margin measurement                                     $10,692               $10,944               $10,661
operating margin, gaap basis                                                         41.0   %              40.9   %              40.4   %
operating margin, as adjusted                                                        43.7   %              42.9   %              42.9   %
•   operating income, as adjusted, includes non-gaap expense adjustments. the portion of compensation expense associated with certain long-term incentive plans ("ltip") funded, or to be funded, through share distributions to participants of blackrock stock held by pnc has been excluded because it ultimately does not impact blackrock's book value. compensation expense associated with appreciation (depreciation) on investments related to certain blackrock deferred compensation plans has been excluded, as returns on investments set aside for these plans, which substantially offset this expense, are reported in nonoperating income (expense). in 2016, a restructuring charge primarily comprised of severance and accelerated amortization expense of previously granted deferred compensation awards has been excluded to provide more meaningful analysis of blackrock's ongoing operations and to ensure comparability among periods presented. in 2014, general and administration expense relating to the reduction of an indemnification asset has been excluded since it is directly offset by a tax benefit of the same amount and, consequently, does not impact blackrock's book value.
•   operating income used for measuring operating margin, as adjusted, is equal to operating income, as adjusted, excluding the impact of product launch costs (e.g. closed-end fund launch costs) and related commissions. management believes the exclusion of such costs and related commissions is useful because these costs can fluctuate considerably and revenue associated with the expenditure of these costs will not fully impact blackrock's results until future periods.
revenue used for operating margin, as adjusted, excludes distribution and servicing costs paid to related parties and other third parties. management believes such costs represent a benchmark for the amount of revenue passed through to external parties who distribute the company's products.  in addition, management believes the exclusion of such costs is useful because it creates consistency in the treatment for certain contracts for similar services, which due to the terms of the contracts, are accounted for under gaap on a net basis within investment advisory, administration fees and securities lending revenue. amortization of deferred sales commissions is excluded from revenue used for operating margin measurement, as adjusted, because such costs, over time, substantially offset distribution fee revenue the company earns. for each of these items, blackrock excludes from revenue used for operating margin, as adjusted, the costs related to each of these items as a proxy for such offsetting revenue.
(2) nonoperating income (expense), less net income (loss) attributable to nci, as adjusted:
nonoperating income (expense), less net income (loss) attributable to nci, as adjusted, equals nonoperating income (expense), gaap basis, less net income (loss) attributable to nci, adjusted for compensation expense associated with (appreciation) depreciation on investments related to certain blackrock deferred compensation plans. the compensation expense offset is recorded in operating income. this compensation expense has been included in nonoperating income (expense), less net income (loss) attributable to nci, as adjusted, to offset returns on investments set aside for these plans, which are reported in nonoperating income (expense), gaap basis.
management believes nonoperating income (expense), less net income (loss) attributable to nci, as adjusted, provides comparability of information among reporting periods and is an effective measure for reviewing blackrock's nonoperating contribution to results.
nonoperating income (expense), gaap basis                                                    $(110       )       $(62       )       $(79       )
nonoperating income (expense), net of nci                                                         (108   )            (69   )            (49   )
compensation plans nonoperating income (expense), less net income (loss) attributable to nci, as adjusted       $(108       )       $(70       )       $(56       )
non-gaap adjustments:
restructuring charge (including $23 tax benefit)                   53                   -                   -
pnc ltip funding obligation, net of tax                            19                  22                  25
management believes net income attributable to blackrock, inc., as adjusted, and diluted earnings per common share, as adjusted, are useful measures of blackrock's profitability and financial performance. net income attributable to blackrock, inc., as adjusted, equals net income attributable to blackrock, inc., gaap basis, adjusted for significant nonrecurring items, charges that ultimately will not impact blackrock's book value or certain tax items that do not impact cash flow.
see aforementioned discussion regarding operating income, as adjusted, and operating margin, as adjusted, for information on the pnc ltip funding obligation and the restructuring charge.
for each period presented, the non-gaap adjustment related to the restructuring charge and pnc ltip funding obligation was tax effected at the respective blended rates applicable to the adjustments. amounts for income tax matters represent net noncash (benefits) expense primarily associated with the revaluation of certain deferred tax liabilities related to intangible assets and goodwill.  amounts have been excluded from the as adjusted results as these items will not have a cash flow impact and to ensure comparability among periods presented.
(4) nonvoting participating preferred stock is considered to be a common stock equivalent for purposes of determining basic and diluted earnings per share calculations.
assets under management aum for reporting purposes generally is based upon how investment advisory and administration fees are calculated for each portfolio. net asset values, total assets, committed assets or other measures may be used to determine portfolio aum.

aum increased $502.4 billion to $5.1 trillion at december 31, 2016 from $4.6 trillion at december 31, 2015 driven by net market appreciation, positive net inflows and aum acquired in the bofa global capital management transaction, partially offset by the impact of foreign exchange movements.
net market appreciation of $326.4 billion was driven by $219.0 billion from equity products, $82.8 billion from fixed income products and $22.5 billion from multi-asset products across the majority of strategies.
aum decreased $106.8 billion due to the impact of foreign exchange movements, primarily resulting from the strengthening of the u.s. dollar, largely against the british pound and the euro.

aum decreased $6.5 billion to $4.645 trillion at december 31, 2015 from $4.652 trillion at december 31, 2014 driven largely by foreign exchange movements and net market depreciation that more than offset organic growth.
net market depreciation of $57.5 billion was driven by $35.3 billion from equity products due to lower u.s. and global equity markets and $12.1 billion from fixed income products.
aum decreased $101.1 billion due to the impact of foreign exchange movements, primarily resulting from the strengthening of the u.s. dollar against the euro, the british pound and the canadian dollar.
discussion of financial results introduction blackrock derives a substantial portion of its revenue from investment advisory and administration fees, which are recognized as the services are performed. such fees are primarily based on predetermined percentages of the market value of aum or percentages of committed capital during investment periods of certain alternative products and are affected by changes in aum, including market appreciation or depreciation, foreign exchange translation and net inflows or outflows. net inflows or outflows represent the sum of new client assets, additional fundings
from existing clients (including dividend reinvestment), withdrawals of assets from, and termination of, client accounts and distributions to investors representing return of capital and return on investments to investors. market appreciation or depreciation includes current income earned on, and changes in the fair value of, securities held in client accounts. foreign exchange translation reflects the impact of translating non-u.s. dollar denominated aum into u.s. dollars for reporting purposes.
blackrock also earns revenue by lending securities on behalf of clients to highly rated banks and broker-dealers. the securities loaned are secured by collateral in the form of cash or securities, with minimum collateral generally ranging from approximately 102% to 112% of the value of the loaned securities. generally, the revenue earned is shared between blackrock and the funds or accounts managed by the company from which the securities are borrowed. historically, securities lending revenue in the second quarter exceeds revenue in the other quarters during the year driven by higher seasonal demand.
investment advisory agreements for certain separate accounts and investment funds provide for performance fees based upon relative and/or absolute investment performance, in addition to base fees based on aum. investment advisory performance fees generally are earned after a given period of time and when investment performance exceeds a contractual threshold. as such, the timing of recognition of performance fees may increase the volatility of blackrock's revenue and earnings. the magnitude of performance fees can fluctuate quarterly due to the timing of carried interest recognition on alternative products; however, the third and fourth quarters have a greater number of nonalternative products with performance measurement periods that end on either september 30 or december 31.
blackrock provides a variety of risk management, investment analytic and investment system and advisory services to financial institutions, pension funds, asset managers, foundations, consultants, mutual fund sponsors, real estate investment trusts, government agencies and retail intermediaries. these services are provided under the brand name blackrock solutions and include a wide array of risk management services, valuation services related to illiquid securities, disposition and workout assignments (including long-term portfolio liquidation assignments), strategic planning and execution, enterprise investment system outsourcing and wealth management technology services to clients. the company's aladdin operating platform serves as the investment/risk solutions system for blackrock and other institutional investors. fees earned for blackrock solutions and advisory services are determined using some, or all, of the following methods: (i) percentages of various attributes of advisory aum or value of positions on the aladdin platform, (ii) fixed-rate fees and (iii) fees billed on a time and materials basis.
blackrock builds upon its leadership position to meet the growing need for investment and risk management solutions. through its scale and diversity of products, it is able to provide its clients with customized solutions including fiduciary outsourcing for liability-driven investments and overlay strategies for pension plan sponsors, balance sheet management and related services for insurance companies and target date and target return funds, as well as asset allocation portfolios, for retail investors. blackrock is also able to service these clients via its aladdin platform to provide risk management and other outsourcing services for institutional investors and custom and tailored solutions to address complex risk exposures.
the company earns fees for transition management services primarily comprised of commissions from acting as a broker-dealer in connection with buying and selling securities on behalf of its customers. commissions related to transition management services are recorded on a trade-date basis as securities transactions occur.
the company also earns revenue related to certain strategic investments accounted for as equity method investments.
operating expense reflects employee compensation and benefits, distribution and servicing costs, amortization of deferred sales commissions, direct fund expense, general and administration expense and amortization of finite-lived intangible assets.
•   employee compensation and benefits expense includes salaries, commissions, temporary help, deferred and incentive compensation, employer payroll taxes, severance and related benefit costs.
•   direct fund expense primarily consists of third-party nonadvisory expense incurred by blackrock related to certain funds for the use of index trademarks, reference data for indices, custodial services, fund administration, fund accounting, transfer agent services, shareholder reporting services, legal expense, and audit and tax services as well as other fund-related expense directly attributable to the nonadvisory operations of the fund. these expenses may vary over time with fluctuations in aum, number of shareholder accounts, or other attributes directly related to volume of business.
general and administration expense includes marketing and promotional, occupancy and office-related costs, portfolio services (including clearing expense related to transition management services), technology, professional services, communications, product launch costs and other general and administration expense, including the impact of foreign currency remeasurement. foreign currency remeasurement (gains) losses were $(6) million, $(8) million and $(11) million for 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.
approximately 75% of the company's revenue is generated in u.s. dollars. the company's revenue and expense generated in foreign currencies (primarily the euro and british pound) are impacted by foreign exchange rates. any effect of foreign exchange rate change on revenue is partially offset by a change in expense driven by the company's considerable non-dollar expense base related to its operations outside the united states.
nonoperating income (expense) includes the effect of changes in the valuations on investments (excluding available-for-sale investments) and earnings on equity method investments as well as interest and dividend income and interest expense. other comprehensive income includes changes in valuations related to available-for-sale investments. blackrock primarily holds seed and co-investments in sponsored investment products that invest in a variety of asset classes, including private equity, hedge funds and real assets. investments generally are made for co-investment purposes, to establish a performance track record or for regulatory purposes, including federal reserve bank stock. blackrock does not engage in proprietary trading activities that could conflict with the interests of its clients.
in addition, nonoperating income (expense) includes the impact of changes in the valuations of consolidated sponsored investment funds. the portion of nonoperating income (expense) not attributable to blackrock is allocated to nci on the consolidated statements of income.

(1)   average aum is calculated as the average of the month-end spot aum amounts for the trailing thirteen months.
revenue decreased $246 million, or 2%, from 2015, driven by lower performance fees, partially offset by higher blackrock solutions and advisory revenue.
investment advisory, administration fees and securities lending revenue of $9,880 million for 2016 increased $40 million from $9,840 million in 2015 reflecting the impact of organic growth and higher markets on average aum, the effect of aum acquired in the bofa global capital management transaction and lower yield-related fee waivers on certain money market funds, partially offset by the impact of divergent beta and mix shift, and the impact of foreign exchange movements.  securities lending revenue increased $66 million from 2015 to $579 million in 2016, primarily reflecting an increase in average balances of securities on loan and higher spreads.
investment advisory performance fees were $295 million in 2016 compared with $621 million in 2015. the decrease was primarily driven by lower fees from equity and alternative products, including the impact of the strong performance from a single hedge fund with an annual performance measurement period that ended in the third quarter of 2015.
revenue increased $320 million, or 3%, from 2014, driven by higher base fees and growth in performance fees.
investment advisory, administration fees and securities lending revenue of $9,840 million for 2015 increased $251 million from $9,589 million in 2014 primarily driven by organic growth, despite the impact of foreign exchange and market volatility. securities lending revenue increased $36 million from 2014 to $513 million in 2015, reflecting an increase in average balances of securities on loan.
investment advisory performance fees were $621 million in 2015 compared with $550 million in 2014. the increase from 2014 reflected higher fees from equity products and strong performance from a single hedge fund. investment advisory performance fees in 2014 reflected a large fee associated with the liquidation of a closed-end mortgage fund.

(1)   see non-gaap financial measures for further information on non-gaap expense adjustments.
gaap. expense decreased $152 million, or 2%, from 2015, reflecting lower compensation and benefits expense, expense discipline and lower amortization of intangible assets, partially offset by a restructuring charge recorded in 2016.
employee compensation and benefits expense decreased $125 million, or 3%, to $3,880 million in 2016 from $4,005 million in 2015, reflecting lower incentive compensation, primarily driven by lower performance fees.
general and administration expense decreased $79 million from 2015, reflecting expense discipline and the impact of higher transaction-related expense recorded in 2015.
restructuring charge of $76 million, primarily comprised of severance and accelerated amortization expense of previously granted deferred compensation awards, was recorded in 2016 in connection with a project to streamline and simplify the organization.
amortization of intangible assets expense decreased $29 million, or 23%, to $99 million in 2016 from $128 million in 2015, primarily reflecting certain finite-lived intangible assets becoming fully amortized.
as adjusted. expense, as adjusted, decreased $225 million, or 3%, to $6,481 million in 2016 from $6,706 million in 2015. the decrease in total expense, as adjusted, is primarily attributable to lower employee compensation and benefits expense, expense discipline and lower amortization of intangible assets.  the restructuring charge has been excluded from the as adjusted results.
gaap. expense increased $130 million, or 2%, from 2014, primarily reflecting higher revenue-related expense, including compensation and benefits expense, and distribution and servicing costs, partially offset by lower general and administration expense and amortization of intangible assets. expense for 2014 included an expense related to a $50 million reduction of an indemnification asset.
employee compensation and benefits expense increased $176 million, or 5%, to $4,005 million in 2015 from $3,829 million in 2014, reflecting higher headcount, and higher incentive and deferred compensation, partially offset by the impact of foreign exchange movements. employees at december 31, 2015 totaled approximately 13,000 compared with approximately 12,200 at december 31, 2014.

the company's tax rate is affected by tax rates in foreign jurisdictions and the relative amount of income earned in those jurisdictions, which the company expects to be fairly consistent in the near term. the significant foreign jurisdictions that have lower statutory tax rates than the u.s. federal statutory rate of 35% include the united kingdom, channel islands, ireland and canada. u.s. income taxes were not provided for certain undistributed foreign earnings intended to be indefinitely reinvested outside the united states.
o   a net noncash benefit of $30 million, primarily associated with the revaluation of certain deferred income tax liabilities; and
o   a benefit from $65 million of nonrecurring items, including the resolution of certain outstanding tax matters.
the as adjusted effective tax rate of 29.6% for 2016 excluded the net noncash benefit of $30 million mentioned above, as it will not have a cash flow impact and to ensure comparability among periods presented.
o   a net noncash benefit of $54 million, primarily associated with the revaluation of certain deferred income tax liabilities; and
o   a benefit from $75 million of nonrecurring items, primarily due to the realization of losses from changes in the company's organizational tax structure and the resolution of certain outstanding tax matters.
the as adjusted effective tax rate of 28.4% for 2015 excluded the net noncash benefit of $54 million mentioned above, as it will not have a cash flow impact and to ensure comparability among periods presented.
o   a $94 million tax benefit, primarily due to the resolution of certain outstanding tax matters related to the acquisition of bgi, including the previously mentioned $50 million tax benefit (see executive summary for more information);
o   a $73 million net tax benefit related to several favorable nonrecurring items; and
o   a net noncash benefit of $9 million associated with the revaluation of deferred income tax liabilities.
the as adjusted effective tax rate of 26.6% for 2014 excluded the $9 million net noncash benefit as it will not have a cash flow impact and to ensure comparability among periods presented and the $50 million tax benefit mentioned above. the $50 million general and administrative expense and $50 million tax benefit have been excluded from as adjusted results as there is no impact on blackrock's book value.
balance sheet overview as adjusted balance sheet the following table presents a reconciliation of the consolidated statement of financial condition presented on a gaap basis to the consolidated statement of financial condition, excluding the impact of separate account assets and separate account collateral held under securities lending agreements (directly related to lending separate account securities) and separate account liabilities and separate account collateral liabilities under securities lending agreements and consolidated sponsored investment funds, including consolidated vies.
the company presents the as adjusted balance sheet as additional information to enable investors to exclude certain assets that have equal and offsetting liabilities or noncontrolling interests that ultimately do not have an impact on stockholders' equity or cash flows. management views the as adjusted balance sheet, a non-gaap financial measure, as an economic presentation of the company's total assets and liabilities; however, it does not advocate that investors consider such non-gaap financial measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with gaap.
separate account assets and liabilities and separate account collateral held under securities lending agreements separate account assets are maintained by blackrock life limited, a wholly owned subsidiary of the company that is a registered life insurance company in the united kingdom, and represent segregated assets held for purposes of funding individual and group pension contracts. the company records equal and offsetting separate account liabilities. the separate account assets are not available to creditors of the company and the holders of the pension contracts have no recourse to the company's assets. the net investment income attributable to separate account assets accrues directly to the contract owners and is not reported on the company's consolidated statements of income. while blackrock has no economic interest in these assets or liabilities, blackrock earns an investment advisory fee for the service of managing these assets on behalf of its clients.
in addition, the company records on its consolidated statements of financial condition the separate account collateral received under blackrock life limited securities lending arrangements as its own asset in addition to an equal and offsetting separate account collateral liability for the obligation to return the collateral. the collateral is not available to creditors of the company, and the borrowers under the securities lending arrangements have no recourse to the company's assets.
consolidated sponsored investment funds the company consolidates certain sponsored investment funds accounted for as voting rights entities ("vres") and vies, (collectively, "consolidated sponsored investment funds"). see note 2, significant accounting policies, in the notes to the consolidated financial statements contained in part ii, item 8 of this filing for more information on the company's consolidation policy.
the company cannot readily access cash and cash equivalents or other assets held by consolidated sponsored investment funds to use in its operating activities. in addition, the company cannot readily sell investments held by consolidated sponsored investment funds in order to obtain cash for use in the company's operations.

the following discussion summarizes the significant changes in assets and liabilities on a gaap basis. please see the consolidated statements of financial condition as of december 31, 2016 and 2015 contained in part ii, item 8 of this filing. the discussion does not include changes related to assets and liabilities that are equal and offsetting and have no impact on blackrock's stockholders' equity.
assets. cash and cash equivalents at december 31, 2016 and 2015 included $53 million and $100 million, respectively, of cash held by consolidated vres (see liquidity and capital resources for details on the change in cash and cash equivalents during 2016).
accounts receivable at december 31, 2016 increased $113 million from december 31, 2015 primarily due to higher alternative products and blackrock solutions receivables and an increase in unit trust receivables (substantially offset by an increase in unit trust payables recorded within accounts payable and accrued liabilities), partially offset by lower securities lending receivables. investments were $1,595 million at december 31, 2016 (for more information see investments herein). goodwill and intangible assets decreased $14 million from december 31, 2015, primarily due to $99 million of amortization of intangible assets, partially offset by intangible assets and goodwill acquired from the bofa global capital management transaction. other assets (including property and equipment) increased $188 million from december 31, 2015, primarily related to an increase in earnings from certain strategic investments and current taxes receivable.
liabilities. accrued compensation and benefits at december 31, 2016 decreased $91 million from december 31, 2015, primarily due to lower 2016 incentive compensation accruals. accounts payable and accrued liabilities at december 31, 2016 increased $26 million from december 31, 2015 due to higher unit trust payables (substantially offset by an increase in unit trust receivables recorded within accounts receivable).
net deferred income tax liabilities at december 31, 2016 decreased $11 million, primarily as a result of revaluation of certain deferred income tax liabilities due to the tax legislation enacted in the united kingdom and the effects of temporary differences associated with stock compensation, and unrealized investment losses.
investments and investments of consolidated vies the company's investments and investments of consolidated vies (collectively, "total investments") were $1,595 million and $1,008 million, respectively, at december 31, 2016. total investments include consolidated investments held by sponsored investment funds accounted for as vres and vies. management reviews blackrock's total investments on an "economic" basis, which eliminates the portion of total investments that does not impact blackrock's book value or net income attributable to blackrock. blackrock's management does not advocate that investors consider such non-gaap financial measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with gaap.
the company presents total investments, as adjusted, to enable investors to understand the portion of total investments that is owned by the company, net of nci, as a gauge to measure the impact of changes in net nonoperating income (expense) on investments to net income (loss) attributable to blackrock.
the company further presents net "economic" investment exposure, net of deferred compensation investments and hedged investments, to reflect another gauge for investors.  the economic impact of total investments held pursuant to deferred compensation arrangements is offset by a change in compensation expense. the impact of certain investments is substantially mitigated by swap hedges. carried interest capital allocations are excluded as there is no impact to blackrock's stockholders' equity until such amounts are realized as performance fees. finally, the company's regulatory investment in federal reserve bank stock, which is not subject to market or interest rate risk, is excluded from the company's net economic investment exposure.
total "economic" investment exposure                   $1,519                $1,548
(1)   amount includes $108 million and $81 million of carried interest (vies) as of december 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, which has no impact on the company's "economic" investment exposure.
the following table represents the carrying value of the company's economic investment exposure, by asset type, at december 31, 2016 and 2015:
total "economic" investment exposure            $1,519            $1,548
(1)   other alternatives include distressed credit/mortgage funds/opportunistic funds and hedge funds/funds of hedge funds.
(2)   other investments primarily include seed investments in fixed income, equity and multi-asset mutual funds/strategies as well as u.k. government securities, primarily held for regulatory purposes.
purchases/capital contributions                                                   1,234

carried interest capital allocations/distributions received                          26
(1)   amount includes distributions representing return of capital and return on investments.
liquidity and capital resources blackrock cash flows excluding the impact of consolidated sponsored investment funds the consolidated statements of cash flows include the cash flows of the consolidated sponsored investment funds. the company uses an adjusted cash flow statement, which excludes the impact of consolidated sponsored investment funds, as a supplemental non-gaap measure to assess liquidity and capital requirements. the company believes that its cash flows, excluding the impact of the consolidated sponsored investment funds, provide investors with useful information on the cash flows of blackrock relating to its ability to fund additional operating, investing and financing activities. blackrock's management does not advocate that investors consider such non-gaap measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, its cash flows presented in accordance with gaap.
the following table presents a reconciliation of the consolidated statements of cash flows presented on a gaap basis to the consolidated statements of cash flows, excluding the impact of the cash flows of consolidated sponsored investment funds:

the company manages its financial condition and funding to maintain appropriate liquidity for the business. liquidity resources at december 31, 2016 and 2015 were as follows:
total liquidity resources(3)                                     $10,038                $9,983

net capital requirements. the company is required to maintain net capital in certain regulated subsidiaries within a number of jurisdictions, which is partially maintained by retaining cash and cash equivalent investments in those subsidiaries or jurisdictions. as a result, such subsidiaries of the company may be restricted in their ability to transfer cash between different jurisdictions and to their parents. additionally, transfers of cash between international jurisdictions, including repatriation to the united states, may have adverse tax consequences that could discourage such transfers.

contingent payments related to business acquisitions. in connection with certain acquisitions, blackrock is required to make contingent payments, subject to achieving specified performance targets, which may include revenue related to acquired contracts or new capital commitments for certain products.  the fair value of the remaining aggregate contingent payments at december 31, 2016 totaled $115 million and is included in other liabilities on the consolidated statement of financial condition.
carried interest clawback. as a general partner in certain investment funds, including private equity partnerships and certain hedge funds, the company may receive carried interest cash distributions from the partnerships in accordance with distribution provisions of the partnership agreements. the company may, from time to time, be required to return all or a portion of such distributions to the limited partners in the event the limited partners do not achieve a return as specified in the various partnership agreements. therefore, blackrock records carried interest
subject to such clawback provisions in total investments, or cash/cash of consolidated vies to the extent that it is distributed, and as a deferred carried interest liability/other liabilities of consolidated vies on its consolidated statements of financial condition. carried interest is recorded as performance fees on blackrock's consolidated statements of income upon the earlier of the termination of the investment fund or when the likelihood of clawback is considered mathematically improbable.
indemnifications. in the ordinary course of business or in connection with certain acquisition agreements, blackrock enters into contracts pursuant to which it may agree to indemnify third parties in certain circumstances. the terms of these indemnities vary from contract to contract and the amount of indemnification liability, if any, cannot be determined or the likelihood of any liability is considered remote and, therefore, has not been included in the table above or recorded in the consolidated statement of financial condition at december 31, 2016. see further discussion in note 13, commitments and contingencies, in the notes to the consolidated financial statements contained in part ii, item 8 of this filing.
on behalf of certain clients, the company lends securities to highly rated banks and broker-dealers. in these securities lending transactions, the borrower is required to provide and maintain collateral at or above regulatory minimums. securities on loan are marked to market daily to determine if the borrower is required to pledge additional collateral. blackrock has issued certain indemnifications to certain securities lending clients against potential loss resulting from a borrower's failure to fulfill its obligations under the securities lending agreement should the value of the collateral pledged by the borrower at the time of default be insufficient to cover the borrower's obligation under the securities lending agreement. at december 31, 2016, the company indemnified certain of its clients for their securities lending loan balances of approximately $169.3 billion. the company held, as agent, cash and securities totaling $180.1 billion as collateral for indemnified securities on loan at december 31, 2016. the fair value of these indemnifications was not material at december 31, 2016.
while the collateral pledged by a borrower is intended to be sufficient to offset the borrower's obligations to return securities borrowed and any other amounts owing to the lender under the relevant securities lending agreement, in the event of a borrower default, the company can give no assurance that the collateral pledged by the borrower will be sufficient to fulfill such obligations. if the amount of such pledged collateral is not sufficient to fulfill such obligations to a client for whom the company has provided indemnification, blackrock would be responsible for the amount of the shortfall. these indemnifications cover only the collateral shortfall described above, and do not in any way guarantee, assume or otherwise insure the investment performance or return of any cash collateral vehicle into which securities lending cash collateral is invested.
compensation and benefit obligations. the company has various compensation and benefit obligations, including bonuses, commissions and incentive payments payable, defined contribution plan matching contribution obligations, and deferred compensation arrangements, that are excluded from the contractual obligations and commitments table above. accrued compensation and benefits at december 31, 2016 totaled $1,880 million and included incentive compensation of $1,325 million, deferred compensation of $304 million and other compensation and benefits related obligations of $251 million. substantially all of the incentive compensation liability was paid in the first quarter of 2017, while the deferred compensation obligations are generally payable over periods of up to three years.
critical accounting policies the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expense during the reporting periods. actual results could differ significantly from those estimates. management considers the following critical accounting policies important to understanding the consolidated financial statements. for a summary of these and additional accounting policies see note 2, significant accounting policies, in the consolidated financial statements contained in part ii, item 8 of this filing.
consolidation in the normal course of business, the company is the manager of various types of sponsored investment vehicles. the company performs an analysis for investment products to determine if the product is a vie or a vre. assessing whether an entity is a vie or a vre involves judgment and analysis. factors considered in this assessment include the entity's legal organization, the entity's capital structure and equity ownership, and any related party or de facto agent implications of the company's involvement with the entity. investments that are determined to be vres are consolidated if the company can exert control over the financial and operating policies of the investee, which generally exists if there is greater than 50% voting interest. see note 4, consolidated voting rights entities, in the notes to the consolidated financial statements contained in part ii, item 8 of this filing for more information. investments that are determined to be vies are consolidated if the company is the primary beneficiary ("pb") of the entity.
at december 31, 2016, blackrock was determined to be the pb for certain investment funds that were determined to be vies, which required blackrock to consolidate them. blackrock was deemed to be the pb because it has the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the entities' economic performance and has the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits that potentially could be significant to the vie.  the company generally consolidates vies in which it holds an equity ownership interest of 10% or greater and deconsolidates such vies once equity ownership falls below 10%.  see note 5, variable interest entities, in the notes to the consolidated financial statements contained in part ii, item 8 of this filing for more information.
investments equity method investments. for equity investments where blackrock does not control the investee, and where it is not the pb of a vie, but can exert significant influence over the financial and operating policies of the investee, the company follows the equity method of accounting. the evaluation of whether the company exerts control or significant influence over the financial and operational policies of its investees requires significant judgment based on the facts and circumstances surrounding each individual investment. factors considered in these evaluations may include the type of investment, the legal structure of the investee, the terms and structure of the investment agreement, including investor voting or other rights, the terms of blackrock's advisory agreement or other agreements with the investee, any influence blackrock may have on the governing board of the investee, the legal rights of other investors in the entity pursuant to the fund's operating documents and the relationship between blackrock and other investors in the entity.
blackrock's equity method investees that are investment companies record their underlying investments at fair value. therefore, under the equity method of accounting, blackrock's share of the investee's underlying net income predominantly represents fair value adjustments in the investments held by the equity method investees. blackrock's share of the investee's underlying net income or loss is based upon the most currently available information and is recorded as nonoperating income (expense) for investments in investment companies, or as other revenue for certain strategic investments, which are recorded in other assets, since such investees are considered to be an extension of blackrock's core business.
at december 31, 2016, the company had $730 million and $348 million of equity method investments, including equity method investments held for deferred compensation, reflected within investments and other assets, respectively, and at december 31, 2015, the company had $527 million and $265 million of equity method investees reflected in investments and other assets, respectively.
impairments of investments. management periodically assesses equity method, available-for-sale, held-to-maturity and cost investments for other-than-temporary impairment ("otti"). if an otti exists, an impairment charge is recorded in nonoperating income (expense) on the consolidated statements of the income.
for equity method, held-to-maturity and cost method investments, if circumstances indicate that an otti may exist, the investments are evaluated using market values, where available, or the expected future cash flows of the investment. if the company determines an otti exists, an impairment charge is recognized for the excess of the carrying amount of the investment over its estimated fair value.
for available-for-sale securities, when the fair value is lower than cost, the company considers, among other factors, the length of time the security has been in a loss position, the extent to which the security's fair value is less than cost, the financial condition and near-term prospects of the security's issuer and the company's ability and intent to hold the security for a length of time sufficient to allow for recovery of such unrealized losses. for equity securities, if the impairment is considered other-than-temporary, an impairment charge is recognized for the excess of the carrying amount of the investment over its fair value. for debt securities, the company considers whether: (1) it has the intent to sell the security; (2) it is more likely than not that it will be required to sell the security before recovery; or (3) it expects to recover the entire amortized cost basis of the security. if the company intends to sell the security or it is more likely than not that it will be required to sell the security, the entire difference between the amortized cost and fair value must be recognized in earnings.  if the company does not intend to sell a security and it is not more likely than not that it will be required to sell the security but the security has suffered an impairment related to credit, the credit loss will be bifurcated from the total decline in value and recorded in earnings with the remaining portion recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income.
for the company's investments in clos, the company reviews cash flow estimates over the life of each clo investment. on a quarterly basis, if the present value of the estimated future cash flows is lower than the carrying value of the investment and there is an adverse change in estimated cash flows, an impairment is considered to be other-than-temporary. an impairment charge is recognized for the excess of the carrying amount of the investment over its estimated fair value.
evaluation of impairments involves significant assumptions and management judgments, which could differ from actual results, and these differences could have a material impact on the consolidated statements of income.
fair value measurements the company's assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement according to the fair value hierarchy (i.e., level 1, 2 and 3 inputs, as defined) in its entirety requires judgment and considers factors specific to the financial instrument. see note 2, significant accounting policies, in the consolidated financial statements contained in part ii, item 8 of this filing for more information on fair value measurements.
changes in valuation. changes in value on $2,255 million of total investments will impact the company's nonoperating income (expense), $80 million will impact accumulated other comprehensive income, $142 million are held at cost or amortized cost and the remaining $126 million relates to carried interest, which will not impact nonoperating income (expense). at december 31, 2016, changes in fair value of approximately $1,365 million of such consolidated vies/vres will impact blackrock's net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests on the consolidated statements of income. blackrock's net exposure to changes in fair value of such consolidated sponsored investment funds was $1,176 million.
goodwill and intangible assets the value of advisory contracts acquired in business acquisitions to manage aum in proprietary open-end investment funds as well as collective trust funds without a specified termination date are classified as indefinite-lived intangible assets. the assignment of indefinite lives to such investment fund contracts is based upon the assumption there is no foreseeable limit on the contract period to manage these funds due to the likelihood of continued renewal at little or no cost. in addition, trade names/trademarks are considered indefinite-lived intangibles as they are expected to generate cash flows indefinitely. goodwill represents the cost of a business acquisition in excess of the fair value of the net assets acquired. in accordance with current accounting guidance, indefinite-lived intangible assets and goodwill are not amortized. finite-lived management contracts, which relate to acquired separate accounts and funds with a specified termination date, are amortized over their remaining expected useful lives, which, at december 31, 2016, ranged from 1 to 9 years with a weighted-average remaining estimated useful life of 3.8 years.
goodwill. the company assesses its goodwill for impairment at least annually, considering such factors as the book value and the market capitalization of the company. the impairment assessment performed as of july 31, 2016 indicated no impairment charge was required. the company continues to monitor its book value per share compared with closing prices of its common stock for potential indicators of impairment. at december 31, 2016, the company's common stock closed at $380.54, which exceeded its book value of approximately $178.38 per share.
indefinite-lived and finite-lived intangibles. the company performs assessments to determine if any intangible assets are impaired and whether the indefinite-life and finite-life classifications are still appropriate.
in evaluating whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of indefinite-lived intangibles is less than carrying value, blackrock performed certain quantitative assessments and assessed various significant qualitative factors including aum, revenue basis points, projected aum growth rates, operating margins, tax rates and discount rates. in addition, the company considered other factors including: (i) macroeconomic conditions such as a deterioration in general economic conditions, limitations on accessing capital, fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, or other developments in equity and credit markets; (ii) industry and market considerations such as a deterioration in the environment in which an entity operates, an increased competitive environment, a decline in market-dependent multiples or metrics, a change in the market for an entity's services, or regulatory, legal or political developments; and (iii) entity-specific events, such as a change in management or key personnel, overall financial performance and litigation that could affect significant inputs used to determine the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset. if an indefinite-lived intangible is determined to be more likely than not impaired, then the fair value of the asset is compared with its carrying value and any excess of the carrying value over the fair value would be recognized as an expense in the period in which the impairment occurs.
for finite-lived intangible assets, if potential impairment circumstances are considered to exist, the company will perform a recoverability test, using an undiscounted cash flow analysis. actual results could differ from these cash flow estimates, which could materially impact the impairment conclusion. if the carrying value of the asset is determined not to be recoverable based on the undiscounted cash flow test, the difference between the book value of the asset and its current fair value would be recognized as an expense in the period in which the impairment occurs.
in addition, management judgment is required to estimate the period over which finite-lived intangible assets will contribute to the company's cash flows and the pattern in which these assets will be consumed. a change in the remaining useful life of any of these assets, or the reclassification of an indefinite-lived intangible asset to a finite-lived intangible asset, could have a significant impact on the company's amortization expense, which was $99 million, $128 million and $157 million for 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.
in 2016, 2015 and 2014, the company performed impairment tests, including evaluating various qualitative factors and performing certain quantitative assessments. the company determined that no impairment charges were required, the classification of indefinite-lived versus finite-lived intangibles was still appropriate and no changes to the expected lives of the finite-lived intangibles were required. the company continuously monitors various factors, including aum, for potential indicators of impairment.
income taxes deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognized for future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases using currently enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. the effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.
significant management judgment is required in estimating the ranges of possible outcomes and determining the probability of favorable or unfavorable tax outcomes and potential interest and penalties related to such unfavorable outcomes. actual future tax consequences relating to uncertain tax positions may be materially different than the company's current estimates. at december 31, 2016, blackrock had $410 million of gross unrecognized tax benefits, of which $284 million, if recognized, would affect the effective tax rate.
management is required to estimate the timing of the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities, make assumptions about the future deductibility of deferred income tax assets and assess deferred income tax liabilities based on enacted tax rates for the appropriate tax jurisdictions to determine the amount of such deferred income tax assets and liabilities. at december 31, 2016, the company had deferred tax assets of $20 million and net deferred tax liabilities of approximately $4,840 million on the consolidated statement of financial condition. changes in deferred tax assets and liabilities may occur in certain circumstances, including statutory income tax rate changes, statutory tax law changes, changes in the anticipated timing of recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities or changes in the structure or tax status of the company.
the company assesses whether a valuation allowance should be established against its deferred income tax assets based on consideration of all available evidence, both positive and negative, using a more likely than not standard. the assessment considers, among other matters, the nature, frequency and severity of recent losses, forecast of future profitability, the duration of statutory carry back and carry forward periods, the company's experience with tax attributes expiring unused, and tax planning alternatives.
the company records income taxes based upon its estimated income tax liability or benefit. the company's actual tax liability or benefit may differ from the estimated income tax liability or benefit. the company had current income taxes receivables of approximately $247 million and current income taxes payables of $75 million at december 31, 2016.
revenue recognition investment advisory and administration fees are recognized as the services are performed. such fees are primarily based on pre-determined percentages of the market value of aum or, in the case of certain real asset clients, net operating income generated by the underlying properties. investment advisory and administration fees are affected by changes in aum, including market appreciation or depreciation, foreign exchange translation and net inflows or outflows. investment advisory and administration fees for investment funds are shown net of fees waived pursuant to contractual expense limitations of the funds or voluntary waivers.
the company contracts with third parties and related parties for various fund distribution and shareholder servicing to be performed on behalf of certain funds the company manages. such arrangements generally are priced as a portion of the management fee paid by the fund. in certain cases, the fund takes on the primary responsibility for payment for services such that the company bears no credit risk to the third-party. the company records its management fees net of retrocessions. retrocessions for 2016, 2015 and 2014 were $804 million, $870 million and $891 million, respectively. the company has additional contracts for similar services with third parties, which due to the terms of the contracts, are recorded as distribution and servicing costs and thus not netted on the consolidated statements of income.
the company earns revenue by lending securities on behalf of clients to highly rated banks and broker-dealers. revenue is accounted for on an accrual basis. the securities loaned are secured by collateral, generally ranging from 102% to 112% of the value of the loaned securities. generally, the revenue earned is shared between the company and the funds or accounts managed by the company from which the securities are borrowed. for 2016, 2015 and 2014, securities lending revenue earned by the company totaled $579 million, $513 million and $477 million, respectively, and is recorded in investment advisory, administration fees and securities lending revenue on the consolidated statements of income. investment advisory, administration fees and securities lending revenue are reported together as the fees for these services often are agreed upon with clients as a bundled fee.
the company receives investment advisory performance fees or incentive allocations, from certain actively managed investment funds and certain separately managed accounts. these performance fees are dependent upon exceeding specified relative or absolute investment return thresholds. such fees are recorded upon completion of the measurement period, which varies by product or account, and could be monthly, quarterly, annually or longer.
in addition, the company is allocated carried interest from certain alternative investment products upon exceeding performance thresholds. blackrock may be required to reverse/return all, or part, of such carried interest allocations depending upon future performance of these funds. therefore, blackrock records carried interest subject to such clawback provisions in total investments or cash/cash of consolidated vies to the extent that it is distributed, on its consolidated statements of financial condition. carried interest is recorded as performance fee revenue upon the earlier of the termination of the investment fund or when the likelihood of clawback is considered mathematically improbable.
the company records a deferred carried interest liability to the extent it receives cash or capital allocations related to carried interest prior to meeting the revenue recognition criteria. at december 31, 2016 and 2015, the company had $152 million and $143 million, respectively, of deferred carried interest recorded in other liabilities/other liabilities of consolidated vies on the consolidated statements of financial condition. a portion of the deferred carried interest liability will be paid to certain employees. the ultimate timing of the recognition of performance fee revenue, if any, for these products is unknown.
the following table presents changes in the deferred carried interest liability (including the portion related to consolidated vies) for 2016 and 2015:
performance fee revenue recognized            (28   )            (31   )
for 2016, 2015 and 2014, performance fee revenue totaled $295 million, $621 million and $550 million, respectively.
fees earned for blackrock solutions, which include advisory services, are recorded as services are performed or when completed and are determined using some, or all, of the following methods: (i) percentages of various attributes of advisory aum or value of positions on the aladdin platform, (ii) fixed-rate fees and (iii) fees billed on a time and materials basis. revenue earned on advisory assignments was comprised of one-time advisory and portfolio structuring fees and ongoing fees based on aum of the respective portfolio assignment. for 2016, 2015 and 2014, blackrock solutions and advisory revenue totaled $714 million, $646 million and $635 million, respectively.
adjustments to revenue arising from initial estimates recorded historically have been immaterial since the majority of blackrock's investment advisory and administration revenue is calculated based on aum and since the company does not record performance fee revenue until performance thresholds have been exceeded and the likelihood of clawback is mathematically improbable.
accounting developments for recent accounting pronouncements not yet adopted, see note 2, significant accounting policies, in the consolidated financial statements contained in part ii, item 8 of this filing.
recent developments in february 2017, the company announced that it has entered an agreement to acquire the first reserve energy infrastructure business, the equity infrastructure franchise of first reserve.  consideration for the transaction will include an upfront payment and contingent consideration.  the transaction is expected to close in the first half of 2017, subject to customary regulatory approvals and closing conditions. this transaction is not expected to be material to the company's consolidated financial condition or results of operations.

item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations.
management's discussion and analysis forward-looking statements certain statements in this report, other than purely historical information, including estimates, projections, statements relating to our business plans, objectives and expected operating results and the assumptions upon which those statements are based, are "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995, section 27a of the securities act of 1933 and section 21e of the securities exchange act of 1934. forward-looking statements may appear throughout this report, including, without limitation, in the following sections: "management's discussion and analysis" and "risk factors." these forward-looking statements generally are identified by the words "believe," "project," "expect," "anticipate," "estimate," "intend," "strategy," "future," "opportunity," "plan," "may," "should," "will," "would," "will be," "will continue," "will likely result" and similar expressions. forward-looking statements are based on current expectations and assumptions, which are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements. a detailed discussion of risks and uncertainties that could cause results and events to differ materially from such forward-looking statements is included in the section titled "economic conditions and uncertainties" and the section titled "risk factors" (item 1a of this form 10-k). forward-looking statements are made as of the date of this report, and we undertake no obligation to update or revise publicly any forward-looking statements, whether because of new information, future events or otherwise.
the purpose of management's discussion and analysis (md&a) is to provide an understanding of procter & gamble's financial condition, results of operations and cash flows by focusing on changes in certain key measures from year to year. the md&a is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. the md&a is organized in the following sections:
•   summary of 2016 results
•   economic conditions and uncertainties
•   results of operations
•   cash flow, financial condition and liquidity
•   other information throughout the md&a, we refer to measures used by management to evaluate performance, including unit volume growth, net sales and net earnings. we also refer to a number of financial measures that are not defined under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america (u.s. gaap), including organic sales growth, core earnings per share (core eps), adjusted free cash flow and adjusted free cash flow productivity. organic sales growth is net sales growth excluding the impacts of the venezuela deconsolidation, acquisitions, divestitures and foreign exchange from year-over-year comparisons. core eps is diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations excluding certain items that are not judged to be part of the company's sustainable results or trends. adjusted free cash flow is operating cash flow less capital spending and certain divestiture impacts. adjusted free cash flow productivity is the ratio of adjusted free cash flow to net earnings excluding certain one-time items. we believe these measures provide our investors with additional information about our underlying results and trends, as well as insight to some of the metrics used to evaluate management. the explanation at the end of the md&a provides more details on the use and the derivation of these measures.
management also uses certain market share and market consumption estimates to evaluate performance relative to competition despite some limitations on the availability and comparability of share and consumption information. references to market share and market consumption in the md&a are based on a combination of vendor-reported consumption and market size data, as well as internal estimates. all market share references represent the percentage of sales in dollar terms on a constant currency basis of our products, relative to all product sales in the category.
overview p&g is a global leader in fast-moving consumer goods, focused on providing branded consumer packaged goods of superior quality and value to our consumers around the world. our products are sold in more than 180 countries and territories primarily through mass merchandisers, grocery stores, membership club stores, drug stores, department stores, distributors, baby stores, specialty beauty stores, e-commerce, high-frequency stores and pharmacies. we have on-the-ground operations in approximately 70 countries.
our market environment is highly competitive with global, regional and local competitors. in many of the markets and industry segments in which we sell our products, we compete against other branded products as well as retailers' private-label brands. additionally, many of the product segments in which we compete are differentiated by price tiers (referred to as super-premium, premium, mid-tier and value-tier products). we are well positioned in the industry segments and markets in which we operate, often holding a leadership or significant market share position.
12 the procter & gamble company organizational structure our organizational structure is comprised of global business units (gbus), selling and market operations (smos), global business services (gbs) and corporate functions (cf).
global business units our gbus are organized into ten product categories. under u.s. gaap, the gbus underlying the ten product categories are aggregated into five reportable segments: beauty; grooming; health care; fabric & home care; and baby, feminine & family care. the gbus are responsible for developing overall brand strategy, new product upgrades and innovations and marketing plans. the following provides additional detail on our reportable segments and the ten product categories and brand composition within each segment.

recent developments: as of june 30, 2015, the company deconsolidated our venezuelan subsidiaries and began accounting for our investment in those subsidiaries using the cost method of accounting. this change resulted in a fiscal 2015 one-time after-tax charge of $2.1 billion ($0.71 per share). beginning in fiscal 2016, our financial results only include sales of finished goods to our venezuelan subsidiaries to the extent we receive cash payments from venezuela (expected to be largely through the dipro and dicom exchange market). accordingly, we no longer include the results of our venezuelan subsidiaries' operations in reporting periods following fiscal 2015 (see note 1 to the consolidated financial statements and additional discussion in the md&a under "venezuela impacts" in results of operations).
in august 2014, the company announced a plan to significantly streamline our product portfolio by divesting, discontinuing or consolidating about 100 non-strategic brands. the resulting portfolio of about 65 key brands are in 10 category-based businesses where p&g has leading market positions, strong brands and consumer-meaningful product technologies.
during fiscal 2016, the company completed the divestiture of its batteries business. the batteries business had historically been part of the company's fabric & home care reportable segment. the results of the batteries business are presented as discontinued operations and, as such, are excluded from both continuing operations and segment results for all periods presented. additionally, the batteries balance sheet positions as of june 30, 2015 are presented as held for sale in the consolidated balance sheets.
on july 9, 2015, the company announced the signing of a definitive agreement to divest four product categories, to coty inc. ("coty"). coty's offer was $12.5 billion. the divestiture was initially comprised of 43 of the company's beauty brands ("beauty brands"), including the global salon professional hair care and color, retail hair color, cosmetics and fine fragrance businesses, along with select hair styling brands. subsequent to signing, two of the fine fragrance brands, dolce gabbana and christina aguilera, were excluded from the divestiture. while the ultimate form of the transaction has not yet been decided, the company's current preference is for a reverse the procter & gamble company 13
morris trust split-off transaction in which p&g shareholders could elect to participate in an exchange offer to exchange their p&g shares for coty shares. the company expects to complete this transaction in october 2016. the results of the beauty brands are now presented as discontinued operations and, as such, are excluded from both continuing operations and segment results for all periods presented. additionally, the beauty brands' balance sheet positions as of june 30, 2016 and june 30, 2015 are presented as held for sale in the consolidated balance sheets.
during fiscal 2015, the company completed the divestiture of its pet care business. the gain on the transaction was not material. the results of the pet care business are presented as discontinued operations and, as such, are excluded from both continuing operations and segment results for all periods presented.
with these transactions and other recent minor brand divestitures, the company will have substantially completed the strategic portfolio reshaping program.
beauty: we are a global market leader in the beauty category. most of the beauty markets in which we compete are highly fragmented with a large number of global and local competitors. we compete in skin and personal care and in hair care. in skin and personal care, we offer a wide variety of products, ranging from deodorants to personal cleansing to skin care, such as our olay brand, which is one of the top facial skin care brands in the world with over 7% global market share. in hair care, we compete in the retail channel. we are the global market leader in the retail hair care market with over 20% global market share primarily behind our pantene and head & shoulders brands.
grooming: we compete in shave care and appliances. in shave care, we are the global market leader in the blades and razors market. our global blades and razors market share is nearly 65%, primarily behind the gillette franchise including fusion, mach3, prestobarba and venus. our appliances, such as electric razors and epilators, are sold under the braun brand in a number of markets around the world where we compete against both global and regional competitors. we hold over 20% of the male shavers market and nearly 45% of the female epilators market.
health care: we compete in oral care and personal health care. in oral care, there are several global competitors in the market and we have the number two market share position with nearly 20% global market share behind our oral-b and crest brands. in personal health care, we are a top ten competitor in a large, highly fragmented industry, primarily behind respiratory treatments (vicks brand), nonprescription heartburn medications (prilosec otc brand) and digestive wellness products (metamucil, pepto bismol, and align brands). nearly all of our sales outside the u.s. in personal health care are generated through the pgt healthcare partnership with teva pharmaceuticals ltd.
fabric & home care: this segment is comprised of a variety of fabric care products including laundry detergents, additives and fabric enhancers; and home care products including dishwashing liquids and detergents, surface cleaners and air fresheners. in fabric care, we generally have the number one or number two market share position in the markets in which we compete and are the global market leader with nearly 30% global market share, primarily behind our tide, ariel and downy brands. our global home care market share is nearly 25% across the categories in which we compete.
baby, feminine & family care:  in baby care, we compete mainly in diapers, pants and baby wipes with nearly 30% global market share. we are the number one or number two baby care competitor in most of the key markets in which we compete, primarily behind pampers, the company's largest brand, with annual net sales of nearly $9 billion. we are the global market leader in the feminine care category with over 25% global market share, primarily behind always. we also compete in the adult incontinence category in certain markets, achieving over 10% market share in the markets where we compete. our family care business is predominantly a north american business comprised largely of the bounty paper towel and charmin toilet paper brands. u.s. market shares are over 40% for bounty and over 25% for charmin.
selling and market operations our smos are responsible for developing and executing go-to-market plans at the local level. the smos include dedicated retail customer, trade channel and country-specific teams. our smos are organized under six regions comprised of north america, europe, latin america, asia pacific, greater china and india, middle east and africa (imea). throughout the md&a, we reference business results in developed markets, which are comprised of north america, western europe and japan, and developing markets which are all other markets not included in developed.

strategic focus p&g aspires to serve the world's consumers better than our best competitors in every category and in every country in which we compete, and, as a result, deliver total shareholder return in the top one-third of our peer group.  delivering and sustaining leadership levels of shareholder value creation requires balanced top-line growth, bottom-line growth and strong cash generation.
our strategic choices are focused on winning with consumers.  the consumers who purchase and use our products are at the center of everything we do.  we increase the number of users - and the usage - of our brands when we win at the zero, first and second moments of truth:  when consumers research our
winning with consumers around the world and against our best competitors requires innovation.  innovation has always been, and continues to be, p&g's lifeblood.  innovation requires consumer insights and technology advancements that lead to product improvements, improved marketing and merchandising programs and game-changing inventions that create new brands and categories.
productivity improvement is critical to delivering our balanced top-line growth, bottom-line growth and value creation objectives.  productivity improvement and sales growth reinforce and fuel each other.  we are driving productivity improvement across all elements of cost, including cost of goods sold, marketing and promotional expenses and non-manufacturing overhead.  productivity improvements and cost savings are being reinvested in product and packaging improvements, brand awareness-building advertising and trial-building sampling programs, increased sales coverage and r&d programs.
we are improving operational effectiveness and organizational culture through enhanced clarity of roles and responsibilities, accountability and incentive compensation programs.
the company has undertaken an effort to focus and strengthen its business portfolio to compete in categories and with brands that are structurally attractive and that play to p&g's strengths. the ongoing portfolio of businesses consists of 10 product categories. these are categories where p&g has leading market positions, strong brands and consumer-meaningful product technologies.
we believe these strategies are right for the long-term health of the company and our objective of delivering total shareholder return in the top one-third of our peer group.
the company expects the delivery of the following long-term annual financial targets will result in total shareholder returns in the top third of the competitive peer group:
•   organic sales growth above market growth rates in the categories and geographies in which we compete;
•   core eps growth of mid-to-high single digits; and
•   adjusted free cash flow productivity of 90% or greater.
in periods with significant macroeconomic pressures, we intend to maintain a disciplined approach to investing so as not to sacrifice the long-term health of our businesses to meet short-term objectives in any given year.

•   net sales decreased 8% to $65.3 billion including a negative 6% impact from foreign exchange.
◦   organic sales increased 1%, as increased pricing was partially offset by a reduction in organic volume.
◦   unit volume decreased 3%. volume decreased low single digits in grooming, health care, fabric &amp; home care and baby, feminine &amp; family care. volume decreased mid-single digits in beauty. organic volume declined 1%.
•   net earnings from continuing operations increased $1.7 billion or 21% in fiscal 2016 due to a $2.1 billion after-tax charge in the prior year related to the deconsolidation of our venezuelan subsidiaries and improved gross margin, partially offset by the earnings impact of the decline in net sales. foreign exchange impacts negatively affected net earnings from continuing operations by $880 million or approximately 11%.
•   net earnings from discontinued operations increased $1.7 billion due primarily to the net impact of a gain on the sale of our batteries business in fiscal 2016 and higher impairment charges on that business in the prior period.
•   net earnings attributable to procter &amp; gamble were $10.5 billion, an increase of $3.5 billion or 49% versus the prior year due to the aforementioned increases in net earnings from both continuing and discontinued operations.
•   cash flow from operating activities was $15.4 billion.
◦   adjusted free cash flow productivity was 115%.
economic conditions and uncertainties we discuss expectations regarding future performance, events and outcomes, such as our business outlook and objectives, in annual and quarterly reports, press releases and other written and oral communications. all such statements, except for historical and present factual information, are "forward-looking statements" and are based on financial data and our business plans available only as of the time the statements are made, which may become out-of-date or incomplete. we assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statements as a result of new information, future events or other factors. forward-looking statements are inherently uncertain and investors must recognize that events could be significantly different from our expectations. for more information on risks that could impact our results, refer to item 1a risk factors in this form 10-k.
global economic conditions. current macroeconomic factors remain dynamic, and any causes of market size contraction, such as reduced gdp in commodity-producing economies as commodity prices decline, greater political unrest in the middle east and eastern europe, further economic instability in the european union, political instability in certain latin american markets and economic slowdowns in japan and china, could reduce our sales or erode our operating margin, in either case reducing our earnings.
changes in costs. our costs are subject to fluctuations, particularly due to changes in commodity prices and our own productivity efforts. we have significant exposures to certain commodities, in particular certain oil-derived materials like resins, and volatility in the market price of these commodity input materials has a direct impact on our costs. if we are unable to manage commodity fluctuations through pricing actions, cost savings projects and sourcing decisions as well as through consistent productivity improvements, it may adversely impact our gross margin, operating margin and net earnings. sales could also be adversely impacted following pricing actions if there is a negative impact on consumption of our products. we strive to implement, achieve and sustain cost improvement plans, including outsourcing projects, supply chain optimization and general overhead and workforce optimization. as discussed later in the md&a, we initiated certain non-manufacturing overhead reduction projects along with manufacturing and other supply chain cost improvements projects in 2012. if we are not successful in executing these changes, there could be a negative impact on our operating margin and net earnings.
foreign exchange. we have both translation and transaction exposure to the fluctuation of exchange rates. translation exposures relate to exchange rate impacts of measuring income statements of foreign subsidiaries that do not use the u.s. dollar as their functional currency. transaction exposures relate to 1) the impact from input costs that are denominated in a currency other than the local reporting currency and 2) the revaluation of transaction-related working capital balances denominated in currencies other than the functional currency. in 2016, 2015 and 2014, the u.s. dollar has strengthened versus a number of foreign currencies leading to lower sales and earnings from these foreign exchange impacts. certain countries experiencing significant exchange rate fluctuations, like argentina, brazil, canada, egypt, mexico, nigeria, russia and turkey have had, and could have, a significant impact on our sales, costs and earnings. increased pricing in response to these fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates may offset portions of the currency impacts, but could also have a negative impact on consumption of our products, which would affect our sales.
government policies. our net earnings could be affected by changes in u.s. or foreign government tax policies. for example, the u.s. may consider corporate tax reform that could significantly impact the corporate tax rate and change the u.s. tax treatment of international earnings. additionally, we attempt to carefully manage our debt and currency exposure in certain countries with currency exchange, import authorization and pricing controls, such as argentina, egypt, nigeria and ukraine. changes in government policies in these areas might cause an increase or decrease in our sales, operating margin and net earnings.
results of operations the key metrics included in our discussion of our consolidated results of operations include net sales, gross margin, selling, general and administrative costs (sg&a), other non-operating items and income taxes. the primary factors driving year-over-year changes in net sales include overall market growth in the categories in which we compete, product initiatives, the level of initiatives and other activities by competitors, geographic expansion and acquisition and divestiture activity, all of which drive changes in our underlying unit volume, as well as pricing actions (which can also indirectly impact volume), changes in product and geographic mix and foreign currency impacts on sales outside the u.s.
most of our cost of products sold and sg&a are to some extent variable in nature. accordingly, our discussion of these operating costs focuses primarily on relative margins rather than the absolute year-over-year changes in total costs. the primary drivers of changes in gross margin are input costs (energy and other commodities), pricing impacts, geographic mix (for example, gross margins in developed markets are generally higher than in developing markets for similar products), product mix (for example, the beauty segment has higher gross margins than the company average), foreign exchange rate fluctuations (in situations where certain input costs may be tied to a different functional currency than the underlying sales), the impacts of manufacturing savings projects and to a lesser extent scale impacts (for costs that are fixed or less variable in nature). the primary drivers of sg&a are marketing-related costs and non-manufacturing overhead costs. marketing-related costs are primarily variable in nature, although we may achieve some level of scale benefit over time due to overall growth and other marketing efficiencies. overhead costs are also variable in nature, but on a relative basis, less so than marketing costs due to our ability to leverage our organization and systems infrastructures to support business growth. accordingly, we generally experience more scale-related impacts for these costs.
16 the procter & gamble company the company is in the midst of a productivity and cost savings plan to reduce costs in the areas of supply chain, marketing and overhead expenses. the plan is designed to accelerate cost reductions by streamlining management decision making, manufacturing and other work processes to fund the company's growth strategy.
net sales decreased 8% to $65.3 billion in 2016 on a 3% decrease in unit volume versus the prior year period. volume decreased low single digits in grooming, health care, fabric & home care and baby, feminine & family care and decreased mid-single digits in beauty. volume increased low single digits in developed regions and declined high single digits in developing regions, in part due to increased pricing to address foreign exchange devaluations and due to the venezuela deconsolidation and minor brand divestitures. organic volume declined mid-single digits in developing markets. unfavorable foreign exchange reduced net sales by
6%, while higher pricing drove a 1% favorable impact on net sales. organic volume decreased 1% and organic sales grew 1% driven by higher pricing.
net sales decreased 5% to $70.7 billion in 2015 on a 1% decrease in unit volume versus the prior year period. volume grew low single digits in fabric & home care. volume decreased low single digits in baby, feminine & family care, grooming, health care and beauty. volume increased low single digits in developed regions and declined low single digits in developing regions due, in part, to increased pricing to address foreign exchange devaluations. unfavorable foreign exchange reduced net sales by 6%, while higher pricing drove a 2% favorable impact on net sales. favorable product mix impact of 1% was offset by acquisition and divestiture activity. organic volume decreased 1% and organic sales grew 2% driven by higher pricing.

•   a 70 basis point benefit of higher pricing.
these impacts were partially offset by:
•   a 70 basis point negative impact from unfavorable foreign exchange,
•   a 70 basis point decrease due to unfavorable product mix caused by the disproportionate decline of higher margin segments like beauty and by product form mix within the segments,
•   a 20 basis point decrease from negative scale impacts due to lower volume and
total sg&a decreased 8% to $18.9 billion primarily due to reduced overhead spending and a decrease in foreign exchange transaction charges. sg&a as a percentage of net sales declined 10 basis points to 29.0%, as the negative scale impacts of lower net sales and inflationary impacts were more than offset by cost savings efforts, mainly in overhead spending, and lower foreign exchange transactional charges.
•   marketing spending as a percentage of net sales increased 90 basis points due to the negative scale impacts from reduced sales.
•   overhead costs as a percentage of net sales decreased 20 basis points, as 90 basis points of productivity savings were partially offset by wage inflation, increased sales personnel in certain businesses, investments in research and development and the negative scale impacts from reduced sales.
•   lower foreign exchange transactional charges reduced sg&amp;a as a percentage of net sales by approximately 70 basis points. a pre-deconsolidation balance sheet remeasurement charge in venezuela in the base period drove 20 basis points of this decline. the balance of the reduction relates to lower transactional charges from revaluing receivables and payables from transactions denominated in a currency other than a local entity's functional currency.
gross margin increased 10 basis points to 47.6% of net sales in 2015. gross margin benefited from:
•   a 200 basis point impact from manufacturing cost savings and
•   a 90 basis point benefit from higher pricing.
these impacts were partially offset by:
•   a 110 basis point impact from unfavorable geographic and product mix, primarily from declines in the higher than average margin beauty and grooming segments as well as within the fabric &amp; home care and grooming segments,
•   a 50 basis point impact from unfavorable foreign exchange,
•   a 40 basis point impact from costs related to initiatives and capacity investments,
•   a 30 basis point impact from higher restructuring costs and
•   smaller impacts from lower volume scale and higher commodity costs.
total sg&a decreased 4% to $20.6 billion, as reduced overhead and marketing spending was partially offset by increased foreign exchange transaction charges. sg&a as a percentage of net sales increased 30 basis points to 29.1%, as the negative scale impacts of lower net sales and inflationary impacts were partially offset by cost savings efforts.
•   marketing spending as a percentage of net sales decreased 60 basis points behind lower spending due to efficiency efforts.
•   overhead spending as a percentage of net sales increased 50 basis points as productivity savings of 60 basis points from reduced overhead spending were more than offset by wage inflation, investments in research and development, the negative scale impacts of lower net sales and higher restructuring costs.
•   increased foreign exchange transaction charges added approximately 40 basis points to sg&amp;a as a percentage of net sales, as current year foreign currency transaction charges (from revaluing receivables and payables denominated in a currency other than a local entity's functional currency) were partially offset by lower year-on-year charges for venezuela remeasurement and devaluation.
during fiscal 2015, the company incurred a $2.0 billion ($2.1 billion after tax) charge related to the deconsolidation of its venezuelan subsidiaries. see the "venezuela impacts" later in the results of operations section.
non-operating items fiscal year 2016 compared with fiscal year 2015
•   interest expense was $579 million in 2016, a decrease of $47 million versus the prior year due to lower average debt balances.
•   interest income was $182 million in 2016, an increase of $33 million versus the prior year primarily due to increasing cash, cash equivalents and investment securities balances.
•   other non-operating income, which primarily includes divestiture gains and investment income, decreased $115 million to $325 million, due primarily to lower gains on minor brand divestitures. in 2016, we had approximately $300 million in minor brand divestiture gains, including escudo and certain hair care brands in europe and imea. the prior year acquisition and divestiture activities included approximately $450 million in divestiture gains, including zest, camay, fekkai and wash &amp; go hair care brands and vaposteam.
•   interest expense was $626 million in 2015 a decrease of $83 million versus the prior year due to lower average debt balances and a decrease in weighted average interest rates.
•   interest income was $149 million in 2015, an increase of $50 million versus the prior year due to an increase in cash, cash equivalents and investment securities.
•   other non-operating income increased $231 million to $440 million, primarily due to minor brand divestiture gains. in 2015, we had approximately $450 million in minor brand divestiture gains, including zest, camay, fekkai and wash &amp; go hair care brands and vaposteam. the prior year acquisition and divestiture activities included approximately $150 million in divestiture gains, primarily related to the sale of our bleach businesses in europe, imea and latin america, our pert hair care business in latin america and mdvip.
the effective tax rate on continuing operations increased 30 basis points to 25.0% in 2016 mainly due to a 260 basis point negative impact from the unfavorable geographic mix of earnings, a 130 basis point impact in the current year from the establishment of valuation allowances on deferred tax assets related to net operating loss carryforwards and the impact of favorable discrete adjustments related to uncertain income tax positions (which netted to 55 basis points in the current year versus 85 basis points in the prior year), partially offset by a 400 basis point decrease related to the prior year non-deductibility of the venezuelan deconsolidation charge.
the effective tax rate on continuing operations increased 360 basis points to 24.7% in 2015 mainly due to the non-deductibility of the $2.0 billion venezuelan deconsolidation charge. the rate increase caused by lower favorable discrete adjustments related to uncertain income tax positions (the net benefit was 80 basis points in fiscal 2015 versus 170 basis points in fiscal 2014) was largely offset by a decrease related to favorable geographic earnings mix.
net earnings from continuing operations increased $1.7 billion or 21% to $10.0 billion primarily due to the base period charge of $2.1 billion after-tax related to the deconsolidation of
18 the procter & gamble company venezuelan subsidiaries. earnings also declined due to the impact of the decline in net sales in fiscal 2016, partially offset by improved gross margin and the reduction in sg&a. foreign exchange impacts reduced net earnings by about $880 million in 2016 due to weakening of certain key currencies against the u.s. dollar, primarily in argentina, brazil, canada, mexico and russia. this impact includes both transactional charges as discussed above in operating costs and translational impacts from converting earnings from foreign subsidiaries to u.s. dollars.
net earnings from discontinued operations improved $1.7 billion in 2016 to $577 million. batteries drove a $2.1 billion improvement due primarily to a $1.8 billion reduction in after-tax impairment charges in the batteries business ($350 million in the current year compared to $2.1 billion in the base period) and a $422 million after-tax gain in the current period from the sale of the batteries business. this was partially offset by a decrease in the earnings of the beauty brands (see note 4 to the consolidated financial statements).
diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations increased $0.65, or 23%, to $3.49 due to the increase in net earnings and a decline in the average number of shares outstanding. diluted net earnings per share from discontinued operations were $0.20 primarily resulting from the gain on the sale of the batteries business. this was an improvement of $0.60 per share versus the prior year. diluted net earnings per share increased $1.25, or 51%, to $3.69.
core eps decreased 2% to $3.67. core eps in fiscal year 2016 represents diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations excluding charges for certain european legal matters and incremental restructuring related to our productivity and cost savings plan. the decline was driven by reduced net sales and foreign exchange impacts, partially offset by gross margin expansion.
net earnings from continuing operations decreased $2.4 billion or 22% to $8.3 billion due to the $2.1 billion after-tax charge related to the deconsolidation of venezuelan subsidiaries and the decline in net sales, partially offset by reduced sg&a. foreign exchange impacts negatively affected net earnings by approximately $1.3 billion in 2015 due to the weakening of certain key currencies against the u.s. dollar, primarily in russia, ukraine, venezuela and argentina, partially offset by lower after-tax charges related to balance sheet remeasurement charges in venezuela.
net earnings from discontinued operations decreased $2.3 billion in 2015 due primarily to $2.1 billion of after-tax impairment charges in our batteries business (see note 4 to the consolidated financial statements) and the absence of fiscal 2015 earnings from our divested pet care business. net earnings attributable to procter & gamble decreased $4.6 billion, or 40% to $7.0 billion.
diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations decreased $0.79, or 22%, to $2.84 due to the decrease in net earnings. we had a diluted net loss per share from discontinued operations of $0.40 due primarily to the impairment charges on the batteries business. this was a reduction of $0.78 per share versus the prior year. diluted net earnings per share decreased $1.57, or 39%, to $2.44.
core eps decreased 2% to $3.76. core eps represents diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations excluding charges for venezuelan deconsolidation, balance sheet remeasurement charges from foreign exchange policy changes and devaluation in venezuela, charges for certain european legal matters and incremental restructuring related to our productivity and cost savings plan. the decline was driven by reduced net sales, partially offset by minor brand divestiture gains.
venezuela impacts there are a number of currency and other operating controls and restrictions in venezuela, which have evolved over time and may continue to evolve in the future. these evolving conditions resulted in an other-than-temporary lack of exchangeability between the venezuelan bolivar and u.s. dollar and restricted our venezuelan operations' ability to pay dividends or pay for certain raw and package materials, finished goods and services denominated in u.s. dollars. for accounting purposes, this resulted in a lack of control over our venezuelan subsidiaries. therefore, in accordance with the applicable accounting standards for consolidation, effective june 30, 2015, we deconsolidated our venezuelan subsidiaries and began accounting for our investment in those subsidiaries using the cost method of accounting. this resulted in a write-off of all of the net assets of our venezuelan subsidiaries, along with venezuela related assets held by other subsidiaries. beginning with the first quarter of fiscal 2016, our financial results only include sales of finished goods to our venezuelan subsidiaries to the extent we receive payments from venezuela. accordingly, we no longer include the results of our venezuelan subsidiaries' operations in our financial results.
segment results segment results reflect information on the same basis we use for internal management reporting and performance evaluation. the results of these reportable segments do not include certain non-business unit specific costs such as interest expense, investing activities and certain restructuring and asset impairment costs. these costs are reported in our corporate segment and are included as part of our corporate segment discussion. additionally, as described in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, we apply blended statutory tax rates in the segments. eliminations to adjust segment results to arrive at our effective tax rate are included in corporate. all references to net earnings throughout the discussion of segment results refer to net earnings from continuing operations.

net loss       $(174)   n/a                    $(2,420)   n/a corporate includes certain operating and non-operating activities not allocated to specific business segments. these include: the incidental businesses managed at the corporate level; financing and investing activities; other general corporate items; the gains and losses related to certain divested brands and categories; certain restructuring-type activities to maintain a competitive cost structure, including manufacturing and workforce optimization; certain significant asset impairment and deconsolidation charges; and certain balance sheet impacts from significant foreign exchange devaluations. corporate also includes reconciling items to adjust the accounting policies used in the segments to u.s. gaap. the most significant reconciling item includes income taxes to adjust from blended statutory rates that are reflected in the segments to the overall company effective tax rate.
corporate net sales decreased $44 million during the fiscal year. corporate net earnings from continuing operations improved by approximately $2.2 billion during the fiscal year, primarily due to the $2.1 billion venezuela deconsolidation charge in the prior fiscal year and lower foreign currency transactional charges. additional discussion of these items impacting net earnings in corporate are included in the results of operations section.
net sales in corporate decreased by $271 million in 2015 primarily due to the prior year divestiture of the mdvip business. corporate net expenses from continuing operations increased $2.0 billion in 2015, primarily due to the charge related to the deconsolidation of the venezuelan subsidiaries, increased foreign exchange transactional charges and incremental restructuring charges, which were partially offset by gains on minor brand divestitures.
productivity and cost savings plan in 2012, the company initiated a productivity and cost savings plan to reduce costs and better leverage scale in the areas of supply chain, research and development, marketing and overheads. the plan was designed to accelerate cost reductions by streamlining management decision making, manufacturing and other work processes to fund the company's growth strategy.
as part of this plan, the company expects to incur approximately $5.5 billion in before-tax restructuring costs over a six-year period (from fiscal 2012 through fiscal 2017). through the end of fiscal 2016, 89% of the expected costs have been incurred. savings generated from the restructuring costs are difficult to estimate, given the nature of the activities, the timing of the execution and the degree of reinvestment. overall, these costs and other non-manufacturing enrollment reductions are expected to deliver approximately $3.0 billion in annual before-tax gross savings. the cumulative before-tax savings realized through 2016 were approximately $2.4 billion.
restructuring accruals of $315 million as of june 30, 2016 are classified as current liabilities. during fiscal 2016, 51% of the restructuring charges incurred either have been or will be settled with cash. consistent with our historical policies for ongoing restructuring-type activities, the resulting charges are funded by and included within corporate for segment reporting.
in addition to our restructuring programs, we have additional ongoing savings efforts in our supply chain, marketing and overhead areas that yield additional benefits to our operating margins.
refer to note 3 to our consolidated financial statements for more details on the restructuring program and to the operating costs section of the md&a for more information about the total benefit to operating margins from our total savings efforts.
cash flow, financial condition and liquidity we believe our financial condition continues to be of high quality, as evidenced by our ability to generate substantial cash from operations and to readily access capital markets at competitive rates.
operating cash flow provides the primary source of cash to fund operating needs and capital expenditures. excess operating cash is used first to fund shareholder dividends. other discretionary uses include share repurchases and acquisitions to complement our portfolio of businesses, brands and geographies. as necessary, we may supplement operating cash flow with debt to fund these activities. the overall cash position of the company reflects our strong business results and a global cash management strategy that takes into account liquidity management, economic factors and tax considerations.
operating cash flow fiscal year 2016 compared with fiscal year 2015
operating cash flow was $15.4 billion in 2016, a 6% increase from the prior year. net earnings, adjusted for non-cash items (depreciation and amortization, share-based compensation, deferred income taxes, loss/(gain) on sale of businesses and impairment charges) generated $13.6 billion of operating cash
24 the procter & gamble company flow. working capital and other impacts generated $1.8 billion of operating cash flow.
•   reduced accounts receivable generated $35 million of cash due to improved collection results partially offset by sales mix. the number of days sales outstanding increased 1 day due to foreign exchange impacts.
•   lower inventory generated $116 million of cash mainly due to supply chain optimizations and lower commodity costs. inventory days on hand increased 4 days primarily due to foreign exchange impacts.
•   accounts payable, accrued and other liabilities increased, generating $1.3 billion in operating cash flow, of which approximately $0.8 billion was driven by extended payment terms with our suppliers. the balance was primarily driven by an increase in fourth quarter marketing activity versus the prior year. these items, along with the impact of foreign exchange, drove a 24 day increase in days payable outstanding. although difficult to project due to market and other dynamics, we anticipate similar cash flow benefits from the extended payment terms with suppliers over the next fiscal year.
•   other operating assets and liabilities generated $204 million of cash.
operating cash flow was $14.6 billion in 2015, a 5% increase from the prior year. operating cash flows resulted primarily from net earnings, adjusted for non-cash items (depreciation and amortization, share-based compensation, deferred income taxes, impairment charges, gains on sale of businesses and the venezuela deconsolidation charge) and a decrease in working capital, partially offset by the impact of other operating assets and liabilities.
•   reduced accounts receivable generated $349 million of cash due to changes in customer terms and improved collection results. the number of days sales outstanding decreased 5 days due to foreign exchange impacts and improvements in collection results and customer terms.
•   lower inventory generated $313 million of cash mainly due to supply chain optimizations and lower commodity costs. inventory days on hand decreased 7 days due to foreign exchange impacts, supply chain optimizations and lower commodity costs.
•   accounts payable, accrued and other liabilities increased, generating $928 million in operating cash flow primarily driven by extended payment terms.
•   other operating assets and liabilities utilized $976 million of cash primarily due to the elimination of the deferred tax impacts associated with the pet care divestiture.
adjusted free cash flow. we view adjusted free cash flow as an important measure because it is a factor impacting the amount of cash available for dividends, share repurchases, acquisitions and other discretionary investment. it is defined as operating cash flow less capital expenditures and excluding certain divestiture impacts (tax payments in the prior year for the pet care divestiture) and is one of the measures used to evaluate senior management and determine their at-risk compensation.
adjusted free cash flow was $12.1 billion in 2016, an increase of 4% versus the prior year. the increase was driven by the increase in operating cash flows and decrease in capital spending. adjusted free cash flow productivity, defined as the ratio of adjusted free cash flow to net earnings excluding the impairment charges and gain on the sale of the batteries business, was 115% in 2016.
adjusted free cash flow was $11.6 billion in 2015, an increase of 15% versus the prior year. the increase was driven by the increase in operating cash flows. adjusted free cash flow productivity, defined as the ratio of adjusted free cash flow to net earnings excluding impairment charges on the batteries business and the venezuelan deconsolidation charge, was 102% in 2015.
net investing activities consumed $5.6 billion in cash in 2016 mainly due to capital spending, divestiture transactions and net purchases of short-term investments, partially offset by sales or maturities of short-term investments.
net investing activities consumed $2.9 billion in cash in 2015 mainly due to capital spending, net purchases of available-for-sale securities and a reduction in cash due to venezuela deconsolidation, partially offset by asset sales.
capital spending. capital expenditures, primarily to support capacity expansion, innovation and cost efficiencies, were $3.3 billion in 2016 and $3.7 billion in 2015. capital spending as a percentage of net sales decreased 20 basis points to 5.1% in 2016. capital spending as a percentage of net sales was 5.3% in 2015.
proceeds from divestitures and other asset sales. proceeds from asset sales in 2016 contributed $432 million in cash, primarily from plant asset sales and other minor brand divestitures. proceeds from asset sales contributed $4.5 billion in cash in 2015 primarily from the sale of our pet care business, the sale of our chinese battery venture, and other minor brand divestitures.
financing cash flow dividend payments. our first discretionary use of cash is dividend payments. dividends per common share increased 3% to $2.66 per share in 2016. total dividend payments to common and preferred shareholders were $7.4 billion in 2016 and $7.3 billion in 2015. in april 2016, the board of directors declared an increase in our quarterly dividend from $0.6629 to $0.6695 per share on common stock and series a and b esop convertible class a preferred stock. this represents a 1% increase compared to the prior quarterly dividend and is the 60th consecutive year that our dividend has increased. we the procter & gamble company 25
long-term and short-term debt. we maintain debt levels we consider appropriate after evaluating a number of factors, including cash flow expectations, cash requirements for ongoing operations, investment and financing plans (including acquisitions and share repurchase activities) and the overall cost of capital. total debt was $30.6 billion as of june 30, 2016 and $30.3 billion as of june 30, 2015.
treasury purchases. total share repurchases were $4.0 billion in 2016 and $4.6 billion in 2015. in addition, the cash infusion of $1.7 billion in the batteries divestiture was reflected as a purchase of treasury stock.
liquidity at june 30, 2016, our current assets exceeded current liabilities by $3.0 billion largely due to current assets and current liabilities of the beauty brands business held for sale. excluding current assets and current liabilities of the beauty brands business held for sale, our current liabilities exceeded current assets by $1.8 billion, largely due to short-term borrowings under our commercial paper program. we anticipate being able to support our short-term liquidity and operating needs largely through cash generated from operations. the company regularly assesses its cash needs and the available sources to fund these needs. as of june 30, 2016, $11.0 billion of the company's cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities is held off-shore by foreign subsidiaries. amounts held by foreign subsidiaries are generally subject to u.s. income taxation on repatriation to the u.s. we do not expect restrictions or taxes on repatriation of cash held outside of the u.s. to have a material effect on our overall liquidity, financial condition or the results of operations for the foreseeable future. of the june 30, 2016 balance of off-shore cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, the majority relates to various western european countries. as of june 30, 2016, we did not have material cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balances in any country subject to exchange controls that significantly restrict our ability to access or repatriate the funds.
we utilize short- and long-term debt to fund discretionary items, such as acquisitions and share repurchases. we have strong short- and long-term debt ratings, which have enabled, and should continue to enable, us to refinance our debt as it becomes due at favorable rates in commercial paper and bond markets. in addition, we have agreements with a diverse group of financial institutions that, if needed, should provide sufficient credit funding to meet short-term financing requirements.
we maintain bank credit facilities to support our ongoing commercial paper program. the current facility is an $8.0 billion facility split between a $3.2 billion five-year facility and a $4.8 billion 364-day facility, which expire in november 2020 and november 2016, respectively. the 364-day facility can be extended for certain periods of time as specified in the terms of the credit agreement. these facilities are currently undrawn and we anticipate that they will remain undrawn. these credit facilities do not have cross-default or ratings triggers, nor do they have material adverse events clauses, except at the time of signing. in addition to these credit facilities, we have an automatically effective registration statement on form s-3 filed with the sec that is available for registered offerings of short- or long-term debt securities. for additional details on debt see note 10 to the consolidated financial statements.
guarantees and other off-balance sheet arrangements we do not have guarantees or other off-balance sheet financing arrangements, including variable interest entities, which we believe could have a material impact on financial condition or liquidity.
26 the procter & gamble company contractual commitments the following table provides information on the amount and payable date of our contractual commitments as of june 30, 2016.
capital leases                                        45                      16                      21                     5                       3
operating leases (2)                               1,563                     237                     464                   360                     502
(1)   as of june 30, 2016, the company's consolidated balance sheet reflects a liability for uncertain tax positions of $1.2 billion, including $343 million of interest and penalties. due to the high degree of uncertainty regarding the timing of future cash outflows of liabilities for uncertain tax positions beyond one year, a reasonable estimate of the period of cash settlement beyond twelve months from the balance sheet date of june 30, 2016, cannot be made.
(2)   operating lease obligations are shown net of guaranteed sublease income.
(3)   represents future pension payments to comply with local funding requirements. these future pension payments assume the company continues to meet its future statutory funding requirements. considering the current economic environment in which the company operates, the company believes its cash flows are adequate to meet the future statutory funding requirements. the projected payments beyond fiscal year 2019 are not currently determinable.
(4)   primarily reflects future contractual payments under various take-or-pay arrangements entered into as part of the normal course of business. commitments made under take-or-pay obligations represent future purchases in line with expected usage to obtain favorable pricing. this includes service contracts for information technology, human resources management and facilities management activities that have been outsourced. while the amounts listed represent contractual obligations, we do not believe it is likely that the full contractual amount would be paid if the underlying contracts were canceled prior to maturity. in such cases, we generally are able to negotiate new contracts or cancellation penalties, resulting in a reduced payment. the amounts do not include other contractual purchase obligations that are not take-or-pay arrangements. such contractual purchase obligations are primarily purchase orders at fair value that are part of normal operations and are reflected in historical operating cash flow trends. we do not believe such purchase obligations will adversely affect our liquidity position.
significant accounting policies and estimates in preparing our financial statements in accordance with u.s. gaap, there are certain accounting policies that may require a choice between acceptable accounting methods or may require substantial judgment or estimation in their application. these include income taxes, certain employee benefits and goodwill and intangible assets. we believe these accounting policies, and others set forth in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, should be reviewed as they are integral to understanding the results of operations and financial condition of the company.
the company has discussed the selection of significant accounting policies and the effect of estimates with the audit committee of the company's board of directors.
income taxes our annual tax rate is determined based on our income, statutory tax rates and the tax impacts of items treated differently for tax purposes than for financial reporting purposes. also inherent in determining our annual tax rate are judgments and assumptions regarding the recoverability of certain deferred tax balances, primarily net operating loss and other carryforwards, and our ability to uphold certain tax positions.
realization of net operating losses and other carryforwards is dependent upon generating sufficient taxable income in the appropriate jurisdiction prior to the expiration of the carryforward periods, which involves business plans, planning opportunities and expectations about future outcomes. although realization is not assured, management believes it is more likely than not that our deferred tax assets, net of valuation allowances, will be realized.
we operate in multiple jurisdictions with complex tax policy and regulatory environments. in certain of these jurisdictions, we may take tax positions that management believes are supportable, but are potentially subject to successful challenge by the applicable taxing authority. these interpretational differences with the respective governmental taxing authorities can be impacted by the local economic and fiscal environment.
our operating principles are that our tax structure is based on our business operating model, such that profits are earned in line with the business substance and functions of the various legal entities. however, we may have income tax exposure related to the determination of the appropriate transfer prices the procter & gamble company 27
for our various cross-border transactions. we obtain advance rulings with tax authorities to support our positions, where possible, to help manage these exposures. nonetheless, many of the underlying transactions are subject to audit, resulting in uncertainty until the ultimate audit resolution. we evaluate our tax positions and establish liabilities in accordance with the applicable accounting guidance on uncertainty in income taxes. we review these tax uncertainties in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the progress of tax audits, and adjust them accordingly. we have a number of audits in process in various jurisdictions. although the resolution of these tax positions is uncertain, based on currently available information, we believe that the ultimate outcomes will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
because there are a number of estimates and assumptions inherent in calculating the various components of our tax provision, certain changes or future events such as changes in tax legislation, geographic mix of earnings, completion of tax audits or earnings repatriation plans could have an impact on those estimates and our effective tax rate. for additional details on the company's income taxes, see note 5 to the consolidated financial statements.
employee benefits we sponsor various post-employment benefits throughout the world. these include pension plans, both defined contribution plans and defined benefit plans, and other post-employment benefit (opeb) plans, consisting primarily of health care and life insurance for retirees. for accounting purposes, the defined benefit pension and opeb plans require assumptions to estimate the projected and accumulated benefit obligations, including the following variables: discount rate; expected salary increases; certain employee-related factors, such as turnover, retirement age and mortality; expected return on assets; and health care cost trend rates. these and other assumptions affect the annual expense and obligations recognized for the underlying plans. our assumptions reflect our historical experiences and management's best judgment regarding future expectations. as permitted by u.s. gaap, the net amount by which actual results differ from our assumptions is deferred. if this net deferred amount exceeds 10% of the greater of plan assets or liabilities, a portion of the deferred amount is included in expense for the following year. the cost or benefit of plan changes, such as increasing or decreasing benefits for prior employee service (prior service cost), is deferred and included in expense on a straight-line basis over the average remaining service period of the employees expected to receive benefits.
the expected return on plan assets assumption impacts our defined benefit expense, since many of our defined benefit pension plans and our primary opeb plan are partially funded. the process for setting the expected rates of return is described in note 8 to the consolidated financial statements. for 2016, the average return on assets assumptions for pension plan assets and opeb assets was 7.2% and 8.3%, respectively. a change in the rate of return of 100 basis points for both pension and opeb assets would impact annual after-tax benefit expense by approximately $100 million.
since pension and opeb liabilities are measured on a discounted basis, the discount rate impacts our plan obligations and expenses. discount rates used for our u.s. defined benefit pension and opeb plans are based on a yield curve constructed from a portfolio of high quality bonds for which the timing and amount of cash outflows approximate the estimated payouts of the plan. for our international plans, the discount rates are set by benchmarking against investment grade corporate bonds rated aa or better. the average discount rate on the defined benefit pension plans and opeb plans of 2.1% and 3.6%, respectively, represents a weighted average of local rates in countries where such plans exist. a 100 basis point change in the pension discount rate would impact annual after-tax defined benefit pension expense by approximately $200 million. a change in the opeb discount rate of 100 basis points would impact annual after-tax opeb expense by approximately $86 million. for additional details on our defined benefit pension and opeb plans, see note 8 to the consolidated financial statements.
goodwill and intangible assets significant judgment is required to estimate the fair value of intangible assets and in assigning their respective useful lives. accordingly, we typically obtain the assistance of third-party valuation specialists for significant tangible and intangible assets. the fair value estimates are based on available historical information and on future expectations and assumptions deemed reasonable by management, but are inherently uncertain.
we typically use an income method to estimate the fair value of intangible assets, which is based on forecasts of the expected future cash flows attributable to the respective assets. significant estimates and assumptions inherent in the valuations reflect a consideration of other marketplace participants, and include the amount and timing of future cash flows (including expected growth rates and profitability), the underlying product or technology life cycles, economic barriers to entry, a brand's relative market position and the discount rate applied to the cash flows. unanticipated market or macroeconomic events and circumstances may occur, which could affect the accuracy or validity of the estimates and assumptions.
determining the useful life of an intangible asset also requires judgment. certain brand intangible assets are expected to have indefinite lives based on their history and our plans to continue to support and build the acquired brands. other acquired intangible assets (e.g., certain trademarks or brands, customer relationships, patents and technologies) are expected to have determinable useful lives. our assessment as to brands that have an indefinite life and those that have a determinable life is based on a number of factors including competitive environment, market share, brand history, underlying product life cycles, operating plans and the macroeconomic environment of the countries in which the brands are sold. our estimates of the useful lives of determinable-lived intangible assets are primarily based on these same factors. all of our acquired technology and customer-related intangible assets are expected to have determinable useful lives.
28 the procter & gamble company the costs of determinable-lived intangible assets are amortized to expense over their estimated lives. the value of indefinite-lived intangible assets and residual goodwill is not amortized, but is tested at least annually for impairment. our impairment testing for goodwill is performed separately from our impairment testing of indefinite-lived intangible assets. we test goodwill for impairment by reviewing the book value compared to the fair value at the reporting unit level. we test individual indefinite-lived intangible assets by comparing the book values of each asset to the estimated fair value. we determine the fair value of our reporting units and indefinite-lived intangible assets based on the income approach. under the income approach, we calculate the fair value of our reporting units and indefinite-lived intangible assets based on the present value of estimated future cash flows. considerable management judgment is necessary to evaluate the impact of operating and macroeconomic changes and to estimate future cash flows to measure fair value. assumptions used in our impairment evaluations, such as forecasted growth rates and cost of capital, are consistent with internal projections and operating plans. we believe such assumptions and estimates are also comparable to those that would be used by other marketplace participants.
most of our goodwill reporting units are comprised of a combination of legacy and acquired businesses and as a result have fair value cushions that, at a minimum, exceed two times their underlying carrying values. certain of our continuing goodwill reporting units, in particular shave care and appliances, are comprised entirely of acquired businesses and as a result have fair value cushions that are not as high. while both of these wholly-acquired reporting units have fair value cushions that currently exceed the underlying carrying values, the shave care cushion, as well as certain of the related indefinite-lived intangible assets, have been reduced to below 20% due in large part to significant currency devaluations in a number of countries relative to the u.s. dollar that began in recent years and continued during fiscal 2016. as a result, this unit is more susceptible to impairment risk from adverse changes in business operating plans and macroeconomic environment conditions, including any further significant devaluation of major currencies relative to the u.s. dollar. any such adverse changes in the future could reduce the underlying cash flows used to estimate fair values and could result in a decline in fair value that could trigger future impairment charges of the business unit's goodwill and indefinite-lived intangibles.
the business unit valuations used to test goodwill and intangible assets for impairment are dependent on a number of significant estimates and assumptions, including macroeconomic conditions, overall category growth rates, competitive activities, cost containment and margin expansion and company business plans. we believe these estimates and assumptions are reasonable. changes to, or a failure to, achieve these business plans or a further deterioration of the macroeconomic conditions could result in a valuation that would trigger an impairment of the goodwill and intangible assets of these businesses.
see note 4 to the consolidated financial statements for additional discussion on goodwill and intangible asset impairment testing results.
new accounting pronouncements refer to note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for recently adopted accounting pronouncements and recently issued accounting pronouncements not yet adopted as of june 30, 2016.
other information hedging and derivative financial instruments as a multinational company with diverse product offerings, we are exposed to market risks, such as changes in interest rates, currency exchange rates and commodity prices. we evaluate exposures on a centralized basis to take advantage of natural exposure correlation and netting. except within financing operations, we leverage the company's diversified portfolio of exposures as a natural hedge and prioritize operational hedging activities over financial market instruments. to the extent we choose to further manage volatility associated with the net exposures, we enter into various financial transactions which we account for using the applicable accounting guidance for derivative instruments and hedging activities. these financial transactions are governed by our policies covering acceptable counterparty exposure, instrument types and other hedging practices. see note 9 to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of our accounting policies for derivative instruments.
derivative positions are monitored using techniques including market valuation, sensitivity analysis and value-at-risk modeling. the tests for interest rate, currency rate and commodity derivative positions discussed below are based on the corporatemanagertm value-at-risk model using a one-year horizon and a 95% confidence level. the model incorporates the impact of correlation (the degree to which exposures move together over time) and diversification (from holding multiple currency, commodity and interest rate instruments) and assumes that financial returns are normally distributed. estimates of volatility and correlations of market factors are drawn from the riskmetricstm dataset as of june 30, 2016. in cases where data is unavailable in riskmetricstm, a reasonable proxy is included.
our market risk exposures relative to interest rates, currency rates and commodity prices, as discussed below, have not changed materially versus the previous reporting period. in addition, we are not aware of any facts or circumstances that would significantly impact such exposures in the near term.
interest rate exposure on financial instruments. interest rate swaps are used to hedge exposures to interest rate movement on underlying debt obligations. certain interest rate swaps denominated in foreign currencies are designated to hedge exposures to currency exchange rate movements on our investments in foreign operations. these currency interest rate swaps are designated as hedges of the company's foreign net investments.
based on our interest rate exposure as of and during the year ended june 30, 2016, including derivative and other instruments sensitive to interest rates, we believe a near-term change in interest rates, at a 95% confidence level based on historical interest rate movements, would not materially affect our financial statements.
currency rate exposure on financial instruments. because we manufacture and sell products and finance operations in a number of countries throughout the world, we are exposed to the impact on revenue and expenses of movements in currency exchange rates. corporate policy prescribes the range of allowable hedging activity. to manage the exchange rate risk associated with the financing of our operations, we primarily use forward contracts with maturities of less than 18 months. in addition, we enter into certain currency swaps with maturities of up to five years to hedge our exposure to exchange rate movements on intercompany financing transactions.
based on our currency rate exposure on derivative and other instruments as of and during the year ended june 30, 2016, we believe, at a 95% confidence level based on historical currency rate movements, the impact on such instruments of a near-term change in currency rates would not materially affect our financial statements.
commodity price exposure on financial instruments. we use raw materials that are subject to price volatility caused by weather, supply conditions, political and economic variables and other unpredictable factors. we may use futures, options and swap contracts to manage the volatility related to the above exposures.
as of and during the years ended june 30, 2016 and june 30, 2015, we did not have any commodity hedging activity.
measures not defined by u.s. gaap our discussion of financial results includes several "non-gaap" financial measures. we believe that these measures provide useful perspective of underlying business trends (i.e. trends excluding non-recurring or unusual items) and results and provide a supplemental measure of year-on-year results. the non-gaap measures described below are used by management in making operating decisions, allocating financial resources and for business strategy purposes. these measures may be useful to investors as they provide supplemental information about business performance and provide investors a view of our business results through the eyes of management. these measures are also used to evaluate senior management and are a factor in determining their at-risk compensation. these non-gaap measures are not intended to be considered by the user in place of the related gaap measure, but rather as supplemental information to our business results. these non-gaap measures may not be the same as similar measures used by other companies due to possible differences in method and in the items or events being adjusted. these measures include:
organic sales growth. organic sales growth is a non-gaap measure of sales growth excluding the impacts of the venezuela deconsolidation, acquisitions, divestitures and foreign exchange from year-over-year comparisons. we believe this measure provides investors with a supplemental understanding of underlying sales trends by providing sales growth on a consistent basis, and this measure is used in assessing achievement of management goals for at-risk compensation.
the following tables provide a numerical reconciliation of organic sales growth to reported net sales growth:

*   acquisition/divestiture impact also includes the impact of the venezuela deconsolidation and the rounding impacts necessary to reconcile net sales to organic sales.
core eps. core eps is a measure of the company's diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations adjusted as indicated. management views these non-gaap measures as a useful supplemental measure of company performance over time. the table below provides a reconciliation of revised diluted net earnings per share to core eps, including the following reconciling items:
•   incremental restructuring: while the company has and continues to have an ongoing level of restructuring activities, beginning in 2012 we began a $10 billion strategic productivity and cost savings initiative that includes incremental restructuring activities. this results in incremental restructuring charges to accelerate productivity efforts and cost savings. the charges include only the incremental portion of the restructuring costs.

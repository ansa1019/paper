•   critical accounting policies and estimates overview and outlook we are the largest producer of quality chocolate in north america and a global leader in chocolate and non-chocolate confectionery. we market, sell and distribute our products under more than 80 brand names in approximately 70 countries worldwide. we report our operations through two segments: north america and international and other.
in 2016, we made good progress against our strategic objectives, including a focus on our consumer brand engagement and continued refinement of our mix of marketing investments. these initiatives, as well as improved analytics, operating efficiencies and new information technology capabilities, strengthened our business model and positioned the company for future growth. we continued to generate solid operating cash flow, totaling approximately $1 billion in 2016, which affords the company significant financial flexibility. we are also in the process of conducting a strategic review of our global cost structure that we believe will result in solid gross and earnings before interest and taxes ("ebit") margin expansion once executed.
our 2016 marketplace performance was similar to the slower growth experienced by other consumer packaged goods ("cpg") companies. additionally, the u.s. candy, mint and gum ("cmg") category and manufacturers were impacted by a shorter easter season and merchandising and display strategies at select customers.  for the full year, u.s. cmg retail takeaway increased 0.4%, lower than the historical average. our u.s. cmg market share performance improved in the second half of 2016, resulting in full year market share of 31.2%, including barkthins, which is approximately in line with the prior year. for the full year 2016, our u.s. market share, including cmg, salty snacks, snack bars, meat snacks, grocery items and barkthins, increased approximately 10 basis points.
our full year 2016 net sales totaled $7,440.2 million, an increase of 0.7% versus $7,386.6 million in 2015. excluding a 0.7% impact from unfavorable foreign exchange rates, our net sales increased 1.4%. the increase was driven by higher north america volumes, largely in products supported by increased promotional programming such as ncaa march madness, the summer olympics and ncaa football college game day, as well as new product innovation such as snack mix, snack bites and hershey's cookie layer crunch bars. additionally, our consolidated net sales for the year ended december 31, 2016 included approximately $35.6 million attributed to barkthins. our full year 2016 net income and earnings per share-diluted (eps) increased 40.4% and 44.0%, respectively, compared to 2015 results, which were impacted by significant goodwill impairment charges. excluding these goodwill impairment charges in 2015 and other items impacting comparability in both periods (as defined in the non-gaap information section of this md&a), 2016 adjusted net income increased 4.3%, reflecting the benefits from continued productivity and cost savings initiatives and a lower effective income tax rate, while adjusted eps-diluted also benefited from recent share buybacks, increasing a total of 7.0%.
for 2017, we expect net sales growth of approximately 2% to 3%, which includes a 0.5% net benefit from acquisitions and a 0.25% unfavorable impact from foreign currency exchange rates. excluding the unfavorable impact from
foreign currency exchange rates, our net sales are expected to increase approximately 2.25% to 3.25%. our focus is on the continued rollout of hershey's cookie layer crunch bars, barkthins chocolate distribution gains and other new products such as reese's crunchers candy and krave meat bars and sticks. we anticipate that these investments and related consumer marketing plans will accelerate our north america sales growth versus 2016 performance, which should enable us to outpace the broader food group in this challenging operating environment. our previously discussed productivity and cost savings programs are on track, and we will continue to focus on reducing non-essential spending going into 2017. additionally, our effective tax rate is expected to be favorable versus 2016 driven by a favorable international tax mix, tax credits and other incentives, and the adoption of accounting standards update 2016-09, compensation-stock compensation (topic 718): improvements to employee share-based payment accounting. as a result, we expect full year 2017 reported eps-diluted, prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america ("gaap"), to improve and be in the $4.54 to $4.65 range. from a non-gaap perspective, we currently expect 2017 adjusted eps-diluted to increase approximately 7% to 9% and to be in the $4.72 to $4.81 range. a reconciliation of reported to adjusted projections for 2017 are reflected in the non-gaap reconciliations that follow.
non-gaap information the comparability of certain of our financial measures is impacted by unallocated mark-to-market losses on commodity derivatives, costs associated with business realignment activities, costs relating to the integration of acquisitions, non-service related components of our pension expense (income) ("nsrpe(i)"), goodwill and other intangible asset impairment charges, settlement of the sgm liability in conjunction with the purchase of the remaining 20% of the outstanding shares of sgm, the gain realized on the sale of a trademark, costs associated with the early extinguishment of debt and other non-recurring gains and losses.
to provide additional information to investors to facilitate the comparison of past and present performance, we use non-gaap financial measures within md&a that exclude the financial impact of these activities. these non-gaap financial measures are used internally by management in evaluating results of operations and determining incentive compensation, and in assessing the impact of known trends and uncertainties on our business, but they are not intended to replace the presentation of financial results in accordance with gaap. a reconciliation of the non-gaap financial measures referenced in md&a to their nearest comparable gaap financial measures as presented in the consolidated statements of income is provided below.

in the assessment of our results, we review and discuss the following financial metrics that are derived from the reported and non-gaap financial measures presented above:
as reported operating profit margin    16.2   %             14.0      %          18.8      %
non-gaap operating profit margin (2)   20.4   %             20.0      %          19.6      %
(1)   calculated as non-gaap gross profit as a percentage of net sales for each period presented.
(2)   calculated as non-gaap operating profit as a percentage of net sales for each period presented.
(3)   calculated as non-gaap provision for income taxes as a percentage of non-gaap income before taxes (calculated as non-gaap operating profit minus non-gaap interest expense, net plus or minus non-gaap other (income) expense, net).
details of the activities impacting comparability that are presented as reconciling items to derive the non-gaap financial measures in the tables above are as follows:
mark-to-market losses on commodity derivatives commensurate with our discontinuance of hedge accounting treatment for commodity derivatives, we are adjusting the mark-to-market losses on such commodity derivatives, until such time as the related inventory is sold. since we often purchase commodity contracts to price inventory requirements in future years, we make this adjustment to facilitate the year-over-year comparison of cost of sales on a basis that matches the derivative gains and losses with the underlying economic exposure being hedged for the period. for the year ended december 31, 2016, unallocated mark-to-market losses on commodity derivatives totaled $163.2 million.
business realignment activities we periodically undertake restructuring and cost reduction activities as part of ongoing efforts to enhance long-term profitability. for the years ended december 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, we incurred $107.6 million, $121.0 million and $34.3 million, respectively, of pre-tax costs related to business realignment activities. see note 7 to the consolidated financial statements for more information.
acquisition integration costs for the year ended december 31, 2016, we incurred expenses totaling $6.5 million related to integration of the 2016 acquisition of ripple brand collective, llc, as we incorporated this business into our operating practices and information systems. for the year ended december 31, 2015, we incurred costs related to the integration of the 2014 acquisitions of sgm and the allan candy company and the 2015 acquisition of krave totaling $22.5 million as we incorporated these businesses into our operating practices and information systems. these 2015 expenses included charges incurred to write-down approximately $6.4 million of expired or near-expiration work-in-process inventory at sgm, in connection with the implementation of our global quality standards and practices. in addition, integration costs for 2015 were offset by a $6.8 million reduction in the fair value of contingent consideration paid to the krave shareholders. for the year ended december 31, 2014, we incurred costs of $13.3 million largely related to the acquisition of sgm, offset by a $4.6 million gain relating to the acquisition of a controlling interest in lotte shanghai foods co., ltd.
non-service related pension expense (income)
nsrpe(i) includes interest costs, the expected return on pension plan assets, the amortization of actuarial gains and losses, and certain curtailment and settlement losses or credits. nsrpe(i) can fluctuate from year to year as a result of changes in market interest rates and market returns on pension plan assets. we believe that the service cost component of our total pension benefit costs closely reflects the operating costs of our business and provides for a better comparison of our operating results from year to year. therefore, we exclude nsrpe(i) from our internal performance measures. our most significant defined benefit pension plans were closed to most new participants in 2007, resulting in ongoing service costs that are stable and predictable. we recorded pre-tax nsrpe(i) of $27.2 million, $18.1 million and $(1.8) million for the years ended december 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.
settlement of sgm liability in the fourth quarter of 2015, we reached an agreement with the sgm selling shareholders to reduce the originally-agreed purchase price for the remaining 20% of sgm, and we completed the purchase on february 3, 2016. in the first quarter of 2016, we recorded a $26.7 million gain relating to the settlement of the sgm liability, representing the net carrying amount of the recorded liability in excess of the cash paid to settle the obligation for the remaining 20% of the outstanding shares.
goodwill and other intangible asset impairment as discussed in note 3 to the consolidated financial statements, in connection with our 2016 annual impairment testing of other indefinite lived assets, we recognized a trademark impairment charge of $4.2 million primarily resulting from plans to discontinue a brand sold in india. in the second and third quarters of 2015, we recorded a total $280.8 million non-cash goodwill impairment charge, representing a write-down of all of the goodwill resulting from the sgm acquisition, including $14.4 million relating to the portion of goodwill that had been allocated to our china chocolate reporting unit, based on synergies to be realized by this business. for the year ended december 31, 2014, we recorded non-cash goodwill and other intangible asset impairment charges totaling $15.9 million associated with our business in india.
loss on early extinguishment of debt during the third quarter of 2015, we recorded a $28.3 million loss on the early extinguishment of debt relating to a cash tender offer. see note 4 to the consolidated financial statements for further information.
gain on sale of trademark during the first quarter of 2015, we recorded a $9.9 million gain relating to the sale of a non-core trademark.
constant currency net sales growth we present certain percentage changes in net sales on a constant currency basis, which excludes the impact of foreign currency exchange.  this measure is used internally by management in evaluating results of operations and determining incentive compensation.  we believe that this measure provides useful information to investors because it provides transparency to underlying performance in our net sales by excluding the effect that foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations have on the year-to-year comparability given volatility in foreign currency exchange markets.
to present this information for historical periods, current period net sales for entities reporting in other than the u.s. dollar are translated into u.s. dollars at the average monthly exchange rates in effect during the corresponding period of the prior fiscal year, rather than at the actual average monthly exchange rates in effect during the current period of the current fiscal year. as a result, the foreign currency impact is equal to the current year results in local currencies multiplied by the change in average foreign currency exchange rate between the current fiscal period and the corresponding period of the prior fiscal year.

our 2017 projected eps-diluted, as presented above, does not include the impact of mark-to-market gains and losses on our commodity derivative contracts. due to the volatility of commodity market prices, it is not possible to forecast this mark-to-market impact. pursuant to our revised accounting policy for commodity derivatives as discussed in note 5 to the consolidated financial statements, we currently reflect changes in the fair value of our commodity derivatives as incurred within cost of goods sold, with an adjustment within our corporate unallocated expenses to enable us to present the gains and losses on commodity derivatives within our segment income at the time the related inventory is sold.

net sales increased 0.7% in 2016 compared with 2015, reflecting volume increases of 0.8% and a 0.6% benefit from net acquisitions and divestitures, partially offset by an unfavorable impact from foreign currency exchange rates of 0.7%. excluding foreign currency, our net sales increased 1.4% in 2016. the volume improvement was primarily driven by new chocolate and snacking products in the united states, including snack mix, snack bites and hershey's cookie layer crunch bars. while the north america segment had unfavorable price realization due to increased levels of trade promotional spending, this was essentially offset by favorable price realization in the international and other segment, due to significantly lower levels of trade spending and returns, discounts and allowances.
net sales decreased 0.5% in 2015 compared with 2014, reflecting volume declines of 3.4% and an unfavorable impact from foreign currency exchange rates of 1.6%, substantially offset by favorable net price realization of 3.5% as well as a 1.0% benefit from net acquisitions and divestitures. the favorable net price realization, primarily in the united states, was attributed to the price increase announced in mid-2014. the volume declines were attributed to volume elasticity relating to the pricing action in the united states as well as lower everyday product sales given the challenging shopper environment in north america, coupled with lower sales in china. excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange rates, our net sales increased 1.1% in 2015.

the consumer takeaway and market share information provided above are for measured channels of distribution accounting for approximately 90% of our u.s. confectionery retail business. these channels of distribution primarily include food, drug, mass merchandisers and convenience store channels, plus wal-mart stores, inc., partial dollar, club and military channels. these metrics are based on measured market scanned purchases as reported by nielsen and provide a means to assess our retail takeaway and market position relative to the overall category.
the amounts presented above are solely for the u.s. cmg category which does not include revenue from our snack mixes and grocery items. for the full year 2016, our cmg market share, including barkthins was 31.2%, about the same as 2015. including barkthins, cmg, salty snacks, snack bars, meat snacks and grocery items, our full year u.s. market share increased approximately 10 basis points.
cost of sales and gross margin
cost of sales increased 7.0% in 2016 compared with 2015. incremental business realignment costs and mark-to-market losses on commodity derivative instruments increased cost of sales by 5.3%, while the remaining increase was primarily attributed to higher volume and higher supply chain costs, in part due to higher manufacturing variances and some incremental fixed costs related to the commencement of manufacturing in the malaysia facility. as described in note 5 to the consolidated financial statements, our commodity derivative instruments are no longer designated for hedge accounting treatment and, as a result, the changes in fair market value are recognized currently in cost of sales.
gross margin decreased by 340 basis points in 2016 compared with 2015. mark-to-market losses on commodity derivative instruments and incremental depreciation expense related to business realignment activities drove a 300 basis point decline in gross margin. higher trade promotional spending and supply chain costs also contributed to the decreased gross margin, but were partially offset by supply chain productivity and cost savings initiatives. on a non-gaap basis, excluding the losses on commodity derivative instruments as well as business realignment costs, 2016 adjusted gross margin decreased by 40 basis points.
cost of sales decreased 2.0% in 2015 compared with 2014. supply chain productivity and volume declines reduced cost of sales by approximately 6.6%. these declines were substantially offset by higher supply chain and commodity costs, and unfavorable sales mix, which together increased total cost of sales by approximately 4.1%. in addition, cost of sales was impacted by acquisition and integration costs of $7.3 million, business realignment costs of $8.8 million and nsrpe of $2.5 million, which collectively increased cost of sales by approximately 0.5%. in comparison, cost of sales benefited by $1.1 million in 2014, primarily due to nsrpi.
gross margin increased by 80 basis points in 2015 compared with 2014. favorable net price realization as well as supply chain productivity and other cost savings initiatives collectively improved gross margin by 330 basis points. however, these benefits were substantially offset by higher supply chain and commodity costs as well as unfavorable sales mix, which collectively reduced gross margin by approximately 250 basis points. on a non-gaap basis, excluding the business realignment and acquisition and integration charges, 2015 gross margin increased by 110 basis points.
selling, marketing and administrative
selling, marketing and administrative ("sm&a") expenses decreased $53.9 million or 2.7% in 2016. advertising and related consumer marketing expense decreased 4.0% during this period. we spent less on advertising and related consumer marketing in our international and other segment, particularly in the china market, and our spending in north america declined as our marketing mix models were weighted toward higher trade promotional spending. excluding these advertising and related consumer marketing costs, selling and administrative expenses for 2016 decreased by 2.0% as compared to 2015 as a result of our continued focus on reducing non-essential spending. sm&a expenses in 2016 were also impacted by business realignment costs of $18.6 million, nsrpe of $15.2 million and acquisition and integration costs of $6.5 million. in 2015, sm&a expenses included business realignment costs of $17.4 million, nsrpe of $15.6 million and acquisition and integration costs of $13.6 million.
sm&a expenses increased $70.9 million or 3.7% in 2015. advertising and related consumer marketing expense increased 1.0% during this period. excluding these advertising and related consumer marketing costs, selling and administrative expenses for 2015 increased by 6.7% compared to 2014, driven by incremental increases from acquired businesses. excluding the impact of acquisition costs, sm&a expenses for 2015 declined as a result of our continued focus on reducing non-essential spending. sm&a expenses in 2015 were also impacted by charges of $13.6 million attributed to the productivity initiative we announced in june 2015, acquisition and integration costs of $13.6 million, nsrpe of $15.6 million and other business realignment costs of $3.7 million. in 2014, sm&a expenses included acquisition and integration costs of $12.4 million, other business realignment costs of $2.9 million and nsrpe of $0.9 million.
goodwill and other intangible asset impairment charges in 2016, in connection with the annual impairment testing of indefinite lived intangible assets, we recognized a trademark impairment charge of $4.2 million, primarily resulting from plans to discontinue a brand sold in india.
as discussed in note 3 to the consolidated financial statements, the sgm business performed below expectations throughout 2015, with net sales and earnings levels well below pre-acquisition levels. as of result of this declining performance, in the second quarter of 2015 we recorded an estimated goodwill impairment charge of $249.8 million relating to the sgm reporting unit. during the third quarter of 2015, we updated our estimates of the acquisition-date fair values of the net assets acquired, which increased the value of acquired goodwill by $16.6 million. we also finalized the impairment test of the goodwill relating to the sgm reporting unit, which resulted in an additional $16.6 million write-off of this increase to goodwill. during the third quarter of 2015, we also wrote off $14.4 million of goodwill that resulted from the sgm acquisition and was assigned to our existing china chocolate business, as this reporting unit was expected to benefit from acquisition synergies relating to the sale of golden monkey-branded product through its tier 1 and hypermarket distributor networks. this goodwill impairment was driven by the continued declining performance in our china chocolate business through the third quarter of 2015, as a result of the macroeconomic challenges mentioned previously, as well as changing consumer shopping behavior in china.
in 2014, the annual impairment testing of our india reporting unit resulted in a $11.4 million goodwill impairment charge and a $4.5 million write-down of a trademark associated with the india business. these impairment charges were largely a result of our decision at the time to exit the oils portion of the india business and realign our approach to regional marketing and distribution in india.
the assessment of the valuation of goodwill and other long-lived assets is based on management estimates and assumptions, as discussed in our critical accounting policies included in item 7 of this annual report on form 10-k. these estimates and assumptions are subject to change due to changing economic and competitive conditions.
business realignment activities we are currently pursuing several business realignment activities designed to increase our efficiency and focus our business behind key growth strategies. costs recorded for business realignment activities during 2016, 2015 and 2014 and their classification within the statements of income are as follows:
in millions of dollars operational optimization program:
2015 productivity initiative:
operational optimization program in the second quarter of 2016, we commenced a program (the "operational optimization program") to optimize our production and supply chain network, which includes select facility consolidations. the program encompasses the continued transition of our china chocolate and sgm operations into a united golden hershey platform, including the integration of the china sales force, as well as workforce planning efforts and the consolidation of production within certain facilities in china and north america.
we have incurred pre-tax costs of $88 million to date, including non-cash asset-related incremental depreciation costs, severance and employee benefit costs, costs to consolidate and relocate production, and third-party costs incurred to execute these activities. we currently expect to incur additional cash costs of approximately $37 million over the next two years to complete this program. the operational optimization program is expected to drive annual savings of approximately $52 million by 2018.
2015 productivity initiative in mid-2015, we initiated a productivity initiative (the "2015 productivity initiative") intended to move decision making closer to the customer and the consumer, to enable a more enterprise-wide approach to innovation, to more swiftly advance our knowledge agenda, and to provide for a more efficient cost structure, while ensuring that we effectively allocate resources to future growth areas. overall, the 2015 productivity initiative was undertaken to simplify the organizational structure to enhance the company's ability to rapidly anticipate and respond to the changing demands of the global consumer.
the 2015 productivity initiative was executed throughout the third and fourth quarters of 2015, resulting in a net reduction of approximately 300 positions, with the majority of the departures taking place by the end of 2015. for the year ended december 31, 2016, we incurred charges totaling $19.3 million, consisting of pension settlement charges, adjustments to estimated severance benefits and incremental third-party costs related to the design and implementation of the new organizational structure. the 2015 productivity initiative was completed during the third quarter of 2016. we incurred total costs of $125.0 million relating to this initiative, including pension settlement charges of $13.7 million recorded in 2016 and $10.2 million recorded in 2015 relating to lump sum withdrawals by employees retiring
or leaving the company as a result of this initiative. we have realized approximately $82 million in savings since inception of the 2015 productivity initiative.
other international restructuring programs other costs incurred in connection with business realignment activities for the year ended december 31, 2015 related principally to accelerated depreciation and amortization and employee severance costs for multiple programs commenced in 2014 to rationalize certain non-u.s. manufacturing and distribution activities and to establish our own sales and distribution teams in brazil in connection with our acquisition of the remaining 49% interest in hershey do brasil ltda. under a cooperative agreement with pandurata netherlands b.v. ("bauducco").
mauna loa divestiture in december 2014, we entered into an agreement to sell the mauna loa macadamia nut corporation ("mauna loa"). as a result of the expected sale, in 2014 we recorded an estimated loss on the anticipated sale of $22.3 million to reflect the disposal entity at fair value, less an estimate of the selling costs. the sale, completed in the first quarter of 2015, resulted in an additional loss on sale of $2.7 million based on updates to the selling expenses and tax benefits.
project next century the 2014 costs shown relate primarily to the demolition of the company's former manufacturing facility, representing the final phase of the project next century program. as of december 31, 2014, we have concluded project next century.
segment operating results do not include business realignment and related costs, as these initiatives are generally centrally managed and are not included within our internal measures of segment performance.
operating profit and operating profit margin
operating profit increased 16.2% in 2016 compared with 2015 due primarily to lower goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges, lower sm&a costs and lower business realignment costs, offset in part by the lower gross profit. operating profit margin increased to 16.2% in 2016 from 14.0% in 2015 due primarily to these same factors.
on a non-gaap basis, 2016 operating profit and operating profit margin increased 2.4% and 40 basis points, respectively, reflecting the reduction in total sm&a costs, including advertising and related consumer marketing, offset in part by higher trade promotional spending.
operating profit decreased 25.5% in 2015 compared with 2014 due primarily to the goodwill impairment charges, higher sm&a costs related to acquisitions as well as higher business realignment costs, offset in part by the higher gross profit. operating profit margin decreased to 14.0% in 2015 from 18.8% in 2014 due to the goodwill impairment charges, higher sm&a expenses as a percent of sales, and higher business realignment costs.
on a non-gaap basis, 2015 operating profit and operating profit margin increased 1.8% and 40 basis points, respectively.
net interest expense was $15.6 million lower in 2016 than in 2015, as the 2015 amount included the premium paid to repurchase long-term debt as part of a cash tender offer. this decrease was partially offset by lower capitalized interest expense and lower interest income.
net interest expense was $22.3 million higher in 2015 than in 2014 due primarily to the premium paid to repurchase long-term debt as part of a cash tender offer. this increase was partially offset by higher capitalized interest expense coupled with savings resulting from fixed-to-floating interest rate swap agreements put in place toward the end of 2014.
other (income) expense, net was $13.9 million lower in 2016 than 2015, due primarily to the $26.7 million settlement of the sgm liability in 2016, partially offset by an increase in the write-down of equity investments qualifying for federal historic and energy tax credits.
other (income) expense, net was $27.4 million higher in 2015 than 2014, due primarily to the write-down of equity investments qualifying for federal historic and energy tax credits, partially offset by the gain on the sale of a non-core trademark.
our effective income tax rate was 34.5% for 2016 compared with 43.1% for 2015. the 2015 tax rate was significantly impacted by the non-deductible goodwill impairment charges. excluding the impact of the goodwill impairment and other non-gaap charges, the 2016 effective income tax rate was 190 basis points lower than the 2015 rate. the 2016 non-gaap rate reflects greater benefit from manufacturing deductions, research and development and investment tax credits, and a favorable foreign rate differential relating to our cocoa procurement operations.
our effective income tax rate was 43.1% for 2015 compared with 35.2% for 2014. the 2015 tax rate was significantly impacted by the non-deductible goodwill impairment charges. excluding the impact of the goodwill impairment and other non-gaap charges, the 2015 effective income tax rate was 130 basis points lower than the 2014 rate. the 2015 rate benefited from tax credits realized from the investment tax strategy initiated in the second quarter of 2015, which was partially offset by the valuation allowance recorded against the sgm net operating loss carryforwards.
net income increased $207.0 million, or 40.4%, while eps-diluted increased $1.02, or 44.0%, in 2016 compared with 2015. the increases in both net income and eps-diluted were driven by the lower goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges, lower sm&a costs and lower business realignment costs, as noted above. our 2016 eps-diluted also benefited from lower weighted-average shares outstanding as a result of share repurchases pursuant to our board-approved repurchase programs.
net income decreased $333.9 million, or 39.4%, while eps-diluted decreased $1.45, or 38.5%, in 2015 compared with 2014. the decreases in both net income and eps-diluted were driven by the goodwill impairment charges, higher sm&a costs related to acquisitions and higher business realignment costs, as noted above. our 2015 eps-diluted benefited from lower weighted-average shares outstanding as a result of share repurchases pursuant to our board-approved repurchase programs.
segment results the summary that follows provides a discussion of the results of operations of our two reportable segments: north america and international and other. the segments reflect our operations on a geographic basis. for segment reporting purposes, we use "segment income" to evaluate segment performance and allocate resources. segment income excludes unallocated general corporate administrative expenses, unallocated mark-to-market gains and losses on commodity derivatives, business realignment and impairment charges, acquisition integration costs, nsrpe(i) and other unusual gains or losses that are not part of our measurement of segment performance. these items of our operating income are largely managed centrally at the corporate level and are excluded from the measure of segment income reviewed by the codm and used for resource allocation and internal management reporting and performance evaluation. segment income and segment income margin, which are presented in the segment discussion that follows, are non-gaap measures and do not purport to be alternatives to operating income as a measure of operating performance. we believe that these measures are useful to investors and other users of our financial information in evaluating ongoing operating profitability as well as in evaluating operating performance in relation to our competitors, as they exclude the activities that are not integral to our ongoing operations. for further information, see the non-gaap information section of this md&a.

north america the north america segment is responsible for our chocolate and non-chocolate confectionery market position, as well as our grocery and growing snacks market positions, in the united states and canada. this includes developing and growing our business in chocolate and non-chocolate confectionery, pantry, food service and other snacking product lines. north america accounted for 87.8%, 87.6% and 85.6% of our net sales in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. north america results for the years ended december 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 were as follows:
percent / point change for the years ended december 31,                  2016                  2015                  2014          2016 vs 2015             2015 vs 2014
in millions of dollars net sales                                 $6,533.0              $6,468.1              $6,352.7              1.0        %             1.8        %
net sales of our north america segment increased $64.9 million or 1.0% in 2016 compared to 2015, reflecting volume increases of 1.4% and the favorable net impact of acquisitions and divestitures of 0.7%, partially offset by unfavorable net price realization of 0.9% and an unfavorable impact from foreign currency exchange rates that reduced net sales by
approximately 0.2%. our 2016 north america performance was similar to the slower growth experienced by other cpg companies. additionally, the u.s. cmg category and manufacturers were impacted by a shorter easter season and merchandising and display strategies at select customers. the segment's volume increase was primarily attributable to new product introductions, partially offset by lower everyday product sales. the unfavorable net price realization resulted from increased levels of trade promotional spending necessary to support higher levels of in-store merchandising and display activity. our canada operations were impacted by the stronger u.s. dollar, which drove the unfavorable foreign currency impact.
our north america segment income decreased $33.0 million or 1.6% in 2016 compared to 2015, driven by lower gross margin as higher trade promotional spending and higher supply chain costs were only partially offset by the benefit from supply chain productivity and cost savings initiatives.
net sales of our north america segment increased $115.4 million or 1.8% in 2015 compared to 2014, reflecting net price realization of 4.8% and the favorable net impact of acquisitions and divestitures of 0.3%, substantially offset by volume declines of 2.5% and an unfavorable impact from foreign currency exchange rates that reduced net sales by approximately 0.8%. the volume decline was due to elasticity related to the 2014 pricing action as well as lower everyday product sales, which were impacted by changing consumer shopping habits, such as channel shifting and e-commerce, an increase in competitive activity and a proliferation of broader snacking options in the marketplace. our canada operations were impacted by the stronger u.s. dollar, which drove the unfavorable foreign currency impact.
our north america segment income increased $157.8 million or 8.2% in 2015 compared to 2014, driven by gross margin expansion, primarily due to favorable price realization and supply chain productivity, which offset volume declines and input cost increases.
international and other the international and other segment includes all other countries where we currently manufacture, import, market, sell or distribute chocolate and non-chocolate confectionery and other products. currently, this includes our operations in china and other asia markets, latin america, europe, africa and the middle east, along with exports to these regions. while a less significant component, this segment also includes our global retail operations, including hershey's chocolate world stores in hershey, pennsylvania, new york city, las vegas, shanghai, niagara falls (ontario), dubai and singapore, as well as operations associated with licensing the use of certain trademarks and products to third parties around the world. international and other accounted for 12.2%, 12.4% and 14.4% of our net sales in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. international and other results for the years ended december 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 were as follows:
percent / point change for the years ended december 31,   2016                 2015                                2014   2016 vs 2015             2015 vs 2014
in millions of dollars net sales                                 $907.2               $918.5               $1,069.1       (1.2     )%              (14.1    )%
net sales of our international and other segment decreased $11.3 million or 1.2% in 2016 compared to 2015, reflecting an unfavorable impact from foreign currency exchange rates of 4.4%, volume declines of 3.7% and the unfavorable impact of net acquisitions and divestitures of 0.1%, substantially offset by favorable net price realization of 7.0%. excluding the unfavorable impact of foreign currency exchange rates, the net sales of our international and other segment increased by approximately 3.2%.
the favorable net price realization was driven by lower direct trade expense as well as lower returns, discounts and allowances in china, which declined significantly compared to the prior year. the volume decrease primarily related to lower sales in india due to the discontinuance of the edible oil business as well as lower sales in our global retail and licensing business, partially offset by net sales increases in latin america and select export markets. constant
currency net sales in mexico and brazil increased on a combined basis by approximately 13%, driven by solid chocolate marketplace performance.
our international and other segment loss decreased $69.0 million in 2016 compared to 2015. combined income in latin america and export markets improved versus the prior year and performance in china benefited from lower direct trade and returns, discounts and allowances that were significantly lower than the prior year.
net sales of our international and other segment decreased $150.6 million or 14.1% in 2015 compared to 2014, reflecting volume declines of 9.0%, an unfavorable impact from foreign currency exchange rates of 6.2% and unfavorable net price realization of 4.0%, partially offset by incremental revenue from the acquisition of sgm representing an increase of 5.1% to 2015 net sales. excluding the unfavorable impact of foreign currency exchange rates, the net sales of our international and other segment declined approximately 7.9%.
the net sales decline was driven by volume declines in our china chocolate business. in 2015, chocolate category growth in china was flat relative to the prior year; however our 2015 chocolate retail takeaway in china declined by 11%, resulting in a market share decline in china of 1.1%.
performance in our focus markets of mexico and brazil improved and, on a constant currency basis, net sales in 2015 in these countries increased by approximately 6% and 3%, respectively, versus 2014. constant currency net sales in india declined in 2015, primarily due to the planned discontinuance of edible oil products.
our international and other segment loss was $98.1 million in 2015 compared to segment income of $40.0 million in 2014. the decline was primarily attributable to lower net sales of chocolate products in china, coupled with losses at sgm as that business was also impacted by the uncertain macroeconomic conditions in china as well as incremental integration-related costs.
unallocated corporate expense unallocated corporate expense includes centrally-managed (a) corporate functional costs relating to legal, treasury, finance and human resources, (b) expenses associated with the oversight and administration of our global operations, including warehousing, distribution and manufacturing, information systems and global shared services, (c) non-cash stock-based compensation expense and (d) other gains or losses that are not integral to segment performance.
unallocated corporate expense totaled $497.4 million in both 2016 and 2015. savings realized in 2016 from our productivity and cost savings initiatives were offset by higher employee-related costs and an increase in corporate depreciation and amortization. as compared to 2014 unallocated corporate expense of $503.2 million, the reduction in 2015 expense was driven primarily by the implementation of the 2015 productivity initiative discussed previously.
financial condition we assess our liquidity in terms of our ability to generate cash to fund our operating, investing and financing activities. significant factors affecting liquidity include cash flows generated from operating activities, capital expenditures, acquisitions, dividends, repurchases of outstanding shares, the adequacy of available commercial paper and bank lines of credit, and the ability to attract long-term capital with satisfactory terms. we generate substantial cash from operations and remain in a strong financial position, with sufficient liquidity available for capital reinvestment, payment of dividends and strategic acquisitions.
cash flow summary the following table is derived from our consolidated statement of cash flows:
in millions of dollars                                         2016                2015                  2014

operating activities our principal source of liquidity is operating cash flows. our net income and, consequently, our cash provided by operations are impacted by sales volume, seasonal sales patterns, timing of new product introductions, profit margins and price changes. sales are typically higher during the third and fourth quarters of the year due to seasonal and holiday-related sales patterns. generally, working capital needs peak during the summer months. we meet these needs primarily with cash on hand, bank borrowings or the issuance of commercial paper.
cash provided by operating activities in 2016 decreased $231.0 million relative to 2015. this decrease was driven by the following factors:
•   working capital (comprised of trade accounts receivable, inventory, accounts payable and accrued liabilities) consumed cash of $37 million in 2016, while it generated cash of $57 million in 2015. this $94 million fluctuation was mainly driven by an $87 million payment to settle an interest rate swap in connection with the issuance of new debt in august 2016.
•   prepaid expenses and other current assets consumed cash of $43 million in 2016, while they generated cash of $118 million in 2015. this $161 million fluctuation was mainly driven by higher payments on commodity futures contracts in 2016 as the market price of cocoa declined, versus receipts in the 2015 period. as noted previously, we utilize commodity futures contracts to economically manage the risk of future price fluctuations associated with our purchase of raw materials.
•   net income adjusted for non-cash charges to operations (including depreciation, amortization, stock-based compensation, excess tax benefit from stock-based compensation, deferred income taxes, goodwill and other intangible asset charges, write-down of equity investments, the gain on settlement of the sgm liability and other charges) decreased cash flow by $34 million in 2016 relative to 2015.
cash provided by operating activities in 2015 increased $370.1 million relative to 2014. this increase was driven by the following factors:
•   working capital (comprised of trade accounts receivable, inventory, accounts payable and accrued liabilities) generated cash of $57 million in 2015, while it consumed cash of $215 million in 2014. this fluctuation was mainly driven by lower inventory purchases in the 2015 period, since certain raw material inventory had been built up at the preceding year-end to take advantage of favorable pricing.
•   prepaid expenses and other current assets generated cash of $118 million in 2015, while they consumed cash of $7 million in 2014. this $125 million fluctuation was mainly driven by our hedging activities, which favorably impacted cash flow by $55 million in 2015 versus an unfavorable impact of $78 million in 2014, due principally to market gains and losses on our commodity futures contracts. our cash receipts typically increase when futures market prices are increasing.
•   2015 cash flow was favorably impacted by approximately $30 million from the timing of tax payments in 2015 compared to 2014.
pension and post-retirement activity. we recorded net periodic benefit costs of $72.8 million, $66.8 million and $37.3 million in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively, relating to our benefit plans (including our defined benefit and
other post retirement plans). the main drivers of fluctuations in expense from year to year are assumptions in formulating our long-term estimates, including discount rates used to value plan obligations, expected returns on plan assets, the service and interest costs and the amortization of actuarial gains and losses.
the funded status of our qualified defined benefit pension plans is dependent upon many factors, including returns on invested assets, the level of market interest rates and the level of funding. we contribute cash to our plans at our discretion, subject to applicable regulations and minimum contribution requirements. cash contributions to our pension and post retirement plans totaled $41.7 million, $53.3 million and $53.1 million in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.
investing activities our principal uses of cash for investment purposes relate to purchases of property, plant and equipment and capitalized software, purchases of short-term investments and acquisitions of businesses, partially offset by proceeds from sales of property, plant and equipment and short-term investments. we used cash of $595.5 million for investing activities in 2016 compared to $477.2 million in 2015, with the increase driven by additional business acquisition activity. we used cash of $862.6 million for investing activities in 2014, which was primarily driven by additional business acquisition activity and purchases of short-term investments.
primary investing activities include the following:
•   capital spending. capital expenditures, including capitalized software, primarily to support capacity expansion, innovation and cost savings, were $269.5 million in 2016, $356.8 million in 2015 and $370.8 million in 2014. the reduction in 2016 was largely due to completion of the malaysia plant construction early in the year. our 2015 and 2014 expenditures included approximately $80 million and $115 million, respectively, relating to the malaysia plant construction. capitalized software additions were primarily related to ongoing enhancements of our information systems. we expect 2017 capital expenditures, including capitalized software, to approximate $270 million to $290 million.
•   acquisitions and divestitures. in 2016, we spent $285.4 million to acquire ripple brand collective, llc. in 2015, we spent $218.7 million to acquire krave, partially offset by net cash received of $32 million from the sale of mauna loa. in 2014, we spent $396.3 million to acquire three businesses, including $379.7 million for sgm and $26.6 million for allan candy, partially offset by net cash received of $10.0 million relating to the acquisition of an additional 5.9% interest in lotte shanghai foods co., ltd., a joint venture established in 2007 in china, whereby cash acquired in the transaction exceeded the $5.6 million paid for the controlling interest. see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our recent acquisitions.
•   short-term investments. we had no short-term investment activity in 2016. in 2015, we received proceeds of $95 million from the sale of short-term investments, which had been purchased in 2014 for approximately $97 million.
financing activities our cash flow from financing activities generally relates to the use of cash for purchases of our common stock and payment of dividends, offset by net borrowing activity and proceeds from the exercise of stock options. we used cash of $434.4 million for financing activities in 2016 compared to $755.2 million in 2015, with the decrease due mainly to higher proceeds from the issuance of long-term borrowings, partially offset by the purchase of the remaining 20% of the outstanding shares of sgm and higher dividend payments in 2016. we used cash of $719.3 million for financing activities in 2014, primarily to fund dividend payments and share repurchases.
the majority of our financing activity was attributed to the following:
•   short-term borrowings, net. in addition to utilizing cash on hand, we use short-term borrowings (commercial paper and bank borrowings) to fund seasonal working capital requirements and ongoing business needs. in
2016, we generated cash flow of $275.6 million through short-term commercial paper borrowings, partially offset by payments in short-term foreign borrowings. in 2015, we generated cash flow of $10.7 million as a result of higher borrowings at certain of our international businesses. in 2014, we generated additional cash flow from the issuance of $55.0 million in commercial paper as well as incremental borrowings at certain international locations in support of sales growth.
•   long-term debt borrowings and repayments. in 2016, we used $500 million to repay long-term debt. additionally, in 2016, we issued $500 million of 2.30% notes due in 2026 and $300 million of 3.375% notes due in 2046. in 2015, we used $355 million to repay long-term debt, including $100.2 million to repurchase $71.6 million of our long-term debt as part of a cash tender offer. additionally, in 2015, we issued $300 million of 1.60% notes due in 2018 and $300 million of 3.20% notes due in 2025. we had no repayment or issuance activity in 2014.
•   share repurchases. we repurchase shares of common stock to offset the dilutive impact of treasury shares issued under our equity compensation plans. the value of these share repurchases in a given period varies based on the volume of stock options exercised and our market price. in addition, we periodically repurchase shares of common stock pursuant to board-authorized programs intended to drive additional stockholder value. we used cash for total share repurchases of $592.6 million in 2016, compared to $582.5 million in 2015. this included purchases pursuant to authorized programs of $420.2 million to purchase 4.6 million shares in 2016 and $402.5 million to purchase 4.2 million shares in 2015. we used cash for total share repurchases of $576.8 million in 2014, which included purchases pursuant to authorized programs of $202.3 million to purchase 2.1 million shares. as of december 31, 2016, approximately $100 million remained available under the $500 million share repurchase authorization approved by the board in january 2016.
•   dividend payments. total dividend payments to holders of our common stock and class b common stock were $499.5 million in 2016, $476.1 million in 2015 and $440.4 million in 2014. dividends per share of common stock increased 7.4% to $2.402 per share in 2016 compared to $2.236 per share in 2015, while dividends per share of class b common stock increased 7.5% in 2016.
•   proceeds from the exercise of stock options, including tax benefits. we received $124.8 million from employee exercises of stock options, including excess tax benefits, in 2016, as compared to $97.6 million in 2015 and $175.8 million in 2014. variances are driven primarily by the number of shares exercised and the share price at the date of grant.
•   other. in february 2016, we used $35.8 million to purchase the remaining 20% of the outstanding shares of sgm. in september 2015, we acquired the remaining 49% interest in hershey do brasil ltda. under a cooperative agreement with bauducco for approximately $38.3 million. additionally, in december 2015, we paid $10.0 million in contingent consideration to the shareholders of krave.
liquidity and capital resources at december 31, 2016, our cash and cash equivalents totaled $297.0 million. at december 31, 2015, our cash and cash equivalents totaled $346.5 million. our cash and cash equivalents at the end of 2016 declined $49.5 million compared to the 2015 year-end balance as a result of the net uses of cash outlined in the previous discussion.
approximately two-thirds of the balance of our cash and cash equivalents at december 31, 2016 was held by subsidiaries domiciled outside of the united states. if these amounts held outside of the united states were to be repatriated, under current law they would be subject to u.s. federal income taxes, less applicable foreign tax credits. however, our intent is to permanently reinvest these funds outside of the united states. the cash that our foreign subsidiaries hold for indefinite reinvestment is expected to be used to finance foreign operations and investments. we believe we have sufficient liquidity to satisfy our cash needs, including our cash needs in the united states.
we maintain debt levels we consider prudent based on our cash flow, interest coverage ratio and percentage of debt to capital. we use debt financing to lower our overall cost of capital which increases our return on stockholders' equity. our total debt was $3.0 billion at december 31, 2016 and $2.4 billion at december 31, 2015. our total debt increased in 2016 mainly due to the additional debt issued mid-year to repay commercial paper that had been used to fund the ripple brand collective, llc acquisition in april 2016.
as a source of short-term financing, we maintain a $1.0 billion unsecured revolving credit facility, with an option to increase borrowings by an additional $400 million with the consent of the lenders. as of december 31, 2016, the termination date of this agreement is november 2020. we may use these funds for general corporate purposes, including commercial paper backstop and business acquisitions. as of december 31, 2016, we had $526 million of available capacity under the agreement. the unsecured revolving credit agreement contains certain financial and other covenants, customary representations, warranties and events of default. we were in compliance with all covenants as of december 31, 2016.
in addition to the revolving credit facility, we maintain lines of credit in various currencies with domestic and international commercial banks. as of december 31, 2016, we had available capacity of $345.4 million under these lines of credit.
furthermore, we have a current shelf registration statement filed with the sec that allows for the issuance of an indeterminate amount of debt securities. proceeds from the debt issuances and any other offerings under the current registration statement may be used for general corporate requirements, including reducing existing borrowings, financing capital additions and funding contributions to our pension plans, future business acquisitions and working capital requirements.
our ability to obtain debt financing at comparable risk-based interest rates is partly a function of our existing cash-flow-to-debt and debt-to-capitalization levels as well as our current credit standing.
we believe that our existing sources of liquidity are adequate to meet anticipated funding needs at comparable risk-based interest rates for the foreseeable future. acquisition spending and/or share repurchases could potentially increase our debt. operating cash flow and access to capital markets are expected to satisfy our various cash flow requirements, including acquisitions and capital expenditures.
equity structure we have two classes of stock outstanding - common stock and class b stock. holders of the common stock and the class b stock generally vote together without regard to class on matters submitted to stockholders, including the election of directors. holders of the common stock have 1 vote per share. holders of the class b stock have 10 votes per share. holders of the common stock, voting separately as a class, are entitled to elect one-sixth of our board. with respect to dividend rights, holders of the common stock are entitled to cash dividends 10% higher than those declared and paid on the class b stock.
hershey trust company, as trustee for the trust established by milton s. and catherine s. hershey that has as its sole beneficiary milton hershey school (such trust, the "milton hershey school trust"), maintains voting control over the hershey company. in addition, a representative of hershey trust company currently serves as a member of the company's board. in performing his responsibilities on the company's board, this representative may from time to time exercise influence with regard to the ongoing business decisions of our board or management. hershey trust company, as trustee for the milton hershey school trust, in its role as controlling stockholder of the company, has indicated it intends to retain its controlling interest in the hershey company. the company's board, and not the hershey trust company board, is solely responsible and accountable for the company's management and performance.
pennsylvania law requires that the office of attorney general be provided advance notice of any transaction that would result in hershey trust company, as trustee for the milton hershey school trust, no longer having voting control of the company. the law provides specific statutory authority for the attorney general to intercede and petition the court having jurisdiction over hershey trust company, as trustee for the milton hershey school trust, to stop such a transaction if the attorney general can prove that the transaction is unnecessary for the future economic viability of the company and is inconsistent with investment and management considerations under fiduciary
obligations. this legislation makes it more difficult for a third party to acquire a majority of our outstanding voting stock and thereby may delay or prevent a change in control of the company.
guarantees and other off-balance sheet arrangements we do not have guarantees or other off-balance sheet financing arrangements, including variable interest entities, that we believe could have a material impact on our financial condition or liquidity.
payments due by period in millions of dollars contractual obligations                                      total            less than 1 year             1-3 years             3-5 years           more than 5 years long-term debt                                        $2,347.7                    $0.2                  $300.6                $435.8                  $1,611.1
(1) includes the net interest payments on fixed and variable rate debt and associated interest rate swaps. interest associated with variable rate debt was forecasted using the libor forward curve as of december 31, 2016.
(2) includes the minimum rental commitments under non-cancelable operating leases primarily for offices, retail stores, warehouses and distribution facilities.
(3) represents future pension payments to comply with local funding requirements. our policy is to fund domestic pension liabilities in accordance with the minimum and maximum limits imposed by the employee retirement income security act of 1974 ("erisa"), federal income tax laws and the funding requirements of the pension protection act of 2006. we fund non-domestic pension liabilities in accordance with laws and regulations applicable to those plans. for more information, see note 9 to the consolidated financial statements.
(4) purchase obligations consist primarily of fixed commitments for the purchase of raw materials to be utilized in the normal course of business. amounts presented included fixed price forward contracts and unpriced contracts that were valued using market prices as of december 31, 2016. the amounts presented in the table do not include items already recorded in accounts payable or accrued liabilities at year-end 2016, nor does the table reflect cash flows we are likely to incur based on our plans, but are not obligated to incur. such amounts are part of normal operations and are reflected in historical operating cash flow trends. we do not believe such purchase obligations will adversely affect our liquidity position.
in entering into contractual obligations, we have assumed the risk that might arise from the possible inability of counterparties to meet the terms of their contracts. we mitigate this risk by performing financial assessments prior to contract execution, conducting periodic evaluations of counterparty performance and maintaining a diverse portfolio of qualified counterparties. our risk is limited to replacing the contracts at prevailing market rates. we do not expect any significant losses resulting from counterparty defaults.
asset retirement obligations we have a number of facilities that contain varying amounts of asbestos in certain locations within the facilities. our asbestos management program is compliant with current applicable regulations, which require that we handle or dispose of asbestos in a specified manner if such facilities undergo major renovations or are demolished. we do not have sufficient information to estimate the fair value of any asset retirement obligations related to these facilities. we cannot specify the settlement date or range of potential settlement dates and, therefore, sufficient information is not available to apply an expected present value technique. we expect to maintain the facilities with repairs and maintenance activities that would not involve or require the removal of significant quantities of asbestos.
income tax obligations liabilities for unrecognized income tax benefits are excluded from the table above as we are unable to reasonably predict the ultimate amount or timing of a settlement of these potential liabilities. see note 8 to the consolidated financial statements for more information.
recent accounting pronouncements information on recently issued accounting standards is included in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements.
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements requires management to use judgment and make estimates and assumptions. we believe that our most critical accounting policies and estimates relate to the following:
l   accrued liabilities for trade promotion activities l   pension and other post-retirement benefits plans l   goodwill and other intangible assets l   income taxes management has discussed the development, selection and disclosure of critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of our board. while we base estimates and assumptions on our knowledge of current events and actions we may undertake in the future, actual results may ultimately differ from these estimates and assumptions. other significant accounting policies are outlined in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements.
accrued liabilities for trade promotion activities we promote our products with advertising, trade promotions and consumer incentives. these programs include, but are not limited to, discounts, coupons, rebates, in-store display incentives and volume-based incentives. we expense advertising costs and other direct marketing expenses as incurred. we recognize the costs of trade promotion and consumer incentive activities as a reduction to net sales along with a corresponding accrued liability based on estimates at the time of revenue recognition. these estimates are based on our analysis of the programs offered, historical trends, expectations regarding customer and consumer participation, sales and payment trends and our experience with payment patterns associated with similar programs offered in the past.
our trade promotional costs totaled $1,157.4 million, $1,122.3 million and $1,125.5 million in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. the estimated costs of these programs are reasonably likely to change in the future due to changes in trends with regard to customer and consumer participation, particularly for new programs and for programs related to the introduction of new products. differences between estimated expense and actual program performance are recognized as a change in estimate in a subsequent period and are normally not significant. over the three-year period ended december 31, 2016, actual promotional costs have not deviated from the estimated amount for a given year by more than 3%.
pension and other post-retirement benefits plans we sponsor various defined benefit pension plans. the primary plans are the hershey company retirement plan and the hershey company retirement plan for hourly employees, which are cash balance plans that provide pension benefits for most u.s. employees hired prior to january 1, 2007. we also sponsor two primary other post-employment benefit ("opeb") plans, consisting of a health care plan and life insurance plan for retirees. the health care plan is contributory, with participants' contributions adjusted annually, and the life insurance plan is non-contributory.
for accounting purposes, the defined benefit pension and opeb plans require assumptions to estimate the projected and accumulated benefit obligations, including the following variables: discount rate; expected salary increases; certain employee-related factors, such as turnover, retirement age and mortality; expected return on assets; and health care cost trend rates. these and other assumptions affect the annual expense and obligations recognized for the underlying plans. our assumptions reflect our historical experiences and management's best judgment regarding future expectations. our related accounting policies, accounting balances and plan assumptions are discussed in note 9 to the consolidated financial statements.
pension plans changes in certain assumptions could significantly affect pension expense and benefit obligations, particularly the estimated long-term rate of return on plan assets and the discount rates used to calculate such obligations:
•   long-term rate of return on plan assets. the expected long-term rate of return is evaluated on an annual basis. we consider a number of factors when setting assumptions with respect to the long-term rate of return, including current and expected asset allocation and historical and expected returns on the plan asset categories. actual asset allocations are regularly reviewed and periodically rebalanced to the targeted allocations when considered appropriate. investment gains or losses represent the difference between the expected return estimated using the long-term rate of return and the actual return realized. for 2017, we reduced the expected return on plan assets assumption to 5.8% from the 6.1% assumption used during 2016, reflecting lower expected long-term returns due to slowing growth in developed and emerging markets. the historical average return (compounded annually) over the 20 years prior to december 31, 2016 was approximately 6.5%.
as of december 31, 2016, our primary plans had cumulative unrecognized investment and actuarial losses of approximately $418 million. we amortize the unrecognized net actuarial gains and losses in excess of the corridor amount, which is the greater of 10% of a respective plan's projected benefit obligation or the fair market value of plan assets. these unrecognized net losses may increase future pension expense if not offset by (i) actual investment returns that exceed the expected long-term rate of investment returns, (ii) other factors, including reduced pension liabilities arising from higher discount rates used to calculate pension obligations or (iii) other actuarial gains when actual plan experience is favorable as compared to the assumed experience. a 100 basis point decrease or increase in the long-term rate of return on pension assets would correspondingly increase or decrease annual net periodic pension benefit expense by approximately $10 million.
•   discount rate. the discount rate used to determine the present value of our future pension obligation at december 31, 2016 was based on a yield curve constructed from a portfolio of high-quality corporate debt securities for which the timing and amount of cash flows approximate the estimated benefit payments of the plans. the plans' expected cash flows are then discounted by the resulting year-by-year spot rates. a 100 basis point decline in the weighted-average pension discount rate would increase annual net periodic pension benefit expense by approximately $7 million and the december 31, 2016 pension liability would increase by approximately $97 million.
pension expense for defined benefit pension plans is estimated to approximate $35 million in 2017. pension expense beyond 2017 will depend on future investment performance, our contributions to the pension trusts, changes in discount rates and various other factors related to the covered employees in the plans.
other post-employment benefit plans changes in significant assumptions could affect consolidated expense and benefit obligations, particularly the discount rates used to calculate such obligations and the healthcare cost trend rate:
•   discount rate. the determination of the discount rate used to calculate the benefit obligations of the opeb plans is discussed in the pension plans section above. if the discount rate assumption for these plans was reduced by 100 basis points, the impact to the opeb plans consolidated expense would not be material and the increase in the december 31, 2016 benefit liability would be approximately $27 million.
•   healthcare cost trend rate. the healthcare cost trend rate is based on a combination of inputs including our recent claims history and insights from external advisers regarding recent developments in the healthcare marketplace, as well as projections of future trends in the marketplace. see note 9 to the consolidated financial statements for disclosure of the effects of a one percentage point change in the healthcare cost trend rate.
goodwill and other intangible assets goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized, but are evaluated for impairment annually or more often if indicators of a potential impairment are present. our annual impairment tests are conducted at the beginning of the fourth quarter.
we test goodwill for impairment by either performing a qualitative assessment or using a two-step quantitative process. if we choose to perform a qualitative assessment, we evaluate economic, industry and company-specific factors as an initial step in assessing the fair value of the related reporting unit. if we determine that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value, the two-step process is then performed. otherwise, no further testing is required. for those reporting units tested using the two-step process, we first compare the fair value of each reporting unit with the carrying amount of the reporting unit, including goodwill. if the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying amount of the reporting unit, we complete a second step to determine the amount of the goodwill impairment that we should record. in the second step, we determine an implied fair value of the reporting unit's goodwill by allocating the reporting unit's fair value to all of its assets and liabilities other than goodwill (including any unrecognized intangible assets). we compare the resulting implied fair value of the goodwill to the carrying amount and record an impairment charge for the difference. we test individual indefinite-lived intangible assets by comparing the estimated fair value with the book values of each asset.
we determine the fair value of our reporting units and indefinite-lived intangible assets using an income approach. under the income approach, we calculate the fair value of our reporting units and indefinite-lived intangible assets based on the present value of estimated future cash flows. considerable management judgment is necessary to evaluate the impact of operating and macroeconomic changes and to estimate the future cash flows used to measure fair value. our estimates of future cash flows consider past performance, current and anticipated market conditions and internal projections and operating plans which incorporate estimates for sales growth and profitability, and cash flows associated with taxes and capital spending. additional assumptions include forecasted growth rates, estimated discount rates, which may be risk-adjusted for the operating market of the reporting unit, and estimated royalty rates that would be charged for comparable branded licenses. we believe such assumptions also reflect current and anticipated market conditions and are consistent with those that would be used by other marketplace participants for similar valuation purposes. such assumptions are subject to change due to changing economic and competitive conditions.
we also have intangible assets, consisting primarily of certain trademarks, customer-related intangible assets and patents obtained through business acquisitions, that are expected to have determinable useful lives. the costs of finite-lived intangible assets are amortized to expense over their estimated lives. our estimates of the useful lives of finite-lived intangible assets consider judgments regarding the future effects of obsolescence, demand, competition and other economic factors. we conduct impairment tests when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these finite-lived assets may not be recoverable. undiscounted cash flow analyses are used to determine if an impairment exists. if an impairment is determined to exist, the loss is calculated based on the estimated fair value of the assets.
at december 31, 2016, the net book value of our goodwill totaled $812.3 million and related to five reporting units. as it relates to our annual testing performed at the beginning of the fourth quarter, no additional goodwill impairment was indicated, and the percentage of excess fair value over carrying value was at least 100% for each of our tested reporting units.
in 2015, we recorded a $280.8 million impairment charge resulting from our interim reassessment of the valuation of the sgm business, coupled with the write-down of goodwill attributed to the china chocolate business in connection with the sgm acquisition. as a result of declining performance levels and our post-acquisition assessment, we determined that gaap required an interim impairment test of the sgm reporting unit. we performed the first step of this test as of july 5, 2015 using an income approach based on our estimates of future performance scenarios for the business. the results of this test indicated that the fair value of the reporting unit was less than the carrying amount as of the measurement date, suggesting that a goodwill impairment was probable, which required us to perform a second step analysis to confirm that an impairment existed and to determine the amount of the impairment based on our reassessed value of the reporting unit. although preliminary, as a result of this reassessment, in the second quarter of 2015 we recorded an estimated $249.8 million non-cash goodwill impairment charge, representing a write-down of all of the goodwill related to the sgm reporting unit as of july 5, 2015. during the third quarter, we increased the value
of acquired goodwill by $16.6 million, with the corresponding offset principally represented by the establishment of additional opening balance sheet liabilities for additional commitments and contingencies that were identified through our post-acquisition assessment. we also finalized the impairment test of the goodwill relating to the sgm reporting unit, which resulted in a write-off of this additional goodwill in the third quarter, for a total impairment of $266.4 million. we also tested the other long-lived assets of sgm for recoverability by comparing the sum of the undiscounted cash flows to the carrying value of the asset group, and no impairment was indicated.
in connection with the 2014 sgm acquisition, we had assigned approximately $15 million of goodwill to our existing china chocolate business, as this reporting unit was expected to benefit from acquisition synergies relating to the sale of golden monkey-branded product through its tier 1 and hypermarket distributor networks. as the net sales and earnings of our china business continued to be adversely impacted by macroeconomic challenges and changing consumer shopping behavior through the third quarter of 2015, we determined that an interim impairment test of the goodwill in this reporting unit was also required. we performed the first step of this test in the third quarter of 2015 using an income approach based on our estimates of future performance scenarios for the business. the results of this test suggested that a goodwill impairment was probable, and the conclusions of the second step analysis resulted in a write-down of $14.4 million, representing the full value of goodwill attributed to this reporting unit as of october 4, 2015. we also tested the other long-lived assets of the china asset group for recoverability by comparing the sum of the undiscounted cash flows to the carrying value of the asset group, and no impairment was indicated.
during our 2014 annual testing, the fair value of our india reporting unit approximated its carrying value. as a result and given the sensitivity of the india impairment analysis to changes in the underlying assumptions, we performed a step two analysis which indicated a goodwill impairment of $11.4 million. in addition, our 2014 annual test of indefinite-lived intangible assets resulted in a $4.5 million pre-tax write-down of a trademark, also associated with the india business. also in 2014, in connection with the anticipated sale of our mauna loa business (as discussed in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements), during the third and fourth quarters of 2014, we recorded estimated impairment charges totaling $18.5 million to write-down goodwill and an indefinite-lived trademark intangible asset, based on the valuation of these assets as implied by the agreed-upon sales price.
income taxes we base our deferred income taxes, accrued income taxes and provision for income taxes upon income, statutory tax rates, the legal structure of our company, interpretation of tax laws and tax planning opportunities available to us in the various jurisdictions in which we operate. we file income tax returns in the u.s. federal jurisdiction and various state and foreign jurisdictions. we are regularly audited by federal, state and foreign tax authorities, but a number of years may elapse before an uncertain tax position, for which we have unrecognized tax benefits, is audited and finally resolved. from time to time, these audits result in assessments of additional tax. we maintain reserves for such assessments.
we apply a more-likely-than-not threshold to the recognition and derecognition of uncertain tax positions. accordingly, we recognize the amount of tax benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being ultimately realized upon settlement. future changes in judgments and estimates related to the expected ultimate resolution of uncertain tax positions will affect income in the quarter of such change. while it is often difficult to predict the final outcome or the timing of resolution of any particular uncertain tax position, we believe that our unrecognized tax benefits reflect the most likely outcome. accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits are included in income tax expense. we adjust these unrecognized tax benefits, as well as the related interest, in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as receiving audit assessments or clearing of an item for which a reserve has been established. settlement of any particular position could require the use of cash. favorable resolution would be recognized as a reduction to our effective income tax rate in the period of resolution.
we believe it is more likely than not that the results of future operations will generate sufficient taxable income to realize the deferred tax assets, net of valuation allowances. our valuation allowances are primarily related to u.s. capital loss carryforwards and various foreign jurisdictions' net operating loss carryforwards and other deferred tax assets for which we do not expect to realize a benefit.

item 7.   management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations.
our revenues and net income are derived primarily from investment advisory services provided to individual and institutional investors in our sponsored u.s. mutual funds and other investment portfolios. the other investment portfolios include separately managed accounts, subadvised funds, and other sponsored investment portfolios, including collective investment trusts, target date retirement trusts, open-ended investment products offered to investors outside the u.s., and portfolios offered through variable annuity life insurance plans in the u.s.
we manage a broad range of u.s., international and global stock, bond, and money market mutual funds and other investment portfolios that meet the varied needs and objectives of individual and institutional investors. investment advisory revenues depend largely on the total value and composition of assets under our management. accordingly, fluctuations in financial markets and in the composition of assets under management affect our revenues and results of operations. we incur significant expenditures to attract new investment advisory clients and additional investments from our existing clients. these efforts involve costs that precede any future revenues that we recognize from an increase to our assets under management.
we remain debt-free with ample liquidity and resources that allow us to take advantage of attractive growth opportunities; invest in key capabilities, including investment professionals, technologies, and new product offerings; and, most importantly, provide our clients with strong investment management expertise and service both now and in the future. we expect to continue our investment in long-term initiatives to sustain and deepen our investment talent, add investment capabilities both in terms of new strategies and new investment vehicles, expand capabilities through enhanced technology, and broaden our distribution reach globally.
we expect to increase our pace of spending on a series of key strategic priorities to address evolving client needs and to grow and further diversify our business. based on these planned initiatives, we currently expect that our planned operating expenses, excluding the net charge related to the dell appraisal rights matter, will grow in the high-single-digit range in 2017 versus 2016. we could elect to moderate the pace of spending on our planned initiatives should markets decline significantly. in addition, other events not currently planned or expected could impact our expense levels.
u.s. stocks rose strongly in 2016, with major indexes finishing the year near record highs. small-cap stocks substantially outperformed large-caps, and it was the eighth consecutive year for a positive s&p 500 index total return. the year began with fears of a global economic slowdown, which caused a short but sharp correction in equities and commodities. u.s. shares bottomed in mid-february and worked their way higher through late june, as commodity prices rebounded and the u.s. dollar weakened due to diminishing expectations for federal reserve interest rate increases in 2016. in late june, world equity markets experienced a brief but intense sell-off as the uk unexpectedly voted in favor of leaving the european union. however, stocks resumed rising amid expectations that global central banks would provide additional monetary stimulus. in the months prior to the november u.s. elections, the u.s. market's advance was hindered by political uncertainty, as well as uncertainty about the timing of a possible interest rate increase, as fed officials started cautioning that the case for raising short-term rates had "strengthened." stocks surged following the u.s. election results. however, the rally lost some steam in december, as the fed raised short-term rates in mid-december and projected more-than-expected increases in 2017.
developed non-u.s. equity markets significantly underperformed u.s. shares for the year, as returns to u.s. investors were hurt by a stronger dollar versus some major currencies. in dollar terms, asian markets advanced for the year, though japan, page  23
hong kong, and singapore gained less than 3%. european equity markets were widely mixed, with italy-one of the worst-performing markets-dropping more than 9%, due in part to its troubled banking sector.
emerging equity markets outperformed developed non-u.s. markets. brazil led the latin america region with a nearly 67% gain, helped by rebounding commodity prices and by a new president pursuing reforms. in emerging europe, russian shares soared amid firming oil prices, a stronger ruble, and hopes for better relations with the u.s. emerging asian markets were widely mixed.
results of several major equity market indexes for 2016 are as follows:
msci emerging markets index                           11.6%
global bond returns were mostly positive in 2016. in the u.s., intermediate- and long-term treasury yields declined in the first half of the year, then rebounded in the second half and finished the year above their year-end 2015 levels. the 10-year treasury note yield decreased from 2.3% at the end of 2015 to less than 1.4% around midyear, then it rose to around 2.5% by the end of 2016. in the investment-grade universe, corporate bonds were among the best performers. longer-term treasuries generated modest returns. municipal securities were flat for the year, as they surrendered earlier gains during the fourth quarter amid rising interest rates and cash outflows. high yield bonds strongly outperformed, helped by their lower interest rate sensitivity, investors' demand for securities with attractive yields, and a rebound in oil prices.
bonds in developed non-u.s. markets produced modest positive returns in dollar terms, as significant first-half gains driven by u.s. currency weakness and falling sovereign debt yields were largely offset by a reversal of these trends in the latter half of the year. bonds in emerging markets produced solid gains, as first-half returns driven by dollar weakness and investors' search for attractive yields were only partially eroded by a stronger u.s. dollar in the second half.

assets under management.
our assets under management ended 2016 at $810.8 billion, an increase of $47.7 billion from the end of 2015. during 2016, market appreciation and income, net of distributions not reinvested, of $50.5 billion was offset in part by net cash outflows of $2.8 billion. investment advisory clients outside the u.s. account for about 5% of our assets under management at december 31, 2016.

our target date retirement portfolios, which invest in a broadly diversified portfolio of other t. rowe price funds or t. rowe price collective investment trusts and automatically rebalance to maintain their specific asset allocation weightings, continue to be a significant part of our assets under management. assets under management at december 31, 2016, in these target date portfolios totaled $189.2 billion, including $150.9 billion in target date retirement funds and $38.3 billion in target date retirement trusts.
the following table presents the component changes in assets under management for 2014, 2015, and 2016.

in 2014, the majority of the assets transferred by clients from our sponsored mutual funds to our other investment portfolios disclosed in the table above were moved from our target date retirement funds to our collective investment trusts and target date retirement trusts. in 2015 and 2016, assets were transferred from both target date retirement funds and other mutual funds to our collective investment trusts, target date retirement trusts, and separate accounts.
money market funds                                                                             (0.2    )           (0.4    )             .6

the net cash inflows in our sponsored u.s. mutual funds over the last three years were sourced primarily from third-party financial intermediaries across various mandates as detailed below.
in 2014, the net outflows from our other investment portfolios were primarily from a few institutional and subadvisory clients who redeemed significant amounts from a small number of equity and fixed income strategies. in 2015, the net inflows in our other investment portfolios resulted primarily from the client transfers received from the mutual funds. the net outflows prior to the transfers into these portfolios were largely concentrated among a small number of institutional clients who redeemed primarily from large-cap u.s. equity strategies. in 2016, our net cash outflows are largely attributable to institutional and intermediary clients reallocating to passive investments and the impact of our closed investment strategies. the general trend to passive also impacted the net cash flows originating in our target date retirement portfolios. this trend has been persistent and has accelerated in recent years. however, over the long term we expect well-executed active management to play an important role for investors, and we are reinvesting in our company with the objective of delivering strong investment performance and excellent client service like we have historically achieved.
investment performance.
strong investment performance and brand awareness is a key driver to attracting and retaining assets-and to our long-term success. although investment performance relative to our peers has weakened in 2016, it has been strong over the longer term. the percentage of our price funds across their share classes that outperformed their comparable lipper averages on a total return basis and percentage in top lipper quartile for the 1-, 3-, 5- and 10-years ended december 31, 2016, were:
asset allocation                                  49%       97%       95%        94%
in addition, nearly 86% of our price funds' assets under management ended december 31, 2016, with an overall rating of four or five stars from morningstar. the performance of our institutional strategies against their benchmarks weakened in 2016 but remains very competitive over longer time periods.
results of operations.
the table below presents financial results on a u.s. gaap basis, as well as a non-gaap basis to adjust for the non-recurring charge related to the dell appraisal rights matter, the impact of the consolidated sponsored investment portfolios, and other non-operating income. we believe the non-gaap financial measures below provide relevant and meaningful information to investors about our core operating results.

(1) non-operating income varies from year to year due to a number of factors; accordingly the percentage change in non-operating income is not believed to be meaningful.

as detailed in the table above, the percentage increase in investment advisory revenues in 2016 was in line with the increase in our average assets under management. we waived $10.5 million in money market-related fees (including advisory fees and fund expenses) in 2016, a decrease of $37.1 million from the $47.6 million waived in the 2015 period. the fee waivers in 2016 represent less than .5% of total investment advisory revenues earned during the same period. these fees were waived from certain of our money market mutual funds and trusts, which have combined net assets of $15.7 billion at december 31, 2016. we expect money market fee waivers, if any, will be insignificant in 2017. the annual fee rate earned on our assets under management was 47.9 basis points in 2016, virtually unchanged from the 48.0 basis points earned in 2015. the impact on our effective fee rate from the reduction in money market waivers in 2016 was offset by effective fee rate reductions in certain of our sponsored u.s. mutual funds.
our operating expenses include a non-recurring charge, net of insurance recovery, of $66.2 million, or $.15 per share after tax related to the dell appraisal rights matter. in 2016, we paid our clients $166.2 million to compensate them for the denial of their appraisal rights in connection with the 2013 leveraged buyout of dell. we made claims with our insurance carriers and, on december 30, 2016, entered into an agreement with our primary insurance carrier to recover $100 million from the claim. the insurance proceeds were recognized as an offset to the related $166.2 million charge recognized in the second quarter of 2016. remaining insurance claims filed with respect to this matter that could result in an additional recovery of up to $50 million are still pending.
our operating margin in 2016 was 41.0% compared to 45.2% in the 2015 period. without the impact of the non-recurring charge relating to the dell appraisal rights matter, our operating margin in 2016 would have been 42.6%. the additional decline in our 2016 operating margin results primarily from the investments we have been making to broaden and deepen our investment management, distribution, and service capabilities around the world.
our 2016 results were significantly impacted by the adoption of new accounting guidance related to consolidation and stock-based compensation. the impacts of implementing this new guidance is discussed in more detail in the summary of significant accounting policies section of our consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 of this filing.
the impact (in millions) the consolidated sponsored investment portfolios have on the individual lines of our 2016 consolidated statement of income is as follows:
operating expenses reflected in net operating income                                                    $(13.0   )
net investment income reflected in non-operating income                                                  121.1
impact on income before taxes                                                                           $108.1
net income attributable to the firm's interest in the consolidated sponsored investment portfolios       $69.1
net revenues investment advisory revenues earned from the t. rowe price mutual funds distributed in the u.s. increased 1.4%, or $37.5 million, to $2.7 billion. average mutual fund assets in 2016 were $495.5 billion, an increase of .4% from the average for the comparable 2015 period. the increase in advisory revenues was due in part to the reduction in money market fee waivers realized in 2016 compared with 2015.
investment advisory revenues earned on the other investment portfolios for 2016 were $1,023.3 million, an increase of $3.9 million, or .4%, from the $1,019.4 million earned in 2015. average assets in these portfolios were $282.7 billion during 2016, up 3.1% from the comparable 2015 period. in 2016, our advisory revenues are presented net of $7.0 million related to the elimination of management fees earned on the net assets of certain of our consolidated sponsored investment portfolios. we eliminated these advisory fees in preparing our consolidated financial statements.
administrative fee revenues decreased $9.3 million to $352.5 million in 2016. the decrease is primarily attributable to transfer agent servicing activities provided to the mutual funds and their investors, as well as the shift of fund accounting and portfolio recordkeeping operations to bny mellon that, prior to august 2015, we provided to our sponsored u.s. mutual funds. changes in administrative fee revenues are generally offset by similar changes in related operating expenses that are incurred to provide services to the funds and their investors.
distribution and servicing fee revenues earned from 12b-1 plans of the advisor, r, and variable annuity ii class shares of our sponsored portfolios were $141.7 million in 2016, a decrease of $9.8 million from the comparable 2015 period on lower average assets under management in these share classes. the 12b-1 fees earned are offset entirely by the costs paid to third- party intermediaries who source these assets. these costs are reported as distribution and servicing costs in the consolidated income statements.
operating expenses compensation and related costs was $1,494.0 million in 2016, an increase of $50.4 million, or 3.5%, compared to the 2015 period. the largest part of the increase is attributable to a $56.7 million increase in salaries and related benefits, which resulted from a modest increase in salaries at the beginning of 2016 combined with a 3.2% increase in average headcount from 2015. noncash stock-based compensation expense and annual variable compensation were up $12.6 million and $4.9 million, respectively. these increases were offset by a higher level of technology labor capitalized in 2016 compared with 2015 and a reduction in temporary labor cost as the 2016 projects used more professional service resources. the overall increase in compensation and related costs and our average staff size from 2015 were muted by lower compensation costs resulting from shifting 210 associates in august 2015 to bny mellon and for the ongoing transition support we provide to them. however, these lower compensation costs are generally offset by increases in costs paid to bny mellon to provide these administrative services and other transition-related activities, which are reflected in other operating expenses.
advertising and promotion costs were $79.9 million in 2016 compared with $79.7 million in 2015. we currently expect advertising and promotion costs for 2017 to be up to 10% higher than the 2016 year as we execute on a number of strategic initiatives.
occupancy and facility costs, together with depreciation expense, increased $20.7 million, or 7.3%, compared to 2015. the increase is primarily attributable to the added costs to update and enhance technology capabilities, including related maintenance programs.
other operating expenses were $401.5 million in 2016, an increase of $60.1 million from 2015. about half of this increase is attributable to costs being paid to bny mellon since august 2015 for the performance of certain administrative services, as mentioned above. the increase also includes $6.5 million in operating expenses, net of investment advisory fees earned by us, of those sponsored investment portfolios that we began consolidating at the beginning of 2016. the remaining balance of the change is due to increased business demands and our continued investment in capabilities.
non-operating income net non-operating investment activity during 2016 resulted in income of $227.1 million compared with $103.5 million in 2015. the following table details the components of non-operating income (in millions) during the 2015 and 2016.

the increase in investment gains on sponsored equity method and trading investments is driven by an increase in the number of sponsored funds accounted for as equity method investments as well as market gains. the investment income on consolidated page  29
sponsored investment portfolios has increased in 2016 as the number of portfolios we consolidate, as discussed earlier in this section, increased significantly upon the adoption of the new consolidation accounting guidance. see the summary of significant accounting policies in the consolidated financial statements contained in part ii, item 8 of this filing for more information related to the impact of the guidance.
provision for income taxes our effective tax rate for 2016 was 36.0% compared to 38.9% in 2015. the decrease in the effective tax rate is related in part to the increase in net income attributable to redeemable non-controlling interest related to our consolidated sponsored investment portfolios as we do not recognize taxes associated with these earnings. additionally, the estimated effective tax rate has declined as a result of adopting the new stock-based compensation accounting guidance as discussed in the summary of significant accounting policies in the consolidated financial statements contained in part ii, item 8 of this filing. under the new guidance, tax benefits and shortfalls on exercised options and vested restricted stock relative to the stock-based compensation expense recognized are included in the provision for income taxes rather than as additional paid in capital on the consolidated balance sheet. our effective income tax rate also reflects the relative contribution of pretax income generated by our foreign subsidiaries that are subject to tax rates lower than our u.s. rates. changes in the relative contribution of pretax income from u.s. and foreign sources or changes in tax rates in relevant jurisdictions may affect our effective income tax rate and overall net income in the future. we currently estimate that our effective tax rate for 2017 to be 36.5%. our 2017 estimate assumes the tax benefits related to stock-based compensation will be similar to those realized in 2016.

investment advisory revenues earned in 2015 increased over 2014 as our average assets under management increased $43.2 billion, or 6.0%, to $767.9 billion. the average annualized fee rate earned on our assets under management was 48.0 basis points in 2015, up from the 47.8 basis points earned in 2014, as money market fee waivers declined and equity valuations, which on average carry a higher fee rate, increased in 2015. we waived $47.6 million in money market-related fees in 2015, including advisory fees and fund expenses, a decrease of $10.8 million from the $58.4 million waived in 2014. the fee waivers in 2015 represent 1.3% of total investment advisory revenues earned during the same period. fees were waived from all our money market mutual funds and trusts, which have combined net assets of $15.7 billion at december 31, 2015.
our operating margin in 2015 was 45.2% compared to 47.5% in the 2014 period. the decline is a result of the investments we have been making to broaden and deepen our investment management, distribution, and service capabilities around the world despite the impact of market volatility on our net revenues.
net revenues investment advisory revenues earned from the t. rowe price mutual funds distributed in the u.s. increased 7.3%, or $182.1 million, to nearly $2.7 billion, on higher average mutual fund assets. average mutual fund assets in 2015 were $493.6 billion, an increase of 7.1% from the average for the comparable 2014 period.
investment advisory revenues earned on the other investment portfolios in 2015 were $1.0 billion, an increase of $40.7 million, or 4.2%, from the $978.7 million earned in the comparable 2014 period. average assets in these portfolios were $274.3 billion in 2015, up 4.0% from the comparable 2014 period.
administrative fee revenues decreased $12.2 million to $361.8 million in 2015. the decrease includes the reduction in certain administrative service fee rates paid by certain fund shareholders at the beginning of 2015. additionally, fees earned from the mutual funds for fund accounting has declined in 2015 compared to 2014, as such services began to be performed by bny mellon in august 2015. the mutual funds have contracted directly with bny mellon to provide such services. changes in administrative fee revenues are generally offset by similar changes in related operating expenses that are incurred to provide services to the funds and their investors.
distribution and servicing fee revenues earned from 12b-1 plans of the advisor class, r class, and variable annuity ii class shares of our sponsored portfolios were $151.5 million in 2015, an increase of $7.9 million from 2014 on greater average assets under management in these share classes. the 12b-1 fees earned are offset entirely by the costs paid to third-party intermediaries who source these assets. these costs are reported as distribution and servicing costs in the consolidated income statements.
operating expenses compensation and related costs were $1.4 billion in 2015, an increase of $114.0 million, or 8.6%, compared to 2014. the largest part of the increase is attributable to a $52.6 million increase in salaries and related benefits and a $43.0 million increase in our annual variable compensation program. our average staff size in 2015 increased 3.7% over 2014, and we employed 5,999 associates at december 31, 2015. higher noncash stock-based compensation expense and temporary staff expense account for the remainder of the increase in compensation and related costs in the 2015 period. the increase in compensation and related costs and our average staff size were muted by the lower compensation costs resulting from shifting 210 associates and providing ongoing transition support to bny mellon, with whom we contracted to provide fund accounting and recordkeeping operations. however, these lower compensation costs are offset by increases in costs paid to bny mellon to provide these administrative services, which are reflected in other operating expenses.
advertising and promotion costs were $79.7 million in 2015, an increase of $3.7 million from 2014. the higher cost is primarily attributable to the creation and launch of a new advertising campaign and increased participation in promotional activities as we broaden our distribution reach.
occupancy and facility costs, together with depreciation expense, increased $29.9 million, or 11.7%, compared to 2014. the increase is primarily attributable to the added costs to update and enhance technology capabilities, including related maintenance programs.
other operating expenses were $341.4 million in 2015, an increase of $55.0 million from 2014. about a third of the increase is attributable to costs being paid to bny mellon since august 2015 for the performance of certain administrative services. the balance of the change is due to increased business demands and our continued investment in capabilities. these costs include information and third-party service costs, costs related to our defined contribution recordkeeping business, travel-related costs, and other general and administrative costs.
non-operating investment income net non-operating investment activity during 2015 resulted in income of $103.5 million, a decrease of $8.7 million from 2014. net losses recognized on our sponsored fund investments of $12.3 million were offset in part by other investment income of $3.6 million. the following table details the components of non-operating investment income (in millions) during 2014 and 2015.

the net loss recognized on deconsolidation represents the reclassification of a foreign currency loss that was accumulated in other comprehensive income from the date we made our initial seed capital investment in an australian dollar-denominated fund. since the deconsolidation, we are accounting for the investment under the equity method of accounting.
provision for income taxes our effective tax rate was 38.9% in 2015 compared to 38.6% in 2014. our effective income tax rate reflects the relative contribution of pretax income generated by our foreign subsidiaries that are subject to tax rates lower than our u.s. rates.
non-gaap information and reconciliation we believe the non-gaap financial measures below provide relevant and meaningful information to investors about our core operating results. these measures have been established in order to increase transparency for the purpose of evaluating our core business, for comparing current results with prior period results, and to enable more appropriate comparison with industry peers. however, non-gaap financial measures should not be considered as a substitute for financial measures calculated in accordance with u.s. gaap and may be calculated differently by other companies. the following schedule reconciles (in millions, except for per-share amounts) u.s. gaap financial measures to non-gaap measures for each of the last five years.

(1) we implemented new consolidation accounting guidance on january 1, 2016, that resulted in a larger number of our sponsored investment portfolios, that we provide seed capital to at inception, to be consolidated in our financial statements as we were deemed to have a controlling financial interest. we now recognize investment gains and losses on a larger number of the investments in sponsored portfolios in our consolidated statement of income compared to our consolidated statement of comprehensive income in 2015. the non-gaap adjustments add back the management fees we earn from the consolidated sponsored investment portfolios and remove the investment income and operating expenses of these portfolios that have been included in our u.s. gaap consolidated statements of income. we believe the consolidated sponsored investment portfolios may impact the reader's ability to understand our core operating results. the following table details the amounts and consolidated statement of income line items in which the amounts were recognized:
net investment income of consolidated sponsored portfolios                 $7.1              $4.5           $-                 $1.5              $121.1

(2) this non-gaap adjustment removes the non-operating income that remains after backing out the portion related to the consolidated sponsored investment portfolios. we believe excluding non-operating income helps the reader's ability to understand the firm's core operating results and increases comparability to prior years. additionally, we do not emphasize the impact of non-operating income when managing our firm and evaluating our performance.

(3) as previously disclosed, we made the decision in 2016 to compensate certain clients in regard to the dell appraisal rights matter. we also recognized an offset to this charge for a related insurance recovery. we believe it is useful to readers of our consolidated statement of income to adjust for this non-recurring charge, net of the insurance recovery, in arriving at adjusted operating expenses, net income attributable to t. rowe price group, inc., and diluted earnings per share, as this will aid with comparability to prior periods and analyzing our core business results.
capital resources and liquidity.
during 2016, stockholders' equity increased from $4.8 billion to $5.0 billion. tangible book value increased to $4.3 billion at december 31, 2016. we paid $2.16 per share in regular dividends in 2016, an increase of 3.8% over the $2.08 per share in regular dividends paid in 2015. additionally, we expended $676.9 million to repurchase 10.0 million shares, or 4.0%, of our outstanding common stock in 2016. these dividends and repurchases were expended using existing cash balances and cash generated from operations. we will generally repurchase our common stock over time to offset the dilution created by our equity-based compensation plans. in december 2016, our board of directors increased our share repurchase program by 12 million shares.
we remain debt-free with ample liquidity, including cash and discretionary sponsored portfolio investment holdings of $1.9 billion at december 31, 2016. we also have seed capital investments in sponsored investment portfolios of $1.3 billion that are redeemable, although we generally expect to be invested for several years until unrelated third-party investors substantially reduce our relative ownership percentage. the cash and discretionary sponsored investment holdings held by our subsidiaries outside the u.s. is $.4 million at december 31, 2016.
the following table details (in millions) the line items of the consolidated balance sheet as of december 31, 2016, where our cash and discretionary sponsored portfolio investment holdings and seed capital investments are presented, as well as the amount of other investments we hold that make up the remainder of the investments line in the financial statements. the investment presentation on the consolidated balance sheet is based on the type of investment, as well as how we account for it.

on january 1, 2016, we implemented new consolidation accounting guidance that resulted in the consolidation of sponsored investment portfolios in which we have a controlling interest. our consolidated balance sheet now reflects the cash and cash equivalents, investments, other assets and liabilities of the sponsored portfolios, as well as redeemable non-controlling interests for the portion of the sponsored portfolios that are held by unrelated third-party investors. although we can redeem our net interest in these sponsored investment portfolios at any time, we cannot directly access or sell the assets held by the portfolios to obtain cash for general operations. additionally, the assets of these investment portfolios are not available to our general creditors. our interest in these sponsored investment portfolios was used as initial seed capital and is recategorized as discretionary when it is determined by management that the seed capital is no longer needed. we assess the discretionary investment portfolio and when we liquidate our interest, we do so in a way as to not impact the portfolio and, ultimately, the unrelated third-party investors.
we anticipate property and equipment expenditures in 2017 to be up to $175 million, of which about two-thirds is planned for technology initiatives. given the availability of our financial resources, we expect to fund our anticipated capital expenditures with operating resources and do not maintain an available external source of liquidity.

operating activities attributable to t. rowe price group during 2016 provided cash flows of $1,343.7 million, a decrease of $186.8 million from the 2015 period. the decline is primarily related to the payments totaling $166.2 million we made in 2016 to compensate certain clients in regard to the dell appraisal rights matter. we entered into an agreement on december 30, 2016, for a $100 million insurance recovery that we received in january 2017. the net cash provided by operating activities attributable to t. rowe price group was offset in part by the net change in trading securities held in our consolidated sponsored investments' underlying investment portfolios.
net cash used in investing activities that are attributable to t. rowe price group totaled $219.7 million in 2016. in 2016, we provided $284.5 million in seed capital to new and existing sponsored investment portfolios. we utilized a portion of the $219.5 million in proceeds from the sale of certain available-for-sale investments and equity method investments in 2016 to fund these seed capital investments. since we consolidate these sponsored investment portfolios, the seed capital that we provided was eliminated in preparing our consolidated statement of cash flow. in 2015, cash proceeds from the sale of certain sponsored fund holdings, net of new investments, resulted in investing cash flows of $269.7 million. additionally, our net property and equipment additions were $148.3 million in 2016 compared to $151.3 million in the 2015 period. the cash flow attributable to consolidated sponsored investment portfolios of $41.4 million represents the net cash added to our consolidated balance sheet from consolidating and deconsolidating portfolios in 2016.
compared with the 2015 period. the net cash used in financing activities attributable to t. rowe price group was largely offset by the $915.0 million of net subscriptions into the consolidated sponsored investment portfolios.
operating activities during 2015 provided cash flows of $1.5 billion, up $215.1 million from the 2014 period. we used $75.0 million less cash in 2015 compared with the 2014 period as we seeded fewer new sponsored investment portfolios. higher noncash depreciation and amortization and noncash stock-based compensation in 2015 increased cash flows by $30.2 million. timing differences on the cash settlement of our assets and liabilities increased our operating cash flows by $114.8 million compared to 2014. more than half of the timing difference on the cash settlement of our assets and liabilities is related to bonus compensation that was deferred by certain employees under the new supplemental savings plan that went into effect in 2015. the supplemental savings plan provides certain senior officers the opportunity to defer any portion of their cash incentive compensation earned for a respective calendar year during which services are provided for a period of two or more years.
net cash provided by investing activities totaled $109.0 million in 2015 compared with net cash used of $443.4 million in the 2014 period. in 2015, cash proceeds from the sale of certain sponsored fund holdings, net of new investments, resulted in investing cash flows of $269.7 million. this compares with net investments of $305.3 million that we made into our sponsored fund investments in 2014. we increased our property and equipment additions by $25.1 million during 2015 compared to the 2014 period.
net cash used in financing activities was $1,949.2 million in 2015, up $1,209.4 million from the comparable 2014 period. the payment of a $2.00 special dividend on april 23, 2015, and an 18% increase in our regular quarterly per-share dividend accounted for $596.9 million of the increase from 2014. we also increased our common stock repurchases by $572.3 million during 2015 compared with 2014.
the following table presents a summary of our future obligations (in millions) under the terms of existing operating leases and other contractual cash purchase commitments at december 31, 2016. other purchase commitments include contractual amounts that will be due for the purchase of goods or services to be used in our operations and may be cancelable at earlier times than those indicated, under certain conditions that may involve termination fees. because these obligations are generally of a normal recurring nature, we expect that we will fund them from future cash flows from operations. the information presented does not include operating expenses or capital expenditures that will be committed in the normal course of operations in 2017 and future years. the information also excludes the $6.2 million of unrecognized tax benefits discussed in note 7 to our consolidated financial statements because it is not possible to estimate the time period in which a payment might be made to the tax authorities.

we also have outstanding commitments to fund additional contributions to investment partnerships totaling $46.4 million at december 31, 2016. the vast majority of these additional contributions will be made to investment partnerships in which we have an existing investment. in addition to such amounts, a percentage of prior distributions may be called under certain circumstances.
the preparation of financial statements often requires the selection of specific accounting methods and policies from among several acceptable alternatives. further, significant estimates and judgments may be required in selecting and applying those methods and policies in the recognition of the assets and liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets, the revenues and expenses in our consolidated statements of income, and the information that is contained in our significant accounting policies and notes to consolidated financial statements. making these estimates and judgments requires the analysis of information concerning events that may not yet be complete and of facts and circumstances that may change over time. accordingly, actual amounts or future results can differ materially from those estimates that we include currently in our consolidated financial statements, significant accounting policies, and notes.
we present those significant accounting policies used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements as an integral part of those statements within this 2016 annual report. in the following discussion, we highlight and explain further certain of those policies that are most critical to the preparation and understanding of our financial statements.
consolidation. we consolidate all subsidiaries and sponsored investment portfolios in which we have a controlling interest. we are generally deemed to have a controlling interest when we own the majority of the voting interest of an entity or are deemed to be the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity (vie). vies are entities that lack sufficient equity to finance its activities or the equity holders do not have defined power to direct the activities of the entity normally associated with an equity investment. our analysis to determine whether an entity is a vie or a voting interest entity (voe) involves judgment and considers several factors, including an entity's legal organization, capital structure, the rights of the equity investment holders, our ownership interest in the entity, and our contractual involvement with the entity. we continually review and reconsider our vie or voe conclusions upon the occurrence of certain events, such as changes to our ownership interest, changes to an entity's legal structure, or amendments to governing documents. our vies are primarily sponsored investment entities and our variable interest consists of our equity ownership in and investment management fees earned from these entities.
we are the primary beneficiary if we have the power to direct the activities of the vie that most significantly impact its economic performance and the obligation to absorb losses of the entity or the right to receive benefits from the vie that could potentially be significant. our sicav funds and other sponsored investment portfolios regulated outside the u.s. are determined to be vies. at december 31, 2016, we consolidated vies with net assets of $1,389.3 million.
other-than-temporary impairments of available-for-sale securities. we generally classify our investment holdings in sponsored funds as available-for-sale if we are not deemed to a have a controlling financial interest nor exercise significant influence over its operating and financial policies. at the end of each quarter, we mark the carrying amount of each investment holding to fair value and recognize an unrealized gain or loss as a component of comprehensive income within the consolidated statements of comprehensive income. we review each individual security position that has an unrealized loss or impairment to determine if that impairment is other than temporary.
in determining whether a mutual fund holding is other-than-temporarily impaired, we consider many factors, including the duration of time the impairment has existed, the severity of the impairment, any subsequent changes in value, and our intent and ability to hold the security for a period of time sufficient for an anticipated recovery in fair value. subject to the other considerations noted above, we believe a fund holding with an unrealized loss that has persisted daily throughout the six months between quarter-ends is generally presumed to have an other-than-temporary impairment. we may also recognize an other-than-temporary impairment for losses that have existed for less than six months in our consolidated statements of income if the particular circumstances of the underlying investment do not warrant our belief that a near-term recovery is possible.
other-than-temporary impairments of equity method investments. we evaluate our equity method investments, including our investment in uti and other sponsored investment holdings, for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the investment exceeds its fair value, and the decline in fair value is other than temporary.
goodwill. we internally conduct, manage, and report our operations as one investment advisory business. we do not have distinct operating segments or components that separately constitute a business. accordingly, we attribute goodwill to a single reportable business segment and reporting unit-our investment advisory business.
we evaluate the carrying amount of goodwill in our consolidated balance sheets for possible impairment on an annual basis in the third quarter of each year using a fair value approach. goodwill would be considered impaired whenever our historical carrying amount exceeds the fair value of our investment advisory business. our annual testing has demonstrated that the fair value of our investment advisory business (our market capitalization) exceeds our carrying amount (our stockholders' equity) and, therefore, no impairment exists. should we reach a different conclusion in the future, additional work would be performed to ascertain the amount of the noncash impairment charge to be recognized. we must also perform impairment testing at other times if an event or circumstance occurs indicating that it is more likely than not that an impairment has been incurred. the maximum future impairment of goodwill that we could incur is the amount recognized in our consolidated balance sheets, $665.7 million.
stock options. we recognize stock option-based compensation expense in our consolidated statements of income using a fair value-based method. fair value methods use a valuation model for shorter-term, market-traded financial instruments to theoretically value stock option grants even though they are not available for trading and are of longer duration. the black-scholes option-pricing model that we use includes the input of certain variables that are dependent on future expectations, including the expected lives of our options from grant date to exercise date; the volatility of our underlying common shares in page  38
the market over that time period; and the rate of dividends that we will pay during that time. our estimates of these variables are made for the purpose of using the valuation model to determine an expense for each reporting period and are not subsequently adjusted. unlike most of our expenses, the resulting charge to earnings using a fair value-based method is a noncash charge that is never measured by, or adjusted based on, a cash outflow.
provision for income taxes. after compensation and related costs, our provision for income taxes on our earnings is our largest annual expense. we operate in numerous states and countries through our various subsidiaries and must allocate our income, expenses, and earnings under the various laws and regulations of each of these taxing jurisdictions. accordingly, our provision for income taxes represents our total estimate of the liability that we have incurred in doing business each year in all of our locations. annually, we file tax returns that represent our filing positions with each jurisdiction and settle our return liabilities. each jurisdiction has the right to audit those returns and may take different positions with respect to income and expense allocations and taxable earnings determinations. from time to time, we may also provide for estimated liabilities associated with uncertain tax return filing positions that are subject to, or in the process of, being audited by various tax authorities. because the determination of our annual provision is subject to judgments and estimates, it is likely that actual results will vary from those recognized in our financial statements. as a result, we recognize additions to, or reductions of, income tax expense during a reporting period that pertain to prior period provisions as our estimated liabilities are revised and actual tax returns and tax audits are settled. we recognize any such prior period adjustment in the discrete quarterly period in which it is determined.
in may 2014, the fasb issued accounting standards update no. 2014-09 - revenue from contracts with customers, and subsequently has issued five related accounting standard updates clarifying several aspects of asu 2014-09, including technical corrections and improvements. the overall objective of the new standards updates is to provide a single, comprehensive revenue recognition model for all contracts with customers to improve comparability within industries, across industries, and across capital markets. the revenue standard contains principles that will be applied to determine the measurement of revenue and timing of when it is recognized. we anticipate adopting the new standard on its effective date, january 1, 2018, though we have not yet selected whether we would adopt using the retrospective approach with adjustments to each prior period or the retrospective method with the cumulative effect of initial application recognized at the date of initial application. while we are continuing to assess all potential impacts these standards will have on our financial position and results of operations, early conclusions indicate that these standards will not have a material impact. our implementation efforts include the identification of revenue within the scope of the guidance, as well as the evaluation of revenue contracts. while we have not identified material changes in the timing of revenue recognition, we continue to evaluate the presentation of certain revenue-related costs on a gross versus net basis and related disclosures of revenue.
in january 2016, the fasb issued accounting standards update no. 2016-01 - financial instruments - overall (subtopic 825-10): recognition and measurement of financial assets and financial liabilities. the amendments in this update address certain aspects of recognition, measurement, presentation, and disclosure of financial instruments. the asu is effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those years beginning after december 15, 2017, and requires a cumulative-effect adjustment to the balance sheet as of the beginning of the fiscal year of adoption. early adoption is not permitted. the new guidance will require the change in fair value of equity investments with readily determinable fair values to be recognized through the income statements. we are currently evaluating the full impact of the standard; however, upon adoption, the change in the fair value of our available-for-sale investments will be recognized in our consolidated income statement rather than our consolidated statement of comprehensive income.
in february 2016, the fasb issued accounting standards update no. 2016-02 - leases (topic 842). the objective of the update is to increase transparency and comparability among organizations by recognizing lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet and disclosing key information about leasing arrangements. the amendments in this update are effective for fiscal years beginning after december 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years. early adoption is permitted. we are currently evaluating the impact this standard will have on our financial position and results of operations, though we expect that our real estate leases will be recognized on our consolidated balance sheet.
in august 2016, the fasb issued accounting standards update no. 2016-05 - statement of cash flows (topic 230): classification of certain cash receipts and cash payments (a consensus of the emerging issues task force). the amendments in this update provide guidance on eight specific cash flow issues. the new guidance is intended to reduce diversity in practice in how certain transactions are classified in the statement of cash flows. the amendments in this update are effective for fiscal years beginning after december 15, 2017, and interim periods within those fiscal years. early adoption is permitted. we are currently evaluating the impact this standard will have on our consolidated statements of cash flows.
we have considered all other newly issued accounting guidance that is applicable to our operations and the preparation of our consolidated financial statements, including that which we have not yet adopted. we do not believe that any such guidance will have a material effect on our financial position or results of operation.
forward-looking information.
from time to time, information or statements provided by or on behalf of t. rowe price, including those within this report, may contain certain forward-looking information, including information or anticipated information relating to: our revenues, net income, and earnings per share on common stock; changes in the amount and composition of our assets under management; our expense levels; our estimated effective income tax rate; and our expectations regarding financial markets, future transactions, dividends, investments, capital expenditures, and other conditions. readers are cautioned that any forward-looking information provided by or on behalf of t. rowe price is not a guarantee of future performance. actual results may differ materially from those in forward-looking information because of various factors including, but not limited to, those discussed below and in item 1a, risk factors, of this form 10-k annual report. further, forward-looking statements speak only as of the date on which they are made, and we undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statement to reflect events or circumstances after the date on which it is made or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events.
our future revenues and results of operations will fluctuate primarily due to changes in the total value and composition of assets under our management. such changes result from many factors, including, among other things: cash inflows and outflows in the t. rowe price mutual funds and other managed investment portfolios, fluctuations in global financial markets that result in appreciation or depreciation of the assets under our management, our introduction of new mutual funds and investment portfolios, and changes in retirement savings trends relative to participant-directed investments and defined contribution plans. the ability to attract and retain investors' assets under our management is dependent on investor sentiment and confidence; the relative investment performance of the price mutual funds and other managed investment portfolios as compared to competing offerings and market indexes; the ability to maintain our investment management and administrative fees at appropriate levels; competitive conditions in the mutual fund, asset management, and broader financial services sectors; and our level of success in implementing our strategy to expand our business. our revenues are substantially dependent on fees earned under contracts with the price funds and could be adversely affected if the independent directors of one or more of the price funds terminated or significantly altered the terms of the investment management or related administrative services agreements. non-operating investment income will also fluctuate primarily due to the size of our investments, changes in their market valuations, and any other-than-temporary impairments that may arise or, in the case of our equity method investments, our proportionate share of the investees' net income.
our future results are also dependent upon the level of our expenses, which are subject to fluctuation for the following or other reasons: changes in the level of our advertising and promotion expenses in response to market conditions, including our efforts to expand our investment advisory business to investors outside the u.s. and to further penetrate our distribution channels within the u.s.; the pace and level of our planned increase in spending to support key strategic priorities; variations in the level of total compensation expense due to, among other things, bonuses, restricted stock units and other equity grants, other incentive awards, changes in our employee count and mix, and competitive factors; any goodwill or other asset impairment that may arise; fluctuation in foreign currency exchange rates applicable to the costs of our international operations; expenses and capital costs, such as technology assets, depreciation, amortization, and research and development, incurred to maintain and enhance our administrative and operating services infrastructure; unanticipated costs that may be incurred to protect investor accounts and the goodwill of our clients; and disruptions of services, including those provided by third parties, such as fund and portfolio recordkeeping, facilities, communications, power, and the mutual fund transfer agent and accounting systems.
our business is also subject to substantial governmental regulation, and changes in legal, regulatory, accounting, tax, and compliance requirements may have a substantial effect on our operations and results, including, but not limited to, effects on costs that we incur and effects on investor interest in mutual funds and investing in general or in particular classes of mutual funds or other investments.

item 7.   management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements for many reasons. see the factors set forth under the heading "forward looking statements" at the beginning of this annual report and in item 1(a) under the heading "risk factors." the following discussion is qualified in its entirety by, and should be read in conjunction with, the more detailed information contained in item 6 "selected financial data" and our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this annual report.
overview we are a leading global operator of regulated exchanges, clearing houses and listings venues, and a provider of data services for commodity and financial markets. we operate regulated marketplaces for listing, trading and clearing a broad array of derivatives and securities contracts across major asset classes, including energy and agricultural commodities, interest rates, equities, equity derivatives, exchange traded funds, credit derivatives, bonds and currencies. we offer end-to-end market data services to support the trading, investment, risk management and connectivity needs of customers across virtually all asset classes.
our exchanges include futures exchanges in the u.s., u.k., continental europe, canada and singapore, and cash equities, equity options and bond exchanges in the u.s. we also operate otc markets for physical energy and cds trade execution. to serve global derivatives markets, we operate central counterparty clearing houses in the u.s., u.k., continental europe, canada and singapore. we offer a range of data services for global financial and commodity markets, including pricing and reference data, exchange data, analytics, feeds, desktops and connectivity solutions. through our markets, clearing houses, listings and data services, we provide end-to-end solutions for our customers through liquid markets, benchmark products, access to capital markets, and related services to support their ability to manage risk and raise capital. our business is currently conducted as two reportable business segments, our trading and clearing segment and our data and listings segment, and the majority of our identifiable assets are located in the u.s. and u.k.
recent developments stock split on november 3, 2016, a 5-for-1 split of our common stock was effected in the form of a four share stock dividend per share of common stock to shareholders of record as of the close of market on october 27, 2016. the new shares began trading on a split-adjusted basis on november 4, 2016. all share and earnings per share information has been retroactively adjusted to reflect the stock split. we retired all of our outstanding treasury shares effective october 27, 2016, the record date.
acquisitions on october 3, 2016, we acquired from s&p global 100% of standard & poor's securities evaluations, inc., or spse, and 100% of credit market analysis for $431 million in cash. the cash consideration was funded from borrowings under our commercial paper program. spse, which has been renamed securities evaluations, is a provider of fixed income evaluated pricing and credit market analysis is a provider of independent data for the otc markets, including credit derivatives and bonds. securities evaluations and credit market analysis are part of the suite of pricing and analytics products and services that comprise ice data services. in order to comply with an order of the securities and exchange commission, services offered by securities evaluations will be managed and operated separately from the existing fixed income evaluated pricing services offered by interactive data, as we work through an integration approach. the acquisitions will enable us to offer customers new data and valuation services. refer to note 3 to our consolidated financial statements and related notes, which are included elsewhere in this annual report, for more information on this acquisition and the other acquisitions discussed below.
on june 30, 2016, we acquired a majority equity position in merscorp holdings, inc., owner of mortgage electronic registrations systems, inc., or collectively "mers". mers is a privately held, member-based organization that owns and manages the mers® system and is made up of thousands of lenders, servicers, sub-servicers, investors and government institutions. in addition, we have entered into a software development agreement to rebuild the mers® system to benefit the u.s. residential mortgage finance market. the mers® system is a national electronic registry that tracks the changes in servicing rights and beneficial ownership interests in u.s.-based mortgage loans. this new infrastructure is expected to shift its operation to an ice data center in the first half of 2018.
the terms of the mers acquisition include a right for us to purchase all of the remaining equity interests of mers after we satisfy our deliverables under the software development agreement. in addition, the mers equity holders may exercise a put option to require us to purchase all of the remaining equity interests of mers. each of these terms is subject to certain price provisions. because we do not have the ability to control mers' operations, we have recorded the purchase as an equity method investment and our ratable share of net income (loss) in mers in future periods will be recorded in our consolidated statements of income as equity earnings of our unconsolidated subsidiaries, below operating income in other income (loss).
on december 14, 2015, we acquired 100% of interactive data in a stock and cash transaction. the total purchase price was $5.6 billion comprised of cash consideration of $4.1 billion and 32.3 million shares of our common stock, on a post-split basis, and their results are included in our consolidated results effective from the acquisition date. the cash consideration is gross of $301 million of cash held by interactive data on the date of the acquisition. the cash consideration was funded from $2.5 billion of net proceeds received on november 24, 2015 in connection with the offering of new senior notes and $1.6 billion of borrowing under our commercial paper program.
on december 11, 2015, we acquired 100% of trayport in a stock transaction. trayport is a software company that licenses its technology to serve exchanges, otc brokers and traders to facilitate electronic and hybrid trade execution primarily in the energy markets. the total purchase price was $620 million, comprised of 12.6 million shares of our common stock, on a post-split basis, and their results are included in our consolidated results effective from the acquisition date.
the u.k. competition and markets authority, or the cma, undertook a review of our acquisition of trayport under the merger control laws of the u.k. during the pendency of the review, we did not integrate trayport into our existing business operations. on october 17, 2016, the cma issued its findings and ordered a divestment of trayport to remedy what the cma indicated it believed to be a substantial lessening of competition in the supply of trade execution services and trade clearing services to energy traders in the european economic area. in november 2016, we filed an appeal to challenge the cma's decision. the outcome of the appeal is expected to be determined in 2017. if our appeal is successful, the matter will be sent back to the cma for additional review. if our appeal is not successful, we will be forced to sell trayport and there is no certainty of the price we could receive if a sale were required. the timing of a final decision is uncertain at this time.
the functional currency of trayport is the pound sterling, as this is the currency in which trayport operates. the $620 million in trayport net assets were recorded on our december 11, 2015 opening balance sheet at a pound sterling/u.s. dollar exchange rate of 1.5218 (£407 million). because our consolidated financial statements are presented in u.s. dollars, we must translate the trayport net assets into u.s. dollars at exchange rates in effect at the end of each reporting period. therefore, increases or decreases in the value of the u.s. dollar against the pound sterling will affect the value of the trayport balance sheet, with gains or losses included in the cumulative translation adjustment account, a component of equity. as of the result of the decrease in the pounds sterling/u.s. dollar exchange rate to 1.2336 as of december 31, 2016, the portion of our equity attributable to the trayport net assets in accumulated other comprehensive loss from foreign currency translation was $117 million as of december 31, 2016. if we are required to sell trayport, we would include the accumulated translation adjustment when computing the gain or loss from the sale.
creditex customer relationship intangible asset impairment in august 2016, we sold certain of creditex's u.s. voice brokerage operations to tullett prebon. during the third quarter of 2016, we discontinued creditex's u.k. voice brokerage operations. we continue to operate creditex's electronically traded markets and systems, post-trade connectivity platforms and intellectual property.
we continued to monitor potential impairment triggering events in our cds trade execution business during 2016, including the impacts of divesting the brokerage business, changes in the business and regulatory climate in which the remaining business operates, the volatility in the capital markets, our recent operating performance and our current financial projections. based on an analysis of these factors, it was determined that the carrying value of the cds creditex customer relationship intangible asset was not fully recoverable and an impairment of the asset was recorded in september 2016 for $33 million. the impairment was recorded as amortization expense in the accompanying consolidated statements of income for the year ended december 31, 2016. as of december 31, 2016, the remaining creditex customer relationship intangible asset is $14 million and will continue to be amortized over the remaining useful life through august 2020.

•   total revenues, less transaction-based expenses, increased $1.2 billion for the year ended december 31, 2016, from the comparable period in 2015, primarily due to our acquisitions of interactive data, trayport, securities evaluations and credit
market analysis, and to a lesser extent, revenue increases in our exchange-related data services and brent crude and agricultural transaction and clearing. we recognized $1.1 billion in interactive data, trayport, securities evaluations and credit market analysis data services revenues for the year ended december 31, 2016, compared to $50 million in interactive data and trayport data services revenues for the year ended december 31, 2015, subsequent to their acquisitions in december 2015. partially offsetting the revenue increases were unfavorable foreign exchange effects of $59 million arising from the strengthening u.s. dollar (primarily impacting revenues billed in pounds sterling), for the year ended december 31, 2016 from the comparable period in 2015.
•   total revenues, less transaction-based expenses, increased $246 million for the year ended december 31, 2015, from the comparable period in 2014, primarily due to increases in our data services revenues, listings revenues and brent crude transaction and clearing revenues. the data services fee revenues increase was partially due to $50 million in data services revenues from interactive data and trayport during the year ended december 31, 2015, subsequent to their acquisitions. these revenue increases were partially offset by decreases in certain interest rate transaction and clearing revenues compared to the prior year period. also partially offsetting the revenue increases were unfavorable foreign exchange effects of $55 million arising from the strengthening u.s. dollar (primarily impacting revenues billed in pounds sterling and euros), for the year ended december 31, 2015 from the comparable period in 2014.
•   total operating expenses increased $744 million for the year ended december 31, 2016, from the comparable period in 2015, primarily due to increased operating expenses relating to interactive data, trayport, securities evaluations and credit market analysis and $33 million relating to the creditex customer relationship intangible asset impairment recorded in september 2016. excluding acquisition-related transaction and integration costs, we recognized $812 million in interactive data, trayport, securities evaluations and credit market analysis operating expenses for the year ended december 31, 2016, compared to $39 million in interactive data and trayport operating expenses for the year ended december 31, 2015, subsequent to their acquisitions in december 2015. these increases were partially offset by decreases in professional services expenses and selling, general and administrative expenses for the year ended december 31, 2016, from the comparable period in 2015. also partially offsetting the operating expense increases were favorable foreign exchange effects of $40 million arising from the strengthening u.s. dollar (primarily impacting operating expenses incurred in pounds sterling) for the year ended december 31, 2016, from the comparable period in 2015.
•   total operating expenses decreased $56 million for the year ended december 31, 2015, from the comparable period in 2014, primarily due to decreases in acquisition-related transaction and integration costs, professional services expenses, rent and occupancy expenses, and selling, general and administrative expenses. operating expenses also decreased due to the impact of a strengthening u.s. dollar on our foreign currency exchange rates (primarily for those operating expenses incurred in pounds sterling and euros), which reduced our operating expenses by $17 million for the year ended december 31, 2015, from the comparable period in 2014. these decreases were partially offset by increases in depreciation expenses compared to the prior year period primarily due to fixed asset additions relating to the nyse integration and real estate expenditures relating primarily to the atlanta and new york headquarters. we also had increases in operating expenses during the year ended december 31, 2015 of $39 million from interactive data and trayport (excluding acquisition-related transaction and integration costs), subsequent to their acquisitions.
•   the lower effective tax rate and income tax expense for the year ended december 31, 2015 are primarily due to the deferred tax benefit associated with future u.k. income tax rate reductions along with certain favorable settlements with various taxing authorities.
business environment and market trends our business environment has been characterized by industry consolidation and increasing competition among global markets for trading, clearing and listings; the globalization of exchanges, customers and competitors; market participants' rising demand for speed, data capacity and connectivity, which requires ongoing investment in technology; evolving and disparate regulation across multiple jurisdictions; and increasing focus on capital and cost efficiencies.
price volatility increases the need to hedge risk and creates demand among market participants for the exchange of risk through trading and clearing. market liquidity is one of the primary market attributes for attracting and maintaining customers and is an important indicator of a market's strength. in addition, the ability to evolve existing products to serve emerging needs, develop new products and respond to competitive dynamics in pricing, exclusivity and consolidation is important to our business. changes in these and other factors could cause our revenues to fluctuate from period to period and these fluctuations may affect the reliability of period to period comparisons of our revenues and operating results. for additional information regarding the factors that affect our results of operations, see item 1(a) "risk factors" included elsewhere in this annual report.
the implementation of new laws or regulations or the uncertainty around potential changes may impact participation in our markets, or the demand for our clearing and data services either favorably or unfavorably. many of the recent changes with regard to
global financial reform have emphasized the importance of transparent markets, centralized clearing and access to data, all of which are important aspects of our product offering. however, some of the proposed rules have yet to be implemented and some rules that have already been propagated are being reconsidered. in europe, final regulations related to mifid ii have not yet been implemented and significant uncertainties and ambiguities remain around such regulations. as this is established, legislative and regulatory actions may change the way we conduct our business and may create uncertainty for market participants, which could affect trading volumes or demand for market data. as a result, it is difficult to predict all of the effects that the legislation and its implementing regulations will have on us. as discussed more fully in item 1 "- business - regulation" included elsewhere in this annual report, the implementation of mifid ii and other regulations may result in operational, regulatory and/or business risk.
in recent years, low interest rates and uncertainty in the financial markets continued to reflect the impact of a relatively slow or yet to occur global economic recovery. lower growth in asia and the european union may also continue to affect global financial markets. in addition, economic and regulatory uncertainty, coupled with periods of high market volatility around geopolitical events, low interest rates and low oil and natural gas prices has affected our clients' activities in recent years. the duration of these trends will determine the continued impact on our business across trading and listings. we have diversified our business so that we are not dependent on volatility or trading activity in any one asset class. in addition, we have increased our portion of non-transaction and clearing revenues from 13% in 2012 to 57% in 2016. this non-transaction revenue includes data services, listings and other revenues. we continue to focus on our strategy to grow each of our revenue streams, as well as on our company-wide expense reduction initiatives and our synergies in connection with our acquisitions in order to mitigate these uncertainties and to build on our growth opportunities by leveraging our proprietary data, clearing and markets.
in recent years, financial institutions and corporations have acted to control spending, including on financial information and related services. yet many of the data products and services we sell are required for our clients' business operations regardless of market volatility or shifts in business profitability levels. while we expect that cost containment pressures will continue, we anticipate that there will continue to be growth in the financial information services sector driven by a number of global trends, including the following: increasing global regulatory demands; greater use of fair value accounting standards and reliance on independent valuations; greater emphasis on risk management; market fragmentation driven by regulatory changes; the move to passive investing and indexation; ongoing growth in the size and diversity of financial markets; increased electronification of fixed income and other less automated markets; the development of new data products; the demand for greater data capacity and connectivity; new entrants; and increasing demand for outsourced services by financial institutions. we contract with clients through data fixed-fee subscriptions, variable fees based on usage or a combination of fixed-fee subscription and usage-based fees. in addition, some of our data services generate one-time or non-recurring revenue, such as one-time purchases of historical data, set-up services or implementation fees.
segment reporting we operated as a single reportable business segment as of december 31, 2015 but began operating as two operating segments in the first quarter of 2016 following our acquisition of interactive data. as of december 31, 2016, we continue to operate as two business segments: our trading and clearing segment and our data and listings segment. this presentation is reflective of how our chief operating decision maker reviews and operates our business. our trading and clearing segment comprises our transaction-based execution and clearing businesses. our data and listings segment comprises our subscription-based data services and securities listings businesses. our chief operating decision maker does not review total assets, intersegment revenues/expenses or statements of income below operating income by segments; therefore, such information is not presented below.
while revenues are allocated directly to segments, a significant portion of our operating expenses are not solely related to a specific segment because the expenses serve functions that are necessary for the operation of both segments. because these expenses do not relate to a single segment, we have employed a reasonable allocation method to allocate expenses between the segments for presentation purposes. we have elected to use a pro-rata revenue approach as the allocation method for the expenses that do not relate solely to one segment. further, precise allocation of expenses to specific revenue streams within these segments is not reasonably possible. accordingly, we did not allocate expenses to specific revenue streams within the segments.
trading and clearing segment the following charts and table present our selected statements of income data for our trading and clearing segment, from continuing operations (dollars in millions):

transaction and clearing revenues overview our transaction and clearing revenues are reported on a net basis, except for the nyse transaction-based expenses discussed below, and consist of fees collected from our derivatives trading and clearing, and from our cash trading and equity options exchanges. in our derivatives markets, we earn transaction and clearing revenues from both counterparties to each contract that is traded and/or cleared, and in our equity and equity options markets, we receive trade execution fees as well as routing fees related to orders in our markets which are routed to other markets for execution.
rates per-contract are driven by the number of contracts or securities traded and the fees charged per contract, net of certain rebates. our per-contract transaction and clearing revenues will depend upon many factors, including, but not limited to, market conditions, transaction and clearing volume, product mix, pricing, applicable revenue sharing and market making agreements, and new product introductions. because transaction and clearing revenues are generally assessed on a per-contract basis, revenues and profitability fluctuate with changes in contract volume and, though not to the same degree, due to product mix.
for the years ended december 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, 19%, 20% and 26%, respectively, of our trading and clearing segment revenues, less transaction-based expenses, were billed in pounds sterling or euros. as the pound sterling or euro exchange rate changes, the u.s. equivalent of revenues denominated in foreign currencies changes accordingly. due to the weakening of the pound sterling and euro the last two years compared to the u.s. dollar, our trading and clearing segment revenues, less transaction-based expenses, decreased $35 million for the year ended december 31, 2016 from the comparable period in 2015, and decreased $49 million for the year ended december 31, 2015 from the comparable period in 2014. see item 3 "- quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk - foreign currency exchange rate risk" below for additional information on the impact of currency fluctuations.
our transaction and clearing fees are presented net of rebates. we recorded rebates of $674 million, $563 million and $466 million for the years ended december 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. we offer rebates in certain of our markets primarily to support market liquidity and trading volume by providing qualified participants in those markets a discount to the applicable commission rate. such rebates are calculated based on volumes traded. the increase in the rebates is due primarily to an increase
in the number of participants in the rebate programs offered on various contracts, an increase in our traded volume and an increase in the number of rebate programs.
commodities markets we operate global crude oil and refined oil futures markets, including the ice brent, ice wti and ice gasoil futures and options contracts, as well as over 400 refined oil futures products that relate to our benchmark futures contracts. the ice brent crude futures contract is relied upon by a broad range of global market participants, including oil producing nations and multinational companies, to price and hedge their crude oil production and consumption. ice gasoil is a key refined oil benchmark in europe and asia. total oil volume and revenues increased 12% and 10%, respectively, for the year ended december 31, 2016, from the comparable period in 2015, and increased 17% and 14%, respectively, for the year ended december 31, 2015, from the comparable period in 2014.
in 2016, ice brent crude futures and options contracts produced the twentieth consecutive year of record volume. ice brent crude futures and options volume increased 15% for the year ended december 31, 2016, from the comparable period in 2015, and increased 14% for the year ended december 31, 2015, from the comparable period in 2014. ice wti crude futures and options volume increased 16% for the year ended december 31, 2016, from the comparable period in 2015, and increased 26% for the year ended december 31, 2015, from the comparable period in 2014. ice brent crude and ice wti crude futures and options volume increased primarily due to increased oil price volatility; broader market volatility in oil products, equities and foreign exchange rates; acts of central governments; outcomes of elections; and uncertainty around opec policy.
our global natural gas futures and options volume declined 2% and revenues increased 4% for the year ended december 31, 2016, from the comparable period in 2015, respectively, and volume declined 4% and revenues increased 3% for the year ended december 31, 2015, from the comparable period in 2014, respectively. global natural gas volume declined the last two years due to lower price volatility related to high natural gas supplies but revenues increased due to geographic product mix.
total volume and revenues in our agricultural and metals futures and options markets increased 11% and 8%, respectively, for the year ended december 31, 2016, from the comparable period in 2015, and increased 13% and 11%, respectively, for the year ended december 31, 2015, from the comparable period in 2014. volume in our largest agricultural contract, sugar futures and options, remained flat for the year ended december 31, 2016, from the comparable period in 2015, and increased 18% for the year ended december 31, 2015, from the comparable period in 2014. volume in our other agricultural and metal futures and options volume increased 21% for the year ended december 31, 2016, from the comparable period in 2015 and increased 9% for the year ended december 31, 2015, from the comparable period in 2014. the increases in agricultural volume were primarily driven by increased price volatility due to changing supply and demand expectations largely related to weather and production levels.
financial markets financial futures and options volume increased 10% and revenues decreased 6%, respectively, for the year ended december 31, 2016, from the comparable period in 2015, and decreased 9% and 14%, respectively, for the year ended december 31, 2015, from the comparable period in 2014. interest rate futures and options volume increased 12% for the year ended december 31, 2016, from the comparable period in 2015, and decreased 11% for the year ended december 31, 2015, from the comparable period in 2014. interest rate futures and options volume increased for the year ended december 31, 2016 primarily due to uncertainty around central bank actions, economic data during 2016, and the u.k.'s decision to exit the european union. revenues decreased while volume increased for the interest rates futures and options for the year ended december 31, 2016 primarily due to the impact of foreign currency translation and increased market making rebates that apply at higher volume levels.
other financial futures and options volume increased 5% for the year ended december 31, 2016, from the comparable period in 2015, and decreased 4% for the year ended december 31, 2015, from the comparable period in 2014. other financial futures and options volume increased for the year ended december 31, 2016 primarily due to changes in price volatility in equity indexes driven by equity market volatility. volume in our msci futures and options contracts increased 49% for the year ended december 31, 2016, from the comparable period in 2015, due to global equity market volatility.
cash equities handled volume increased 6% for the year ended december 31, 2016, from the comparable period in 2015, primarily due to increased market volatility during the first half of 2016. cash equities handled volume increased 13% for the year ended december 31, 2015, from the comparable period in 2014, primarily due to increased market volatility throughout 2015. cash equities revenues, net of transaction-based expenses, were $223 million, $220 million and $188 million for the years ended december 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.
equity options volume decreased 5% for the year ended december 31, 2016, compared to the same period in 2015, and decreased 20% for the year ended december 31, 2015, from the comparable period in 2014. equity options revenues, net of
transaction-based expenses, were $98 million, $112 million and $145 million for the years ended december 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. equity options volume and revenues decreased the last several years primarily due to the restructuring of the nyse amex options business. while revenues declined the last several years, the overall financial contribution of equity options was consistent with the prior years due to the retention of a higher percentage of profits from nyse amex options driven by our repurchase of the equity in the exchange from the minority shareholders.
cds clearing revenues were $107 million, $100 million and $97 million for the years ended december 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. the notional value of cds cleared during the same periods were $11.5 trillion, $11.9 trillion and $13.7 trillion, respectively. buyside participation at our u.s. cds clearing house, ice clear credit, reached record levels in terms of number of participants and notional cleared due to increased participation from both u.s. and european buyside customers due to greater regulatory certainty, the breadth of products offered, and cost efficient margining in the u.s. relative to europe.
cds trade execution revenues were $36 million, $49 million and $64 million for the years ended december 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. the notional value of the underlying cds traded was $417.2 billion, $867.7 billion and $1.0 trillion for the years ended december 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. cds trading remains muted due to financial reform implementation and lower volatility in corporate credit markets. the decrease in the cds trade execution revenues for the year ended december 31, 2016 is also impacted by the sale and discontinuance of our u.s. and u.k. cds voice brokerage operations in the third quarter of 2016.
other revenues other revenues include interest income on certain clearing margin deposits, regulatory penalties and fines, fees for use of our facilities, regulatory fees charged to member organizations of our u.s. securities exchanges, designated market maker service fees, exchange membership fees and agricultural grading and certification fees. the increase in other revenues for the year ended december 31, 2015, from the comparable period in 2014, is primarily due to increases in the interest income recognized on certain clearing margin deposits and fees earned on non-cash collateral placed by clearing members primarily due to fee changes and increased clearing margin deposits.

open interest is the aggregate number of contracts (long or short) that clearing members hold either for their own account or on behalf of their clients. open interest refers to the total number of contracts that are currently open - in other words, contracts that have been traded but not yet liquidated by either an offsetting trade, exercise, expiration or assignment. open interest is also a measure of the future activity remaining to be closed out in terms of the number of contracts that members and their clients continue to hold in the particular contract and by the number of contracts held for each contract month listed by the exchange. the following table presents our year-end open interest for our futures and options contracts (in thousands, except for percentages).

transaction-based expenses our equities and equity options markets pay fees to the sec pursuant to section 31 of the exchange act. section 31 fees collected from customers are recorded on a gross basis as a component of transaction and clearing fee revenue. these section 31 fees are designed to recover the government's costs of supervising and regulating the securities markets and securities professionals. we, in turn, collect activity assessment fees, which are included in transaction and clearing revenues in our consolidated statements of income, from member organizations clearing or settling trades on the equities and options exchanges and recognize these amounts when invoiced. the activity assessment fees are designed so that they are equal to the section 31 fees which are included in transaction-based expenses in our consolidated statements of income. as a result, activity assessment fees and section 31 fees do not have an impact on our net income. activity assessment fees received are included in cash at the time of
receipt and, as required by law, the amount due to the sec is remitted semi-annually and recorded as an accrued liability until paid. as of december 31, 2016, the accrued liability related to the un-remitted sec section 31 fees was $131 million.
we also incur liquidity payments made to cash and options trading customers and routing charges made to other exchanges that are included in transaction-based expenses. we incur routing charges when we do not have the best bid or offer in the market for a security that a customer is trying to buy or sell on one of our securities exchanges. in that case, we route the customer's order to the external market center that displays the best bid or offer. the external market center charges us a fee per share (denominated in tenths of a cent per share) for routing to its system. we record routing charges on a gross basis as a component of transaction and clearing fee revenue.
operating expenses, operating income and operating margin trading and clearing segment operating expenses decreased $35 million for the year ended december 31, 2016, from the comparable period in 2015 (with the decrease being partially offset by the $33 million creditex customer relationship intangible asset impairment expense recorded in september 2016), and decreased $96 million for the year ended december 31, 2015, from the comparable period in 2014. see "- consolidated operating expenses" below.
trading and clearing segment operating income increased $75 million for the year ended december 31, 2016, from the comparable period in 2015, and increased $124 million for the year ended december 31, 2015, from the comparable period in 2014. trading and clearing segment operating margins were 58%, 56% and 50% for the years ended december 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. the operating income and operating margin increases the last two years were driven by the revenue increases and operating expense decreases discussed above.
trading and clearing segment adjusted operating expenses were $770 million, $809 million and $868 million for the years ended december 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. trading and clearing segment adjusted operating income was $1.3 billion, $1.3 billion and $1.2 billion for the years for the years ended december 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. trading and clearing segment adjusted operating margins were 63%, 61% and 57% for the years for the years ended december 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. see "- non-gaap financial measures" below.

data services revenues the data and listings segment represents subscription-based, or recurring, revenue businesses that relate to data services and listings services offered across ice, nyse and ice data services. through ice data services, we generate revenues from a range of data services, including the dissemination of our exchange and evaluated pricing data and analytics, desktops and connectivity and exchange market data. through nyse, nyse mkt and nyse arca, we generate listings revenue related to the provision of listings services for public companies and etfs, and related corporate actions for listed companies.
our pricing and analytics services consist of an extensive set of independent evaluated pricing services focused primarily on fixed income and international equity securities, valuation services, reference data, market data, end of day pricing, fixed income, equity portfolio analytics and risk management analytics. we also serve as an administrator of regulated benchmarks, including libor, the ice swap rate and the lbma gold price. our index services offer a range of products across fixed income, energy, equities, etfs and other asset classes to provide the methodology, pricing and licensing of key benchmarks.
our desktop and connectivity services comprise technology-based information platforms, feeds and connectivity. these include trading applications, desktop solutions and data feeds to support trading, voice brokers and investment functions. our desktop and web-based applications deliver real-time market information, analytical and decision support tools to support trading and investment decisions. through our consolidated feeds, clients receive consolidated real-time and/or delayed financial data from global exchanges, trading venues and data sources for exchange-traded and otc markets. our connectivity services offer a secure, resilient, private multi-participant network that provides connectivity to global exchanges and content service providers. our connectivity infrastructure managed services solution also offers colocation space, direct exchange access, proximity hosting and support services that enable access to real-time exchange data and facilitates low latency electronic trading.
our exchange data primarily represents subscription fees for the provision of our market data that is created from activity in our trading and clearing segment. in our derivatives markets, exchange data fees primarily relate to subscription fees charged for customer and license access from third party data vendors, or quote vendors such as thomson reuters and bloomberg, and from end users, as well as view-only data access, direct access services, terminal access, daily indices, forward curves and other valuation services, and end of day reports.
we earn exchange data fees relating to our cash equity and options markets, and related data and network services. we collect cash trading market data fees principally for consortium-based data products and, to a lesser extent, for nyse proprietary data products. consortium-based data fees are determined by the securities industry plans and are charged to vendors based on their redistribution of data. consortium-based data revenues (net of administrative costs) are distributed to participating securities markets on the basis of a formula set by the sec under regulation nms. last trade prices and quotes in new york stock exchange-listed, nyse mkt-listed, and nyse arca-listed securities are disseminated through "tape a" and "tape b," which constitute the majority of our revenues from consortium-based market data revenues.
our data services revenues increased during the year ended december 31, 2016, from the comparable period in 2015, primarily due to the acquisitions of interactive data and trayport in december 2015, the acquisitions of securities evaluations and credit market analysis in october 2016, the high retention rate of existing customers, the addition of new customers, increased usage by existing customers and the development of new and enhanced products designed to efficiently deliver more value to our customers. these increases were partially offset due to the impact of foreign currency translation. we recognized $1.1 billion in
data services revenues for interactive data, trayport, securities evaluations and credit market analysis during the year ended december 31, 2016, compared to $50 million in data services revenues for interactive data and trayport during year ended december 31, 2015, subsequent to their acquisitions dates.
our data services revenues increased during the year ended december 31, 2015, from the comparable period in 2014, primarily due to the addition of new users, increased usage by customers, expanded product offerings, fee increases and the addition of superderivatives and ice benchmark administration for all of 2015 and interactive data and trayport subsequent to their acquisitions in december 2015.
for the years ended december 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, 12%, 4% and 4%, respectively, of our data and listings segment revenues were billed in pounds sterling or euros (all relating to our data services revenues). as the pound sterling or euro exchange rate changes, the u.s. equivalent of revenues denominated in foreign currencies changes accordingly. due to the weakening of the pound sterling and euro the last two years compared to the u.s. dollar, our data services revenues decreased $24 million for the year ended december 31, 2016 from the comparable period in 2015, and decreased $6 million for the year ended december 31, 2015 from the comparable period in 2014. see item 3 "- quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk - foreign currency exchange rate risk" below for additional information on the impact of currency fluctuations.
listings revenues we recognize listings revenues in our securities markets from two types of fees applicable to companies listed on our cash equities exchanges - original listing fees and annual listing fees. original listing fees consist of two components: initial listing fees and fees related to other corporate-related actions. initial listing fees, subject to a minimum and maximum amount, are based on the number of shares that a company initially lists. initial listing fees are recognized as revenue on a straight-line basis over estimated service periods of nine years for nyse and five years for nyse arca and nyse mkt. u.s. companies pay annual fees based on the number of outstanding shares the company has and non-u.s. companies pay annual fees based on the number of outstanding shares the company has issued or held in the u.s. annual fees are recognized as revenue on a pro rata basis over the calendar year.
in addition, other corporate actions-related listing fees are paid by listed companies in connection with actions involving the issuance of new shares, such as stock splits, rights issues and sales of additional securities, as well as mergers and acquisitions. other corporate actions-related listing fees are recognized as revenue on a straight-line basis over estimated service periods of six years for nyse and three years for nyse arca and nyse mkt. unamortized balances are recorded as deferred revenue in our consolidated balance sheet.
listings revenues increased for the last two years primarily due to the amortization of the original listing fees earned since the acquisition of nyse and due to additional annual listing fee revenue from new customers. the listings unamortized deferred revenue balance as of december 31, 2016 of $149 million relates to original and other corporate action listing fees incurred and billed and not yet recognized as revenue subsequent to the november 13, 2013 acquisition through december 31, 2016.
operating expenses, operating income and operating margin data and listings segment operating expenses increased $779 million for the year ended december 31, 2016, from the comparable period in 2015, and increased $40 million for the year ended december 31, 2015, from the comparable period in 2014. the increases primarily relate to the $812 million in operating expenses recognized relating to interactive data, trayport, securities evaluations and credit market analysis for the year ended december 31, 2016, compared to $39 million in operating expenses recognized relating to interactive data and trayport for the year ended december 31, 2015 (both excluding acquisition-related transaction and integration costs). see "- consolidated operating expenses" below for further details on the interactive data, trayport, securities evaluations and credit market analysis operating expenses.
data and listings segment operating income increased $342 million for the year ended december 31, 2016, from the comparable period in 2015, and increased $178 million for the year ended december 31, 2015, from the comparable period in 2014. data and listings segment operating margins were 39%, 47% and 40% for the years ended december 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. the operating income increases the last two years were driven by the acquisitions discussed above.
data and listings segment adjusted operating expenses were $1.2 billion, $556 million and $521 million for the years ended december 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. data and listings adjusted operating income was $1.2 billion, $720 million and $537 million for the years for the years ended december 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. data and listings adjusted operating margins were 51%, 56% and 51% for the years for the years ended december 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. see "- non-gaap financial measures" below.
consolidated operating expenses the majority of our operating expenses do not vary directly with changes in our volume and revenues, except for certain technology and communication expenses and a portion of our compensation expense that is tied directly to our financial performance, as discussed below. the following chart and table present our operating expenses from continuing operations (dollars in millions):
2016                                                                                 2015          change                2015                2014          change compensation and benefits                                    $945                $611            55     %            $611                $592             3   %

total operating expenses                                   $2,332              $1,588            47     %          $1,588              $1,644            (3   )%
we expect our operating expenses to increase in absolute terms in future periods in connection with our acquisitions and growth of our business, and to vary from year to year based on the type and level of our acquisitions and other investments.
for the years ended december 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, 18%, 12% and 18%, respectively, of our consolidated operating expenses were incurred in pounds sterling or euros. as the pound sterling or euro exchange rate changes, the u.s. equivalent of operating expenses denominated in foreign currencies changes accordingly. due to the weakening of the pound sterling and euro the last two years compared to the u.s. dollar, our consolidated operating expenses decreased $40 million for the year ended december 31, 2016 from the comparable period in 2015, and decreased $17 million for the year ended december 31, 2015 from the comparable period in 2014. see item 3 "- quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk - foreign currency exchange rate risk" below for additional information on the impact of currency fluctuations.
compensation and benefits expenses compensation and benefits expense is our most significant operating expense and includes non-capitalized employee wages, bonuses, non-cash or stock compensation, certain severance costs, benefits and employer taxes. the bonus component of our compensation and benefits expense is based on both our financial performance and the individual employee performance and the performance-based restricted stock compensation expense is also based on our financial performance. therefore, our compensation and benefits expense will vary year to year based on our financial performance and fluctuations in the number of employees.
compensation and benefits expenses increased for the last two years primarily due to increases in employee headcount. our employee headcount increased primarily due to the acquisitions of interactive data, trayport, securities evaluations, credit market analysis, superderivatives, singapore mercantile exchange and holland clearing house, converting contractor roles to employees at nyse, and hiring for clearing, technology, regulation and compliance. headcount increased from 2,879 employees at december 31, 2013 (excluding the euronext and nyse technologies employees) to 2,902 employees as of december 31, 2014, increased to 5,549 employees as of december 31, 2015, and increased to 5,631 employees as of december 31, 2016. we recognized $342 million in compensation and benefits expenses relating to the interactive data, trayport, securities evaluations and credit market analysis acquisitions during the year ended december 31, 2016, compared to $17 million in compensation and benefits expenses relating to interactive data and trayport during the year ended december 31, 2015, subsequent to their acquisitions. the employee increases associated with these acquisitions were partially offset by employee terminations for the years ended december 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 for nyse and for the year ended december 31, 2016 for interactive data, in connection with our integrations.
we recorded $33 million, $20 million and $99 million in nyse and interactive data employee severance costs during the years ended december 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively, with such costs included in the acquisition-related transaction and integration costs discussed below and primarily related to executive departures. in addition, we incurred non-acquisition related employee severance costs of $10 million, $3 million and $4 million for the years ended december 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. non-cash compensation expenses recognized in our consolidated financial statements for employee stock options and restricted stock were $123 million, $111 million and $82 million for the years ended december 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. the increases in non-cash compensation expenses primarily relates to a greater number of employees receiving non-cash awards due to the headcount increases discussed above.
professional services expenses this expense includes fees for consulting services received on strategic and technology initiatives, temporary labor, as well as regulatory, legal and accounting fees. this expense may fluctuate as a result of changes in consulting and technology services, temporary labor, and regulatory, accounting and legal proceedings.
we recognized $34 million in professional services expenses relating to interactive data, trayport, securities evaluations and credit market analysis during the year ended december 31, 2016, compared to $2 million in professional services expenses for interactive data and trayport during the year ended december 31, 2015, subsequent to their acquisitions. excluding the impact of the acquisitions, professional services expenses decreased the last two years primarily due to the continued reduction in professional services and contractors at nyse. we eliminated or replaced certain contractor positions with full time employees at nyse. in addition, during the year ended december 31, 2016, we recorded a credit from a third party service provider related to fees charged during 2015, and we incurred lower legal fees during the year ended december 31, 2016, from the comparable period in 2015. legal fees, which are included in professional services expenses, primarily related to class action lawsuits in which nyse is a defendant.
acquisition-related transaction and integration costs we incurred $80 million in acquisition-related transaction and integration costs during the year ended december 31, 2016, primarily relating to our integration of interactive data and nyse, legal and professional fees related to the trayport cma review, our investment in mers, our acquisitions of securities evaluations and credit market analysis, and various other potential and discontinued acquisitions. of this amount, $41 million was primarily related to fees for investment banking advisors, lawyers,
accountants, tax advisors and other external costs directly related to the completed 2016 acquisitions and to other transactions. we incurred $39 million for interactive data and nyse integration costs during the year ended december 31, 2016, primarily relating to employee and lease termination costs and professional services costs. as of december 31, 2016, the integration of nyse has been completed and we will no longer include any nyse integration costs in the future.
we incurred $88 million in acquisition-related transaction and integration costs during the year ended december 31, 2015, primarily relating to our acquisitions of interactive data and trayport and the integration of nyse. of this amount, $46 million was primarily related to fees for investment banking advisors, lawyers, accountants, tax advisors and other external costs directly related to the interactive data and trayport acquisitions and to other transactions. we incurred $42 million for nyse integration costs during the year ended december 31, 2015, primarily relating to employee and lease termination costs and professional services costs.
we incurred $129 million in acquisition-related transaction and integration costs during the year ended december 31, 2014, primarily relating to our acquisition and integration of nyse and the acquisitions of ice futures singapore, superderivatives, ice clear netherlands and true office. of this amount, $6 million was related to fees for investment banking advisors, lawyers, accountants, tax advisors and public relations firms, and other external costs directly related to the transactions. the remaining $123 million was for nyse integration costs incurred during the year ended december 31, 2014, primarily relating to employee termination costs, costs incurred relating to the euronext ipo and sale, costs incurred relating to the sale of nyse technologies, and professional service costs.
we expect to continue to explore and pursue various potential acquisitions and other strategic opportunities to strengthen our competitive position and support our growth. as a result, we may incur acquisition-related transaction costs in future periods. see "- non-gaap financial measures" below.
technology and communication expenses technology support services consist of costs for running our wholly-owned data centers, hosting costs paid to third-party data centers, and maintenance of our computer hardware and software required to support our technology. these costs are driven by system capacity, functionality and redundancy requirements. communication expenses consist of costs for network connection for our electronic platforms, telecommunications costs, and fees paid for access to external market data. this expense also includes licensing and other fee agreement expenses which may be impacted by growth in electronic contract volume, our capacity requirements, changes in the number of telecommunications hubs and connections with customers to access our electronic platforms directly.
we recognized $162 million in technology and communication expenses relating to interactive data, trayport, securities evaluations and credit market analysis during the year ended december 31, 2016, compared to $8 million in technology and communication expenses for interactive data and trayport during the year ended december 31, 2015, subsequent to their acquisitions. in addition, during the last two years, we incurred increased hardware and software support costs related to our trading and clearing platforms and our data services.
rent and occupancy expenses this expense consists of costs related to leased and owned property including rent, maintenance, real estate taxes, utilities and other related costs. we have significant operations located in and around atlanta, new york, london and boston with smaller offices located throughout the world. see "item 2 - properties" above for additional information regarding our leased and owned property.
we recognized $28 million in rent and occupancy expenses relating to interactive data, trayport, securities evaluations and credit market analysis during the year ended december 31, 2016, compared to $1 million in rent and occupancy expenses for interactive data and trayport during the year ended december 31, 2015, subsequent to their acquisitions. excluding the impact of the acquisitions, rent and occupancy expenses decreased the last two years primarily due to reduced rent and occupancy costs realized due to the continued consolidation of our new york, atlanta and london office locations.
selling, general and administrative expenses this expense relates to expenses from marketing, advertising, public relations, insurance, bank service charges, dues and subscriptions, travel and entertainment, non-income taxes and other general and administrative costs.
we recognized $22 million in selling, general and administrative expenses relating to interactive data, trayport, securities evaluations and credit market analysis during the year ended december 31, 2016, compared to $1 million in selling, general and administrative expenses for interactive data and trayport during the year ended december 31, 2015, subsequent to their acquisitions. excluding the impact of the acquisitions, selling, general and administrative expenses decreased the last two years primarily due to the release of non-income tax-related reserves and lower marketing expenses.
depreciation and amortization expenses depreciation and amortization expense results from depreciation of long-lived assets such as buildings, leasehold improvements, planes, furniture, fixtures and equipment over their estimated useful lives. this expense includes amortization of intangible assets obtained in our acquisitions of businesses, as well as on various licensing agreements, over their estimated useful lives. intangible assets subject to amortization consist primarily of customer relationships, trading products with finite lives and technology. this expense also includes amortization of internally developed and purchased software over their estimated useful lives.
we recorded amortization expenses on the intangible assets acquired as part of our acquisitions, as well as on the other intangible assets, of $356 million, $160 million and $151 million for the years ended december 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. we recognized $182 million and $8 million in amortization expenses on the interactive data, trayport, securities evaluations and credit market analysis intangible assets during the years ended december 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. we recorded an impairment of the creditex customer relationship intangible asset of $33 million during the year ended december 31, 2016, which was recorded as amortization expense. see "- recent developments - creditex customer relationship intangible asset impairment" above. the increases in amortization expenses for the year ended december 31, 2016 discussed above were partially offset by a reduction in amortization expenses recorded on intangible assets which became fully amortized during 2016, primarily related to certain of the nyse intangible assets.
we recorded depreciation expenses on our fixed assets of $254 million, $213 million and $182 million for the years ended december 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. we recognized $42 million and $2 million in depreciation expenses on the interactive data, trayport, securities evaluations and credit market analysis during the years ended december 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. in addition to the impact of the acquisitions, depreciation expenses increased for the year ended december 31, 2015 primarily due to additional fixed asset additions and capitalized internally developed software, including additions relating to the nyse integration and real estate expenditures during the last several years relating primarily to the atlanta, new york and london headquarters.
non-operating income (expenses)
income and expenses incurred through activities outside of our core operations are considered non-operating. the following tables present our non-operating income (expenses) (dollars in millions):
2016                                                                2015                     change   2015                         2014          change other income (expense):
interest expense increased for the year ended december 31, 2016, from the comparable period in 2015, primarily due to the interest expense we recognized on the additional debt incurred to finance the interactive data acquisition in december 2015. interest expense increased for the year ended december 31, 2015, from the comparable period in 2014, primarily due to interest expense that we recognized relating to new debt we incurred for the interactive data acquisition during the fourth quarter of 2015, partially offset by the repayment of $1.0 billion in nyse eur notes on june 30, 2015. see "- debt" below.
during the year ended december 31, 2015, we incurred $15 million in settlements and accruals for various outstanding legal matters (net of insurance proceeds), which was recorded in other expense.
we incurred foreign currency transaction losses of $1 million, $14 million and $2 million for the years ended december 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. foreign currency gains and losses are recorded in other income (expense) and relate to the settlement of foreign currency assets, liabilities and payables that occur through our foreign operations that are received in non-functional currencies due to the increase or decrease in the period-end foreign currency exchange rates between periods. see item 7a
"- quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk - foreign currency exchange rate risk" included elsewhere in this annual report for more information on these items.
for consolidated subsidiaries in which our ownership is less than 100%, and for which we have control over the assets, liabilities and management of the entity, the outside stockholders' interests are shown as non-controlling interests. during the years ended december 31, 2015 and 2014, we repurchased the remaining ownership of nyse amex options from the minority owners. effective from july 1, 2015, all of the profits from nyse amex options are retained by us as we now own 100% of nyse amex options. see note 13 to our consolidated financial statements and related notes, which are included elsewhere is this annual report, for additional information on nyse amex options. the decrease in the net income attributable to non-controlling interest for the year ended december 31, 2015, from the comparable period in 2014, is primarily due to a decrease in the net income relating to the nyse amex options minority ownership interest primarily due to the reduction in the minority ownership percentage.
income tax provision consolidated income tax expense from continuing operations was $580 million, $358 million and $402 million for the years ended december 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. the change in consolidated income tax expense between years is primarily due to the tax impact of changes in our pre-tax income and the changes in our effective tax rate each year. our effective tax rate from continuing operations was 29%, 22% and 29% for the years ended december 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. the effective tax rates for the years ended december 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 were lower than the federal statutory rate primarily due to favorable foreign income tax rate differentials and favorable tax law changes, partially offset by state income taxes. favorable foreign income tax rate differentials result primarily from lower tax rates in the u.k and various other lower tax jurisdictions as compared to the tax rates in the u.s.
during the fourth quarter of 2015, the u.k. reduced the corporate income tax rate from 20% to 19% effective april 1, 2017 and to 18% effective april 1, 2020. during the third quarter of 2016, the u.k. further reduced their corporate income tax rate from 18% to 17% effective april 1, 2020. the reduction in the future u.k. corporate income tax rates resulted in deferred tax benefits. the impact of the deferred tax benefit for the years ended december 31, 2016 and 2015 lower the effective tax rate by 2% and 4%, respectively. the increase in the effective tax rate for the year ended december 31, 2016, from the comparable period in 2015, is primarily due to the tax impact of foreign versus u.s. based pre-tax income, lower deferred tax benefit associated with the future u.k. income tax rate reduction, and greater favorable settlements with various taxing authorities in 2015, partially offset by a tax benefit from the early adoption of asu 2016-09 in 2016. the decrease in the effective tax rate for the year ended december 31, 2015, from the comparable period in 2014, is primarily due to the deferred tax benefit associated with future u.k. income tax rate reductions along with certain favorable settlements with various taxing authorities. see note 11 to our consolidated financial statements and related notes, which are included elsewhere is this annual report, for additional information on these tax items.
discontinued operations on november 13, 2013, we acquired 100% of nyse for $11.1 billion, comprised of cash consideration of $2.7 billion and 211.9 million shares of our common stock, on a post-split basis, and their results are included in our consolidated results effective from the acquisition date. nyse owned and operated euronext, which was comprised of continental european-based exchanges. on june 24, 2014, we sold an aggregate 65.8 million shares of common stock of euronext, representing 94% of all outstanding shares, in three transactions. the three transactions include our sale of 42.2 million shares of euronext common stock in an initial public offering, or ipo, at €20 per share, 23.4 million shares of euronext common stock to a group of european institutional investors at €19.20 per share, and 0.2 million shares of euronext common stock to eligible euronext employees at €16 per share. on december 9, 2014, we sold our remaining 4.2 million shares of euronext common stock, representing 6% of the outstanding shares of euronext, for €95 million ($118 million). we no longer hold any shares of euronext stock and these four transactions generated an aggregate €1.5 billion ($2.1 billion) of net cash proceeds for us. the net cash proceeds received included cash of $220 million distributed from euronext as part of the separation of euronext from us.
nyse previously operated a commercial technology business, nyse technologies, which offered transaction, data and infrastructure services, and managed solutions for market participants. during the year ended december 31, 2014, we sold nyfix, metabit and wombat, the three companies that comprised nyse technologies. these sales completed our previously announced intention to divest non-core nyse technologies assets.
the results of euronext, nyfix, metabit and wombat are reflected as discontinued operations in the consolidated financial statements. we used the net cash proceeds from the ipo and sales to repay debt, invest in growth initiatives, pursue strategic investments and return capital to shareholders via dividends and share repurchases. see "- debt" below. also, refer to note 16 to our consolidated financial statements and related notes, which are included elsewhere in this annual report, for more information on the ipo and sales and the presentation of the results as discontinued operations.
there was no gain or loss recognized on the euronext ipo or on the sale of the nyse technologies companies, as any differences in the carrying value of these net assets was adjusted in the nyse purchase price allocation. the results below include
external advisory costs and professional services costs related to the sales of euronext and nyse technologies of $51 million for the year ended december 31, 2014, which have been included with acquisition-related transaction and integration costs, below, from discontinued operations. the results below also include deal-related compensation and severance costs related to the sales of euronext and nyse technologies of $42 million for the year ended december 31, 2014, which have also been included with acquisition-related transaction and integration costs, below, from discontinued operations. results of discontinued operations were as follows for the year ended december 31, 2014 (in millions):

(1) we acquired securities evaluations and credit market analysis on october 3, 2016, trayport on december 11, 2015 and interactive data on december 14, 2015 and have included their financial results in our results of operations for the periods subsequent to their acquisitions dates, including all revenues from these acquisitions in data services revenues.
(2) the increase in the depreciation and amortization expenses for the three months ended september 30, 2016 is primarily due to the $33 million creditex customer relationship intangible asset impairment. see "- recent developments - creditex customer relationship intangible asset impairment" above.
(3) the decrease in the income tax expenses for the three months ended september 30, 2016 and for the three months ended december 31, 2015 is primarily due to the deferred tax benefit associated with future u.k. income tax rate reductions. see "- consolidated income tax provision" above.
liquidity and capital resources below are charts that reflect our capital allocation. the acquisition and integration costs in the chart below includes both the net cash paid for the acquisitions and the acquisition-related transaction and integration costs in each year.
we have financed our operations, growth and cash needs primarily through income from operations and borrowings under our various debt facilities. our principal capital requirements have been to fund capital expenditures, working capital, strategic acquisitions and investments, stock repurchases, dividends to our shareholders and the continued development of our electronic trading and clearing platforms. we believe that our cash on hand and cash flows from operations will be sufficient to repay our outstanding debt as it matures. in the future, we may need to incur additional debt or issue additional equity securities, which we may be unable to do or to do on favorable terms. we used the cash proceeds from the euronext ipo and sale to repay debt and we used the net cash proceeds from the sale of select nyse technology businesses to repay debt, invest in growth initiatives, pursue strategic investments and return capital to shareholders via dividends and share repurchases. see "- discontinued operations" above and "- debt" and "- future capital requirements" below.
on october 3, 2016, we acquired securities evaluations and credit market analysis for $431 million in cash. the cash consideration was funded from borrowing under our commercial paper program. on december 14, 2015, we acquired interactive data in a stock and cash transaction. the total purchase price was $5.6 billion, comprised of cash consideration of $4.1 billion and 32.3 million shares of our common stock (the cash consideration is gross of $301 million of cash held by interactive data on the date of the acquisition). the cash consideration was funded from $2.5 billion of net proceeds received on november 24, 2015 in connection with the offering of new senior notes and $1.6 billion of borrowing under our commercial paper program. on december 11, 2015, we acquired trayport in a stock transaction. the total purchase price was $620 million, comprised of 12.6 million shares of our common stock.
our commercial paper program enables us to borrow efficiently at reasonable short term interest rates and provides us with the flexibility to de-lever using our strong annual cash flows from operating activities whenever our leverage becomes elevated as a result of investment or acquisition activities. we reduced our outstanding commercial paper during the year ended december 31, 2016 by $949 million, enabled by strong cash flows and a reduction in our unrestricted cash balance, partially offset by $431 million in commercial paper borrowing in october 2016 to fund the purchase price of the securities evaluations and credit market analysis acquisitions.
upon maturity of old issuances of commercial paper and to the extent old issuances are not repaid by cash on hand, we are exposed to the rollover risk of not being able to issue new commercial paper. to mitigate the rollover risk, we maintain an undrawn back-stop bank revolving credit facility for an aggregate amount equaling at any time the amount issued under our commercial paper
program. if we were not able to issue new commercial paper, we have the option of drawing on the back-stop revolving facility, however electing to do so would result in higher interest expense. see "- debt" below.
consolidated cash and cash equivalents were $407 million and $627 million as of december 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. we had $432 million and $299 million in long-term investments as of december 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and $943 million and $920 million in short-term and long-term restricted cash and investments as of december 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. we consider all short-term, highly liquid investments with remaining maturity dates of three months or less at the time of purchase to be cash equivalents. we classify all investments with original maturity dates in excess of three months but less than one year as short-term investments and all investments that we intend to hold for more than one year as long-term investments. cash and investments that are not available for general use, either due to regulatory requirements or through restrictions in specific agreements, are classified as restricted cash and investments.
as of december 31, 2016, the amount of unrestricted cash held by our non-u.s. subsidiaries was $250 million. while we consider our non-u.s. earnings to be indefinitely reinvested overseas, if these cash balances are needed for our operations in the u.s., any repatriation by way of dividend may be subject to both u.s. federal and state income taxes, as adjusted for any non-u.s. tax credits. however, we do not have any current needs or foreseeable future needs or other plans to repatriate cash by way of dividends from our non-u.s. subsidiaries.
our cash and cash equivalents and financial investments are managed as a global treasury portfolio of non-speculative financial instruments that are readily convertible into cash, such as overnight deposits, term deposits, money market funds, mutual funds for treasury investments, short duration fixed income investments and other money market instruments, thus ensuring high liquidity of financial assets. we may invest a portion of our cash in excess of short-term operating needs in investment-grade marketable debt securities, including government or government sponsored agencies and corporate debt securities.
certain of these investments, with an original maturity of greater than three months, will be classified as available-for-sale in accordance with relevant accounting standards. available-for-sale investments are carried at their fair values with unrealized gains and losses, reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income. realized gains and losses, and declines in value deemed to be other-than-temporary on available-for-sale investments, are recognized currently in earnings. we do not have any investments classified as held-to-maturity or trading.
during the years ended december 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, we repurchased 902,920 shares, 14,343,845 shares and 16,157,420 shares, respectively, of our outstanding common stock at a cost of $50 million, $660 million and $645 million, respectively. these repurchases were completed under stock repurchase plans authorized by our board of directors. in connection with our acquisition of interactive data during the fourth quarter of 2015, we suspended our stock repurchase plan and that plan expired shortly thereafter. the timing and extent of future repurchases that are not made pursuant to a rule 10b5-1 trading plan will be at our discretion and will depend upon many conditions. our management and board of directors periodically review whether or not to be active in repurchasing our stock. in making a determination regarding any stock repurchases, we consider multiple factors. the factors may include: overall stock market conditions, our common stock price movements, the remaining amount authorized for repurchases by our board of directors, the potential impact of a stock repurchase program on our corporate debt ratings, our expected free cash flow and working capital needs, our current and future planned strategic growth initiatives, and other potential uses of our cash and capital resources.
in august 2016, our board of directors approved an aggregate of $1.0 billion for future repurchases of our common stock with no fixed expiration date, subject to applicable laws and regulations. repurchases may be made from time to time on the open market, through established plans, in privately-negotiated transactions or otherwise, in accordance with all applicable securities laws, rules and regulations. we have entered into a rule 10b5-1 trading plan, as authorized by our board of directors, to govern some or all of the repurchases of our shares of common stock, and we began to repurchase shares in october 2016. we may discontinue the stock repurchases at any time and may amend or terminate the rule 10b5-1 trading plan at any time. the approval of our board of directors for the share repurchases does not obligate us to acquire any particular amount of our common stock. in addition, our board of directors may increase or decrease the amount of capacity we have for repurchases from time to time and our purchases will generally depend upon market conditions, our stock price, our target debt ratio and corporate debt rating, and our strategic growth initiatives at that time. we expect funding for any share repurchases to come from our operating cash flow or borrowings under our debt facilities or commercial paper program. the shares repurchased are held in treasury stock. as of december 31, 2016, the remaining board authorization permits repurchases of up to $950 million of our common stock with no fixed expiration date.
cash flow the following presents the major components of net increases (decreases) in cash and cash equivalents (in millions):
operating activities from continuing operations      $2,149                $1,311                $1,463
effect of exchange rate changes                          (9    )              (14    )              (21    )
operating activities net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations primarily consists of net income adjusted for certain non-cash items, including depreciation and amortization and the effects of changes in working capital. fluctuations in net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations is primarily attributable to increases and decreases in our net income between periods and due to fluctuations in working capital.
the $838 million increase in net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations for the year ended december 31, 2016, from the comparable period in 2015, is primarily due to $393 million in cash provided by operating activities for interactive data, trayport, securities evaluations and credit market analysis for the year ended december 31, 2016, increase in the net income of our historical income statement excluding the acquisitions, and other fluctuations in working capital (including the impact of the increase in cash paid for income taxes in 2015 as discussed below). the $152 million decrease in net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations for the year ended december 31, 2015, from the comparable period in 2014, is primarily due to normal changes in operating cash flow during the year and timing of repayment of accrued expenses, including an increase of $204 million in cash paid for income taxes for the year ended december 31, 2015, from the comparable period in 2014.
investing activities consolidated net cash (used in) provided by investing activities from continuing operations for the years ended december 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 primarily relates to cash paid for acquisitions, cash proceeds from the ipo and sale of euronext and nyse technologies, purchases/proceeds from term deposits and sales of available-for-sale investments, changes in the restricted cash and investment balances, and increases in the capital expenditures and capitalized software development costs.
we paid cash for acquisitions, net of cash acquired, of $425 million, $3.8 billion and $577 million, respectively, for the years ended december 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, primarily relating to the securities evaluations and credit market analysis acquisitions during the year ended december 31, 2016, the interactive data acquisition during the year ended december 31, 2015, and the superderivatives, ice futures singapore, ice clear netherlands and true office acquisitions during the year ended december 31, 2014. we received net cash proceeds from the ipo and sale of euronext shares and the sale of nyse technologies of $2.3 billion for the year ended december 31, 2014.
we purchased euro-denominated term deposits of $1.3 billion during the year ended december 31, 2014 and we received proceeds from the euro-denominated terms deposits of $1.1 billion during the year ended december 31, 2015 relating to the repayments of the nyse eur notes. see "- debt" below for a discussion of the term deposits. the decrease in the value of the euro-denominated term notes is due to the strengthening of the u.s. dollar compared to the euro during 2015.
we had net increases in restricted cash and investments of $38 million, $294 million and $161 million for the years ended december 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. the restricted cash increase in 2016 primarily related to increases in the regulatory capital restricted cash at ice clear europe, ice futures europe, ice clear u.s. and ice clear credit. the increases in the regulatory capital restricted cash at ice clear u.s and ice clear credit were primarily due our voluntarily adoption of the application of emir capital requirements for our u.s. clearing houses, which exceeded the cftc financial resource requirements as of december 31, 2016. the increases in the regulatory capital restricted cash at ice clear europe and ice futures europe were primarily due to additional expenses incurred due to the growth of our trading and clearing businesses and additional regulatory capital buffers required by the bank of england that we have classified as restricted cash. these 2016 increases were partially offset by the elimination of the regulatory capital restricted cash at liffe administration and management and a decrease in the restricted cash held as escrow for the superderivatives acquisition.
the restricted cash increase in 2015 primarily related to additional cash that was put into our clearing houses to cover our financial resources, regulatory capital needs and for liquidity purposes. the restricted cash increase in 2014 primarily related to a contribution to the ice clear u.s. guaranty fund in connection with ice clear u.s.'s status as a qccp, cash escrow set aside for the superderivatives acquisition, regulatory capital from hch after our acquisition, and increases in the regulatory capital of ice clear
europe and ice futures europe due to additional expenses incurred at both of these companies due to growth of these businesses. refer to note 4 to our consolidated financial statements and related notes, which are included elsewhere in this annual report, for more information on the changes in our restricted cash and investments.
capital expenditures were $250 million, $190 million and $172 million for the years ended december 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively, and we had capitalized software development expenditures of $115 million, $87 million and $78 million for the years ended december 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. the capital expenditures primarily relate to hardware purchases to continue the development and expansion of our electronic platforms, data services and clearing houses and leasehold improvements associated with the new and renovated office spaces in atlanta, new york and london. the software development expenditures primarily relate to the continued development and expansion of our electronic trading platforms, data services and clearing houses.

consolidated net cash provided by financing activities from continuing operations for the year ended december 31, 2015 primarily relates to $2.5 billion in net proceeds received in connection with the offering of new senior notes and $1.7 billion in net borrowings under our commercial paper program, partially offset by $1.0 billion in net repayments under our debt facilities, $660 million in repurchases of common stock, $331 million in dividend and dividend equivalent payments to our shareholders, $128 million for the purchase of subsidiary shares from non-controlling interest holders (for the purchase of the nyse amex options shares) and $45 million in cash payments related to treasury shares received for restricted stock tax payments and stock options exercises.

discontinued operations we did not have any cash provided by or used in any activities from discontinued operations for the years ended december 31, 2016 and 2015. consolidated net cash provided by (used in) operating activities, investing activities and financing activities from discontinued operations was $51 million, ($504 million) and $339 million, respectively, for the year ended december 31, 2014. the $504 million in net cash used in investing activities primarily relates to $220 million of cash distributed from euronext to us as part of the separation of euronext from our remaining businesses and $262 million in cash retained by euronext and removed from our balance sheet in the de-consolidation. the $339 million in net cash provided by financing activities relates to cash proceeds received from the issuance of debt by euronext just prior to the ipo.
debt our total debt, including short-term and long-term debt, consisted of the following as of december 31, 2016 and 2015 (in millions):
as of december 31,
credit facility we have entered into a $3.0 billion senior unsecured revolving credit facility, or the credit facility, with a maturity date of november 13, 2020, pursuant to a credit agreement with wells fargo bank, national association, or wells fargo, as administrative agent, issuing lender and swing line lender, bank of america, n.a., as syndication agent, and the lenders party thereto. the credit facility includes an option for us to propose an increase in the aggregate amount available for borrowing by up to $1.0 billion, subject to the consent of the lenders funding the increase and certain other conditions. on november 13, 2015, we utilized this option to increase the amount of the credit facility to $3.4 billion. the commitments under the credit facility will automatically reduce to $3.17 billion on april 3, 2019. no amounts were outstanding under the credit facility as of december 31, 2016.
amounts borrowed under the credit facility may be prepaid at any time without premium or penalty. the credit facility provides for a $3.4 billion multi-currency revolving facility, with sub-limits for non-dollar borrowings and letters of credit and with a swing-line facility available on a same-day basis. of the $3.4 billion that is currently available for borrowing under the credit facility, $1.6 billion is required to back-stop the amount outstanding under our commercial paper program as of december 31, 2016. the amount required to back-stop the amounts outstanding under the commercial paper program will fluctuate as we increase or decrease our commercial paper borrowings. the remaining $1.8 billion available under the credit facility as of december 31, 2016 is available to us to use for working capital and general corporate purposes including, but not limited to, acting as a back-stop to future increases in the amounts outstanding under the commercial paper program.
borrowings under the credit facility will bear interest on the principal amount outstanding at either (a) libor plus an applicable margin rate or (b) a "base rate" plus an applicable margin rate; provided, however, that all loans denominated in a foreign currency will bear interest at libor plus an applicable margin rate. the "base rate" equals the higher of (i) wells fargo's prime rate, (ii) the federal funds rate plus 0.50%, or (iii) the one month libor rate plus 1.00%. the applicable margin rate is based upon our public long term debt ratings and ranges from 0.875% to 1.50% on libor borrowings and from 0.00% to 0.50% on base rate borrowings.
the credit facility includes an unutilized revolving credit commitment fee that is equal to the unused maximum revolver amount, multiplied by an applicable commitment fee rate and is payable in arrears on a quarterly basis. the applicable commitment fee rate ranges from 0.08% to 0.20% and is determined based on our long term debt rating. as of december 31, 2016, the applicable commitment fee rate was 0.125% based on our current long term debt ratings.
commercial paper program we have entered into a u.s. dollar commercial paper program, or the commercial paper program. our commercial paper program is currently backed by the borrowing capacity available under the credit facility, equal to the amount of the commercial paper that is issued and outstanding at any given point in time. the effective interest rate of commercial paper issuances does not materially differ from short term interest rates (such as usd libor). the fluctuation of these rates due to market conditions may impact our interest expense.
we used net proceeds from notes issued under the commercial paper program during the year ended december 31, 2016 for the $431 million cash purchase price of the securities evaluations and credit market analysis acquisitions and for general corporate purposes. we used net proceeds from notes issued under the commercial paper program during the year ended december 31, 2015 to finance part of the cash portion of the purchase price of the interactive data acquisition and to pay related fees and expenses, to repurchase our common stock, and for general corporate purposes. we used net proceeds from notes issued under the commercial
paper program during the year ended december 31, 2014 to repay amounts outstanding under our prior credit facilities that were terminated in connection with us entering into the credit facility, to fund certain of our acquisitions, and to repurchase our common stock. we repaid a portion of the amounts outstanding under the commercial paper program during the years ended december 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 with cash flows from operations and a portion of our unrestricted cash balances. we also repaid a portion of the amounts outstanding under the commercial paper program during the year ended december 31, 2014 using a combination of the cash proceeds received from the ipo and sale of euronext, and the sale of nyse technologies.
commercial paper notes of $1.6 billion with original maturities ranging from 3 to 68 days were outstanding as of december 31, 2016 under the commercial paper program. as of december 31, 2016, the weighted average interest rate on the $1.6 billion outstanding under the commercial paper program was 0.74% per annum, with a weighted average maturity of 18 days. commercial paper notes with original maturities ranging from 2 to 89 days were outstanding as of december 31, 2015 under the commercial paper program. as of december 31, 2015, the weighted average interest rate on the amounts outstanding under the commercial paper program was 0.60% per annum, with a weighted average maturity of 19 days.
364 day facility on november 13, 2015, we entered into a $500 million 364 day senior unsecured revolving credit facility, or the 364 day facility, pursuant to a credit agreement with wells fargo, as administrative agent, bank of america, n.a., as syndication agent, and the lenders signatory thereto. the amounts available under the 364 day facility were available for use by us for working capital and general corporate purposes but specifically excluding any use to back-stop amounts issued under the commercial paper program. the 364 day credit facility expired on november 13, 2016.
senior notes in november 2015, we issued $2.5 billion in aggregate senior notes, including $1.25 billion principal amount of 2.75% senior unsecured fixed rate notes due november 2020, or the 2020 senior notes, and $1.25 billion principal amount of 3.75% senior unsecured fixed rate notes due november 2025, or the 2025 senior notes. we used the net proceeds from the 2020 senior notes and 2025 senior notes offering, together with $1.6 billion of borrowings under our commercial paper program, to finance the $4.1 billion cash portion of the purchase price of the acquisition of interactive data.
in october 2013, we issued $600 million principal amount of 2.50% senior unsecured fixed rate notes due october 2018, or the 2018 senior notes, and $800 million principal amount of 4.00% senior unsecured fixed rate notes due october 2023, or the 2023 senior notes. we used the net proceeds from the 2018 senior notes and 2023 senior notes offering to finance, together with cash on hand, the $2.7 billion cash portion of the purchase price of the acquisition of nyse.
nyse notes in connection with our acquisition of nyse, one of our subsidiaries assumed the outstanding nyse debt instruments, which included $850 million of 2.0% senior unsecured fixed rate notes due in october 2017, or the nyse usd notes, and €920 million ($1.1 billion) of 5.375% senior unsecured fixed rate notes due in june 2015, or the nyse eur notes, and together with the nyse usd notes, the nyse notes.
on june 30, 2015, we repaid the nyse eur notes using cash that had been set aside in july 2014 from the proceeds of the euronext ipo. the cash, in the amount of €969 million ($1.2 billion) had been placed in term deposits that matured on june 25, 2015. the cash was sufficient to settle the principal maturity of €920 million ($1.1 billion) and the final interest coupon of €49 million ($60 million).
refer to note 9 to our consolidated financial statements and related notes, which are included elsewhere in this annual report, for additional information on our debt and debt facilities.
future capital requirements our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including the rate of growth across our trading and clearing and data and listings segments, strategic plans and acquisitions, available sources for financing activities, required technology and clearing initiatives, regulatory requirements, the timing and introduction of new products and enhancements to existing products, the geographic mix of our business, potential stock repurchases, and the continuing market acceptance of our electronic trading and clearing platforms. we currently expect to make aggregate operational capital expenditures and to incur capitalized software development costs ranging between $280 million and $300 million for the year ended december 31, 2017, which we believe will support the enhancement of our technology, business integration and the continued growth of our businesses. in addition, we currently expect between $40 million to $45 million in real estate capital expenditures during 2017 for leasehold improvements primarily associated with our new york headquarters.
our board of directors has adopted a quarterly dividend declaration policy providing that the declaration of any dividends will be determined quarterly by the board of directors or audit committee of the board of directors taking into account such factors as our evolving business model, prevailing business conditions and our financial results and capital requirements, without a predetermined annual net income payout ratio. during the year ended december 31, 2016, we paid cash dividends of $0.68 per share of our common stock in the aggregate, including 2016 quarterly dividends of $0.17 per share, for an aggregate payout of $409 million in 2016, which includes the payment of dividend equivalents on unvested employee restricted stock units. refer to note 10 to our consolidated financial statements and related notes, which are included elsewhere in this annual report, for details on the amounts of our quarterly dividend payouts for the last two years. for the first quarter of 2017, we announced a $0.20 per share dividend, which is a 18% increase over the prior dividend, which is payable on march 31, 2017 to shareholders of record as of march 16, 2017.
as of december 31, 2016, we had $6.4 billion in outstanding debt. we currently have a $3.4 billion credit facility. after factoring in the $1.6 billion required to backstop the commercial paper program as of december 31, 2016, $1.8 billion of our credit facility is currently available for general corporate purposes. the credit facility and our commercial paper program are currently the only significant agreements or arrangements that we have with third parties for liquidity and capital resources. in the event of any strategic acquisitions, mergers or investments, or if we are required to raise capital for any reason or desire to return capital to our stockholders, we may incur additional debt, issue additional equity to raise necessary funds, repurchase additional shares of our common stock or pay a dividend. however, we cannot provide assurance that such financing or transactions will be available or successful, or that the terms of such financing or transactions will be favorable to us. see "- debt" above.
in connection with our acquisition of nyse, we assumed nyse's pension plans covering its u.s. and certain european operations. the benefit accrual for the u.s. operations pension plan is frozen. following the euronext ipo in june 2014, there are no longer any nyse european operations covered by the pension plans. during the year ended december 31, 2016, we contributed $10 million to our pension plans. our practice is to fund our frozen defined benefit pension plan each year at a level above the minimum required contribution but within tax deductible limits. based on actuarial projections, we estimate that a contribution of $10 million in 2017 will allow us to meet our funding goal. however, the actual contribution is contingent on the actual plan performance relative to assumptions.
non-gaap financial measures we use non-gaap measures internally to evaluate our performance and in making financial and operational decisions. when viewed in conjunction with our gaap results and the accompanying reconciliation, we believe that our presentation of these measures provides investors with greater transparency and a greater understanding of factors affecting our financial condition and results of operations than gaap measures alone. in addition, we believe the presentation of these measures is useful to investors for period-to-period comparison of results because the items described below as adjustments to gaap are not reflective of our core business performance. these financial measures are not in accordance with, or an alternative to, gaap financial measures and may be different from non-gaap measures used by other companies. we use these adjusted results because we believe they more clearly highlight trends in our business that may not otherwise be apparent when relying solely on gaap financial measures, since these measures eliminate from our results specific financial items that have less bearing on our core operating performance. we strongly recommend that investors review the gaap financial measures included in this annual report, including our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto.
adjusted operating expenses, adjusted operating income, adjusted operating margin, adjusted net income attributable to ice common shareholders from continuing operations and adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations for the periods presented below are calculated by adding or subtracting the adjustments described below, which are not reflective of our cash operations and core business performance, and their related income tax effect and other tax adjustments (in millions, except for percentages and per share amounts). all share and per share amounts have been retroactively adjusted to reflect the 5-for-1 stock split that was effected in the fourth quarter of 2016:

acquisition-related transaction costs are included as part of our core business expenses, except for those that are directly related to the announcement, closing, financing or termination of a transaction. however, the acquisition-related transaction and integration costs relating to nyse and interactive data are included in non-gaap adjustments given the sizes of these acquisitions. as of december 31, 2016, the integration of nyse has been completed and we will no longer include any nyse integration costs as non-gaap adjustments in the future. amortization of acquisition-related intangibles are included in non-gaap adjustments as excluding these non-cash expenses provides greater clarity regarding our financial strength and stability of cash operating results.
during the year ended december 31, 2016, we also include as non-gaap adjustments the creditex u.k. voice brokerage severance costs related to its discontinuance and the creditex customer relationship intangible asset impairment expense, as they are not part of our core business operations. during the year and/or three months ended december 31, 2015, we also include as non-gaap adjustments various litigation settlements and accruals and the interest expense on the senior notes and commercial paper we issued for the interactive data acquisition (from the issuance date of the new senior notes on november 24, 2015 and on the issuance dates of the commercial paper in early december 2015 to the acquisition date of interactive data on december 14, 2015), as they are not part of our core business operations. during the year and three months ended december 31, 2014, we also include as non-gaap adjustments the net gain on the sale of our 6% remaining ownership in euronext and the income recognized on our occ equity investment, as they are not part of our core business operations.
the income tax effects relating to the items above are included in non-gaap adjustments as well as deferred tax adjustments on acquisition-related intangibles and other tax adjustments. the tax items in non-gaap adjustments are either the tax impacts of the pre-tax non-gaap adjustments or are tax items as described below that are not in the normal course of business and are not indicative of our core business performance. deferred tax adjustments on acquisition-related intangibles relates primarily to future u.k. corporate income tax rate reductions with deferred tax benefits of $34 million and $60 million for the years ended december 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. further, deferred tax adjustments on acquisition-related intangibles include the impact of u.s. state tax law and apportionment changes which resulted in a deferred tax expense of $12 million for the year ended december 31, 2016 and a deferred tax benefit of $22 million and $14 million for the years ended december 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. other tax adjustments for the year ended december 31, 2016 relate to a $15 million valuation allowance on singapore pre-acquisition net operating losses and other deferred tax assets and an $8 million deferred tax adjustment with respect to our occ equity method investment. other tax adjustments for year ended december 31, 2015 represents a $7 million uncertain tax position relating to a retrospective foreign tax law change for a pre-acquisition period and for the year ended december 31, 2014, represents $12 million of foreign tax expense in connection with the ipo of euronext and the integration of liffe.
for additional information on these items, refer to our consolidated financial statements and related notes, which are included elsewhere in this annual report and "- consolidated operating expenses", "- non-operating income (expenses)" and "- income tax provision" above.
off-balance sheet arrangements we do not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities, which have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes.
contractual obligations and commercial commitments the following table presents, for the periods indicated, our contractual obligations (which we intend to fund from our existing cash as well as cash flow from operations) and commercial commitments as of december 31, 2016 (in millions):
operating lease obligations                        612                  85                   148         113                   266
purchase obligations include our estimate of the minimum outstanding obligations under agreements to purchase goods or services that we believe are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. purchase obligations exclude agreements that are cancellable at any time without penalty.
we have excluded from the contractual obligations and commercial commitments table above $55.2 billion in cash margin deposits and guaranty fund liabilities. clearing members of our clearing houses are required to deposit original margin and variation margin and to make deposits to a guaranty fund. the cash deposits made to these margin accounts and to the guaranty fund are recorded in the consolidated balance sheet as current assets with corresponding current liabilities to the clearing members that deposited them. see note 12 to our consolidated financial statements and related notes that are included elsewhere in this annual report for additional information on our clearing houses and the margin deposits and guaranty funds' liabilities.
we have also excluded unrecognized tax benefits, or utbs, from the contractual obligations and commercial commitments table above. as of december 31, 2016, our cumulative utbs were $112 million. interest and penalties related to utbs were $35 million as of december 31, 2016. we are under examination by various tax authorities. we are unable to make a reasonable estimate of the periods of cash settlement because it is not possible to reasonably predict, the amount of tax, interest and penalties, if any, that might be assessed by a tax authority or the timing of an assessment or payment. it is also not possible to reasonably predict whether or not the applicable statutes of limitations might expire without us being examined by any particular tax authority. see note 11 to our consolidated financial statements and related notes that are included elsewhere in this annual report for additional information on our utbs.
as of december 31, 2016, in connection with our acquisition of nyse, we have obligations related to our pension and other benefit programs. the date of payment under these obligations cannot be determined and have been excluded from the table above. see note 14 to our consolidated financial statements and related notes that are included elsewhere in this annual report for additional information on our pension and other benefit programs.
we have a 40% ownership in occ. under the occ's capital plan, the occ shareholders have committed to contribute up to $200 million in equity capital if certain capital thresholds are breached, including up to $80 million to be contributed by nyse.
new and recently adopted accounting pronouncements refer to note 2 to our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this annual report for information on the new and recently adopted accounting pronouncements that are applicable to us.
critical accounting policies we have identified the policies below as critical to our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations. the impact of, and any associated risks related to, these policies on our business operations is discussed throughout "- management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations". for a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies, see note 2 to our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this annual report. our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with u.s. gaap. the preparation of financial statements in conformity with these accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities, and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, at the date of our financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
we evaluate our estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis, including those related to the accounting matters described below. we base our estimates and judgments on our historical experience and other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances when we make these estimates and judgments. based on these factors, we make estimates and judgments about, among other things, the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from market prices or other independent sources and about the recognition and characterization of our revenues and expenses. the values and results based on these estimates and judgments could differ significantly under different assumptions or conditions and could change materially in the future.
we believe that the following critical accounting policies, among others, affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements and could materially increase or decrease our reported results, assets and liabilities.
goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets we have significant intangible assets related to goodwill and other acquired intangible assets. in connection with our acquisitions, assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recorded at their estimated fair values. goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price of our acquisitions over the fair value of identifiable net assets acquired, including other identified intangible assets. we recognize specifically identifiable intangibles when a specific right or contract is acquired. our determination of the fair value of the intangible assets and whether or not these assets are impaired requires us to make significant judgments and requires us to use significant estimates and assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows. if we change our strategy or if market conditions shift, our judgments may change, which may result in adjustments to recorded asset balances. as of december 31, 2016, we had goodwill of $12.3 billion and net other intangible assets of $10.4 billion relating to our acquisitions and our purchase of trademarks and internet domain names from various third parties. we do not amortize goodwill or other intangible assets with indefinite useful lives. intangible assets with finite useful lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives.
in performing the purchase price allocation, we consider, among other factors, the intended future use of acquired assets, analysis of historical financial performance and estimates of future performance of the acquired business. at the acquisition date, a preliminary allocation of the purchase price is recorded based upon a preliminary valuation. we continue to review and validate estimates, assumptions and valuation methodologies underlying the preliminary valuation during the measurement period. accordingly, these estimates and assumptions are subject to change, which could have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. the measurement period ends as soon as we receive the information about facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date or we learn that more information is not obtainable, which usually does not exceed one year from the date of acquisition.
our goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets are evaluated for impairment annually in our fiscal fourth quarter or more frequently if conditions exist that indicate that the value may be impaired. we test our goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level. these impairment evaluations are performed by comparing the carrying value of the goodwill reporting unit or other indefinite-lived intangibles to its estimated fair value. we allocate goodwill to reporting units based on the reporting unit expected to
benefit from the business combination. we had previously identified three reporting units: our futures reporting unit, our cds reporting unit, and our cash listings reporting unit. during the year ended december 31, 2016, we conducted a review to determine the appropriate reporting units as a result of operating under two business segments effective january 1, 2016 and following our acquisition of interactive data in december 2015. this review has led to the identification of four reporting units: our futures reporting unit, our cds reporting unit, our cash reporting unit, and our data and listings reporting unit.
goodwill impairment testing consists of a two-step methodology. the initial step requires us to determine the fair value of each reporting unit and compare it to the carrying value, including goodwill and other intangible assets, of such reporting unit. if the fair value exceeds the carrying value, no impairment loss is recognized and the second step, which is a calculation of the impairment, is not performed. however, if the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, an impairment charge is recorded equal to the extent that the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value. for annual goodwill impairment testing, we have the option to first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, including goodwill and other intangible assets. if we conclude that this is the case, we must perform the two-step methodology described above. otherwise, we can skip the two-step methodology and do not need to perform any further testing. for annual indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment testing, we also have the option to first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible assets is less than its carrying amount.
application of the impairment test requires judgment, including the identification of reporting units, assignment of assets and liabilities to reporting units, assignment of goodwill to reporting units, and determination of the fair value of each reporting unit. we have historically determined the fair value of our reporting units based on various valuation techniques, including discounted cash flow analysis and a multiple of earnings approach. in assessing whether goodwill and other intangible assets are impaired, we must make estimates and assumptions regarding future cash flows, long-term growth rates of our business, operating margins, discount rates, weighted average cost of capital and other factors to determine the fair value of our assets. these estimates and assumptions require management's judgment, and changes to these estimates and assumptions, as a result of changing economic and competitive conditions, could materially affect the determination of fair value and/or impairment. the cash flows employed in the discounted cash flow analysis are based on our most recent budgets and business plans and, when applicable, various growth rates have been assumed for years beyond the current business plan period. future events could cause us to conclude that indicators of impairment exist for goodwill or other intangible assets. impairment may result from, among other things, deterioration in the performance of our business, adverse market conditions, adverse changes in applicable laws and regulations, competition, or the sale or disposition of a reporting unit. any resulting impairment loss could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations. our impairment analysis has not resulted in any impairment of goodwill through december 31, 2016.
we are also required to evaluate other finite-lived intangible assets and property and equipment for impairment by first determining whether events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets to be held and used may not be recoverable. if impairment indicators are present, then an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows produced by these long-lived assets is compared to the carrying value of those assets to determine if the asset is recoverable. if an asset is not recoverable, the loss is measured as the difference between fair value and carrying value of the impaired asset. fair value of these assets is based on various valuation techniques, including discounted cash flow analysis.
among our finite-lived intangible assets, during the year ended december 31, 2015, we performed an undiscounted cash flow analysis to test whether the cds creditex customer relationship intangible asset was recoverable as we concluded that indicators of impairment were present. cds trade execution revenues at creditex have decreased over the last several years as trading volumes in the global cds market have declined and cds trading remains muted due to financial reform implementation and lower volatility in corporate credit markets. we identified the decline in revenues and the delay in their expected recovery as a triggering event requiring our creditex customer relationship intangible asset to be tested for recoverability. as of december 31, 2015, the creditex customer relationship intangible asset had a remaining net book value of $61 million and will become fully amortized in august 2020. the results of the recoverability test indicated that the estimated future undiscounted cash flows exceeded the carrying value of the asset by 8%. therefore, no impairment was recorded for the year ended december 31, 2015.
in august 2016, we sold certain of creditex's u.s. voice brokerage operations to tullett prebon. during the third quarter of 2016, we discontinued creditex's u.k. voice brokerage operations. we continue to operate creditex's electronically traded markets and systems, post-trade connectivity platforms and intellectual property. we continued to monitor potential impairment triggering events in our cds trade execution business during 2016, including the impacts of divesting the brokerage business, changes in the business and regulatory climate in which the remaining business operates, the volatility in the capital markets, our recent operating performance and our current financial projections. based on an analysis of these factors, it was determined that the carrying value of the cds creditex customer relationship intangible asset was not fully recoverable and an impairment of the asset was recorded in september 2016 for $33 million. the impairment was recorded as amortization expense in the accompanying consolidated statements of income for the year ended december 31, 2016. as of december 31, 2016, the remaining creditex customer relationship intangible asset is $14 million and will continue to be amortized over the remaining useful life through august 2020.
income taxes we are subject to income taxes in the u.s., u.k. and other foreign jurisdictions where we operate. the determination of our provision for income taxes and related accruals, deferred tax assets and liabilities requires significant judgment, the use of estimates, and the interpretation and application of complex tax laws. we recognize a current tax liability or tax asset for the estimated taxes payable or refundable on tax returns for the current year. we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of our assets and liabilities. we establish valuation allowances if we believe that it is more likely than not that some or all of our deferred tax assets will not be realized. deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using current enacted tax rates in effect for the years in which those temporary differences and carryforwards are expected to reverse.
we do not recognize a tax benefit unless we conclude that it is more likely than not that the benefit will be sustained on audit by the taxing authority based solely on the technical merits of the associated tax position. if the recognition threshold is met, we recognize a tax benefit measured at the largest amount of the tax benefit that, in our judgment, is greater than 50 percent likely to be realized. we recognize accrued interest and penalties related to uncertain income tax positions as income tax expense in the consolidated statements of income.
the undistributed earnings from our non-u.s. subsidiaries are considered to be indefinitely reinvested and, accordingly, no provision for u.s. federal and state income taxes has been made in our consolidated financial statements. a distribution of these non-u.s. earnings in the form of dividends, or otherwise, could subject us to both u.s. federal and state income taxes, as adjusted for non-u.s. tax credits, and withholding taxes payable to the various non-u.s. countries. determination of the amount of any unrecognized deferred income tax liability on these undistributed earnings is not practicable.
we operate within multiple domestic and foreign taxing jurisdictions and are subject to audit in these jurisdictions by domestic and foreign tax authorities. these audits include questions regarding our tax filing positions, including the timing and amount of deductions taken and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions. we record accruals for the estimated outcomes of these audits, and the accruals may change in the future due to new developments in each matter. at any point in time, many tax years are subject to or in the process of being audited by various taxing authorities. to the extent our estimates of settlements change or the final tax outcome of these matters is different from the amounts recorded, such differences will impact the income tax provision in the period in which such determinations are made. our income tax expense includes changes in our estimated liability for exposures associated with our various tax filing positions. determining the income tax expense for these potential assessments requires management to make assumptions that are subject to factors such as proposed assessments by tax authorities, changes in facts and circumstances, issuance of new regulations, and resolution of tax audits.
item 7 (a).     quantitative    and qualitative disclosures about market risk as a result of our operating and financing activities, we are exposed to market risks such as interest rate risk, foreign currency exchange rate risk and credit risk. we have implemented policies and procedures designed to measure, manage, monitor and report risk exposures, which are regularly reviewed by the appropriate management and supervisory bodies.
interest rate risk we have exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relating to our cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, short-term and long-term restricted cash and investments, and indebtedness. as of december 31, 2016 and 2015, our cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments and short-term and long-term restricted cash and investments were $1.4 billion and $1.6 billion, respectively, of which $294 million and $439 million, respectively, were denominated in pounds sterling, euros or canadian dollars. the remaining cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments and short-term and long-term restricted cash and investments are denominated in u.s. dollars. we do not use our investment portfolio for trading or other speculative purposes. a hypothetical decrease in long-term interest rates to zero basis points would decrease annual pre-tax earnings by $3 million as of december 31, 2016, assuming no change in the amount or composition of our cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments and short-term and long-term restricted cash and investments.
our investment in cetip, which is recorded as an available-for-sale long-term investment, was valued at $432 million as of december 31, 2016, including an accumulated unrealized gain of $108 million. changes in the fair value of the cetip investment are reflected in accumulated other comprehensive income and do not impact earnings, except to the extent that unrealized losses are deemed to be other than temporary.
as of december 31, 2016, we had $6.4 billion in outstanding debt, of which $3.9 billion relates to senior notes and $851 million relates to the nyse notes, all of which bear interest at fixed interest rates. the remaining amount outstanding of $1.6 billion relates to
the commercial paper program, which bears interest at fluctuating rates and, therefore, subjects us to interest rate risk. a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in long-term interest rates relating to the amounts outstanding under the commercial paper program as of december 31, 2016 would decrease annual pre-tax earnings by $16 million, assuming no change in the volume or composition of our outstanding indebtedness and no hedging activity. the interest rates on our commercial paper program are currently evaluated based upon current maturities and market conditions. see item 7 "- management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations - debt" included elsewhere in this annual report.
foreign currency exchange rate risk as an international business, we are subject to foreign currency exchange rate risk. we may experience gains or losses from foreign currency transactions in the future given that a significant part of our assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses are recorded in pounds sterling or euros. certain assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses of foreign subsidiaries are denominated in the local functional currency of such subsidiaries. our exposure to foreign denominated earnings for the years ended december 31, 2016 and 2015 is presented by primary foreign currency in the following table (dollars in millions, except exchange rates):

(1)   represents the impact of currency fluctuation for the year compared to the same period in the prior year.
we have a significant part of our assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses recorded in pounds sterling or euros. for the year ended december 31, 2016, 15% of our consolidated revenues, less transaction-based expenses, were denominated in pounds sterling or euros, and 18% of our consolidated operating expenses were denominated in pounds sterling or euros. as the pound sterling or euro exchange rate changes, the u.s. equivalent of revenues and expenses denominated in foreign currencies changes accordingly.
we have foreign currency transaction risk related to the settlement of foreign currency denominated assets, liabilities and payables that occur through our operations, which are received in or paid in pounds sterling or euros, due to the increase or decrease in the foreign currency exchange rates between periods. we had foreign currency transaction losses of $1 million, $14 million and $2 million for the years ended december 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively, primarily attributable to the fluctuations of the pound sterling and euro relative to the u.s. dollar, which strengthened. a 10% adverse change in the underlying foreign currency exchange rates as of december 31, 2016 would result in a foreign currency transaction loss of $1 million, assuming no change in the composition of the foreign currency denominated assets, liabilities and payables and assuming no hedging activity.
we entered into foreign currency hedging transactions during years ended december 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 as economic hedges to help mitigate a portion of our foreign exchange risk exposure and may enter into additional hedging transactions in the future to help mitigate our foreign exchange risk exposure. although we may enter into additional hedging transactions in the future to help mitigate our foreign exchange risk exposure, these hedging arrangements may not be effective, particularly in the event of imprecise forecasts of the levels of our non-u.s. denominated assets and liabilities.
we have foreign currency translation risk equal to our net investment in our foreign subsidiaries. the financial statements of these subsidiaries are translated into u.s. dollars using a current rate of exchange, with gains or losses included in the cumulative translation adjustment account, a component of equity. our exposure to the net investment in foreign currencies is presented by primary foreign currencies in the table below (in millions):
as of december 31, 2016
of which goodwill represents                                                         522                                                  43
impact on consolidated equity of a 10% decrease in foreign currency exchange rates   $143                                      $14
as of december 31, 2016 and 2015, the portion of our equity attributable to accumulated other comprehensive loss from foreign currency translation was $345 million and $45 million, respectively. as of december 31, 2016, we had net exposure of pounds sterling and euro of £1.2 billion ($1.4 billion) and €130 million ($137 million), respectively. based on these december 31, 2016 net currency positions, a hypothetical 10% decrease of pound sterling against u.s. dollar would negatively impact our equity by $143 million and a hypothetical 10% decrease of euro against u.s. dollar would negatively impact our equity by $14 million. for the years ended december 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, currency exchange rate differences had a negative impact of $300 million, $58 million and $130 million, respectively, on our consolidated equity. the decrease for the year ended december 31, 2016 is primarily due to the decrease in the pound sterling/u.s. dollar exchange rate to 1.2336 as of december 31, 2016 (from 1.4868 as of december 31, 2015) due to the weakening pound sterling. the pound sterling decreased starting in june 2016 following the u.k. referendum that resulted in a vote for the u.k. to leave the european union. the future impact on our business relating to the u.k. leaving the european union and the corresponding regulatory changes are uncertain at this time, including future impacts on currency exchange rates.
credit risk we are exposed to credit risk in our operations in the event of a counterparty default. we limit our exposure to credit risk by rigorously selecting the counterparties with which we make our investments and execute agreements. credit risk is monitored by using exposure limits depending on ratings assigned by rating agencies as well as the nature and maturity of transactions. our investment objective is to invest in securities that preserve principal while maximizing yields, without significantly increasing risk. we seek to substantially mitigate credit risk associated with investments by ensuring that these financial assets are placed with governments, well-capitalized financial institutions and other creditworthy counterparties.
an ongoing review is performed to evaluate changes in the status of counterparties. in addition to the intrinsic creditworthiness of counterparties, our policies require diversification of counterparties (banks, financial institutions, bond issuers and funds) so as to avoid a concentration of risk.
clearing house cash deposit risks our clearing houses hold material amounts of clearing member cash deposits which are held or invested primarily to provide security of capital while minimizing credit, market and liquidity risks. refer to note 12 to our consolidated financial statements and related notes, which are included elsewhere in this annual report, for more information about clearing house cash deposits, which were $55.2 billion as of december 31, 2016. while we seek to achieve a reasonable rate of return which may generate interest income for our clearing members, we are primarily concerned with preservation of capital and managing the risks associated with these deposits. as the clearing houses may pass on interest revenues (minus costs) to the members, this could include negative or reduced yield due to market conditions. the following is a summary of the risks associated with these deposits and how these risks are mitigated.
credit risk when a clearing house has the ability to hold cash collateral at a central bank, the clearing house utilizes its access to the central bank system to minimize credit risk exposures. credit risk is monitored by using exposure limits reflecting a number of factors including ratings assigned by rating agencies, cds spreads and internal ratings, as well as the nature and maturity of transactions. we seek to substantially mitigate credit risk associated with investments by ensuring financial assets are placed with governments, well-capitalized financial institutions and other creditworthy counterparties.
an ongoing review is performed to evaluate changes in the financial status of counterparties. in addition to the intrinsic creditworthiness of counterparties, our policies require diversification of counterparties (banks, financial institutions, bond issuers and funds) to avoid a concentration of risk.
liquidity risk liquidity risk is the risk a clearing house may not be able to meet its payment obligations in the right currency, in the right place and the right time. to mitigate this risk, the clearing houses monitor liquidity requirements closely and maintain funds and assets in a
manner which minimizes the risk of loss or delay in the access by the clearing house to such funds and assets. for example, holding funds with a central bank where possible or making only short term investments such as overnight reverse repurchase agreements serves to reduce liquidity risks.
interest rate risk interest rate risk is the risk that interest rates rise causing the value of purchased securities to decline. if we were required to sell securities prior to maturity, and interest rates had risen, the sale of the securities might be made at a loss relative to the latest market price. our clearing houses seek to manage this risk by making short term investments of cash deposits. for example, where possible and in accordance with regulatory requirements, the clearing houses invest cash pursuant to overnight reverse repurchase agreements or term reverse repurchase agreements with short dated maturities. in addition, the clearing house investment guidelines allow for direct purchases of high quality sovereign debt (for example, u.s. treasury securities) and supranational debt instruments (euro cash deposits only) with short dated maturities.
security issuer risk security issuer risk is the risk that an issuer of a security defaults on its payment when the security matures. this risk is mitigated by limiting allowable investments under the reverse repurchase agreements to high quality sovereign or government agency debt and limiting any direct investments to high quality sovereign debt instruments.
investment counterparty risk investment counterparty risk is the risk that a reverse repurchase agreement counterparty might become insolvent and, thus, fail to meet its obligations to our clearing houses. we mitigate this risk by only engaging in transactions with high credit quality reverse repurchase agreement counterparties and by limiting the acceptable collateral under the repurchase agreement to high quality issuers. when engaging in reverse repurchase agreements, our clearing houses take delivery of the underlying reverse repurchase securities in custody accounts under clearing house control. additionally, the securities purchased subject to reverse repurchase have a market value greater than the reverse repurchase amount. the typical haircut received for high quality sovereign debt is 2% of the reverse repurchase amount. thus, in the event that a reverse repurchase counterparty defaults on its obligation to repurchase the underlying reverse repurchase securities, our clearing house will have possession of a security with a value potentially greater than the reverse repurchase counterparty's obligation to the clearing house.
our clearing houses may use third party investment advisors who make investments subject to the guidelines provided to them by the clearing house. such investment advisors do not hold clearing member cash deposits or the underlying investments. clearing house property is held in custody accounts under clearing house control. clearing house property is held with credit worthy custodians including jpmorgan chase bank n.a., citibank n.a., bny mellon, bmo harris n.a. and euroclear bank brussels (for non-u.s. dollar deposits).
each clearing house employs (or may employ) multiple investment advisors and custodians to ensure that in the event a single investment advisor or custodian is unable to fulfill its role, additional investment advisors or custodians are available as alternatives.
cross-currency margin deposit risk each of our clearing houses, pursuant to their rules, may permit posting of cross-currency collateral to satisfy margin requirements (for example, accepting margin deposits denominated in u.s. dollars to secure a euro margin obligation). the clearing houses mitigate the risk of a decline in currency value by applying a "haircut" to the currency posted as margin at a level sufficient to provide financial protection during periods of high currency volatility. cross-currency balances are marked-to-market on a daily basis. should the currency posted to satisfy margin requirements decline in value, the clearing member is required to increase its margin deposit on a same-day basis.
impact of inflation we have not been adversely affected by inflation as technological advances and competition have generally caused prices for the hardware and software that we use for our electronic platforms to remain constant or to decline. in the event of inflation, we believe that we will be able to pass on any price increases to our participants, as the prices that we charge are not governed by long-term contracts.

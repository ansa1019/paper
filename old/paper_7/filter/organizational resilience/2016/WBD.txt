business overview we are a global media company that provides content across multiple distribution platforms, including pay-tv, fta and broadcast television, websites, digital distribution arrangements and content licensing agreements. our portfolio of networks includes prominent television brands such as discovery channel, our most widely distributed global brand, tlc, animal planet, id, velocity (known as turbo outside of the u.s.) and eurosport, a leading sports entertainment pay-tv programmer across europe and asia. we also develop and sell curriculum-based education products and services and operate production studios.
our objectives are to invest in content for our networks to build viewership, optimize distribution revenue, capture advertising sales and create or reposition branded channels and businesses that can sustain long-term growth and occupy a desired content niche with strong consumer appeal. our strategy is to maximize the distribution, ratings and profit potential of each of our branded networks. in addition to growing distribution and advertising revenues for our branded networks, we are extending content distribution across new platforms, including brand-aligned websites, web-native networks, on-line streaming, mobile devices, vod and broadband channels, which provide promotional platforms for our television content and serve as additional outlets for advertising and distribution revenue. audience ratings are a key driver in generating advertising revenue and creating demand on the part of cable television operators, dth satellite operators, telecommunication service providers, and other content distributors, that deliver our content to their customers.
our content spans genres including survival, exploration, sports, lifestyle, general entertainment, heroes, adventure, crime and investigation, health and kids. we have an extensive library of high-definition content and own rights to much of our content and footage, which enables us to exploit our library to launch brands and services into new markets quickly. our content can be re-edited and updated in a cost-effective manner to provide topical versions of subject matter that can be utilized around the world on a variety of platforms.
although the company utilizes certain brands and content globally, we classify our operations in two reportable segments: u.s. networks, consisting principally of domestic television networks and websites, and international networks, consisting primarily of international television networks and websites. for further discussion of our company, segments in which we do business, and our content development activities and revenues, see our business overview set forth in item 1, "business" in this annual report on form 10-k.
results of operations - 2016 vs. 2015
consolidated results of operations - 2016 vs. 2015
our consolidated results of operations for 2016 and 2015 were as follows (in millions).
2016                    2015          % change revenues:
costs of revenues, excluding depreciation and amortization               2,432                   2,343                4      %
operating income                                                         2,058                   1,985                4      %
nm - not meaningful revenues distribution revenue includes affiliate fees and digital distribution revenue and is largely dependent on the rates negotiated in our distribution agreements, the number of subscribers that receive our networks or content, and the market demand for the content that we provide. distribution revenue increased 5%. excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations and the acquisition of eurosport france in march 2015, distribution revenue increased 7% at our u.s. networks segment and 9% at our international networks segment. u.s. networks distribution revenue increased primarily due to contractual rate increases partially offset by slight declines in subscribers. international networks' distribution revenue increases were mostly due to increases in rates in europe and increases in subscribers and rates in latin america.
advertising revenue is dependent upon a number of factors, including the stage of development of television markets, the number of subscribers to our channels, viewership demographics, the popularity of our content, our ability to sell commercial time over a group of channels, market demand, the mix of sales of commercial time between the upfront and scatter markets, and economic conditions. these factors impact the pricing and volume of our advertising inventory. advertising revenue decreased 1%. excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations and the disposition of the company's radio business, advertising revenue increased 2% as a result of increases of 2% at our u.s. networks and 3% at our international networks. the increase for our u.s. networks was due to inventory management and pricing increases, partially offset by a decline in ratings. the increase for our international networks was primarily driven by ratings and volume in southern europe, and to a lesser extent, pricing, ratings and volume in central and eastern europe, the middle east, and africa ("ceemea"), partially offset by lower ratings in northern europe.
other revenue decreased 2%. excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations and the disposition of the company's radio business, other revenue, which includes revenues from services provided to equity investees, increased 3%. this was due to increases at our u.s. networks offset by decreases at our international networks.
costs of revenues costs of revenues increased 4%. excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations, the acquisition of eurosport france in march 2015 and the disposition of the company's radio business, costs of revenues increased 7% for the year ended december 31, 2016. the increase was primarily attributable to increased spending for content on our networks, particularly sports rights and associated production costs, and increases in content impairments in northern europe as a result of changes in programming strategies. content amortization was $1.7 billion and $1.6 billion for the years ended december 31, 2016 and december 31, 2015, respectively.
selling, general and administrative selling, general and administrative expenses consist principally of employee costs, marketing costs, research costs, occupancy and back office support fees. selling, general and administrative expenses increased 1%. excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations and the disposition of the company's radio business, selling, general and administrative expenses increased 5% for the year ended december 31, 2016. the increase was due to increases in mark-to-market equity-based compensation expense from increases in the company's stock price and marketing expense.
depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization expense includes depreciation of fixed assets and amortization of finite-lived intangible assets. depreciation and amortization declined slightly for the year ended december 31, 2016 as there have been slight declines in capital spending and no new significant business combinations.
restructuring and other charges restructuring and other charges increased $8 million for the year ended december 31, 2016. the increase was primarily due to personnel related termination costs for voluntary and involuntary severance actions in the second quarter of 2016. (see note 15 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.) this increase was partially offset by decreases in content impairments that were classified as other charges.
gain on disposition gain on disposition increased $80 million for the year ended december 31, 2016 as a result of a gain recorded upon the deconsolidation of our digital networks businesses seeker and sourcefed studios on december 2, 2016 in connection with the group nine media transaction, and the recognition of a gain following the resolution of the final contingent payment for the sale of the radio business, compared with an expected loss in the prior year. (see note 3 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.)
interest expense interest expense increased for the year ended december 31, 2016 primarily due to the march 11, 2016 issuance of the 4.90% senior notes due march 2026. (see note 9 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.)
(loss) income from equity investees, net losses from our equity method investees increased $39 million due to investments in limited liability companies that sponsor renewable energy projects related to solar energy and increased losses at all3media for derivatives that do not receive hedge accounting. (see note 4 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.)
other expense, net the table below presents the details of other expense, net (in millions).
other-than-temporary impairment of afs investments                (62     )         -
other income (expense), net increased $101 million in 2016. the change is primarily the result of gains in foreign currency offset by a $62 million other-than-temporary impairment in the value of our lionsgate shares (see note 4 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements). the change in foreign currency (gains) losses, net is caused by the remeasurement of foreign currency monetary assets and liabilities. for the year ended december 31, 2016, exchange rate changes in the british pound resulted in net remeasurement gains. the gains in the current year are in contrast to losses in the prior period for the remeasurement of our 1.90% euro-dominated senior notes due march 19, 2027, which have been effectively hedged for the year ended december 31, 2016 , and remeasurement losses on monetary assets in venezuela following a steep decline in value during the prior year.
state and local income taxes, net of federal tax benefit         (2     )%             2      %
effect of foreign operations                                     (1     )%             1      %
change in uncertain tax positions                                 -      %            (1     )%
income tax expense was $453 million and $511 million and the effective tax rate was 27% and 33% for 2016 and 2015, respectively. the net 6% decrease in the effective tax rate was attributable to the resolution of multi-year state tax positions that resulted in a reduction of reserves related to uncertain tax positions, allocation and taxation of income among multiple foreign and domestic jurisdictions, the impact of various foreign legislative changes, and tax credits that we receive related to our renewable energy investments. the decrease was partially offset by 2015 favorable audit resolutions which positively impacted the assessment of uncertain tax positions for 2015 but did not recur in 2016. (see note 16 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.)
segment results of operations - 2016 vs. 2015
we evaluate the operating performance of our operating segments based on financial measures such as revenues and adjusted oibda. adjusted oibda is defined as operating income excluding: (i) mark-to-market equity-based compensation, (ii) depreciation and amortization, (iii) amortization of deferred launch incentives, (iv) restructuring and other charges, (v) certain impairment charges, (vi) gains and losses on business and asset dispositions, and (vii) certain inter-segment eliminations related to production studios. we use this measure to assess the operating results and performance of our segments, perform analytical comparisons, identify strategies to improve performance, and allocate resources to each segment. we believe adjusted oibda is relevant to investors because it allows them to analyze the operating performance of each segment using the same metric management uses. we exclude mark-to-market equity-based compensation, restructuring and other charges, certain impairment charges, and gains and losses on business and asset dispositions from the calculation of adjusted oibda due to their volatility. we also exclude the depreciation of fixed assets and amortization of intangible assets and deferred launch incentives as these amounts do not represent cash payments in the current reporting period. additionally, certain corporate expenses and inter-segment eliminations related to production studios are excluded from segment results to enable executive management to evaluate segment performance based upon the decisions of segment executives. total adjusted oibda should be considered in addition to, but not a substitute for, operating income, net income and other measures of financial performance reported in accordance with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles ("gaap").
additional financial information for our segments and geographical areas in which we do business is discussed in note 21 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements included in item 8, "financial statements and supplementary data" in this annual report on form 10-k.
the table below presents the calculation of total adjusted oibda (in millions).

revenues distribution revenue increased 3%. excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations and the acquisition of eurosport france in march 2015, distribution revenue increased 9%. the increase was mostly due to increases in rates in europe and increases in subscribers and rates in latin america. such growth is consistent with the value negotiated in new arrangements following investment in sports content in markets in europe and the continued development of the pay-tv markets in latin america.
advertising revenue decreased 5%. excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations and the disposition of the company's radio business, advertising revenue increased 3%. the increase was primarily driven by ratings and volume in southern europe, and, to a lesser extent, pricing, ratings and volume in ceemea, partially offset by lower ratings in northern europe and lower price, ratings and volume in asia.

corporate operations primarily consist of executive management, administrative support services and substantially all of our equity-based compensation.
the increase in mark-to-market equity-based compensation expense was primarily attributable to an increase in discovery's stock price in 2016 compared to 2015. changes in stock price are a key driver of fair value estimates used in the attribution of expense for stock appreciation rights ("sars") and performance-based restricted stock units ("prsus"). by contrast, stock options and service-based restricted stock units ("rsus") are fair valued at grant date and amortized over their vesting period without mark-to-market adjustments. the expense associated with stock options and rsu's is included in adjusted oibda as a component of selling, general and administrative expense.
items impacting comparability from time to time certain items may impact the comparability of our consolidated results of operations between two periods. in comparing the financial results for the years 2016 and 2015, the company has identified foreign currency as one such item, as noted below.
foreign currency the impact of exchange rates on our business is an important factor in understanding period to period comparisons of our results. for example, our international revenues are favorably impacted as the u.s. dollar weakens relative to other foreign currencies, and unfavorably impacted as the u.s dollar strengthens relative to other foreign currencies. we believe the presentation of results on a constant currency basis ("ex-fx"), in addition to results reported in accordance with gaap, provides useful information about our operating performance because the presentation ex-fx excludes the effects of foreign currency volatility and highlights our core operating results. the presentation of results on a constant currency basis should be considered in addition to, but not a substitute for, measures of financial performance reported in accordance with gaap.
the ex-fx change represents the percentage change on a period-over-period basis adjusted for foreign currency impacts. the ex-fx change is calculated as the difference between the current year amounts translated at a baseline rate, a spot rate for each of our currencies determined early in the fiscal year as part of our forecasting process, (the "2016 baseline rate") and the prior year amounts translated at the same 2016 baseline rate. in addition, consistent with the assumption of a constant currency environment, our ex-fx results exclude the impact of our foreign currency hedging activities as well as realized and unrealized foreign currency transaction gains and losses. the impact of foreign currency on the comparability of our results is reflected in the tables below (in millions). results on a constant currency basis, as we present them, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies.

results of operations - 2015 vs. 2014
the discussion of our results that follows reflects our management reporting structure for international networks prior to january 1, 2015. effective january 1, 2015, we realigned our international networks management reporting structure into the following regions: northern europe, which includes primarily the nordic countries, which we refer to as the nordics, and u.k.; southern europe, which primarily includes italy and spain; ceemea, which has been expanded to include germany; latin america; asia-pacific; and eurosport. previously, international networks' regional operations reporting structure was segregated into the following regions: western europe, which included the u.k. and western european countries; nordics; ceemea; latin america; asia-pacific; and eurosport. this realignment did not impact our consolidated financial statements other than to change the regions in which we describe our operating results for the international networks segment from january 1, 2015.

nm - not meaningful revenues distribution revenue includes affiliate fees and digital distribution revenue and is largely dependent on the rates negotiated in our distribution agreements, the number of subscribers that receive our networks or content, and the market demand for the content that we provide. excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations, the acquisition of eurosport and the effect of the consolidation of discovery family, distribution revenue increased 7% as a result of increases of 7% at our u.s. networks segment and 7% at our international networks segment. for u.s. networks, excluding the effect of the consolidation of discovery family, distribution revenue increased primarily due to annual contractual rate increases and, to a lesser extent, increases in digital distribution revenue, partially offset by slight declines in subscribers. the increase in our international networks' distribution revenue, excluding the impact of foreign currency and the acquisition of eurosport, was mostly due to increases in affiliate rates and subscribers, in equivalent amounts, in latin america, and, a lesser extent, to increases in subscribers in ceemea and digital distribution revenue.
advertising revenue is dependent upon a number of factors, including the stage of development of television markets, the number of subscribers to our channels, viewership demographics, the popularity of our content, our ability to sell commercial time over a group of channels, market demand, the mix of sales of commercial time between the upfront and scatter markets, and economic conditions. these factors impact the pricing and volume of our advertising inventory. excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations, the acquisition of eurosport, the effect of the consolidation of discovery family, and the disposition of the company's radio business, advertising revenue increased 6%, primarily due to increases of 11% at our international networks segment and, to a lesser extent, increases of 2% at our u.s. networks segment. the increase at our international networks segment was mostly driven by pricing and, to a lesser extent, ratings in southern europe and pricing, volume, and to a lesser extent, ratings in latin america. southern europe and latin america contributed to the increase in equivalent amounts. the increases were also, to a lesser extent, due to pricing in northern europe. these increases were partially offset by decreases due to changes in regulations involving advertising sales operations in russia, as further described in item 1, "business" in this annual report on form 10-k. u.s. networks' advertising revenue increased due to increases in pricing, partially offset by lower audience delivery.
excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations, the acquisition of eurosport, the effect of the consolidation of discovery family, and the disposition of the company's radio business, other revenue increased 4%. this increase was primarily due to an increase at our education and other segments due to increased productions and, to a lesser extent, an increase at our international networks segment as result of increased program sales. these increases were offset by a decrease at our u.s. networks segment primarily due to the absence of representation service fees for discovery family, which have been eliminated since the company began to consolidate discovery family.
costs of revenues excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations, the acquisitions of eurosport, the effect of the consolidation of discovery family, and the disposition of the company's radio business, costs of revenues increased 11% as result of increases of 12% at our international networks segment and 7% at our u.s. networks segment. the increases in costs of revenues were mostly due to our commitment to increased spending for content on our networks, which increased content amortization, and, to a lesser extent, increases in content impairments that were not included in restructuring and other charges. excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations, the acquisition of eurosport and the effect of the consolidation of discovery family, content amortization was $1.5 billion and $1.3 billion for the years ended december 31, 2015 and december 31, 2014, respectively. content amortization rates on our networks have been slightly accelerating.
selling, general and administrative selling, general and administrative expenses consist principally of employee costs, marketing costs, research costs, occupancy and back office support fees. excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations, the acquisition of eurosport, the consolidation of discovery family, and the disposition of the company's radio business, selling, general and administrative expenses increased 3% for the year ended december 31, 2015. the increase was primarily due to an increase in selling, general and administrative expense at our international networks segment of 10% mostly due to increased personnel and associated support costs and, to a lesser extent, increased marketing costs. the increase was also, to a lesser extent, due to slight increases at our u.s. network segment due to an increase in research and, to a lesser extent, marketing costs. these increases were partially offset by a decrease in our equity-based compensation expense.
depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization expense includes depreciation of fixed assets and amortization of finite-lived intangible assets. excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations, business combinations and dispositions, depreciation and amortization remained consistent for the year ended december 31, 2015.
restructuring and other charges restructuring and other charges decreased $40 million. the decrease was primarily due to a decrease in content impairment resulting from the post-acquisition rebranding of the hub network to discovery family in 2014 (see note 6 and note 15 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.)
loss (gain) on disposition loss on dispositions comprised $12 million for the sale of the sbs radio business and $5 million for the contribution of the russian business to the new russian business for the year ended december 31, 2015. gain on disposition comprised $31 million for the sale of howstuffworks for the year ended december 31, 2014. (see note 3 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.)
income from equity investees, net income from our equity method investees declined $22 million, mostly due to losses at all3media related to the amortization of intangible assets for the step up in the fair value of assets acquired from the investment following its acquisition on september 23, 2014, interest expense for the recapitalization of debt for the transaction and losses on derivative instruments. the decline was also, to a lesser extent, due to the change in accounting for discovery family from an equity method investment to a consolidated subsidiary, as well as decreased income at various other equity method investees.
other expense, net the table below presents the details of other income (expense), net (in millions).
other expense, net increased $88 million in 2015. the increase was primarily due to foreign currency losses related to revaluation of our 1.90% euro-dominated senior notes due march 19, 2027, which expose discovery to fluctuations in euro exchange rates, as well as the revaluation of monetary assets in venezuela, due to changes in the bolivar exchange rate used to remeasure revenue and monetary asset balances (as further discussed in item 7a, "quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk" in this annual report on form 10-k). the increase was further attributable to a decrease in remeasurement gain related to the acquisition of a controlling interest in eurosport on may 30, 2014 of $29 million, and eurosport france on march 31, 2015 of $2 million (see note 3 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements). these increases were slightly offset by the attribution expense related to the put right held by tf1, the holder of the remaining interests in eurosport and eurosport france, as a component of other expense, net in 2014, for which there is no similar expense in the 2015.

income tax expense was $511 million and $610 million and the effective tax rate was 33% and 35% for 2015 and 2014, respectively. the net 2% decrease in the effective tax rate was attributable to a decrease in unrecognized tax benefits as a result of multiple audit resolutions and the lapse of the statute of limitations in foreign and domestic jurisdictions, favorable impact to deferred taxes due to various enacted foreign legislative changes and the allocation and taxation of income among multiple foreign and domestic jurisdictions.

corporate operations primarily consist of executive management, administrative support services and substantially all of our equity-based compensation.
adjusted oibda decreased 5%, mostly attributable to higher personnel costs and, to a lesser extent, fees related to investments and other matters, partially offset by a decrease in equity-based compensation expense for equity-settled awards such as stock options and rsus that are recorded at fair value at grant date and amortized over the vesting period without mark-to-market adjustments.
the decrease in mark-to-market equity-based compensation expense was primarily attributable to a decrease in discovery's stock price compared to 2014. changes in stock price are a key driver of fair value estimates used in the attribution of expense for sars and unit awards. (see note 13 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.)
items impacting comparability from time to time, certain items may impact the comparability of our consolidated results of operations between two periods. in comparing the financial results for the years 2015 and 2014, the company has identified foreign currency and the impact of the acquisition of eurosport as items impacting comparability between periods, as noted below.
foreign currency the impact of exchange rates on our business is an important factor in understanding period to period comparisons of our results. for example, our international revenues are favorably impacted as the u.s. dollar weakens relative to other foreign currencies, and unfavorably impacted as the u.s dollar strengthens relative to other foreign currencies. we believe the presentation of results on a constant currency basis (ex-fx), in addition to results reported in accordance with gaap provides useful information about our operating performance because the presentation ex-fx excludes the effects of foreign currency volatility and highlights our core operating results. the presentation of results on a constant currency basis should be considered in addition to, but not a substitute for, measures of financial performance reported in accordance with gaap.
the ex-fx change represents the percentage change on a period-over-period basis adjusted for foreign currency impacts. the ex-fx change is calculated as the difference between the current year amounts translated at a baseline rate, a spot rate for each of our currencies determined early in the fiscal year as part of our forecasting process, (the "2015 baseline rate") and the prior year amounts translated at the same 2015 baseline rate. in addition, consistent with the assumption of a constant currency environment, our ex-fx results exclude the impact of our foreign currency hedging activities as well as realized and unrealized foreign currency transaction gains and losses. the impact of foreign currency on the comparability of our results is reflected in the tables below (in millions). results on a constant currency basis, as we present them, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies.

newly acquired businesses on may 30, 2014, we acquired a controlling interest in eurosport international. on march 31, 2015, we acquired a controlling interest in eurosport france and integrated the business into eurosport international, collectively referred to as eurosport. (see note 3 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.) we included the operations of eurosport international and eurosport france in our consolidated financial statements as of their respective acquisition dates. as a result, eurosport has impacted the comparability of our results of operations between 2015 and 2014. accordingly, to assist the reader in understanding the changes in our results of operations, the results of operations for the years ended december 31, 2015 and 2014 excluding eurosport are presented in the tables below (in millions). the results of operations for eurosport do not reflect the synergies from increased pan-european market penetration, which are reflected in the total company excluding eurosport amounts. adjustments for discovery family, which was acquired on september 23, 2014, the company's radio business in northern europe, which was disposed of on june 30, 2015, and other less significant acquisitions made during 2015 and 2014, were not made in the comparability tables as their results did not materially impact the comparability of operations, except as otherwise noted within this item. adjusted oibda is defined and a reconciliation to operating income is presented below in "segment results of operations - 2015 vs. 2014."

liquidity and capital resources liquidity sources of cash historically, we have generated a significant amount of cash from operations. during the year ended december 31, 2016, we funded our working capital needs primarily through cash flows from operations. as of december 31, 2016, we had $300 million of cash and cash equivalents on hand. we maintain an effective registration statement on form s-3 that allows us to conduct
registered offerings of securities, including debt securities, common stock and preferred stock. access to sufficient capital from the public market is not assured.
•   debt senior notes on march 11, 2016, discovery communications, llc ("dcl"), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the company, issued $500 million principal amount of 4.90% senior notes due march 11, 2026. all of dcl's outstanding senior notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed on an unsecured and unsubordinated basis by discovery and contain certain nonfinancial covenants, events of default and other customary provisions.
revolving credit facility we have access to a $2.0 billion revolving credit facility. borrowing capacity under this agreement is reduced by the outstanding borrowings under our commercial paper program. as of december 31, 2016, the company had outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facility of $550 million at a weighted average interest rate of 2.05%. the revolving credit facility agreement provides for a maturity date of february 4, 2021, and the option for two additional 364-day renewal periods. all obligations of dcl and the other borrowers under the revolving credit facility are unsecured and are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by discovery. borrowings may be used for general corporate purposes.
the credit agreement governing the revolving credit facility (the "credit agreement") contains customary representations, warranties and events of default, as well as affirmative and negative covenants, including limitations on liens, investments, indebtedness, dispositions, affiliate transactions, dividends and restricted payments. dcl, its subsidiaries and discovery are also subject to a limitation on mergers, liquidation and disposals of all or substantially all of their assets. the credit agreement also requires dcl to maintain a consolidated interest coverage ratio (as defined in the credit agreement) of no less than 3:00 to 1:00 and a consolidated leverage ratio (as defined in the credit agreement) of no more than 4:50 to 1:00. as of december 31, 2016, discovery, dcl and the other borrowers were in compliance with all covenants and there were no events of default under the credit agreement.
commercial paper under our commercial paper program and subject to market conditions, dcl may issue unsecured commercial paper notes guaranteed by the company from time to time up to an aggregate principal amount outstanding at any given time of $1.0 billion. the maturities of these notes will vary but may not exceed 397 days. the notes may be issued at a discount or at par, and interest rates vary based on market conditions and the credit ratings assigned to the notes at the time of issuance. as of december 31, 2016, we had $48 million of commercial paper borrowings outstanding with a weighted average interest rate of approximately 1.20% and maturities of less than 90 days. borrowings under the commercial paper program reduce the borrowing capacity under the revolving credit facility arrangement referenced above.
we repay our senior notes, revolving credit facility and commercial paper as required, and accordingly these sources of cash also require use of our cash.
•   notes receivable we have an outstanding note receivable from own, our equity method investee, which totals $311 million including accrued interest. during the years ended december 31, 2016 and 2015, the company received net repayments from own of $87 million and $82 million, respectively. borrowings are scheduled for repayment four years after the borrowing date to the extent that own has excess cash to repay the borrowings then due.
uses of cash our primary uses of cash include the creation and acquisition of new content, business acquisitions, repurchases of our capital stock, income taxes, personnel costs, principal and interest on our outstanding senior notes, and funding for various equity method and other investments.
•   content acquisition we plan to continue to invest significantly in the creation and acquisition of new content. additional information regarding contractual commitments to acquire content is set forth in "commitments and off-balance sheet arrangements" in item 7, "management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations" in this annual report on form 10-k.
•   common stock repurchase program under the company's stock repurchase program, management is authorized to purchase shares of the company's common stock from time to time through open market purchases or privately negotiated transactions at prevailing prices or pursuant to one or more accelerated stock repurchase or other derivative arrangements as permitted by securities laws and other legal requirements and subject to stock price, business and market conditions and other factors. as of december 31, 2016, the company had repurchased 3 million and 150 million shares of series a and series c common stock over the life of the program for the aggregate purchase price of $171 million and $6.2 billion, respectively. over the life of the program, authorization under the stock repurchase program has totaled $7.5 billion. as of december 31, 2016, the company had remaining authorization of approximately $1.1 billion for future repurchases under the existing stock repurchase program, which will expire on october 8, 2017. (see note 12 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.) we have been funding our stock repurchases through a combination of cash on hand, cash generated by operations and the issuance of debt. in the future we may also choose to fund our stock repurchase program through borrowings under our revolving credit facility and future financing transactions.
•   prepayments for repurchase of common stock during the year ended december 31, 2016, we entered into two prepaid common stock repurchase contracts for the company's series c common stock, one of which settled via the receipt of common stock during the quarter ended december 31, 2016 and one which will settle in the first quarter of 2017. we made up-front cash-payments totaling $128 million for the two common stock repurchase contracts during 2016. the common stock repurchase contract that settled during the year ended december 31, 2016 settled at a cost of $71 million. (see note 12 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.)
•   preferred stock conversion and repurchase we have an agreement with advance/newhouse to repurchase, on a quarterly basis, a number of shares of series c convertible preferred stock convertible into 3/7 of the number of shares of series c common stock purchased under the company's stock repurchase program during the then most recently completed fiscal quarter. the price paid per share is calculated as 99% of the average price paid for the series c common shares repurchased by the company during the applicable fiscal quarter multiplied by the series c conversion rate. the advance/newhouse repurchases are made outside of the company's publicly announced stock repurchase program. during 2016, we converted, repurchased and retired 9 million shares of our series c convertible preferred stock under the preferred stock conversion and repurchase arrangement for an aggregate purchase price of $479 million. the company expects to convert, repurchase and retire approximately 1 million shares of its series c convertible preferred stock for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $60 million on or about february 16, 2017. (see note 12 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.)
•   income taxes and interest we expect to continue to make payments for income taxes and interest on our outstanding senior notes. during the year ended december 31, 2016, we made cash payments of $527 million and $343 million for income taxes and interest on our outstanding debt, respectively.
•   business combinations and investments our uses of cash have included investment in business combinations (see note 3 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements), equity method investments, afs securities and cost method investments (see note 4 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements). due to business combinations, we also have redeemable equity balances of $243 million, which may require the use of cash in the event holders of noncontrolling interests put their interests to the company.
we provide funding to our equity method investees from time to time. as of december 31, 2016, we have outstanding advances to and a note receivable from own, our equity method investee, which totals $311 million including interest. during december 2016, the company invested $63 million in limited liability companies that sponsor renewable energy projects related to solar energy. the company has total funding commitments of $238 million related to these projects, which is expected to be invested in 2017.
•   equity-based compensation we expect to continue to make payments for vested cash-settled equity awards. actual amounts expensed and payable for cash-settled awards are dependent on future fair value calculations which are primarily affected by changes in our stock price as well as changes in the number of awards outstanding. during 2016, we paid $5 million for cash-settled equity awards. as of december 31, 2016, liabilities totaled $83 million for outstanding liability-classified equity-based compensation awards, of which $31 million was classified as current. (see note 13 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.)
cash flows changes in cash and cash equivalents were as follows (in millions).
cash and cash equivalents, beginning of period                          $390                $367                $408
cash provided by operating activities                                  1,373               1,277               1,318

net change in cash and cash equivalents                                  (90    )             23                 (41    )
cash and cash equivalents, end of period                                $300                $390                $367
operating activities cash provided by operating activities increased $96 million for the year ended december 31, 2016 as compared to the year ended december 31, 2015. improvements in operating results were partially offset by increases in content spending, particularly for sports rights, of $131 million and the impact of foreign currency.
cash provided by operating activities decreased $41 million for the year ended december 31, 2015 as compared to the year ended december 31, 2014. the decrease was primarily attributable to negative foreign currency fluctuations that impacted the company's operating performance, increased content investment of $90 million and decreases in working capital of $182 million due to decreases in accounts payable and accruals. these decreases were partially offset by a decrease in cash payments for equity-based compensation of $56 million.
investing activities cash flows used in investing activities decreased $45 million for the year ended december 31, 2016 as compared to the year ended december 31, 2015. the decrease was primarily attributable to a decrease in cash paid for business combinations, net of cash acquired of $80 million, partially offset by a decrease in proceeds from dispositions of business of $42 million.
cash flows used in investing activities decreased $267 million for the year ended december 31, 2015 as compared to the year ended december 31, 2014. the decrease was primarily attributable to a decrease in cash paid for business combinations, net of cash acquired of $292 million and partially offset by an increase in payments for investments, net of $92 million.
financing activities cash flows used in financing activities increased $275 million for the year ended december 31, 2016 as compared to the year ended december 31, 2015. the increase was attributable to an increase in repurchases of stock of $423 million and a decrease in net borrowings of $471 million, which is comprised of increases in repayments on the revolver loans, net of repayments, of $973 million partially offset by increased borrowings of senior notes, net of repayments, of $411 million and decreases in commercial paper repayments of $91 million. these net increases were partially offset by decreases in purchases of redeemable noncontrolling interests of $548 million and payments on hedging instruments for derivatives in connection with the effective portion of interest rate contracts of $69 million.
cash flows used in financing activities increased $168 million for the year ended december 31, 2015 as compared to the year ended december 31, 2014. the increase was primarily due to the purchase of tf1's 49% noncontrolling interest in eurosport for $548 million, an increase in net repayments of commercial paper of $365 million, an increase in cash distributions to redeemable noncontrolling interests of $40 million and payments on hedging instruments for derivatives in connection with the effective portion of our interest rate contracts of $29 million. these increases were partially offset by increased borrowings under the revolving credit facility of $318 million and a decrease in repurchases of stock of $471 million.
capital resources as of december 31, 2016, capital resources were comprised of the following (in millions).
totalcapacity       outstandingletters ofcredit             outstandingindebtedness           unusedcapacity cash and cash equivalents                                          $300              $-                                      $-                                $300
(a) outstanding commercial paper borrowings of $48 million as of december 31, 2016 are supported by unused committed capacity under the revolving credit facility and reduce unused capacity. there were $550 million in borrowings under the revolving credit facility outstanding as of december 31, 2016.
(b) interest on senior notes is paid annually or semi-annually. our senior notes outstanding as of december 31, 2016 had interest rates that ranged from 1.90% to 6.35% and will mature between 2019 and 2043.
we expect that our cash balance, cash generated from operations and availability under our revolving credit facility will be sufficient to fund our cash needs for the next twelve months. our borrowing costs and access to the capital markets can be affected by short and long-term debt ratings assigned by independent rating agencies which are based, in part, on our performance as measured by credit metrics, such as interest coverage and leverage ratios.
as of december 31, 2016, we held $86 million of our $300 million of cash and cash equivalents in our foreign subsidiaries. we intend to permanently reinvest these funds outside of the u.s. our current plans do not demonstrate a need to repatriate them to the u.s. however, if these funds are needed in the u.s., we would be required to accrue and pay u.s. taxes to repatriate them. the determination of the amount of unrecognized u.s. deferred income tax liability with respect to these undistributed foreign earnings is not practicable.
additional information regarding the changes in our outstanding indebtedness and the significant terms and provisions of our revolving credit facility and outstanding indebtedness is discussed in note 9 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements included in item 8, "financial statements and supplementary data" in this annual report on form 10-k.
commitments and off-balance sheet arrangements obligations as of december 31, 2016, our significant contractual obligations, including related payments due by period, were as follows (in millions).
capital lease obligations:
operating lease obligations             198                      56                      87                    34                        21
the above table does not include certain long-term obligations as the timing or the amount of the payments cannot be predicted. for example, as of december 31, 2016, we have recorded $243 million for redeemable equity (see note 11 to the
accompanying consolidated financial statements), although we are unable to predict reasonably the ultimate amount or timing of any payment. the current portion of the liability for cash-settled equity-based compensation awards was $31 million as of december 31, 2016. additionally, reserves for unrecognized tax benefits have been excluded from the above table because we are unable to predict reasonably the ultimate amount or timing of settlement. our unrecognized tax benefits totaled $117 million as of december 31, 2016.
the above table also does not include dcl's revolving credit facility that, during the year ended december 31, 2016, allowed dcl and certain designated foreign subsidiaries of dcl to borrow up to $2.0 billion, including a $100 million sublimit for the issuance of standby letters of credit and a $50 million sublimit for swingline loans. borrowing capacity under this agreement is reduced by the outstanding borrowings under the commercial paper program discussed below. as of december 31, 2016, the revolving credit facility agreement provided for a maturity date of february 4, 2021 and the option for up to two additional 364-day renewal periods.
from time to time we may provide our equity method investees additional funding that has not been committed to as of december 31, 2016 based on unforeseen investee opportunities or cash flow needs. (see note 4.)
long-term debt principal payments on long-term debt reflect the repayment of our outstanding senior notes, at face value, assuming repayment will occur upon maturity. interest payments on our outstanding senior notes are projected based on their contractual rate and maturity.
capital lease obligations we acquire satellite transponders and other equipment through multi-year capital lease arrangements. principal payments on capital lease obligations reflect amounts due under our capital lease agreements. interest payments on our outstanding capital lease obligations are based on the stated or implied rate in our capital lease agreements.
operating lease obligations we obtain office space and equipment under multi-year lease arrangements. most operating leases are not cancelable prior to their expiration. payments for operating leases represent the amounts due under the agreements assuming the agreements are not canceled prior to their expiration.
purchase obligations content purchase obligations include commitments and liabilities associated with third-party producers and sports associations for content that airs on our television networks. production contracts generally require: purchase of a specified number of episodes; payments over the term of the license; and include both programs that have been delivered and are available for airing and programs that have not yet been produced or sporting events that have not yet taken place. if the content is ultimately never produced, our commitments expire without obligation. the commitments disclosed above exclude content liabilities recognized on the consolidated balance sheet. we expect to enter into additional production contracts and content licenses to meet our future content needs.
other purchase obligations include agreements with certain vendors and suppliers for the purchase of goods and services whereby the underlying agreements are enforceable, legally binding and specify all significant terms. significant purchase obligations include transmission services, television rating services, marketing research, employment contracts, equipment purchases, and information technology and other services. the company has contracts that do not require the purchase of fixed or minimum quantities and generally may be terminated with a 30-day to 60-day advance notice without penalty, and are not included in the table above past the 30-day to 60-day advance notice period. amounts related to employment contracts include base compensation and do not include compensation contingent on future events.
put rights the company has granted put rights related to an equity method investment and certain consolidated subsidiaries. harpo has the right to require the company to purchase all or part of its interest in own for fair value during a 90-day window every two and a half years commencing april 1, 2017. no amounts have been recorded by the company for the harpo put right. (see note 4 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.) hasbro, inc. ("hasbro") and jupiter telecommunications co., ltd. ("j:com") have the right to require the company to purchase their remaining noncontrolling interests in discovery family and discovery japan, respectively. the company recorded the value of the put rights for discovery family and discovery japan as a component of redeemable equity in the amounts of $216 million and $27 million, respectively. on july 22, 2015, tf1 exercised its
right to put the entirety of its remaining 49% noncontrolling interest in eurosport to the company for €491 million ($551 million as of the date redemption became mandatory). the transaction closed on october 1, 2015 for $548 million. (see note 11 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.)
off-balance sheet arrangements we have no material off-balance sheet arrangements (as defined in item 303(a)(4) of regulation s-k) that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.
related party transactions in the ordinary course of business we enter into transactions with related parties, primarily our equity method investees and liberty entities. information regarding transactions and amounts with related parties is discussed in note 19 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements included in item 8, "financial statements and supplementary data" in this annual report on form 10-k.
new accounting and reporting pronouncements we adopted certain accounting and reporting standards during 2016. information regarding our adoption of new accounting and reporting standards is discussed in note 2 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements included in item 8, "financial statements and supplementary data" in this annual report on form 10-k.
critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with gaap, which requires management to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10-k and accompanying notes. management considers an accounting policy to be critical if it is important to reporting our financial condition and results of operations, and if it requires significant judgment and estimates on the part of management in its application. the development and selection of these critical accounting policies have been determined by management and the related disclosures have been reviewed with the audit committee of the board of directors of the company. we consider policies relating to the following matters to be critical accounting policies:
•   revenue recognition;
goodwill is allocated to our reporting units, which are our operating segments or one level below our operating segments (the component level). reporting units are determined by the discrete financial information available for the component and whether it is regularly reviewed by segment management. components are aggregated into a single reporting unit if they share similar economic characteristics. our reporting units are as follows: u.s. networks, europe, latin america, asia-pacific, education, and studios.
we evaluate our goodwill for impairment annually as of november 30 or earlier upon the occurrence of substantive unfavorable changes in economic conditions, industry trends, costs, cash flows, or ongoing declines in market capitalization. if we believe that as a result of our qualitative assessment it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is greater than its carrying amount, a quantitative impairment test is not required.
for 2016, we performed a quantitative goodwill impairment test for our reporting units based on our policy of performing a quantitative impairment test every three years, irrespective of the outcome of the qualitative assessment. the quantitative impairment test requires judgment, including the identification of reporting units, the assignment of assets, liabilities and goodwill to reporting units, and the determination of fair value of each reporting unit. the first step of the test requires the comparison of the fair value of each reporting unit with its carrying amount, including goodwill. in performing the first step, we determined the fair value of our reporting units by using a combination of discounted cash flow ("dcf") analyses and market-based valuation
methodologies. determining fair value requires the company to make judgments about appropriate discount rates, perpetual growth rates, relevant comparable company earnings multiples and the amount and timing of expected future cash flows. the cash flows employed in the dcf analysis for each reporting unit are based on the reporting unit's budget, long-term business plan, and recent operating performance. discount rate assumptions are based on an assessment of the risk inherent in the future cash flows of the respective reporting unit and market conditions. given the inherent uncertainty in determining the assumptions underlying a dcf analysis, actual results may differ from those used in our valuations. in assessing the reasonableness of the determined fair values, we also reconciled the aggregate determined fair value of the company to the company's market capitalization, which included a 14% control premium.
the net assets assigned to each of our reporting units included corporate allocations. these assets and liabilities include corporate enterprise goodwill and intangible assets, allocated to each reporting unit based on the relative fair value of each reporting unit at inception, and deferred taxes and content, allocated to each reporting unit based on the jurisdiction that gave rise to the deferred tax balance or is using the content asset.
for the current year test, the fair value of the reporting units exceeded the respective carrying values by 12% to 83% ("headroom"). significant assumptions used in the dcf and market-based models included exchange rates used in the long range plan ("lrp"), discount rates that ranged from 9% to 12.5%, and guideline company earnings multiples and control premiums. an increase in the discount and decrease in the long-term growth rates of 0.5% would result in the fair value of the reporting units exceeding their respective carrying values by 5% to 82%.
the europe reporting unit, which had headroom of 12%, was the only reporting unit with fair value in excess of carrying value of less than 20%. as of december 31, 2016, the carrying value of goodwill assigned to the europe reporting unit was $2.2 billion. management will continue to monitor this reporting unit for changes in the business environment that could impact recoverability. the recoverability of goodwill is dependent upon the continued growth of cash flows from our business activities. see item 1a, "risk factors" for details on all significant risks that could impact the company's ability to successfully grow its cash flows. most significantly, changes in foreign exchange rates impact on the calculation of fair value in excess of carrying value for step 1 of the goodwill impairment test. as the europe reporting unit operates in foreign markets with various functional currencies and has significant u.s. dollar denominated assets, a strengthening of the u.s. dollar negatively impacts the fair value of the reporting unit and the calculation of excess carrying value.
for an in depth discussion of each of our significant accounting policies, including our critical accounting policies and further information regarding estimates and assumptions involved in their application, see note 2 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements included in item 8, "financial statements and supplementary data" in this annual report on form 10-k.

management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations executive summary as described further throughout this executive summary, citi's full year 2016 results of operations reflected solid overall performance and underlying momentum across the franchise, including in several businesses where citi has been making investments, such as its north america citi-branded cards business. citi also continued to demonstrate strong expense discipline, resulting in a citicorp operating efficiency ratio of 58% in 2016.
in global consumer banking (gcb), results for the north america citi-branded cards business reflected the acquisition of the costco portfolio (late in the second quarter of 2016), but also modest growth in average loans and purchase sales in the remainder of the portfolio. international gcb results reflected revenue growth and positive operating leverage in mexico, and citi announced its $1 billion investment in mexico to be completed by 2020 where it believes it has the opportunity to build upon its strong brand position and scale to lead to improved returns. in institutional clients group (icg), citi generated year-over-year revenue growth, despite the challenging market conditions in the first quarter of 2016 and the volatility in the energy sector earlier in the year.
in citicorp, loans increased 4% and deposits increased 3%. excluding the impact of foreign currency translation into u.s. dollars for reporting purposes (fx translation), citicorp loans increased 6% and deposits increased 5%. (citi's results of operations excluding the impact of fx translation are non-gaap financial measures. citi believes the presentation of its results of operations excluding the impact of fx translation provides a meaningful depiction for investors of the underlying fundamentals of its businesses.) credit quality remained broadly favorable in every region.
2016 was an important year for citi in several additional respects. first, citi holdings will no longer be reported separately (it will be reported as part of corporate/other beginning in the first quarter of 2017). at its peak, citi holdings had over $800 billion in assets and in certain quarters generated significant losses. as of december 31, 2016, citi holdings' assets of $54 billion constituted only approximately 3% of citigroup's gaap assets, and with $87 million of net income in the fourth quarter of 2016, citi holdings was profitable for ten consecutive quarters. accordingly, the results of operations and financial condition of citigroup are now driven by the core citicorp franchise.
second, citi increased the amount of capital it returned to shareholders during 2016 while at the same time increasing its key regulatory capital metrics (see "capital resources" below). during 2016, citi returned nearly $11.0 billion of capital to common shareholders in the form of dividends and the repurchase of 196 million common shares, including the additional $1.75 billion increase to its common stock repurchase program announced in november 2016. and third, while citi has more work to do, citi achieved a significant milestone during 2016 when it received feedback from the federal reserve board and fdic that neither agency had found deficiencies in citi's 2015 resolution plan.
going into 2017, while economic sentiment has improved, there continues to be much uncertainty, primarily as a result of a new u.s. presidential administration and policies and the anticipated beginning of the exit of the u.k. from the european union. for a more detailed discussion of the risks and uncertainties that could impact citi's businesses, results of operations and financial condition during 2017, see each respective business's results of operations, "risk factors" and "managing global risk" below. despite these uncertainties, citi intends to continue to build on the progress made during 2016 with a focus on further optimizing its performance to benefit shareholders.
2016 summary results citigroup citigroup reported net income of $14.9 billion, or $4.72 per share, compared to $17.2 billion, or $5.40 per share, in the prior year. results in 2015 included $254 million ($162 million after-tax) of cva/dva.
excluding the impact of cva/dva in 2015, citigroup reported net income of $14.9 billion for 2016, or $4.72 per share, compared to $17.1 billion, or $5.35 per share, in the prior year. (citi's results of operations excluding the impact of cva/dva are non-gaap financial measures. citi excludes the impact of cva/dva from results for 2015 for consistency with the current year's presentation.) the 13% decrease in net income from the prior year was primarily driven by lower revenues, largely due to the decline in citi holdings, partially offset by lower expenses and lower credit costs.
citi's revenues were $69.9 billion in 2016, a decrease of 8% from the prior year, driven by a 2% decline in citicorp and a 57% decline in citi holdings. excluding cva/dva in 2015 and the impact of fx translation (which increased the reported decline in revenues versus the prior year by approximately $1.7 billion), citigroup revenues decreased 6% from the prior year, driven by a 56% decrease in citi holdings, partially offset by a 1% increase in citicorp revenues.
as previously announced, in january 2017, citi signed agreements to effectively exit its u.s. mortgage servicing operations by the end of 2018 and intensify its focus on originations. these transactions are expected to negatively impact citi's pretax earnings by approximately $400 million, including a loss on sale and certain related transaction costs, in the first quarter of 2017. for additional information on these transactions, see note 29 to the consolidated financial statements.
expenses citigroup expenses decreased 5% versus the prior year as significantly lower expenses in citi holdings, efficiency savings and a benefit from the impact of fx translation were partially offset by ongoing investments in citicorp (including those referenced above). fx translation increased the reported
citicorp expenses increased 1%, reflecting the ongoing investments in the franchise, partially offset by efficiency savings and the benefit from the impact of fx translation.
citi holdings' expenses were $3.2 billion, down 43% from the prior year, primarily driven by sales and run-off of citi holdings assets and lower legal and repositioning costs.
credit costs citi's total provisions for credit losses and for benefits and claims of $7.0 billion decreased 12% from the prior year. the decrease was driven by a decrease in net credit losses and a lower provision for benefits and claims due to lower insurance-related business activity within citi holdings, partially offset by a net loan loss reserve build, largely driven by north america cards within citicorp, compared to a net loan loss reserve release in the prior year.
net credit losses of $6.6 billion declined 10% versus the prior year. consumer net credit losses declined 14% to
$6.1 billion, mostly reflecting continued improvement in the north america mortgage portfolio and ongoing divestiture activity within citi holdings, partially offset by higher net credit losses in north america cards in citicorp due to volume growth. corporate net credit losses increased $267 million to $511 million, mostly related to the energy portfolio in the first half of 2016, with a vast majority of the corporate net credit losses offset by releases of previously established loan loss reserves (for additional information, see "institutional clients group" and "credit risk-corporate credit" below).
the net build of allowance for loan losses and unfunded lending commitments was $217 million in 2016, compared to a $120 million release in 2015. citicorp's net reserve build was $680 million, compared to a net loan loss reserve build of $358 million in 2015. the larger net reserve build in 2016 was primarily related to the north america cards franchise, driven primarily by the impact of the costco portfolio acquisition, volume growth and seasoning and the absence of reserve releases that occurred in 2015 as credit normalized (see "global consumer banking-north america gcb" below), partially offset by a net reserve release in icg. overall, citi expects its credit costs will likely be higher in 2017 as compared to 2016, driven by loan growth and seasoning.
for additional information on citi's consumer and corporate credit costs and allowance for loan losses, see "credit risk" below.
capital citigroup's tier 1 capital and common equity tier 1 capital ratios, on a fully implemented basis, were 14.2% and 12.6% as of december 31, 2016, respectively, compared to 13.5% and 12.1% as of december 31, 2015 (all based on the basel iii advanced approaches for determining risk-weighted assets). citigroup's supplementary leverage ratio as of december 31, 2016, on a fully implemented basis, was 7.2%, compared to 7.1% as of december 31, 2015. for additional information on citi's capital ratios and related components, including the impact of citi's dtas on its capital ratios, see "capital resources" below.
citicorp citicorp net income decreased 12% from the prior year to $14.3 billion. cva/dva, recorded in icg, was $269 million ($172 million after-tax) in 2015 (for a summary of cva/dva by business within icg, see "institutional clients group" below). excluding cva/dva in 2015, citicorp's net income decreased 11% from the prior year, primarily driven by lower revenues, higher expenses and higher credit costs.
citicorp revenues decreased 2% from the prior year to $66.0 billion, reflecting a 2% decline in gcb revenues and lower revenues in corporate/other as icg revenues were largely unchanged. as referenced above, excluding cva/dva in 2015 and the impact of fx translation, citicorp's revenues increased 1% versus the prior year, as growth in the gcb and icg franchises were partially offset by lower revenues in corporate/other.
gcb revenues of $31.8 billion decreased 2% versus the prior year. excluding the impact of fx translation, gcb revenues increased 1%, as increases in north america gcb and latin america gcb were partially offset by a decrease in asia gcb. north america gcb revenues increased 1% to $20.0 billion, as higher revenues in citi-branded cards were partially offset by lower retail banking revenues. citi-branded cards revenues of $8.2 billion were up 5% versus the prior year, mostly reflecting the addition of the costco portfolio. citi retail services revenues of $6.4 billion were largely unchanged versus the prior year, as the impact of previously disclosed renewals and extension of several partnerships as well as the absence of revenues from portfolio exits was offset by modest growth in average loans. retail banking revenues decreased 3% from the prior year to $5.3 billion. excluding the previously disclosed $110 million gain on the sale of branches in texas in the prior year, retail banking revenues decreased 1% reflecting lower mortgage revenues, partially offset by higher average loans and checking deposits.
north america gcb average deposits of $183 billion increased 1% year-over-year and average retail loans of $54 billion grew 9%. average citi retail services loans of $44 billion increased 1% versus the prior year while retail services purchase sales of $80 billion were unchanged versus the prior year. average citi-branded card loans of $73 billion increased 14%, while citi-branded card purchase sales of $251 billion increased 37% versus the prior year, each including the impact of the costco portfolio acquisition. for additional information on the results of operations of north america gcb for 2016, see "global consumer banking-north america gcb" below.
international gcb revenues (consisting of latin america gcb and asia gcb (which includes the results of operations of gcb activities in certain emea countries)) decreased 8% versus the prior year to $11.8 billion, driven by a decline in latin america gcb (14%) and asia gcb (2%). excluding the impact of fx translation, international gcb revenues were unchanged versus the prior year. latin america gcb revenues increased 1% versus the prior year, as increases in average loan and deposit balances were partially offset by the
absence of the previously disclosed $160 million gain (excluding the impact of fx translation, $180 million as reported) related to the sale of citi's merchant acquiring business in mexico in the third quarter of 2015.
asia gcb revenues declined 1% versus the prior year, reflecting lower wealth management revenues driven by weak investor sentiment in early 2016, partially offset by growth in cards revenues. for additional information on the results of operations of latin america gcb and asia gcb for 2016, including the impact of fx translation, see "global consumer banking" below. year-over-year, international gcb average deposits of $117 billion increased 6%, average retail loans of $86 billion decreased 1%, investment assets under management were largely unchanged, average card loans of $23 billion increased 1% and card purchase sales of $90 billion increased 3%, all excluding the impact of fx translation.
icg revenues were $33.9 billion in 2016, largely unchanged from the prior year as a 4% increase in markets and securities services was offset by a 5% decrease in banking revenues (including the impact of $594 of million mark-to-market losses on hedges related to accrual loans within corporate lending, compared to gains of $324 million in the prior year). excluding cva/dva in 2015 and the impact of mark-to-market gains (losses) on loan hedges, icg revenues increased 3% from the prior year to $34.4 billion, driven by 6% growth in markets and securities services and 1% growth in banking revenues.
banking revenues of $17.1 billion (excluding cva/dva in 2015 and the impact of mark-to-market gains (losses) on hedges), were up 1% compared to the prior year, as growth in treasury and trade solutions and private bank were partially offset by lower investment banking revenues. investment banking revenues of $4.3 billion decreased 6% versus the prior year. advisory revenues decreased 9% to $1.0 billion, primarily reflecting lower activity during the first half of 2016. debt underwriting revenues increased 5% to $2.7 billion, as the continued low interest rate environment resulted in strong industry-wide activity in 2016, while equity underwriting revenues decreased 31% to $628 million, largely reflecting an industry-wide slowdown in activity during the year.
private bank revenues increased 3% (3% excluding cva/dva in 2015) to $3.0 billion from the prior year, driven by loan growth and improved deposit spreads, partially offset by lower capital markets activity. corporate lending revenues declined 46% to $1.2 billion, including $594 million of mark-to-market losses on hedges related to accrual loans compared to a $324 million gain in the prior year. excluding the mark-to-market impact of loan hedges, corporate lending revenues decreased 3% versus the prior year, primarily driven by a lease financing adjustment in the second quarter of 2016, lower spreads and higher hedging costs. treasury and trade solutions revenues of $8.1 billion increased 4% versus the prior year. excluding the impact of fx translation, treasury and trade solutions revenues increased 8%, reflecting continued growth in transaction volumes and fee growth.
markets and securities services revenues of $17.3 billion, excluding cva/dva in 2015, increased 6% from the prior year. fixed income markets revenues of $13.0 billion increased 13% (15% excluding cva/dva in 2015) from the prior year, driven by growth in both rates and currencies and spread products. equity markets revenues of $2.9 billion decreased 10% (9% excluding cva/dva in 2015) from the prior year, reflecting an industry-wide slowdown in client activity. securities services revenues of $2.2 billion increased 1% versus the prior year. excluding the impact of fx translation, securities services revenues increased 5% as increased client activity, higher deposit volumes and improved spreads more than offset the absence of revenues from divested businesses. for additional information on the results of operations of icg for 2016, see "institutional clients group" below.
corporate/other revenues decreased to $410 million from $908 million in the prior year, primarily reflecting the absence of gains from real estate and other asset sales and the equity contribution related to citi's stake in china guangfa bank, which was divested in the third quarter of 2016. for additional information on the results of operations of corporate/other for 2016, see "corporate/other" below.
citicorp end-of-period loans increased 4% to $591 billion from the prior year, driven by a 5% increase in consumer loans and a 3% increase in corporate loans. excluding the impact of fx translation, citicorp loans grew 6%, with 8% growth in consumer loans and 4% growth in corporate loans.
citi holdings citi holdings' net income was $600 million in 2016, compared to $974 million in the prior year. cva/dva was negative $15 million (negative $10 million after-tax) in 2015. excluding the impact of cva/dva in the prior year, citi holdings' net income was $600 million, compared to $984 million in the prior year, primarily reflecting lower revenues, partially offset lower expenses and lower credit costs. citi does not expect the same level of net income from citi holdings to recur in 2017.
citi holdings' revenues were $3.9 billion, down 57% from the prior year. excluding cva/dva in 2015, citi holdings' revenues also decreased 57% to $3.9 billion from the prior year, mainly reflecting continued reductions in citi holdings assets and lower net gains on asset sales. for additional information on the results of operations of citi holdings for 2016, see "citi holdings" below.
as noted above, at the end of 2016, citi holdings' assets were $54 billion, 33% below the prior year, and represented approximately 3% of citi's total gaap assets. citi holdings' risk-weighted assets were $104 billion as of december 31, 2016, a decrease of 25% from the prior year, and represented 9% of citi's risk-weighted assets under basel iii (based on the advanced approaches for determining risk-weighted assets).

net income decreased by 22% due to significantly higher cost of credit and higher expenses, partially offset by higher revenues.
revenues increased 1%, reflecting higher revenues in citi-branded cards, partially offset by lower revenues in retail banking.
retail banking revenues decreased 3%. excluding the previously disclosed $110 million gain on sale of branches in texas in the first quarter of 2015, revenues decreased 1%, primarily driven by lower mortgage revenues. the decline in mortgage revenues was due to lower gain on sale revenues due to lower mortgage originations, lower servicing revenues and lower spreads driven by higher cost of funds. north america gcb expects higher interest rates could negatively impact mortgage revenues in 2017. the decline in mortgage revenues was partially offset by continued volume growth, including growth in average loans (9%) and average checking deposits (9%).
cards revenues increased 3%. in citi-branded cards, revenues increased 5%, primarily reflecting the acquisition of the costco portfolio (completed june 17, 2016) as well as volume growth, partially offset by higher investment-related acquisition and rewards costs and the impact of higher promotional balances. average loans grew 14% (3% excluding costco) and purchase sales grew 37% (9% excluding costco), driven by continued investments in the portfolio. while north america gcb believes it has largely absorbed the impact of higher acquisition and rewards costs as of year-end 2016, it expects the negative impact of higher promotional balances driven by new card accounts in the business could continue to impact citi-branded cards revenues in the first half of 2017, with this impact abating in the second half of 2017.
citi retail services revenues were largely unchanged as the impact of the previously disclosed renewal and extension of several partnerships within the portfolio as well as the absence of revenues from portfolio exits were offset by modest growth in average loans. average loans increased 1%, while purchase sales were largely unchanged. north america gcb expects citi retail services revenues to continue to reflect the impacts of the more competitive terms of the partnership renewals and the portfolio sales during 2017, partially offset by volume growth.
expenses increased 7%, primarily due to the costco acquisition, continued investment spending (including marketing spending), volume growth, higher repositioning charges and regulatory and compliance costs. this increase was partially offset by ongoing efficiency savings, including continued reductions in retail banking branches (7%) in 2016, and lower legal and related costs.
provisions increased 33%, driven by a net loan loss reserve build ($658 million), compared to a loan loss reserve release in the prior year ($330 million), and higher net credit losses (5%). the net loan loss reserve build mostly reflected reserve builds in the cards portfolios and was primarily driven by the impact of the acquisition of the costco portfolio, as well as volume growth and seasoning of the portfolios and the absence of nearly $400 million of reserve releases in 2015 as credit normalized. the reserve build was also due to the estimated impact of proposed regulatory guidelines in july 2016 on third-party debt collections.
the increase in net credit losses was driven by increases in the cards businesses and retail banking. in retail banking, net credit losses grew 38% to $207 million, primarily due to an increase related to citi's energy and energy-related exposures within the commercial banking portfolio, which was largely offset by releases of previously established loan loss reserves (for information on citi's energy and energy-related exposures within commercial banking in north america gcb, see "credit risk-commercial credit" below).
in citi-branded cards, net credit losses increased 1% to $1.9 billion, driven by volume growth (14% increase in average loans), including the impact of costco beginning in the fourth quarter of 2016, seasoning and the impact of the regulatory changes on collections. in citi retail services, net credit losses increased 6% to $1.8 billion, primarily due to portfolio growth and seasoning and the impact of the regulatory changes on collections. north america gcb expects net credit losses in 2017 in cards to reflect the full year impact of the costco portfolio acquisition, portfolio growth and seasoning and the impact of regulatory changes on collections.
for additional information on north america gcb's retail banking, including commercial banking, and its citi-branded cards and citi retail services portfolios, see "credit risk-consumer credit" below.
net income decreased by 4% due to lower loan loss reserve releases and lower revenues, partially offset by lower expenses and lower net credit losses.
revenues decreased 1%, reflecting lower revenues in citi-branded cards, partially offset by higher revenues in retail banking. retail banking revenues increased 5%. the increase was primarily driven by 7% growth in average loans, 9% growth in average checking deposits, improved deposit spreads and slightly higher mortgage origination revenues, partially offset by lower net gains on branch sales (approximately $40 million) and mortgage portfolio sales (approximately $80 million) as well as a lower mortgage repurchase reserve release (approximately $50 million) compared to 2014. cards revenues decreased 3% due to a 2% decline in average loans, partially offset by a 4% increase in purchase sales. in citi-branded cards, revenues decreased 6%, primarily reflecting an increase in acquisition and rewards costs, particularly during the second half of 2015, as north america gcb deployed its investment spending to grow its new account acquisitions in its core products. the decrease in citi-branded cards revenues was also due to the continued impact of lower average loans (down 4%), driven primarily by continued high customer payment rates during the year, partially offset by a 6% increase in purchase sales.
citi retail services revenues were largely unchanged as the continued impact of lower fuel prices and higher contractual partner payments was offset by the impact of higher spreads. purchase sales were unchanged as the
continued impact of lower fuel prices was offset by volume growth.
expenses decreased 5%, primarily due to ongoing cost reduction initiatives, including as a result of north america gcb's branch rationalization strategy, and lower repositioning charges, partially offset by increased investment spending (including marketing, among other areas) in citi-branded cards.
provisions increased 16% largely due to lower net loan loss reserve releases (74%), partially offset by lower net credit losses (11%). net credit losses declined in citi-branded cards (down 14% to $1.9 billion) and in citi retail services (down 8% to $1.7 billion). the lower loan loss reserve release reflected overall credit stabilization in the cards portfolios during 2015.

the discussion of the results of operations for latin america gcb below excludes the impact of fx translation for all periods presented. presentations of the results of operations, excluding the impact of fx translation, are non-gaap financial measures. for a reconciliation of certain of these metrics to the reported results, see the table above.
net income increased 7%, driven by higher revenues and lower expenses, partially offset by higher credit costs.
revenues increased 1%, driven by overall volume growth, largely offset by the absence of a previously disclosed $160 million gain on sale (excluding the impact of fx translation, $180 million as reported) related to the sale of the merchant acquiring business in mexico in the third quarter of 2015. excluding this gain, revenues increased 5%, primarily due to higher revenues in retail banking, partially offset by lower revenues in cards.
retail banking revenues increased 4%. excluding the gain on sale related to the merchant acquiring business, revenues increased 9%, driven by volume growth, including an increase in average loans (8%) due to higher personal loans, and higher average deposits (12%). cards revenues decreased 4%, driven by the continued impact of higher payment rates, partially offset by increased purchase sales (8%).
expenses decreased 2% as lower legal and related expenses, the impact of business divestitures, ongoing efficiency savings and the impact of certain episodic items in 2015 were partially offset by higher repositioning charges and ongoing investment spending. citi continues to execute on its investment plans for citibanamex (totaling more than $1 billion over the next several years), including initiatives to modernize the branch network, enhance digital capabilities and upgrade core operating platforms.
provisions increased 1%, driven by a higher net loan loss reserve build, partially offset by lower net credit losses. the net loan loss reserve build increased $56 million, largely due to volume growth within the personal loan and mortgage portfolios. net credit losses decreased 5%, largely reflecting continued lower net credit losses in the cards portfolio due to a focus on higher credit quality customers, partially offset by higher net credit losses in the personal loan portfolio. despite this decrease, latin america gcb expects net credit losses within its loan portfolios could increase consistent with continued portfolio growth and seasoning. for additional information on latin america gcb's retail banking, including commercial banking, and its citi-branded cards portfolios, see "credit risk-consumer credit" below.
in 2016, mexico experienced slower economic growth and the value of the peso declined, particularly later in the year, which resulted in higher inflation and negatively impacted consumer confidence. these factors could negatively impact latin america gcb's results in the near term. for additional information on potential macroeconomic and geopolitical challenges and other risks facing latin america gcb, see "risk factors-strategic risks" below.
net income decreased 7% as higher expenses were partially offset by higher revenues and lower credit costs.
revenues increased 3%, primarily due to the gain on sale related to the mexico merchant acquiring business. excluding this gain, revenues were largely unchanged as higher retail banking revenues were offset by lower cards revenues. revenues were also impacted by continued slow economic growth in mexico during 2015. retail banking revenues increased 2%, excluding the gain on sale related to the merchant acquiring business. this increase in retail banking revenues reflected volume growth. cards revenues decreased 2%, primarily due to higher payment rates, as well as muted volumes and ongoing shifts in consumer behavior, including due to the previously disclosed regulatory reforms in mexico enacted in 2013.
expenses increased 8%, primarily due to higher regulatory and compliance costs, higher technology spending and mandatory salary increases, partially offset by lower repositioning charges, lower legal and related costs and ongoing efficiency savings.
provisions declined 6%, driven by a higher net loan loss reserve release. net credit losses were largely unchanged as higher net credit losses in the commercial banking and small business banking portfolios were offset by the absence of a $71 million charge-off in the fourth quarter of 2014 related to citi's homebuilder exposure in mexico. the net loan loss reserve build declined 70%, primarily due to lower builds related to cards, partially offset by the absence of releases related to the homebuilder exposure in 2014.

revenues decreased 1%, reflecting lower retail banking revenues, partially offset by higher cards revenues. retail banking revenues decreased 2%, mainly due to a 5% decrease in wealth management revenues due to lower client activity in the first half of 2016, particularly in china, hong kong and korea. the decline in retail banking revenues was also due to modestly lower investment assets under management (1%) driven by lower equity market values and a decline in average loans (decrease of 4%). the decline in revenues was partially offset by growth in deposit volumes (4% increase in average deposits) and higher insurance revenues. the lower average loans were due to the continued optimization of the retail loan portfolio away from lower-yielding mortgage loans, as well as de-risking in the commercial portfolio with a focus on growing higher return personal loans.
cards revenues increased 2%, driven by continued improvement in yields, modestly abating regulatory headwinds and modest volume growth due to continued stabilizing payment rates. volume growth was driven by a 1% increase in average loans and a 2% increase in purchase sales.
expenses increased 3%, primarily due to higher repositioning costs in the first half of 2016, higher regulatory and compliance costs and increased investment spending, partially offset by efficiency savings.
provisions were largely unchanged as lower net loan loss reserve releases were offset by lower net credit losses, primarily in the commercial portfolio due to the de-risking.
for additional information on asia gcb's retail banking, including commercial banking, and its citi-branded cards portfolios, see "credit risk-consumer credit" below.
net income was largely unchanged as lower revenues were offset by lower expenses and lower cost of credit.
revenues decreased 3%, primarily due to an industry-wide slowdown in investment sales, particularly in the second half of 2015, as well as spread compression and higher payment rates and the ongoing impact of regulatory changes in cards, partially offset by volume growth. retail banking revenues decreased 2%, mainly due to a decline in investment sales revenue, reflecting weaker customer confidence due to slowing economic growth and volatility in the capital markets, as well as spread compression. this decline in revenues was partially offset by higher volumes, driven by lending (2% increase in average loans), deposit products (5% increase in average deposits) and higher insurance fee revenues.
cards revenues decreased 5%, primarily due to spread compression, including continued high payment rates, and the ongoing impact of regulatory changes, partially offset by modest volume growth (a 3% increase in average loans and a 5% increase in purchase sales). cards revenues were also impacted by the weaker customer confidence.
expenses decreased 4%, primarily due to the absence of repositioning charges in korea in 2014 and efficiency savings, partially offset by higher regulatory and compliance costs, investment spending, volume-related growth and compensation expense.
provisions decreased 5%, primarily due to higher loan loss reserve releases, largely offset by an increase in net credit losses related to the consumer business in russia due to deterioration in the economic environment.
institutional clients group institutional clients group (icg) provides corporate, institutional, public sector and high-net-worth clients around the world with a full range of wholesale banking products and services, including fixed income and equity sales and trading, foreign exchange, prime brokerage, derivative services, equity and fixed income research, corporate lending, investment banking and advisory services, private banking, cash management, trade finance and securities services. icg transacts with clients in both cash instruments and derivatives, including fixed income, foreign currency, equity and commodity products.
icg revenue is generated primarily from fees and spreads associated with these activities. icg earns fee income for assisting clients in clearing transactions, providing brokerage and investment banking services and other such activities. revenue generated from these activities is recorded in commissions and fees and investment banking. revenue is also generated from transaction processing and assets under custody and administration. revenue generated from these activities is primarily recorded in administration and other fiduciary fees. in addition, as a market maker, icg facilitates transactions, including holding product inventory to meet client demand, and earns the differential between the price at which it buys and sells the products. these price differentials and the unrealized gains and losses on the inventory are recorded in principal transactions (for additional information on principal transactions revenue, see note 6 to the consolidated financial statements). other primarily includes mark-to-market gains and losses on certain credit derivatives, gains and losses on available-for-sale (afs) securities and other non-recurring gains and losses. interest income earned on assets held less interest paid to customers on deposits and long-term and short-term debt is recorded as net interest revenue.
the amount and types of markets revenues are impacted by a variety of interrelated factors, including market liquidity; changes in market variables such as interest rates, foreign exchange rates, equity prices, commodity prices, and credit spreads, as well as their implied volatilities; investor confidence; and other macroeconomic conditions. assuming all other market conditions do not change, increases in client activity levels or bid/offer spreads generally result in increases in revenues. however, changes in market conditions can significantly impact client activity levels, bid/offer spreads, and the fair value of product inventory. for example, a decrease in market liquidity may increase bid/offer spreads, decrease client activity levels, and widen credit spreads on product inventory positions.
icg's management of the markets businesses involves daily monitoring and evaluating of the above factors at the trading desk as well as the country level. icg does not separately track the impact on total markets revenues of the volume of transactions, bid/offer spreads, fair value changes of product inventory positions and economic hedges because, as noted above, these components are interrelated and are not deemed useful or necessary individually to manage the markets businesses at an aggregate level.
in the markets businesses, client revenues are those revenues directly attributable to client transactions at the time of inception, including commissions, interest, or fees earned. client revenues do not include the results of client facilitation activities (for example, holding product inventory in anticipation of client demand) or the results of certain economic hedging activities.
icg's international presence is supported by trading floors in approximately 80 countries and a proprietary network in 97 countries and jurisdictions. at december 31, 2016, icg had approximately $1.3 trillion of assets and $610 billion of deposits, while two of its businesses, securities services and issuer services, managed approximately $15.2 trillion of assets under custody compared to $15.1 trillion at the end of 2015.

the discussion of the results of operations for icg below excludes the impact of cva/dva for 2015 and 2014. presentations of the results of operations, excluding the impact of cva/dva and the impact of gains (losses) on hedges of accrual loans, are non-gaap financial measures. for a reconciliation of these metrics to the reported results, see the table above.
net income increased 6%, primarily driven by lower expenses and lower cost of credit.
•   revenues were largely unchanged, reflecting higher revenues in markets and securities services (increase of 6%), driven by fixed income markets, offset by lower revenues in banking (decrease of 5% including the gains/(losses) on hedges of accrual loans). excluding the impact of the gains (losses) on loan hedges, banking revenues increased 1%, driven by treasury and trade solutions and the private bank.
•   investment banking revenues decreased 6%, largely reflecting the overall industry-wide slowdown in activity levels in equity underwriting and advisory during the first half of 2016. advisory revenues decreased 9%, driven by north america, reflecting strong performance in 2015 and the lower overall m&amp;a market. equity underwriting revenues decreased 31%, driven by north america and emea, primarily reflecting the lower market activity. debt underwriting revenues increased 5%, driven by north america, primarily due to higher market activity reflecting a favorable interest rate environment.
•   treasury and trade solutions revenues increased 4%. excluding the impact of fx translation, revenues increased 8%, reflecting growth across most regions. the increase was primarily due to continued growth in transaction volumes with new and existing clients, continued growth in deposit balances and improved spreads in certain regions. the trade business experienced modest growth due to a continued focus on high quality loan growth and spread improvements. end-of-period deposit balances increased 5% (6% excluding the impact of fx translation), while average trade loans decreased 2% (1% excluding the impact of fx translation).
•   corporate lending revenues decreased 46%. excluding the impact of gains (losses) on hedges of accrual loans, revenues decreased 3%. excluding the impact of gains (losses) on hedges of accrual loans and fx translation, revenues decreased 1%, mostly reflecting a lease financing adjustment in the second quarter of 2016, spread compression and higher hedging costs, partially offset by higher average loans.
•   private bank revenues increased 3%, driven by north america, reflecting growth in loan volumes and improved banking spreads, partially offset by lower capital markets activity and lower managed investments revenues.
within markets and securities services:
•   fixed income markets revenues increased 15%, with higher revenues in all regions. the increase was largely driven by both higher principal transactions revenues (up 22%) and other revenues (up 78%). the increase in principal transactions revenues was primarily due to higher rates and currencies revenues, reflecting increased client revenues and higher volatility. principal transactions revenues also increased due to higher spread products revenues. other revenues increased mainly due to foreign currency losses in 2015.
rates and currencies revenues grew 22%, driven by strength in all regions, primarily due to a more favorable trading environment and higher client revenues, particularly with corporate clients. the increase in client revenues was primarily driven by volatility following the vote in the u.k. to withdraw from the eu and the u.s. presidential election, as well as changing expectations regarding the interest rate environment. spread products revenues increased 5% offset by lower other fixed income revenues. the increase in spread products revenues reflects higher client revenues in credit products, securitized products and municipal securities, particularly in the second half of 2016 as client risk appetite recovered. this increase in spread products revenues was partially offset by the impact of significantly lower liquidity in the market in the first quarter of 2016, particularly in securitized products, as well as market uncertainty in municipal securities in the fourth quarter of 2016 due to potential changes in u.s. tax laws following the u.s. presidential election.
•   equity markets revenues declined 9%. equity derivatives and prime finance revenues declined 13%, reflecting both a challenging trading environment across all regions driven by lower volatility compared to 2015, and a comparison to a more favorable trading environment in 2015 in asia. the decline in equity markets revenue was also due to lower equity cash commissions driven by a continued shift to electronic trading and passive investing by clients across the industry.
•   securities services revenues increased 1%. excluding the impact of fx translation, revenues increased 5%, driven by emea, primarily reflecting increased client activity, a modest gain on sale of a private equity fund services business in the first quarter of 2016, higher deposit volumes and improved spreads. the increase in revenues was partially offset by the absence of revenues from divestitures. excluding the impact of fx translation and divestitures, revenues increased 6%.
expenses decreased 1% as a benefit from fx translation and efficiency savings were partially offset by higher compensation expense and higher repositioning charges.
provisions decreased 49%, driven by a net loan loss reserve release of $30 million (compared to a net build of $748 million in the prior year). the significant decline in loan loss reserve builds related to energy and energy-related exposures, and was driven by stabilization of commodities as oil prices continued to recover from lows in early 2016. the decline in cost of credit was partially offset by higher net credit losses of $516 million (compared to $214 million in the prior year) mostly related to the energy and energy-related exposures, with a vast majority offset by the release of previously established loan loss reserves. for additional information on citi's corporate energy and energy-related exposures, see "credit risk-corporate credit" below.
net income declined 4% as higher credit costs were partially offset by lower expenses.
•   revenues were largely unchanged as lower revenues in markets and securities services (decrease of 1%) were offset by a modest increase in revenues in banking (increase of 1%, but unchanged excluding the gains (losses) on hedges of accrual loans).
•   investment banking revenues decreased 3%, largely reflecting an industry-wide decline in underwriting activity. advisory revenues increased 17%, reflecting increased target client activity and strength in the overall m&amp;a market. equity underwriting revenues decreased 28% driven by the lower market activity and a decline in wallet share resulting from continued share fragmentation. debt underwriting revenues increased 1%, driven by increased wallet share in investment grade debt and strong performance in investment grade loans in the second half of 2015, partially offset by the lower market activity and decreased wallet share in high-yield and leveraged loans.
•   treasury and trade solutions revenues were largely unchanged. excluding the impact of fx translation, revenues increased 6%, as continued growth in deposit balances across regions and improved spreads, particularly in north america, were partially offset by continued declines in trade balances and spreads. end-of-period deposit balances increased 4% (7% excluding the impact of fx translation), largely driven by asia and latin america. average trade loans decreased 12% (9% excluding the impact of fx translation).
•   corporate lending revenues increased 7%. excluding the impact of gains (losses) on hedges of accrual loans, revenues decreased 3%. excluding the impact of fx translation and gains (losses) on hedges of accrual loans, revenues also increased 3% as continued growth in average loan balances, lower hedge premium costs and an improvement in mark-to-market adjustments were partially offset by lower spreads, particularly in emea.
•   private bank revenues increased 7%, reflecting strength in north america, asia and emea, primarily due to growth in loan volumes and deposit balances, improved spreads in banking and higher managed investments revenues, partially offset by continued spread compression in lending.
within markets and securities services:
•   fixed income markets revenues decreased 7%, driven by north america. the decline was primarily due to a 13% decline in principal transactions revenues, primarily lower spread products revenues, partially offset by higher rates and currencies revenues. rates and currencies revenues increased 5%, reflecting significant market volatility due to central bank actions, which contributed to higher client revenues, partly offset by modest losses on the swiss franc revaluation. spread products and other fixed income revenues declined 25%, mostly driven by north america and emea, reflecting a challenging trading environment and lower client activity, especially in structured products.
•   equity markets revenues increased 15%. equity derivatives and prime finance revenues increased 16% reflecting increased volatility and higher client revenues. sharply increased trading opportunities as a result of market turbulence in china drove higher asia equity derivatives and prime finance revenues versus 2014. the increase in equity markets revenues was partially offset by a decline in commissions driven by equity cash, due to lower client activity in all regions except asia.
•   securities services revenues increased 5%. excluding the impact of fx translation, revenues increased 16%, reflecting increased client activity and higher client balances.
expenses decreased 2% as efficiency savings, a benefit from fx translation and lower repositioning charges were partially offset by increased regulatory and compliance costs and compensation expense.
provisions increased $915 million to $962 million, primarily reflecting a net loan loss reserve build ($748 million), compared to a net loan loss reserve release ($228 million) in 2014. the net loan loss reserve build included approximately $530 million for energy and energy-related exposures, including $250 million in the fourth quarter of 2015, due to the significant decline in commodity prices during the second half of 2015. the remainder of the build during 2015 was primarily due to volume growth and overall macroeconomic conditions.
the higher net loan loss reserve build during 2015 was partially offset by lower net credit losses. net credit losses decreased 22%, primarily due to the absence of net credit losses of approximately $165 million related to the petróleos mexicanos (pemex) supplier program, which were incurred during 2014 (for additional information, see citi's form 8-k filed with the sec on february 28, 2014), partially offset by increased net credit losses related to a limited number of energy and energy-related exposures, including approximately $75 million in the fourth quarter of 2015.
corporate/other corporate/other includes certain unallocated costs of global staff functions (including finance, risk, human resources, legal and compliance), other corporate expenses and unallocated global operations and technology expenses, corporate treasury and discontinued operations. at december 31, 2016, corporate/other had $49 billion of assets, or 3% of citigroup's total assets. as announced in april 2016, beginning in the first quarter of 2017, the remaining businesses and portfolio of assets in citi holdings will be reported as part of corporate/other. for additional information, see "citigroup segments," "executive summary-2016 summary results-citi holdings" and "citicorp" above and "citi holdings" below.

the net loss was $659 million, compared to net income of $424 million in 2015, primarily reflecting lower revenues and a higher effective tax rate in 2016 due to the absence of certain tax benefits in 2015. the net loss was also due to the absence of the favorable tax impact reflecting the resolution of state and local audits in the second quarter of 2015.
revenues decreased 55%, primarily due to the absence of gains on real estate and other asset sales in 2015, lower gains on debt buybacks and the absence of the equity contribution related to china guangfa bank (which was sold in the third quarter of 2016), partially offset by higher investment income.
expenses increased 2%, largely driven by higher corporate-wide advertising and marketing expenses primarily related to citi's sponsorship of the u.s. olympic team and higher consulting costs, partially offset by lower legal and related expenses, lower repositioning costs and a benefit from fx translation.
net income was $424 million, compared to a net loss of $5.4 billion in 2014, largely reflecting significantly lower expenses, the increased tax benefits and the favorable tax impact reflecting the resolution of the state and local audits, as well as higher revenues.
revenues increased $605 million to $908 million, primarily due to the gains on debt buybacks and the real estate sales in 2015, as well as higher revenues from sales of afs securities, partially offset by hedging activities.
expenses decreased $4.3 billion to $1.8 billion, largely driven by lower legal and related expenses ($797 million compared to $4.4 billion in 2014), a benefit from fx translation and lower repositioning charges.
citi holdings citi holdings contains the remaining businesses and portfolios of assets that citigroup has determined are not central to its core citicorp businesses. as announced in april 2016, citi will no longer report the results of citi holdings separately beginning in the first quarter of 2017 and citi holdings will cease to be a separately reported business segment. for additional information, see "citigroup segments" and "citicorp" above.
as of december 31, 2016, citi holdings assets were approximately $54 billion, a decrease of 33% year-over-year and 11% from september 30, 2016. the decline in assets of $7 billion from september 30, 2016 primarily consisted of divestitures and run-off. as of december 31, 2016, citi had signed agreements to reduce citi holdings gaap assets by an additional $9 billion, subject to regulatory approvals and other closing conditions.
also as of december 31, 2016, consumer assets in citi holdings were approximately $49 billion, or approximately 91% of citi holdings assets. of the consumer assets, approximately $28 billion, or 57%, consisted of north america mortgages (residential first mortgages and home equity loans). as of december 31, 2016, citi holdings represented approximately 3% of citi's gaap assets and 9% of its risk-weighted assets under basel iii (based on the advanced approaches).

net income was $600 million, compared to net income of $984 million in 2015, primarily due to lower revenues, partially offset by lower expenses and lower credit costs.
revenues decreased 57%, primarily driven by the overall wind-down of the portfolio and lower net gains on sales, particularly the sales of onemain financial and the retail banking and credit cards businesses in japan in the fourth quarter of 2015.
expenses declined 43%, primarily due to sales and run-off of assets, lower legal and related costs and lower repositioning costs.
provisions decreased 95% due to lower net credit losses and a lower provision for benefits and claims (decrease of 84%) due to lower insurance-related business activity. net credit losses declined 68%, primarily due to the impact of divestitures and continued credit improvements in north america mortgages. the net reserve release declined 3%.
net income was $984 million, an improvement from a net loss of $3.4 billion in 2014, largely due to the impact of a charge of $3.8 billion ($3.7 billion after-tax) in 2014 to settle rmbs and cdo-related claims. excluding the mortgage settlement, net income increased $705 million, primarily due to lower expenses and lower net credit losses, partially offset by a lower net loan loss reserve release and lower revenues.
revenues decreased 4%, primarily driven by the overall wind-down of the portfolio, the impact of redemptions of high cost debt and the impact of recording onemain financial net credit losses as a reduction of revenue beginning in the second quarter of 2015, mostly offset by higher gains on asset sales, including the sales of onemain financial and the retail banking and credit cards businesses in japan.
expenses declined 49%. excluding the impact of the mortgage settlement, expenses declined 22%, primarily due to sales and run-off of citi holdings assets and lower legal and related costs ($431 million compared to $1.0 billion in 2014).
provisions decreased 22%. excluding the impact of the mortgage settlement, provisions decreased 20%, driven by lower net credit losses, partially offset by a lower net loss reserve release. net credit losses declined 39%, primarily due to the impact of the recording of onemain financial net credit losses as a reduction in revenue, continued improvements in north america mortgages and overall lower asset levels. the net reserve release decreased 49%. excluding the impact of the mortgage settlement, the net reserve release decreased 52% to $478 million, primarily due to lower releases related to the north america mortgage portfolio.
the selling of ppi by financial institutions in the u.k. has been the subject of intense review and focus by u.k. regulators and the u.k. supreme court. for additional information on ppi, see "citi holdings" in citi's annual report on form 10-k for the year ended december 31, 2013 filed with the sec on march 3, 2014.
ppi is designed to cover a customer's loan repayments if certain events occur, such as long-term illness or unemployment. the u.k. financial conduct authority (fca) found certain problems across the industry with how these products were sold, including customers not realizing that the cost of ppi premiums was being added to their loan or ppi being unsuitable for the customer. redress generally involves the repayment of premiums and the refund of all applicable contractual interest together with compensatory interest of 8%. in addition, during the fourth quarter of 2015, the u.k. supreme court issued a ruling in a case (plevin) involving ppi pursuant to which the court ruled, independent of the sale of the ppi contract, the ppi contract at issue in the case was "unfair" due to the high sales commissions earned and the lack of disclosure to the customer thereof.
during the third quarter of 2016, the fca issued a new consultation paper that proposed (i) a deadline for ppi complaints of june 2019 (a 2018 deadline was proposed previously) for both non-plevin and plevin complaints; (ii) an fca-led customer communications campaign in advance of the deadline, with bank funding of the campaign; and (iii) a failure to disclose a sales commission of 50% or more would be deemed unfair when assessing a new ppi complaint and require a customer refund of the difference between the commission paid and 50%, plus interest. final rules have not yet been published by the fca.
during 2016, citi increased its ppi reserves by approximately $134 million ($63 million of which was recorded in citi holdings and $71 million of which was recorded in discontinued operations). the increase for full year 2016 compared to an increase of $153 million during 2015 and was primarily due to the new proposed deadline for ppi complaints as well as the ongoing level of ppi claims.
citi's year-end 2016 ppi reserve was $228 million (compared to $262 million as of december 31, 2015).
additional reserving actions, if any, in 2017 will largely depend on the timing and requirements of the fca's final rules and the level of customer response to any communications campaign.
off-balance sheet arrangements citigroup enters into various types of off-balance sheet arrangements in the ordinary course of business. citi's involvement in these arrangements can take many different forms, including without limitation:
•   providing guarantees, indemnifications, loan commitments, letters of credit and representations and warranties; and
•   entering into operating leases for property and equipment.
citi enters into these arrangements for a variety of business purposes. for example, securitization arrangements offer investors access to specific cash flows and risks created through the securitization process. securitization arrangements also assist citi and its customers in monetizing their financial assets and securing financing at more favorable rates than citi or the customers could otherwise obtain.
the table below shows where a discussion of citi's various off-balance sheet arrangements may be found in this form 10-k. in addition, see notes 1, 21 and 26 to the consolidated financial statements.

(2)   contractual obligations related to interest payments on long-term debt for 2017-2021 are calculated by applying the december 31, 2016 weighted-average interest rate (3.49%) on average outstanding long-term debt to the average remaining contractual obligations on long-term debt for each of those years. the "thereafter" interest payments on long-term debt for the remaining years to maturity (2022-2098) are calculated by applying current interest rates on the remaining contractual obligations on long-term debt for each of those years.
(3)   purchase obligations consist of obligations to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding on citi. for presentation purposes, purchase obligations are included in the table above through the termination date of the respective agreements, even if the contract is renewable. many of the purchase agreements for goods or services include clauses that would allow citi to cancel the agreement with specified notice; however, that impact is not included in the table above (unless citi has already notified the counterparty of its intention to terminate the agreement).
(4)   other liabilities reflected on citigroup's consolidated balance sheet includes accounts payable, accrued expenses, uncertain tax positions and other liabilities that have been incurred and will ultimately be paid in cash; legal reserve accruals are not included in the table above. also includes discretionary contributions in 2017 for citi's employee-defined benefit obligations for the pension, postretirement and post employment plans and defined contribution plans.

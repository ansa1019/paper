our management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is intended to assist readers in understanding our financial information from our management's perspective and is presented as follows:
•   results of operations
•   non-gaap financial measures
•   liquidity and capital resources
•   contractual obligations and off-balance-sheet arrangements
•   recent accounting pronouncements in december 2016, as more fully described in note 2 of notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k, we entered into a transaction agreement with verizon communications inc. ("verizon") to acquire verizon's colocation services business at 24 data center sites, consisting of 29 data center buildings, located in the united states, brazil and colombia, for a cash purchase price of $3.6 billion (the "verizon asset purchase"). the acquisition is expected to close by mid-2017. we expect to fund the acquisition with a combination of cash on hand and proceeds of debt and equity financings.
in connection with the verizon asset purchase, we entered into a commitment letter, dated december 6, 2016, with jpmorgan chase bank, n.a., bank of america, n.a. and merrill lynch, pierce, fenner & smith incorporated (the "commitment parties"), pursuant to which the commitment parties have committed to provide a senior unsecured bridge facility in aggregate principal amount of up to $2.0 billion for the purposes of funding (i) a portion of the cash consideration for the acquisition and (ii) the fees and expenses incurred in connection with the acquisition. the full amount must be drawn in a single drawing. the initial maturity date is 12 months from the date of the drawdown and, at the initial maturity date (if not repaid prior to that time), the facility will convert into a seven-year senior unsecured term loan. as of december 31, 2016, we had not drawn against the bridge facility.
in december 2016, as more fully described in note 10 of notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k, we entered into a third amendment (the "third amendment") to the credit agreement we entered into on december 17, 2014 with a group of lenders for a $1.5 billion credit facility (the "senior credit facility"). pursuant to the third amendment, (i) we could borrow up to €1.0 billion in additional term b loan drawings (the "term b-2 loan"), (ii) the interest rate margin applicable to the existing term loan b (the "term loan b-1 facility") in us dollars was reduced from 3.25% to 2.50% and the libor floor applicable to such loan was reduced from 0.75% to zero and (iii) the interest rate margin applicable to the loans borrowed under the term loan b-1 facility in pounds sterling was reduced from 3.75% to 3.00%, with no change to the existing libor floor of 0.75% applicable to such loan. in january 2017, we borrowed the full amount of the €1.0 billion term b-2 loan. the term b-2 loan bears interest at an index rate based on euribor plus a margin of 3.25%. no original issue discount is applicable to the term b-2 loan. the term b-2 loan must be repaid in equal quarterly installments of 0.25% of the original principal amount of the term b-2 loan, starting in the second quarter of 2017, with the remaining amount outstanding to be repaid in full on the seventh anniversary of the funding date of the term b-2 loan.
in june 2016, as more fully described in note 4 of notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k, we approved the divestiture of the solar power assets of bit-isle. during the quarter ended september 30, 2016, we evaluated the recoverability of the carrying value of the assets held for sale associated with terra power co., ltd., and recorded an impairment charge on other current assets of $7.7 million, reducing the carrying value of such assets from $79.5 million to the estimated fair value of $71.8 million. in october 2016, we entered into a share transfer agreement for the transfer of common stock of terra power co., ltd., relating to the divestiture of the solar power assets of bit-isle. we received ¥400.0 million, or
approximately $3.8 million at the exchange rate in effect on october 31, 2016, and by november 30, 2016, we had received an additional ¥2.5 billion, or approximately $22.1 million at the exchange rate in effect at the time of cash receipt. in addition, we expect to receive the remaining payment of ¥5.3 billion in the first quarter of 2017, or approximately $45.5 million at the exchange rate in effect on december 31, 2016. the associated loss on the sale was insignificant.
in september 2016, as more fully described in note 10 of notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k, we entered into a five year term loan agreement (the "japanese yen term loan") with the bank of tokyo-mitsubishi ufj, ltd. ("btmu") for ¥47.5 billion or approximately $468.4 million in u.s. dollars at the exchange rate in effect as of september 30, 2016. in september 2015, in connection with our acquisition of bit-isle, we entered into a term loan agreement (the "bridge term loan agreement") with btmu. btmu was committed to provide a senior bridge loan facility (the "bridge term loan") in the amount of up to ¥47.5 billion or approximately $468.4 million in u.s. dollars at the exchange rate in effect as of september 30, 2016. in october 2016, we borrowed the full amount of the ¥47.5 billion under the japanese yen term loan and repaid the bridge term loan for a principal amount of ¥47.5 billion or approximately $453.2 million at the exchange rate in effect on october 31, 2016.
in april and june 2016, as more fully described in note 10 of notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k, holders of our 4.75% convertible subordinated notes converted or redeemed a total of $150.1 million of the principal amount of the notes for 2.0 million shares of our common stock and $3.6 million in cash, comprised of accrued interest, cash paid in lieu of fractional shares and principal redemption. upon maturity of our 4.75% convertible subordinated notes on june 15, 2016, we settled the related capped call transaction and received 380,779 shares of common stock, which was placed in treasury and resulted in a credit of $141.7 million to additional paid in capital based on the market price of $372.10 on june 15, 2016.
in january 2016, as more fully described in note 2 of notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k, we completed our acquisition of telecity group plc ("telecitygroup") for a total purchase price of approximately $1.6 billion in cash and 6.9 million shares of our common stock valued at approximately $2.1 billion, for a total of $3.7 billion. in january 2016, we terminated our bridge credit agreement for £875.0 million, or approximately $1.3 billion, related to the telecitygroup acquisition.
in january 2016, as more fully described in notes 4 and 5 of notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k, we agreed to divest eight data centers and related assets, including our london 2 data center ("ld2") in london, united kingdom and seven data centers of telecitygroup in order to obtain the approval of the european commission for the acquisition of telecitygroup. the results of operations for the seven telecitygroup data centers were classified as net income from discontinued operations, net of tax, from january 15, 2016, the date of the acquisition, through july 5, 2016 in our consolidated statement of operations. in july 2016, we completed the sale of these data centers and related assets to digital realty trust, inc. ("digital realty") for approximately $827.3 million at the exchange rate in effect on july 5, 2016. on august 1, 2016, we purchased digital realty's operating business, including its real estate and facility, in st. denis, paris, where we already had an established presence with two ibx data centers, for total cash consideration of approximately €193.8 million or approximately $216.4 million at the exchange rate in effect on august 1, 2016 (the "paris ibx data center acquisition").
in january 2016, as more fully described in note 10 of notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k, we borrowed the full amount of the $250.0 million and £300.0 million, or approximately $438.2 million at the exchange rate in effect on january 8, 2016 ("term loan b"), made available to us under the second amendment to our senior credit facility to fund the telecitygroup acquisition.
overview equinix provides global data center offerings that protect and connect the world's most valued information assets. global enterprises, financial services companies and content and network service providers rely upon equinix's leading insight and data centers in 41 markets around the world for the safekeeping of their critical it equipment and the ability to directly connect to the networks that enable today's information-driven economy. equinix offers the following solutions: (i) premium data center colocation, (ii) interconnection and (iii) exchange and outsourced it infrastructure services. as of december 31, 2016, we operated or had partner ibx data centers in the atlanta, boston, chicago, dallas, denver, los angeles, miami, new york, philadelphia, rio de janeiro, sao paulo, seattle, silicon valley, toronto and washington, d.c. metro areas in the americas region; bulgaria, finland, france, germany, ireland, italy, the netherlands, poland, sweden, switzerland, turkey, the united arab emirates and the united kingdom in the europe, middle east and africa ("emea") region; and australia, china, hong kong, indonesia, japan and singapore in the asia-pacific region.
our data centers in 41 markets around the world are a global platform, which allows our customers to increase information and application delivery performance while significantly reducing costs. this global platform and the quality of our ibx data centers have enabled us to establish a critical mass of customers. as more customers choose our ibx data centers, it benefits their suppliers and business partners to colocate with us as well, in order to gain the full economic and performance benefits of our offerings. these partners, in turn, pull in their business partners, creating a "marketplace" for their services. our global platform enables scalable, reliable and cost-effective colocation, interconnection and traffic exchange that lowers overall cost and increases flexibility. our focused business model is built on our critical mass of customers and the resulting "marketplace" effect. this global platform, combined with our strong financial position, continues to drive new customer growth and bookings.
historically, our market has been served by large telecommunications carriers who have bundled telecommunications products and services with their colocation offerings. the data center market landscape has evolved to include cloud computing/utility providers, application hosting providers and systems integrators, managed infrastructure hosting providers and colocation providers. more than 350 companies provide data center solutions in the u.s. alone. each of these data center solutions providers can bundle various colocation, interconnection and network offerings, and outsourced it infrastructure services. we are able to offer our customers a global platform that reaches 21 countries with proven operational reliability, improved application performance and network choice, and a highly scalable set of offerings.
our utilization rate represents the percentage of our cabinet space billing versus net sellable cabinet space available, taking into account power limitations. our utilization rate was approximately 81% as of december 31, 2016 and december 31, 2015. however, excluding the impact of ibx data center expansion projects that have opened during the last 12 months, our utilization rate would be approximately 84% as of december 31, 2016. our utilization rate varies from market to market among our ibx data centers across the americas, emea and asia-pacific regions. we continue to monitor the available capacity in each of our selected markets. to the extent we have limited capacity available in a given market, it may limit our ability for growth in that market. we perform demand studies on an ongoing basis to determine if future expansion is warranted in a market. in addition, power and cooling requirements for most customers are growing on a per unit basis. as a result, customers are consuming an increasing amount of power per cabinet. although we generally do not control the amount of power our customers draw from installed circuits, we have negotiated power consumption limitations with certain high power-demand customers. this increased power consumption has driven us to build out our new ibx data centers to support power and cooling needs twice that of previous ibx data centers. we could face power limitations in our ibx data centers, even though we may have additional physical cabinet capacity available within a specific ibx data center. this could have a negative impact on the available utilization capacity of a given ibx data center, which could have a negative impact on our ability to grow revenues, affecting our financial performance, operating results and cash flows.
strategically, we will continue to look at attractive opportunities to grow our market share and selectively improve our footprint and offerings. as was the case with our recent expansions and acquisitions, our expansion criteria will be dependent on a number of factors, such as demand from new and existing customers, quality of the design, power capacity, access to networks, capacity availability in the current market location, amount of incremental investment required by us in the targeted property, lead-time to break even on a free cash flow basis, and in-place customers. like our recent expansions and acquisitions, the right combination of these factors may be attractive to us. depending on the circumstances, these transactions may require additional capital expenditures funded by upfront cash payments or through long-term financing arrangements in order to bring these properties up to equinix standards. property expansion may be in the form of purchases of real property, long-term leasing arrangements or acquisitions. future purchases, construction or acquisitions may be completed by us or with partners or potential customers to minimize the outlay of cash, which can be significant.
our business is based on a recurring revenue model comprised of colocation and related interconnection and managed infrastructure offerings. we consider these offerings recurring because our customers are generally billed on a fixed and recurring basis each month for the duration of their contract, which is generally one to three years in length. our recurring revenues have comprised more than 90% of our total revenues during the past three years. in addition, during any given quarter of the past three years, more than half of our monthly recurring revenue bookings came from existing customers, contributing to our revenue growth. our largest customer accounted for approximately 3% of our recurring revenues for the periods ended december 31, 2016 and 2015 and 2% of our recurring revenues for the period ended december 31, 2014. our 50 largest customers accounted for approximately 36%, 34% and 36%, respectively, of our recurring revenues for the years ended december 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014.
our non-recurring revenues are primarily comprised of installation services related to a customer's initial deployment and professional services that we perform. these services are considered to be non-recurring because they are billed typically once, upon completion of the installation or the professional services work performed. the majority of these non-recurring revenues are typically billed on the first invoice distributed to the customer in connection with their initial installation. however, revenues from installation services are deferred and recognized ratably over the expected life of the customer installation. additionally, revenue from contract settlements, when a customer wishes to terminate their contract early, is recognized when no remaining performance
obligations exist and collectability is reasonably assured, to the extent that the revenue has not previously been recognized. as a percentage of total revenues, we expect non-recurring revenues to represent less than 10% of total revenues for the foreseeable future.
our americas revenues are derived primarily from colocation and related interconnection offerings, and our emea and asia-pacific revenues are derived primarily from colocation and managed infrastructure offerings.
the largest components of our cost of revenues are depreciation, rental payments related to our leased ibx data centers, utility costs, including electricity and bandwidth, ibx data center employees' salaries and benefits, including stock-based compensation, repairs and maintenance, supplies and equipment and security services. a majority of our cost of revenues is fixed in nature and should not vary significantly from period to period, unless we expand our existing ibx data centers or open or acquire new ibx data centers. however, there are certain costs that are considered more variable in nature, including utilities and supplies that are directly related to growth in our existing and new customer base. we expect the cost of our utilities, specifically electricity, will generally increase in the future on a per-unit or fixed basis, in addition to the variable increase related to the growth in consumption by our customers. in addition, the cost of electricity is generally higher in the summer months, as compared to other times of the year. to the extent we incur increased utility costs, such increased costs could materially impact our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. furthermore, to the extent we incur increased electricity costs as a result of either climate change policies or the physical effects of climate change, such increased costs could materially impact our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of compensation and related costs for sales and marketing personnel, including stock-based compensation, sales commissions, marketing programs, public relations, promotional materials and travel, as well as bad debt expense and amortization of customer contract intangible assets.
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expenses, including stock-based compensation, accounting, legal and other professional service fees, and other general corporate expenses, such as our corporate regional headquarters office leases and some depreciation expense.
we expect our cost of revenues, sales and marketing expenses and general and administrative expenses to grow in absolute dollars in connection with our business growth. we may periodically see a higher cost of revenues as a percentage of revenue, when a large expansion project opens or is acquired, and before it starts generating any meaningful revenue. furthermore, in relation to cost of revenues, we note that the americas region has a lower cost of revenues as a percentage of revenue than either emea or asia-pacific. this is due to both the increased scale and maturity of the americas region, compared to either the emea or asia-pacific region, as well as a higher cost structure outside of the americas, particularly in emea. while we expect all three regions to continue to see lower cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues in future periods, we expect the trend that sees the americas having the lowest cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues to continue. as a result, to the extent that revenue growth outside the americas grows in greater proportion than revenue growth in the americas, our overall cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues may increase in future periods. sales and marketing expenses may periodically increase as a percentage of revenues as we continue to scale our operations by investing in sales and marketing initiatives to further increase our revenue, including the hiring of additional headcount and new product innovations. general and administrative expenses may also periodically increase as a percentage of revenues as we continue to scale our operations to support our growth.
taxation as a reit we elected to be taxed as a reit for federal income tax purposes beginning with our 2015 taxable year. as of december 31, 2016, our reit structure includes all of our data center operations in the u.s., canada, japan, our historical data center operations in europe and a significant portion of the data center operations acquired in the telecitygroup acquisition. our data center operations in other jurisdictions are operated as taxable reit subsidiaries ("trss"). we plan to complete the reit integration of the majority of the remaining telecitygroup business during the first half of 2017.
as a reit, we generally are permitted to deduct from our federal taxable income the dividends we pay to our stockholders (including, for this purpose, the value of any deemed distributions attributable to anti-dilution adjustments made with respect to our 4.75% convertible subordinated notes prior to their maturity in 2016). the income represented by such dividends payment is not subject to federal income tax at the entity level but is taxed, if at all, at the stockholder level. nevertheless, the income of our trss which hold our u.s. operations that may not be reit compliant is subject, as applicable, to federal and state corporate income tax. likewise, our foreign subsidiaries continue to be subject to foreign income taxes in jurisdictions in which they hold assets or conduct operations, regardless of whether held or conducted through trss or through qualified reit subsidiaries ("qrss"). we are also subject to a separate corporate income tax on gain recognized from a sale of a reit asset where our basis in the asset is determined by reference to the basis of the asset in the hands of a c corporation (such as (i) an asset that we held as of the effective date of our reit election, that is, january 1, 2015, or (ii) an asset that we or a qrs hold following the liquidation
or other conversion of a former trs). this built-in-gains tax is generally applicable to any disposition of such an asset during the five-year period after the date we first owned the asset as a reit asset (e.g., january 1, 2015 in the case of reit assets we held at the time of our reit conversion), to the extent of the built-in-gain based on the fair market value of such asset on the date we first held the asset as a reit asset. if we fail to remain qualified for federal income tax as a reit, we will be subject to federal income tax at regular corporate tax rates. even if we remain qualified for federal income tax as a reit, we may be subject to some federal, state, local and foreign taxes on our income and property in addition to taxes owed with respect to our trss' operations. in particular, while state income tax regimes often parallel the federal income tax regime for reits, many states do not completely follow federal rules and some may not follow them at all.
on march 23, june 15, september 14, and december 14 of 2016, we paid quarterly cash dividends of $1.75 per share. we expect these quarterly and other applicable distributions to equal or exceed the taxable income that we recognized in 2016.
we continue to monitor our reit compliance in order to maintain our qualification for federal income tax as a reit. for this and other reasons, as necessary we may convert certain of our data center operations in additional countries into the reit structure in future periods.
results of operations our results of operations for the year ended december 31, 2016 include the results of operations of telecitygroup from january 15, 2016, and the paris ibx data center acquisition from august 1, 2016. our results of operations for the year ended december 31, 2015 include the results of operations of the nimbo and bit-isle acquisitions from january 15, 2015 and november 2, 2015, respectively.
discontinued operations we present the results of operations associated with the telecitygroup data centers that were divested in july 2016 as discontinued operations in our consolidated statement of operations for the year ended december 31, 2016. we did not have any discontinued operations activity during 2015 or 2014.
years ended december 31,                          % change
americas revenues. during the years ended december 31, 2016 and 2015, our revenues from the united states, the largest revenue contributor in the americas region for the periods, represented approximately 92% and 93%, respectively, of the regional revenues. growth in americas revenues was primarily due to (i) $28.9 million of revenue generated from our recently-opened ibx data centers or ibx data center expansions in the atlanta, chicago, dallas, silicon valley and washington, d.c. metro areas and (ii) an increase in orders from both our existing customers and new customers during the period. during the year ended december 31, 2016, the u.s. dollar was generally stronger relative to the canadian dollar and brazilian real than during the year ended december 31, 2015, resulting in approximately $6.6 million of unfavorable foreign currency impact on our americas revenues during the year ended december 31, 2016 compared to average exchange rates during the year ended december 31, 2015.
emea revenues.  revenues for our emea region for the year ended december 31, 2016 include $404.1 million of revenues attributable to telecitygroup, which closed in january 2016, and the paris ibx data center acquisition, which closed in august 2016. after our acquisition of telecitygroup, the u.k. continues to be our largest revenue contributor in the emea region, providing 32% of regional revenues for the year ended december 31, 2016 compared to 37% of regional revenues for the year ended december 31, 2015. our emea revenue growth was primarily due to (i) $404.1 million of revenues attributable to telecitygroup and the paris ibx data center acquisition, (ii) approximately $49.7 million of revenue from our recently-opened ibx data centers or ibx data center expansions in the amsterdam, frankfurt, paris and zurich metro areas and (iii) an increase in orders from both our existing customers and new customers during the period. during the year ended december 31, 2016, the impact of foreign currency fluctuations resulted in approximately $33.5 million of net unfavorable foreign currency impact to our emea revenues primarily due to a generally stronger u.s. dollar relative to the british pound during the year ended december 31, 2016 compared to the year ended december 31, 2015.
asia-pacific revenues.  revenues for our asia-pacific region for the year ended december 31, 2016 include $148.7 million of revenues attributable to bit-isle, which closed in november 2015. after our acquisition of bit-isle, japan is our largest revenue contributor in the asia-pacific region, providing 35% of regional revenues including bit-isle for the year ended december 31, 2016 compared to 20% for the year ended december 31, 2015. excluding revenues attributable to bit-isle, our revenues from singapore, which was our largest revenue contributor in the asia-pacific region before we acquired bit-isle, represented approximately 38% and 39%, respectively, of the regional revenues for the years ended december 31, 2016 and december 31, 2015. our asia-pacific revenue growth was primarily due to (i) $148.7 million of revenues attributable to bit-isle, (ii) approximately $58.2 million of revenue generated from our recently-opened ibx data center expansions in the hong kong, melbourne, shanghai, singapore, sydney and tokyo metro areas and (iii) an increase in orders from both our existing customers and new customers during the period. during the year ended december 31, 2016, the u.s. dollar was generally weaker relative to the japanese yen than during the year ended december 31, 2015, resulting in approximately $7.5 million of net favorable foreign currency impact to our asia-pacific revenues during the year ended december 31, 2016 when compared to average exchange rates during the year ended december 31, 2015.
cost of revenues.  our cost of revenues for the years ended december 31, 2016 and 2015 were split among the following geographic regions (dollars in thousands):
years ended december 31,                          % change
cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues:
americas cost of revenues. our americas cost of revenues for the years ended december 31, 2016 and 2015 included $241.6 million and $219.1 million, respectively, of depreciation expense. the growth in depreciation expense was primarily due to our ibx expansion activity. in addition to the increase in depreciation expense, the increase in our americas cost of revenues for the year ended december 31, 2016 compared to the year ended december 31, 2015 was primarily due to (i) $22.9 million of higher utilities, rent and facilities costs, office expense, consulting, and repairs and maintenance in support of our business growth, (ii) $10.1 million of higher costs primarily due to custom service orders in support of our revenue growth and (iii) $4.5 million of higher compensation costs, including general salaries, bonuses and stock-based compensation. during the year ended december 31, 2016, the impact of foreign currency fluctuations resulted in approximately $4.9 million of net favorable foreign currency impact to our americas cost of revenues primarily due to a generally stronger u.s. dollar relative to the brazilian real and canadian dollar during the year ended december 31, 2016 compared to the year ended december 31, 2015. we expect americas cost of revenues to increase as we continue to grow our business.
emea cost of revenues. cost of revenues for our emea region for the year ended december 31, 2016 included $273.5 million of cost of revenues attributable to telecitygroup, which closed in january 2016, and the paris ibx data center acquisition, which closed in august 2016. excluding cost of revenues attributable to telecitygroup and the paris ibx data center acquisition, emea cost of revenues was $380.3 million for the year ended december 31, 2016 compared to $350.3 million for the year ended december 31, 2015. depreciation expense, excluding telecitygroup and the paris ibx data center acquisition, was $100.8 million and $97.8 million for the years ended december 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. the growth in depreciation expense was primarily due to our ibx data center expansion activity. excluding the impact of telecitygroup and the paris ibx data center acquisition, the remaining increase in our emea cost of revenues was primarily due to (i) $16.4 million of higher utilities, consulting, and repairs and maintenance costs in support of our business growth, (ii) $4.7 million of higher compensation costs, including general salaries, bonuses and stock-based compensation and headcount growth (623 emea cost of revenues employees, excluding telecitygroup employees, as of december 31, 2016 versus 541 as of december 31, 2015), (iii) $8.3 million of other costs primarily related to the impact from cash flow hedges, offset by $4.0 million of lower rent and facilities costs. during the year ended december 31, 2016, the impact of foreign currency fluctuations resulted in approximately $13.6 million of net favorable foreign currency impact to our emea cost of revenues, primarily due to a generally stronger u.s. dollar relative to the british pound during the year ended december 31, 2016 compared to the year ended december 31, 2015. we expect emea cost of revenues to increase as we continue to grow our business and as a result of our acquisitions of telecitygroup and the paris ibx data centers.
asia-pacific cost of revenues. cost of revenues for our asia-pacific region included $116.0 million and $17.4 million of cost of revenues attributable to bit-isle, which closed in november 2015, for the years ended december 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. excluding cost of revenues attributable to bit-isle, asia-pacific cost of revenues was $350.6 million for asia-pacific for the year ended december 31, 2016 compared to $286.2 million for the year ended december 31, 2015. depreciation expense, excluding bit-isle, was $149.5 million and $116.9 million for the years ended december 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. the growth in depreciation expense was primarily due to our ibx data center expansion activity. excluding the impact of our acquisition of bit-isle, the remaining increase in our asia-pacific cost of revenues was primarily due to (i) $26.0 million of higher utilities, rent, facility costs, consulting, custom service orders, repairs and maintenance costs in support of our business growth and (ii) $4.5 million of higher compensation costs, including general salaries, bonuses and stock-based compensation and headcount growth (431 asia-pacific cost of revenues employees as of december 31, 2016 versus 390 as of december 31, 2015, excluding bit-isle employees in both periods). during the year ended december 31, 2016, the u.s. dollar was generally weaker relative to the japanese yen than during the year ended december 31, 2015, resulting in approximately $5.6 million of net unfavorable foreign currency impact to our asia-pacific cost of revenues during the year ended december 31, 2016 when compared to average exchange rates during the year ended december 31, 2015. we expect asia-pacific cost of revenues to increase as we continue to grow our business, including from the impact of our acquisition of bit-isle.
sales and marketing expenses. our sales and marketing expenses for the years ended december 31, 2016 and 2015 were split among the following geographic regions (dollars in thousands):

americas income from operations. the increase in our americas income from continuing operations was due to higher revenues as result of our ibx data center expansion activity and organic growth as described above as well as the gain recognized on the sale of the san jose land parcel, partially offset by higher cost of revenues and operating expenses primarily attributable to higher compensation and other headcount related expenses to support our growth. the impact of foreign currency fluctuations on our americas income from continuing operations for the year ended december 31, 2016 was not significant when compared to average exchange rates of the year ended december 31, 2015.
emea income from operations. the decrease in our emea income from continuing operations was primarily due to acquisition and integration costs incurred in connection with our acquisition of telecitygroup, which closed in january 2016, as well as the increased depreciation and amortization created from the purchase accounting for telecitygroup and the paris ibx data center acquisition, partially offset by the gain recognized on the sale of the ld2 data center. during the year ended december 31, 2016, the impact of foreign currency fluctuations resulted in approximately $5.2 million of net unfavorable foreign currency impact to our emea income from continuing operations primarily due to a generally stronger u.s. dollar relative to the british pound during the year ended december 31, 2016 compared to the year ended december 31, 2015.

2015. we expect our interest income to remain at these low levels for the foreseeable future due to lower invested balances and a portfolio more weighted towards money market funds.
interest expense.  interest expense increased to $392.2 million for the year ended december 31, 2016 from $299.1 million for the year ended december 31, 2015. this increase in interest expense was primarily due to the impact of our $1.1 billion of senior notes issued in december 2015, $614.7 million outstanding in seven-year term loans we borrowed in january 2016 and $406.6 million outstanding in five-year term loans we borrowed in october 2016, replacing a bridge term loan facility we borrowed to finance our acquisition of bit-isle, which closed in november 2015, as well as additional financings such as various capital lease and other financing obligations to support our expansion projects. the increase in interest expense is partially offset by the settlement of the 4.75% convertible debt in june 2016. during the years ended december 31, 2016 and 2015, we capitalized $13.3 million and $10.9 million, respectively, of interest expense to construction in progress. going forward, we expect to incur higher interest expense as we borrowed the €1.0 billion term b-2 loan in january 2017. we also expect to incur additional indebtedness to support our growth and acquisition opportunities including the verizon asset purchase, resulting in higher interest expense going forward.

we recorded excess income tax benefits of $2,773,000 and $30,000 during the year ended december 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, in our consolidated balance sheets.

emea general and administrative expenses. the increase in our emea general and administrative expenses was primarily due to (i) approximately $4.2 million of higher compensation costs, including general salaries, bonuses and stock-based compensation as a result of headcount growth (420 emea general and administrative employees as of december 31, 2015 versus 353 as of december 31, 2014), (ii) $4.3 million of higher depreciation expenses due to implementation of the oracle r12 erp system and certain systems to support the reit conversion and (iii) $2.8 million of higher consulting costs primarily due to integration efforts in connection with our acquisition of telecitygroup as well as an increase in net losses related to cash flow hedging derivatives. during the year ended december 31, 2015, the impact of foreign currency fluctuations resulted in approximately $7.8 million of net favorable foreign currency impact on our emea general and administrative expenses primarily due to the generally stronger u.s. dollar relative to the british pound and euro during the year ended december 31, 2015 compared to the year ended december 31, 2014.
asia-pacific general and administrative expenses. asia-pacific general and administrative expenses for the year ended december 31, 2015 included $5.8 million of general and administrative expenses attributable to our acquisition of bit-isle, which closed on november 2, 2015. excluding general and administrative expenses attributable to bit-isle, asia-pacific general and administrative expenses for the year ended december 31, 2015 were $47.3 million compared to $42.5 million for the year ended december 31, 2014. excluding general and administrative expenses attributable to bit-isle, the increase in our asia-pacific general and administrative expenses was primarily due to a $2.2 million increase in consulting costs, legal fees and other costs for tax-related matters as well as higher compensation costs, including general salaries, bonuses and stock-based compensation as a result of headcount growth (266 asia-pacific general and administrative employees, excluding bit-isle employees, as of december 31, 2015 versus 224 as of december 31, 2014). during the year ended december 31, 2015, the impact of foreign currency fluctuations resulted in approximately $3.4 million of net favorable impact on our asia-pacific general and administrative expenses primarily due to a generally stronger u.s. dollar relative to the australian dollar, japanese yen and singapore dollar compared to the year ended december 31, 2014.
years ended december 31,                          % change
americas income from operations. the increase in our americas income from operations was due to higher revenues as result of our ibx data center expansion activity and organic growth as described above, partially offset by higher operating expenses as a percentage of revenues primarily attributable to higher compensation and other headcount related expenses to support our growth.
emea income from operations. the increase in our emea income from operations was primarily due to higher revenues as a result of our ibx data center expansion activity and organic growth as described above. during the year ended december 31, 2015, currency fluctuations resulted in approximately $25.6 million of net unfavorable foreign currency impact on our emea income from operations primarily due to the generally stronger u.s. dollar relative to the british pounds and euro during the year ended december 31, 2015 compared to the year ended december 31, 2014.
asia-pacific income from operations. the increase in our asia-pacific income from operations was primarily due to higher revenues as a result of our ibx data center expansion activity and organic growth as described above, partially offset by higher operating expenses as a percentage of revenues primarily attributable to higher compensation and other headcount related expenses and higher professional fees to support our growth. during the year ended december 31, 2015, currency fluctuations resulted in approximately $17.5 million of net unfavorable foreign currency impact on our asia-pacific income from operations primarily due to the generally stronger u.s. dollar relative to the australian dollar, japanese yen and singapore dollar during the year ended december 31, 2015 compared to the year ended december 31, 2014.
interest expense.  interest expense increased to $299.1 million for the year ended december 31, 2015 from $270.6 million for the year ended december 31, 2014. this increase in interest expense was primarily due to the full impact recognized for the year ended december 31, 2015 of our $1.25 billion senior notes offering in november 2014, the $0.5 billion term loan a we borrowed in december 2014 under our senior credit facility and $18 million of higher interest expense from various capital lease and other financing obligations to support our expansion projects, which was partially offset by the redemption of our 7.00% senior notes in december 2014, the settlement of the 3.00% convertible notes and the partial redemption of the 4.75% convertible notes in june 2014. during the years ended december 31, 2015 and 2014, we capitalized $10.9 million and $19.0 million, respectively, of interest expense to construction in progress.
other income (expense). we recorded net expense of $60.6 million and net income of $0.1 million for the years december 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, primarily due to foreign currency exchange gains and losses during the periods. the expense recorded in 2015 is primarily attributed to foreign currency losses to fund the telecitygroup acquisition purchase price.
loss on debt extinguishment. during the year ended december 31, 2015, we recorded a $0.3 million loss on debt extinguishment which was attributable to partial conversions of our 4.75% convertible subordinated notes in december 2015. during the year ended december 31, 2014, we recorded a $157.0 million loss on debt extinguishment, of which $51.2 million was attributable to the exchanges of the 3.00% convertible subordinated notes and 4.75% convertible subordinated notes, $103.3 million was attributable to the redemption of our $750.0 million 7.00% senior notes and $2.5 million was attributable to the prepayment and termination of our $750.0 million multicurrency credit facility. for additional information, see "loss on debt extinguishment" in note 10 of notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k.
income taxes. during the year ended december 31, 2015 and 2014, we recorded $23.2 million and $345.5 million of income tax expenses, respectively. we recognized a significantly lower income tax provision in 2015 as compared to the income tax provision in 2014 primarily due to the de-recognition, in 2014, of the deferred tax assets and liabilities of our u.s. operations upon conversion to a reit.
the $345.5 million of income tax expense recorded during the year ended december 31, 2014 was primarily attributable to the statutory tax rate change due to our reit conversion, which resulted in a $324.1 million domestic deferred tax assets write-off. in connection with the formal approval of our conversion to a reit by our board of directors in december 2014, we reassessed, in the fourth quarter of 2014, the deferred tax assets and liabilities of our u.s. operations to be included in the reit structure. the reevaluation resulted in de-recognizing the deferred tax assets and liabilities of our reit's u.s. operations, excluding the deferred tax liabilities associated with the depreciation and amortization recapture expected in 2015. the de-recognition of the deferred tax assets and liabilities of our reit's u.s. operations occurred because the expected recovery or settlement of the related assets and liabilities will not result in deductible or taxable amounts in any post-reit conversion periods. the deferred tax assets and liabilities associated with our foreign operations, regardless of whether such foreign operations were part of the reit conversion, are not subject to the de-recognition assessment. we generally do not expect our occasional sale of assets to result in a material tax liability.
our effective tax rates were 11.0% and 407.7%, respectively, for the years ended december 31, 2015 and 2014. our effective tax rate for the year ended december 31, 2014 was primarily due to tax expense attributable to the $324.1 million domestic deferred tax assets write-off as a result of our reit conversion. excluding this tax expense, our effective tax rate would have been 25.2% for the year ended december 31, 2014. due to our reit conversion, we are entitled to a deduction for dividends paid, which results in a substantial reduction of u.s income tax expense. as a reit, substantially all of our income tax expense is the foreign income tax incurred by our foreign subsidiaries and the u.s. income tax expense incurred by our u.s. trss.
we recorded excess income tax benefits of $30,000 and $18.6 million during the years ended december 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, in our consolidated balance sheets.
adjusted ebitda. adjusted ebitda is a key factor in how we assess the operating performance of our segments and develop regional growth strategies such as ibx data center expansion decisions. we define adjusted ebitda as income or loss from operations plus depreciation, amortization, accretion, stock-based compensation expense, restructuring charges, impairment charges, acquisition costs and gain on asset sales. see "non-gaap financial measures" below for more information about adjusted ebitda and a reconciliation of adjusted ebitda to income or loss from operations. our adjusted ebitda for the years ended december 31, 2015 and 2014 was split among the following geographic regions (dollars in thousands):
years ended december 31,                          % change
americas adjusted ebitda. the increase in our americas adjusted ebitda was due to higher revenues as result of our ibx data center expansion activity and organic growth as described above, partially offset by higher adjusted operating expenses as a percentage of revenues primarily attributable to higher compensation and other headcount related expenses to support our growth. during the year ended december 31, 2015, currency fluctuations resulted in approximately $12.2 million of net unfavorable foreign currency impact on our americas adjusted ebitda primarily due to the generally stronger u.s. dollar relative to the brazilian real and canadian dollar during the year ended december 31, 2015 compared to the year ended december 31, 2014.
emea adjusted ebitda. the increase in our emea adjusted ebitda was primarily due to higher revenues as a result of our ibx data center expansion activity and organic growth as described above. during the year ended december 31, 2015, currency fluctuations resulted in approximately $45.4 million of net unfavorable foreign currency impact on our emea adjusted ebitda primarily due to the generally stronger u.s. dollar relative to the british pounds and euro during the year ended december 31, 2015 compared to the year ended december 31, 2014.
asia-pacific adjusted ebitda. the increase in our asia-pacific adjusted ebitda was primarily due to higher revenues as a result of our ibx data center expansion activity and organic growth as described above, partially offset by higher adjusted operating expenses as percentages of revenues primarily attributable to higher compensation and other headcount related expenses and higher professional fees to support our growth. during the year ended december 31, 2015, currency fluctuations resulted in approximately $26.1 million of net unfavorable foreign currency impact on our asia-pacific adjusted ebitda primarily due to the generally stronger u.s. dollar relative to the australian dollar, japanese yen and singapore dollar during the year ended december 31, 2015 compared to the year ended december 31, 2014.
non-gaap financial measures we provide all information required in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles ("gaap"), but we believe that evaluating our ongoing operating results may be difficult if limited to reviewing only gaap financial measures. accordingly, we use non-gaap financial measures to evaluate our operations.
non-gaap financial measures are not a substitute for financial information prepared in accordance with gaap. non-gaap financial measures should not be considered in isolation, but should be considered together with the most directly comparable gaap financial measures and the reconciliation of the non-gaap financial measures to the most directly comparable gaap financial measures. we have presented such non-gaap financial measures to provide investors with an additional tool to evaluate our operating results in a manner that focuses on what management believes to be our core, ongoing business operations. we believe that the inclusion of these non-gaap financial measures provides consistency and comparability with past reports and provides a better understanding of the overall performance of the business and ability to perform in subsequent periods. we believe that if we did not provide such non-gaap financial information, investors would not have all the necessary data to analyze equinix effectively.
investors should note that the non-gaap financial measures used by us may not be the same non-gaap financial measures, and may not be calculated in the same manner, as those of other companies. investors should therefore exercise caution when comparing non-gaap financial measures used by us to similarly titled non-gaap financial measures of other companies.
our primary non-gaap financial measures, adjusted ebitda and adjusted funds from operations ("affo"), exclude depreciation expense as these charges primarily relate to the initial construction costs of our ibx data centers and do not reflect
our current or future cash spending levels to support our business. our ibx data centers are long-lived assets and have an economic life greater than 10 years. the construction costs of an ibx data center do not recur with respect to such data center, although we may incur initial construction costs in future periods with respect to additional ibx data centers, and future capital expenditures remain minor relative to our initial investment. this is a trend we expect to continue. in addition, depreciation is also based on the estimated useful lives of our ibx data centers. these estimates could vary from actual performance of the asset, are based on historical costs incurred to build out our ibx data centers and are not indicative of current or expected future capital expenditures. therefore, we exclude depreciation from our operating results when evaluating our operations.
in addition, in presenting adjusted ebitda and affo, we exclude amortization expense related to acquired intangible assets. amortization expense is significantly affected by the timing and magnitude of our acquisitions and these charges may vary in amount from period to period. we exclude amortization expense to facilitate a more meaningful evaluation of our current operating performance and comparisons to our prior periods. we exclude accretion expense, both as it relates to asset retirement obligations as well as accrued restructuring charge liabilities, as these expenses represent costs which we believe are not meaningful in evaluating our current operations. we exclude stock-based compensation expense, as it can vary significantly from period to period based on share price, the timing, size and nature of equity awards. as such, we, and many investors and analysts, exclude this stock-based compensation expense to compare our operating results with those of other companies. we also exclude restructuring charges. the restructuring charges relate to our decisions to exit leases for excess space adjacent to several of our ibx data centers, which we did not intend to build out, or our decision to reverse such restructuring charges. we also exclude impairment charges related to certain long-lived assets. the impairment charges are related to expense recognized whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of long-lived assets are not recoverable. we also exclude gains on asset sales as it represents profit that is not meaningful in evaluating the current or future operating performance. finally, we exclude acquisition costs from affo and adjusted ebitda to allow more comparable comparisons of our financial results to our historical operations. the acquisition costs relate to costs we incur in connection with business combinations. such charges generally are not relevant to assessing the long-term performance of the company. in addition, the frequency and amount of such charges vary significantly based on the size and timing of the acquisitions. management believes items such as restructuring charges, impairment charges, gains on asset sales and acquisition costs are non-core transactions; however, these types of costs may occur in future periods.
adjusted ebitda we define adjusted ebitda as income or loss from operations plus depreciation, amortization, accretion, stock-based compensation expense, restructuring charges, impairment charges, acquisition costs, and gain on asset sales as presented below (in thousands):
impairment charges                                          7,698                         -                         -
our adjusted ebitda results have improved each year and in each region in total dollars due to the improved operating results discussed earlier in "results of operations", as well as the nature of our business model consisting of a recurring revenue stream and a cost structure which has a large base that is fixed in nature also discussed earlier in "overview".
funds from operations ("ffo") and affo we use ffo and affo, which are non-gaap financial measures commonly used in the reit industry. ffo is calculated in accordance with the standards established by the national association of real estate investment trusts ("nareit"). ffo represents net income (loss), excluding gain (loss) from the disposition of real estate assets, depreciation and amortization on real estate assets and adjustments for unconsolidated joint ventures' and non-controlling interests' share of these items.
we use affo to evaluate our performance on a consolidated basis and as a metric in the determination of employees' annual bonuses beginning in 2015 and vesting of restricted stock units that were granted beginning in 2015 and that have both service and performance conditions. in presenting affo, we exclude certain items that we believe are not good indicators of our current or future operating performance. affo represents ffo excluding depreciation and amortization expense on non-real estate assets,
accretion, stock-based compensation, restructuring charges, impairment charges, acquisition costs, an installation revenue adjustment, a straight-line rent expense adjustment, amortization of deferred financing costs, gain (loss) on debt extinguishment, an income tax expense adjustment, recurring capital expenditures and adjustments for unconsolidated joint ventures' and noncontrolling interests' share of these items, gain on asset sales and net income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of tax. the adjustments for both installation revenue and straight-line rent expense are intended to isolate the cash activity included within the straight-lined or amortized results in the consolidated statement of operations. we exclude the amortization of deferred financing costs as these expenses relate to the initial costs incurred in connection with debt financings that have no current or future cash obligations. we exclude gain (loss) on debt extinguishment since it generally represents the write-off of initial costs incurred in connection with debt financings or a cost that is incurred to reduce future interest costs and is not a good indicator of our current or future operating performance. we include an income tax expense adjustment, which represents the non-cash tax impact due to changes in valuation allowances, uncertain tax positions and deferred taxes that do not relate to current period's operations. we deduct recurring capital expenditures, which represent expenditures to extend the useful life of its ibx centers or other assets that are required to support current revenues. we also exclude net income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of tax, which represents results that may not recur and are not a good indicator of our current future operating performance.

our affo results have improved due to the improved operating results discussed earlier in "results of operations," as well as due to the nature of our business model which consists of a recurring revenue stream and a cost structure which has a large base that is fixed in nature as discussed earlier in "overview."
constant currency presentation our revenues and certain operating expenses (cost of revenues, sales and marketing and general and administrative expenses) from our international operations have represented and will continue to represent a significant portion of our total revenues and certain operating expenses. as a result, our revenues and certain operating expenses have been and will continue to be affected by changes in the u.s. dollar against major international currencies such as the euro, british pound, japanese yen, singapore dollar, australian dollar and brazilian real. in order to provide a framework for assessing how each of our business segments performed excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations, we present period-over-period percentage changes in our revenues and certain operating expenses on a constant currency basis in addition to the historical amounts as reported. presenting constant currency results of operations is a non-gaap financial measure and is not meant to be considered in isolation or as an alternative to gaap results of operations. however, we have presented this non-gaap financial measure to provide investors with an additional tool to evaluate our operating results. to present this information, our current and comparative prior period revenues
and certain operating expenses from entities reporting in currencies other than the u.s. dollar are converted into u.s. dollars at constant exchange rates rather than the actual exchange rates in effect during the respective periods (i.e. average rates in effect for the year ended december 31, 2015 are used as exchange rates for the year ended december 31, 2016 when comparing the year ended december 31, 2016 with the year ended december 31, 2015, and average rates in effect for the year ended december 31, 2014 are used as exchange rates for the year ended december 31, 2015 when comparing the year ended december 31, 2015 with the year ended december 31, 2014).
liquidity and capital resources as of december 31, 2016, our total indebtedness was comprised of debt and financing obligations totaling approximately $6,821.6 million consisting of (a) approximately $3,850.0 million of principal from our senior notes, (b) approximately $1,511.8 million from our capital lease and other financing obligations, and (c) $1,459.8 million of principal from our mortgage and other loans payable (gross of discount and premium).
we believe we have sufficient cash, coupled with anticipated cash generated from operating activities, to meet our operating requirements, including repayment of the current portion of our debt as it becomes due, payment of regular dividend distributions and completion of our publicly-announced expansion projects. as of december 31, 2016, we had $761.9 million of cash, cash equivalents and short-term and long-term investments, of which approximately $380.8 million was held in the u.s. we believe that our current expansion activities can be funded with our cash and cash equivalents and investments. on december 6, 2016, we entered into a transaction agreement with verizon to acquire verizon's colocation services business at 24 data center sites located in the united states, brazil and colombia for a cash purchase price of $3,600.0 million. we expect to fund the acquisition with a combination of cash on hand, proceeds from the €1,000.0 million term b-2 loan which we borrowed in full on january 6, 2017 (see note 10 of notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k), and proceeds from future debt and equity financings. in connection with the verizon asset purchase, we entered into a commitment letter to provide a senior unsecured bridge facility in the aggregate principal amount of $2,000.0 million for the purpose of funding a portion of the cash consideration for the acquisition. see note 2 of notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k.
as of december 31, 2016, we had 30 irrevocable letters of credit totaling $50.5 million issued and outstanding under the revolving credit facility; as a result of these letters of credit, we had a total of approximately $1,449.5 million of additional liquidity available to us under the revolving credit facility. besides any further financing activities we may pursue, customer collections are our primary source of cash. while we believe we have a strong customer base, and have continued to experience relatively strong collections, if the current market conditions were to deteriorate, some of our customers may have difficulty paying us and we may experience increased churn in our customer base, including reductions in their commitments to us, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity. additionally, we may pursue additional expansion opportunities, primarily the build out of new ibx data centers, in certain of our existing markets which are at or near capacity within the next year, as well as potential acquisitions. while we expect to fund these plans with our existing resources, additional financing, either debt or equity, may be required, and if current market conditions were to deteriorate, we may be unable to secure additional financing or any such additional financing may only be available to us on unfavorable terms. an inability to pursue additional expansion opportunities will have a material adverse effect on our ability to maintain our desired level of revenue growth in future periods.
we completed our conversion to a reit in 2014 and began operating as a reit effective january 1, 2015. as a result of our conversion to a reit, we made special distributions to our stockholders in 2015 and 2014. the distributions were payable in common stock or cash at the election of our stockholders, with the cash portion of the distributions subject to certain maximum amounts. as a result of the special distributions, we paid a total of $125.5 million in 2015 and $83.3 million in 2014 and distributed 1.7 million and 1.5 million shares of common stock in 2015 and 2014, respectively. also as a result of our conversion to a reit, we began paying quarterly dividends in 2015. we paid an aggregate of $499.5 million of quarterly cash dividends during 2016 and $521.5 million of quarterly cash dividends and special distribution during 2015.
sources and uses of cash years ended december 31,
net cash provided by operating activities                $1,016,580                  $894,793                $689,420
operating activities the increase in net cash provided by operating activities during 2016 compared to 2015 was primarily due to improved operating results combined with incremental operating cash provided by the acquisition of telecitygroup in january 2016 and inclusion of full year operating results of bit-isle. the increase in net cash provided by operating activities during 2015 compared to 2014 was primarily due to improved operating results.
investing activities the increase in net cash used in investing activities during 2016 compared to 2015 was primarily due to the increase in spending for the acquisitions of telecitygroup and the paris ibx data center of $1,521.4 million, net of cash acquired, over prior year acquisition spending, a decrease in sales and maturities of investments, net of purchases, of $503.3 million and $245.2 million of higher capital expenditures, primarily a result of expansion activity. these uses were partially offset by proceeds from sales of assets of $851.6 million, net of cash transferred, and changes in restricted cash totaling $950.9 million related primarily to the telecitygroup acquisition. the increase in net cash used in investing activities during 2015 compared to 2014 was primarily due to a $513.9 million increase in restricted cash, primarily in connection with our cash and share offer for telecitygroup, $245.6 million, net of cash for our acquisition of bit-isle and nimbo, $207.9 million of higher capital expenditures primarily as a result of expansion activity and $21.5 million of higher purchases of real estate, partially offset by $187.0 million of lower purchase of investments and $87.6 million of higher sales and maturities of investment.
during 2017, we expect to complete the acquisition of verizon's data center sites located in the united states, brazil and colombia. we also anticipate our ibx expansion construction activity will be approximately the same as our 2016 levels. if the opportunity to expand is greater than planned and we have sufficient funding to pursue such expansion opportunities, we may further increase the level of capital expenditures to support this growth as well as pursue additional business acquisitions, property acquisitions or joint ventures.
financing activities net cash used in financing activities during 2016 was primarily due to (i) $1,462.9 million repayment of loans payable including repayment of loans assumed in the telecitygroup acquisition, bridge term loan and revolving credit facility, (ii) $114.4 million repayment of capital lease and other financing obligations and (iii) $499.5 million payment of dividends, partially offset by (iv) $1,168.3 million of proceeds from loans payable including proceeds from our term loan b and japanese yen term loan. net cash provided by financing activities during 2015 was primarily due to (i) $1,100.0 million of gross proceeds from the senior notes offering in december 2015, (ii) $829.5 million of net proceeds from our public offering of common stock in november 2015, (iii) $1,197.1 million of proceeds from loans payable including proceeds from our term loan modification, our bridge term loan and our revolving credit facility, partially offset by (iv) $715.3 million repayment of mortgage and loans payable including repayment of $171.2 million of loans assumed in the bit-isle acquisition and repayment of $544.1 million of u.s. dollar-denominated term loan and other mortgage and loan payments, (v) $396.0 million of quarterly dividend distributions and (vi) $125.5 million of special distributions. the net cash provided by financing activities for 2014 was primarily due to $1,250.00 million of proceeds from the senior notes offering in november 2014, $500.0 million of proceeds from the term loan facility, partially offset by (i) $1,100.0 million for repayment of debt including $750.0 million for the redemption of the 7.00% senior notes, prepayment of the remaining principal balance of the u.s. term loan of $110.0 million, $43.5 million for repayments of mortgage and other loan payable, and $29.5 million for the exchanges of the 3.00% convertible subordinated notes and 4.75% convertible subordinated notes, (ii) $298.0 million for the purchases of treasury stock, (iii) $226.3 million for the purchase of riverwood's interest in alog and the approximate 10% of alog owned by alog management and (iv) $83.3 million for the cash portion of the special distribution. going forward, we expect that our financing activities will consist primarily of repayment of our debt and additional financings needed to support expansion opportunities, additional acquisitions or joint ventures and the payment of our regular cash dividends.
debt obligations debt facilities we have various debt obligations with maturity dates ranging from 2017 to 2026 under which a total principal balance of $5,309.8 million remained outstanding (gross of debt issuance cost and discounts) as of december 31, 2016. for further information on debt obligations, see "debt facilities" in note 10 of notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k.
capital lease and other financing obligations we have numerous capital lease and other financing obligations with maturity dates ranging from 2017 to 2053 under which a total principal balance of $1,511.8 million remained outstanding as of december 31, 2016 with a weighted average effective interest rate of 7.96%. for further information on our capital leases and other financing obligations, see "capital leases and other financing obligations" in note 9 of notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k.
contractual obligations and off-balance-sheet arrangements we lease a majority of our ibx data centers and certain equipment under non-cancelable lease agreements expiring through 2065. the following represents our debt maturities, financings, leases and other contractual commitments as of december 31, 2016 (in thousands):
capital lease and other financing obligations (3)         161,602               158,887               154,764                 153,763               155,103           1,520,510             2,304,629
operating leases (4)                                      142,854               138,555               134,123                 122,781               114,890             958,068             1,611,271
(2)   represents interest on mortgage payable, senior notes, term loan facilities and other loans payable based on their approximate interest rates as of december 31, 2016.
(4)   represents minimum operating lease payments, excluding potential lease renewals.
(6)   represents liability, net of future accretion expense.
in connection with certain of our leases and other contracts requiring deposits, we entered into 30 irrevocable letters of credit totaling  $50.5 million under the revolving credit facility. these letters of credit were provided in lieu of cash deposits. if the landlords for these ibx leases decide to draw down on these letters of credit triggered by an event of default under the lease, we will be required to fund these letters of credit either through cash collateral or borrowing under the revolving credit facility. these contingent commitments are not reflected in the table above.
we had accrued liabilities related to uncertain tax positions totaling approximately $53.3 million as of december 31, 2016. these liabilities, which are reflected on our balance sheet, are not reflected in the table above since it is unclear when these liabilities will be paid.
primarily as a result of our various ibx data center expansion projects, as of december 31, 2016, we were contractually committed for $234.4 million of unaccrued capital expenditures, primarily for ibx equipment not yet delivered and labor not yet provided in connection with the work necessary to complete construction and open these ibx data centers prior to making them available to customers for installation. this amount, which is expected to be paid during 2017 and thereafter, is reflected in the table above as "other contractual commitments."
we had other non-capital purchase commitments in place as of december 31, 2016, such as commitments to purchase power in select locations and other open purchase orders, which contractually bind us for goods or services to be delivered or provided during 2017 and beyond. such other purchase commitments as of december 31, 2016, which total $304.9 million, are also reflected in the table above as "other contractual commitments."
in addition, although we are not contractually obligated to do so, we expect to incur additional capital expenditures of approximately $634.7 million to $734.7 million, in addition to the $539.3 million in contractual commitments discussed above as of december 31, 2016, for our various ibx data center expansion projects during 2017 and thereafter in order to complete the work needed to open these ibx data centers. these non-contractual capital expenditures are not reflected in the table above. if we so choose, whether due to economic factors or other considerations, we could delay these non-contractual capital expenditure commitments to preserve liquidity.
on january 6, 2017, we borrowed the full amount of the €1.0 billion term b-2 loan, which is not reflected in the table above.
other off-balance-sheet arrangements we have various guarantor arrangements with both our directors and officers and third parties, including customers, vendors and business partners. as of december 31, 2016, there were no significant liabilities recorded for these arrangements. for additional information, see "guarantor arrangements" in note 15 of notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k.
critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the u.s. ("gaap"). the preparation of our financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. on an ongoing basis, management evaluates the accounting policies, assumptions, estimates and judgments to ensure that our consolidated financial statements are presented fairly and in accordance with gaap. management bases its assumptions, estimates and judgments on historical experience, current trends and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. however, because future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty, actual results may differ from these assumptions and estimates, and such differences could be material.
our significant accounting policies are discussed in note 1 to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k. management believes that the following critical accounting policies and estimates are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our consolidated financial statements, and they require significant judgments, resulting from the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain:
•   accounting for business combinations;
•   accounting for impairment of goodwill; and

deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized based on the future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences that exist between the financial statement carrying value of assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases, and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards on a taxing jurisdiction basis. we measure deferred tax assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates that will apply in the years in which we expect the temporary differences to be recovered or settled. the accounting standard for income taxes requires a reduction of the carrying amounts of deferred tax assets by recording a valuation allowance if, based on the available evidence, it is more likely than not (defined by the accounting standard as a likelihood of more than 50%) that such assets will not be realized.   in assessing the need for a valuation allowance, we consider both positive and negative evidence related to the likelihood of realization of the deferred tax assets. if, based on the weight of that available evidence, it is more likely than not the deferred tax assets will not be realized, we record a valuation allowance. the weight given to the positive and negative evidence is commensurate with the extent to which the evidence may be objectively verified.   for the year ended december 31, 2016, our decision to release our valuation allowances in japan was due to the tax free merger of bit-isle into equinix japan on january 1, 2017. this results in an overall net deferred tax liability position for the surviving entity so that it is more likely than not the deferred tax assets can be realized via deferred tax liability reversal.
a tax benefit from an uncertain income tax position may be recognized in the financial statements only if it is more likely than not that the position is sustainable, based solely on its technical merits and consideration of the relevant taxing authority's widely understood administrative practices and precedents.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   this assessment, which is completed on a taxing jurisdiction basis, takes into account a number of types of evidence, including the following: 1) the nature, frequency and severity of current and cumulative financial reporting losses, 2) sources of future taxable income and 3) tax planning strategies.                                                                                                                                                                  our decision to release our valuation allowances in other jurisdiction was based on our belief that the operations of these jurisdictions had achieved a sufficient level of profitability and will sustain a sufficient level of profitability in the future to support the release of these valuation allowances based on relevant facts and circumstances. however, if our assumptions on the future performance of these jurisdictions prove not to be correct and these jurisdictions are not able to sustain a sufficient level of profitability to support the associated deferred tax assets on our consolidated balance sheet, we will have to impair our deferred tax assets through an additional valuation allowance, which would impact our financial position and results of operations in the period such a determination is made.
in assessing the tax benefit from an uncertain income tax position, the tax position that meets the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold is initially and subsequently measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information.                                                                                              our remaining valuation allowance as of december 31, 2016 was $29.2 million and relates to certain of our subsidiaries outside of the u.s. if and when we reduce our remaining valuation allowances, it will have a favorable impact to our financial position and results of operations in the periods such determinations are made. we will continue to assess the need for our valuation allowances, by country or location, in the future.
as of december 31, 2016 and 2015, we had unrecognized tax benefits of $72.2 million and $30.8 million, respectively, exclusive of interest and penalties. during the year ended december 31, 2016, the unrecognized tax benefits increased by $41.4 million primarily due to the telecitygroup acquisition and integration. during the year ended december 31, 2015, the unrecognized tax benefits decreased by $5.3 million primarily due to an agreement with dutch tax authorities on the availability of historical loss carry-forwards to offset future profits generated by the dutch fiscal unity. the unrecognized tax benefits of $72.2 million as of december 31, 2016, if subsequently recognized, will affect our effective tax rate favorably at the time when such benefits are recognized.

in accordance with the accounting standard for business combinations, we allocate the purchase price of an acquired business to its identifiable assets and liabilities based on estimated fair values. the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, if any, is recorded as goodwill.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the estimates or assumptions we used to complete the purchase price allocations and the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed. however, if actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions, we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material, which would be recorded in our consolidated statements of operations in 2017 or beyond.
we use all available information to estimate fair values. we typically engage outside appraisal firms to assist in the fair value determination of identifiable intangible assets such as customer contracts, leases and any other significant assets or liabilities and contingent consideration. we adjust the preliminary purchase price allocation, as necessary, up to one year after the acquisition closing date if we obtain more information regarding asset valuations and liabilities assumed.
accounting for impairment of goodwill                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       in 2016, we elected to perform the first step of the two-step goodwill impairment test, we used both the income and market approach. the income approach is based on the ten-year business plan. we apply the weighted-average cost of capital applicable to our reporting units as discount rates. this requires assumptions and estimates derived from a review of our actual and forecasted operating results, approved business plans, future economic conditions and other market data. the market approach requires judgment in determining the appropriate market comparables.                                                                                                                                                          as of december 31, 2016, goodwill attributable to the americas reporting unit, the emea reporting unit and the asia-pacific reporting unit was $469.4 million, $2.3 billion and $235.3 million, respectively.
in accordance with the accounting standard for goodwill and other intangible assets, we perform goodwill impairment reviews annually, or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. during the year ended december 31, 2016, we elected to perform the first step of the two-step goodwill impairment test.                                                                                                                           in 2015, we elected to assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value requires assumptions and estimates before performing the two-step goodwill impairment test, the assessment requires assumptions and estimates derived from a review of our actual and forecasted operating results, approved business plans, future economic conditions and other market data.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       future events, changing market conditions and any changes in key assumptions may result in an impairment charge. while we have not recorded an impairment charge against our goodwill to date, the development of adverse business conditions in our americas, emea or asia-pacific reporting units, such as higher than anticipated customer churn or significantly increased operating costs, or significant deterioration of our market comparables that we use in the market approach, could result in an impairment charge in future periods.
we completed annual goodwill impairment assessment of the americas reporting unit, the emea reporting unit and the asia-pacific reporting unit and concluded that the fair values of the reporting units exceeded their carrying values. goodwill is not considered impaired and we are not required to perform step two of goodwill impairment test.                                                                                                                                                       these assumptions require significant management judgment and are inherently subject to uncertainties.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         any potential impairment charge against our goodwill would not exceed the amounts recorded on our consolidated balance sheets.

we have a substantial amount of property, plant and equipment recorded on our consolidated balance sheet. the vast majority of our property, plant and equipment represent the costs incurred to build out or acquire our ibx data centers. our ibx data centers are long-lived assets. the majority of our ibx data centers are in properties that are leased. we depreciate our property, plant and equipment using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the respective assets (subject to the term of the lease in the case of leased assets or leasehold improvements and integral equipment located in leased properties).                      another area of judgment for us in connection with our property, plant and equipment is related to lease accounting. most of our ibx data centers are leased. each time we enter into a new lease or lease amendment for one of our ibx data centers, we analyze each lease or lease amendment for the proper accounting. this requires certain judgments on our part such as establishing the lease term to include in a lease test, establishing the remaining estimated useful life of the underlying property or equipment and estimating the fair value of the underlying property or equipment and establishing the incremental borrowing rate to calculate the present value of the minimum lease payment for the lease test. all of these judgments are inherently uncertain. different assumptions or estimates could result in a different accounting treatment for a lease.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        as of december 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, we had property, plant and equipment of $7.2 billion, $5.6 billion, and $5.0 billion, respectively. during the years ended december 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, we recorded depreciation expense of $714.3 million, $498.1 million, and $453.9 million, respectively. further changes in our estimated useful lives of our property, plant and equipment could have a significant impact on our results of operations.
accounting for property, plant and equipment includes determining the appropriate period in which to depreciate such assets, making assessments for leased properties to determine whether they are capital or operating leases, determining if construction projects performed at leased properties trigger build-to-suit lease accounting, assessing such assets for potential impairment, capitalizing interest during periods of construction and assessing the asset retirement obligations required for certain leased properties that require us to return the leased properties back to their original condition at the time we decide to exit a leased property.   the assessment of long-lived assets for impairment requires assumptions and estimates of undiscounted and discounted future cash flows. these assumptions and estimates require significant judgment and are inherently uncertain.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            as of december 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, we had property, plant and equipment under capital leases and other financing obligations of $1.6 billion, $1.5 billion and $1.1 billion, respectively. during the years ended december 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, we recorded depreciation expense of $61.9 million, $52.9 million, and $43.2 million, respectively, related to property, plant and equipment under capital leases and other financing obligations. during the years ended december 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014, we recorded interest expense of $120.7 million, $104.4 million, $86.4 million, respectively, related to property, plant, equipment, under capital leases and other financing obligations.
additionally, during the years ended december 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, we recorded rent expense of $140.6 million, $101.5 million, and $105.4 million under operating leases.

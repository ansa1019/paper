proposed acquisition of linear technology corporation on july 26, 2016, we entered into a definitive agreement (the merger agreement) to acquire linear technology corporation (linear), an independent manufacturer of high performance linear integrated circuits. under the terms of the merger agreement, linear stockholders will receive, for each outstanding share of linear common stock, $46.00 in cash and 0.2321 of a share of our common stock at the closing. based on the number of outstanding shares of linear common stock as of july 26, 2016 and our 5-day volume weighted average price as of july 21, 2016, the value of the total consideration to be paid by us is estimated to be approximately $14.8 billion. on october 18, 2016, linear stockholders approved the merger agreement. as of october 29, 2016 we had received antitrust clearance in the united states and germany. subsequently, we have also received antitrust clearances in japan and israel. we currently expect the transaction to be completed by the end of the second quarter of our fiscal year ended october 28, 2017 (fiscal 2017), subject to receipt of the remaining required regulatory clearances and the satisfaction or waiver of the other conditions contained in the merger agreement.
we intend to fund the acquisition with the issuance of approximately 58.0 million new shares of our common stock and approximately $11.6 billion of new short- and long-term indebtedness. the financing is supported by fully underwritten bridge financing commitments and is expected to consist of term loans and bonds. see note 6, acquisitions and note 16, debt, of the notes to the consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k for further information.
acquisition of hittite microwave corporation (hittite)
on july 22, 2014, we completed the acquisition of hittite, a company that designed and developed high performance integrated circuits, modules, subsystems and instrumentation for radio frequency, microwave and millimeterwave applications. the total consideration paid to acquire hittite was approximately $2.4 billion, financed through a combination of existing cash on hand and a 90-day term loan facility of $2.0 billion. the acquisition of hittite is referred to as the hittite acquisition. see note 6, acquisitions, of the notes to the consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 of this annual report on from 10-k for further discussion related to the hittite acquisition.
revenue trends by end market the following table summarizes revenue by end market. the categorization of revenue by end market is determined using a variety of data points including the technical characteristics of the product, the "sold to" customer information, the "ship to" customer information and the end customer product or application into which our product will be incorporated. as data systems for capturing and tracking this data evolve and improve, the categorization of products by end market can vary over time. when this occurs, we reclassify revenue by end market for prior periods. such reclassifications typically do not materially change the sizing of, or the underlying trends of results within, each end market.

automotive end market revenue increased year-over-year in fiscal 2016 primarily as a result of increased demand for our powertrain, advanced driver assistance systems, and infotainment products. the year-over-year decrease in the consumer end market in fiscal 2016 was primarily the result of lower demand for products sold into portable consumer applications.
the year-over-year increase in the industrial and communications end markets revenue in fiscal 2015 was the result of the hittite acquisition. consumer end market revenue increased in fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014 as a result of increased demand for products sold into the portable sector of this end market.

gross margin percentage in fiscal 2016 decreased by 70 basis points compared to fiscal 2015, primarily as a result of lower utilization rates in our manufacturing facilities partially offset by a mix shift in favor of higher margin products being sold.
gross margin percentage in fiscal 2015 increased 190 basis points compared to fiscal 2014 primarily as a result of the impact of purchased inventory recognized in fiscal 2014 as a result of the hittite acquisition.

r&d expenses increased in fiscal 2016 as compared to fiscal 2015 primarily as a result of increases in r&d employee and related benefit expenses and operational spending, partially offset by a decrease in variable compensation expense linked to our overall profitability and revenue growth.
r&d expenses increased in fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014 primarily as a result of increases in operational spending resulting from the hittite acquisition, variable compensation expense linked to our overall profitability and revenue growth and r&d employee and related benefit expenses.
r&d expenses as a percentage of revenue will fluctuate from year-to-year depending on the amount of revenue and the success of new product development efforts, which we view as critical to our future growth. we have hundreds of r&d projects underway, none of which we believe are material on an individual basis. we expect to continue the development of innovative technologies and processes for new products. we believe that a continued commitment to r&d is essential to maintain product leadership with our existing products as well as to provide innovative new product offerings, and therefore, we expect to continue to make significant r&d investments in the future.

amortization expenses as a % of revenue         2.0   %             2.6   %             0.9   %
amortization expenses decreased in fiscal 2016 as compared to fiscal 2015 as a result of certain intangible assets becoming fully amortized during fiscal 2015.
amortization expenses increased in fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014 as a result of acquired amortizable intangible assets from the hittite acquisition. these intangible assets are being amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives.
special charges we monitor global macroeconomic conditions on an ongoing basis, and continue to assess opportunities for improved operational effectiveness and efficiency and better alignment of expenses with revenues. as a result of these assessments, we have undertaken various restructuring actions over the past several years. the expense reductions relating to ongoing actions are described below.
during fiscal 2016, we recorded a special charge of approximately $13.7 million for severance and fringe benefit costs in accordance with the company's ongoing benefit plan for 123 manufacturing, engineering and smg&a employees. as of october 29, 2016, we still employed 44 of the 123 employees included in these cost reduction actions. these employees must continue to be employed by the company until their employment is terminated in order to receive the severance benefit. we expect this action will result in estimated annual cost savings of approximately $12.3 million once fully implemented.
during fiscal 2014, we recorded special charges of approximately $37.3 million. these special charges included $37.9 million for severance and fringe benefit costs in accordance with our ongoing benefit plan or statutory requirements at foreign locations for 341 manufacturing, engineering and smg&a employees; $0.5 million for lease obligations costs for facilities that we ceased using during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014; and $0.4 million for the impairment of assets that have no future use located at closed facilities. we reversed approximately $1.4 million of our severance accrual related to charges taken in fiscal 2013, primarily due to severance costs being lower than our estimates. we terminated the employment of all employees associated with this action. this action resulted in annual cost savings of approximately $46.2 million.
we expect that annual cost savings resulting from these actions will be used to make additional investments in products that we expect will drive revenue growth in the future.
other operating expense during fiscal 2015, we converted the benefits provided to participants in our irish defined benefits pension plan to benefits provided under our irish defined contribution plan. retired pension plan participants received an annuity. as a result, in fiscal 2015 we recorded settlement charges, legal, accounting and other professional fees totaling $223.7 million to settle all existing and future irish pension plan liabilities.

the increase in operating income in fiscal 2016 as compared to fiscal 2015 was primarily the result of a $223.7 million decrease in other operating expense more fully described above under the heading other operating expense, partially offset by a 70 basis point decrease in gross margin percentage.
the increase in operating income in fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014 was primarily the result of an increase in revenue of $570.3 million, a 190 basis point increase in gross margin percentage and a $37.3 million decrease in special charges, partially offset by a $223.7 million increase in other operating expense, a $77.8 million increase in r&d expenses, a $24.3 million increase in smg&a expenses and a $62.3 million increase in amortization of intangibles more fully described above under the headings research and development (r&d), selling, marketing, general and administrative (smg&a), amortization of intangibles, special charges and other operating expense.

the increase in nonoperating expense in fiscal 2016 as compared to fiscal 2015 was primarily the result of an increase in interest expense as a result of the issuance of $850.0 million aggregate principal amount of 3.9% senior unsecured notes due december 15, 2025 (the 2025 notes) and $400.0 million aggregate principal amount of 5.3% senior unsecured notes due december 15, 2045 (the 2045 notes) in fiscal 2016, and as a result of fees related to financing commitments entered into in anticipation of the proposed acquisition of linear. these increases were partially offset by a decrease in interest expense as a result of the redemption of the $375.0 million aggregate principal amount of 3.0% senior unsecured notes (the 2016 notes) in fiscal 2016. see note 16, debt, of the notes to our condensed consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k for further information on the issuance of the 2025 notes and the 2045 notes and redemption of the 2016 notes. the increase in nonoperating expense as a result of the increase in interest expense in fiscal 2016 as compared to fiscal 2015 was partially offset by an increase in interest income due to higher interest rates earned on our investments and the investment of higher cash balances in fiscal 2016 as compared to fiscal 2015.
the decrease in nonoperating expense in fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014 was primarily the result of the repayment of the 90-day term loan facility used to fund the hittite acquisition in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014, partially offset by a decrease in interest income primarily as a result of lower cash balances throughout fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014.

the tax rate for all periods presented was below the u.s. federal statutory tax rate of 35%, primarily due to lower statutory tax rates applicable to our operations in the foreign jurisdictions in which we earn income. non-u.s. jurisdictions accounted for approximately 78% of our total revenues for the fiscal 2016, resulting in a material portion of our pretax income being earned and taxed outside the u.s., primarily in bermuda and ireland, at rates ranging from 0% to 35%. the impact on our provision for income taxes of income earned in foreign jurisdictions being taxed at rates different than the u.s. statutory rate was a benefit of approximately $264.3 million and a foreign effective tax rate of approximately 6.1% in fiscal 2016 compared to a benefit of approximately $198.1 million and a foreign effective tax rate of approximately 10.6% fiscal 2015. a reduction in the ratio of domestic taxable income to worldwide taxable income effectively lowers the overall tax rate, due to the fact that the tax rates in the majority of foreign jurisdictions where we earn income are significantly lower than the u.s.
statutory rate. in addition, our effective income tax rate can be impacted each year by discrete factors or events. our effective tax rate for fiscal 2016 included a tax benefit of $7.5 million from the reinstatement of the u.s. federal research and development tax credit in december 2015 retroactive to january 1, 2015. our effective tax rate for fiscal 2015 was reduced as a result of $13.0 million recorded from the reversal of certain prior period tax liabilities, a tax benefit of $7.0 million from the reinstatement of the u.s. federal research and development tax credit in december 2014 retroactive to january 1, 2014 and a tax benefit of $3.8 million as a result of an acquisition accounting adjustment. in addition our effective tax rate for fiscal 2015 included $2.0 million of discrete tax expense items associated with the u.s. provision to return adjustments.
non-u.s. jurisdictions accounted for approximately 78% of our total revenues for fiscal 2015, resulting in a material portion of our pretax income being earned and taxed outside the u.s., primarily in bermuda and ireland, at rates ranging from 0% to 35%. the impact on our provision for income taxes of income earned in foreign jurisdictions being taxed at rates different than the u.s. statutory rate was a benefit of approximately $198.1 million and a foreign effective tax rate of approximately 10.6% in fiscal 2015, compared to a benefit of approximately $179.3 million and a foreign effective tax rate of approximately 7.7% in fiscal 2014. a reduction in the ratio of domestic taxable income to worldwide taxable income effectively lowers the overall tax rate, due to the fact that the tax rates in the majority of foreign jurisdictions where we earn income are significantly lower than the u.s. statutory rate. in addition, our effective income tax rate can be impacted each year by discrete factors or events. our effective tax rate for fiscal 2015 was reduced as a result of $13.0 million recorded from the reversal of certain prior period tax liabilities, a tax benefit of $7.0 million from the reinstatement of the u.s. federal research and development tax credit in december 2014 retroactive to january 1, 2014 and a tax benefit of $3.8 million as a result of an acquisition accounting adjustment. in addition our effective tax rate for fiscal 2015 included $2.0 million of discrete tax expense items associated with the u.s. provision to return adjustments. our effective tax rate for fiscal 2014 was not significantly impacted by discrete items.

the increase in net income in fiscal 2016 as compared to fiscal 2015 was primarily a result of the $197.3 million increase in operating income and the $18.0 million decrease in provision for income taxes, partially offset by the $50.5 million increase in nonoperating expense.
the increase in net income in fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014 was primarily a result of the $78.4 million increase in operating income, partially offset by the $13.2 million increase in provision for income taxes.
the impact of inflation and foreign currency exchange rate movement on our results of operations during the past three fiscal years has not been significant.
acquisitions on july 22, 2014, we completed our acquisition of hittite, a company that designed and developed high performance integrated circuits, modules, subsystems and instrumentation for radio frequency, microwave and millimeterwave applications. the total consideration paid to acquire hittite was approximately $2.4 billion, financed through a combination of existing cash on hand and a 90-day term loan facility of $2.0 billion. we recognized assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition, resulting in the recognition of $1.4 billion of goodwill and $666.4 million of intangible assets, including $0.9 million of in-process research and development intangible assets. we recognized approximately $50.9 million of transaction-related costs, including legal, accounting, severance, debt financing, interest and other related fees of which approximately $9.7 million were expensed in fiscal 2015 and $41.2 million in fiscal 2014. these costs are included in the consolidated statements of income in operating expenses within smg&a expenses as well as non-operating expenses. the hittite acquisition resulted in the creation of a new operating segment. we continue to operate and track our results in one reportable segment based on the aggregation of seven operating segments.
the following unaudited pro forma consolidated financial information presents our combined results of operations after giving effect to the hittite acquisition and assumes that the hittite acquisition, which closed on july 22, 2014, was completed
on november 4, 2012 (the first day of the company's 2013 fiscal year). the pro forma consolidated financial information has been calculated after applying our accounting policies and includes adjustments for amortization expense of acquired intangible assets, transaction-related costs, increase in cost of sales for inventory acquired and depreciation of property, plant and equipment, and interest expense for the debt incurred to fund the hittite acquisition, together with the consequential tax effects. these pro forma results have been prepared for comparative purposes only and do not purport to be indicative of our operating results that would have been achieved had the hittite acquisition actually taken place on november 4, 2012. in addition, these results are not intended to be a projection of future results and do not reflect events that may occur after the hittite acquisition, including but not limited to revenue enhancements, cost savings or operating synergies that the combined company may achieve as a result of the hittite acquisition.
liquidity and capital resources at october 29, 2016, our principal source of liquidity was $4.1 billion of cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments, of which approximately $725.8 million was held in the united states. the balance of our cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments was held outside the united states in various foreign subsidiaries. as we intend to reinvest substantially all of our foreign earnings indefinitely, the majority of cash held outside the united states is not available to meet certain aspects of our cash requirements in the united states, including cash dividends, principal and interest payments, and common stock repurchases. if these funds are needed for u.s. operations or can no longer be indefinitely reinvested outside the united states, we would be required to accrue and pay u.s. taxes to repatriate these funds and such amounts could be material. our cash and cash equivalents consist of highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less at the time of acquisition, including money market funds, and our short-term investments consist primarily of corporate obligations, such as commercial paper and floating rate notes, bonds and bank time deposits. we maintain these balances with high credit quality counterparties, continually monitor the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer and diversify our investments in order to minimize our credit risk.
in connection with our proposed acquisition of linear, in fiscal 2016 we obtained bridge financing commitments and entered into a term loan facility consisting of a 3-year unsecured term loan facility in the principal amount of $2.5 billion and a 5-year unsecured term loan facility in the principal amount of $2.5 billion. we expect to finance the proposed acquisition using both short- and long-term indebtedness totaling approximately $11.6 billion. in addition, in fiscal 2016 we amended and restated our existing revolving credit facility to allow for the increase in the amount of commitments to $1.0 billion from $750.0 million, subject to closing the acquisition of linear and the satisfaction of certain other conditions. during the period prior to closing, we expect to incur fees and expenses related to the financing arrangements and the acquisition. see note 16, debt, of the notes to our condensed consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k for further information.
we believe that our existing sources of liquidity and cash expected to be generated from future operations, together with existing and anticipated available long-term financing, will be sufficient to fund operations, capital expenditures, research and development efforts and dividend payments (if any) in the immediate future and for at least the next twelve months.
net cash provided by operations as a % of revenue   37.4            %              26.4   %              30.4   %
at october 29, 2016, cash and cash equivalents totaled $921.1 million. the following changes contributed to the net increase in cash and cash equivalents of $36.8 million in fiscal 2016.
operating activities cash provided by operating activities is net income adjusted for certain non-cash items and changes in assets and liabilities.
the increase in cash provided by operating activities during fiscal 2016 as compared to fiscal 2015 was primarily due to changes in working capital and higher net income adjusted for non-cash items. changes in working capital included a decrease in inventory and an increase in accounts receivable more fully described below under the heading working capital.
investing activities investing cash flows consist primarily of capital expenditures, investment purchases, maturities and sales of available-for-sale securities, as well as cash used for acquisitions.
the increase in cash used for investing activities during fiscal 2016 as compared to fiscal 2015 was primarily due to an increase in the net purchases of available-for-sale securities and an increase in payments for acquisitions, partially offset by a decrease in property, plant and equipment additions.
financing activities financing cash flows consist primarily of payments of dividends to stockholders, repurchases of common stock, issuance and repayment of long-term debt, and proceeds from the sale of shares of common stock pursuant to employee equity incentive plans.
the decrease in cash used for financing activities during fiscal 2016 as compared to fiscal 2015 was primarily due to net proceeds of $1.2 billion received from the issuance of the 2025 notes and 2045 notes, partially offset by $378.2 million of payments for the redemption of our 2016 notes, an increase in stock repurchases of $143.1 million, a decrease in proceeds from the sale of shares of common stock pursuant to employee equity incentive plans of $61.1 million, payments of $33.4 million related to derivative instruments, payments of $26.6 million in deferred financing fees related to the proposed acquisition of linear and an increase in dividend payments to shareholders of $22.1 million.

* we use the average of the current year and prior year ending net accounts receivable and ending inventory balance in our calculation of days sales outstanding and days cost of sales in inventory, respectively the increase in accounts receivable was primarily the result of higher product shipments in the final month of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016 as compared to the final month of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015. days sales outstanding increased primarily as a result of an increase in average accounts receivable of 9% over the prior year.
inventory as of october 29, 2016 decreased as compared to the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015 primarily as a result of our efforts to balance manufacturing production, demand and inventory levels. our inventory levels are impacted by our need to support forecasted sales demand and variations between those forecasts and actual demand.
current liabilities decreased to $782.9 million at october 29, 2016 from $1.1 billion recorded at the end of fiscal 2015. the decrease was primarily the result of the redemption of the 2016 notes in the first quarter of fiscal 2016, partially offset by an increase in deferred income on shipments to distributors as more fully described below.
as of october 29, 2016 and october 31, 2015, we had gross deferred revenue of $432.3 million and $379.9 million, respectively, and gross deferred cost of sales of $80.8 million and $79.8 million, respectively. deferred income on shipments to distributors increased in fiscal 2016 primarily as a result of higher demand for products sold into the channel. sales to distributors are made under agreements that allow distributors to receive price-adjustment credits and to return qualifying products for credit, as determined by us, in order to reduce the amounts of slow-moving, discontinued or obsolete product from
their inventory. given the uncertainties associated with the levels of price-adjustment credits to be granted to distributors, the sales price to the distributors is not fixed or determinable until the distributors resell the products to their customers. therefore, we defer revenue recognition from sales to distributors until the distributors have sold the products to their customers. the amount of price-adjustments is dependent on future overall market conditions, and therefore the levels of these adjustments could fluctuate significantly from period to period. to the extent that we experience a significant increase in the amount of credits we issue to our distributors, there could be a material impact on the ultimate revenue and gross margin recognized relating to these transactions.
debt as of october 29, 2016, we had $1,732.2 million of carrying value outstanding on our debt. the difference in the carrying value of the debt and the principal amount of the debt is due to the unamortized discount and issuance fees on these instruments that will accrete to the face value of the debt over the term of the debt. our debt obligations consist of the following:
$500.0 million aggregate principal amount of 2.875% senior unsecured notes (2023 notes)
on june 3, 2013, we issued the 2023 notes with semi-annual fixed interest payments due on june 1 and december 1 of each year, commencing december 1, 2013.
$850.0 million aggregate principal amount of 3.9% senior unsecured notes (2025 notes) and $400.0 million aggregate principal amount of 5.3% senior unsecured notes (2045 notes)
on december 14, 2015, we issued the 2025 notes and the 2045 notes with semi-annual fixed interest payments due on june 15 and december 15 of each year, commencing june 15, 2016.
the indentures governing the 2023 notes, 2025 notes and 2045 notes contain covenants that may limit our ability to: incur, create, assume or guarantee any debt for borrowed money secured by a lien upon a principal property; enter into sale and lease-back transactions with respect to a principal property; and consolidate with or merge into, or transfer or lease all or substantially all of our assets to, any other party. as of october 29, 2016, we were compliant with these covenants. see note 16, debt, of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k for further information on our outstanding debt.
revolving credit facility on july 10, 2015, we amended and restated our existing senior unsecured revolving credit facility with certain institutional lenders (the credit agreement) dated as of december 19, 2012. on september 23, 2016, we subsequently amended and restated the credit agreement. the credit agreement expires on july 10, 2020 and provides that the company may borrow up to $750.0 million. subject to closing the acquisition of linear and the satisfaction of certain other conditions, the aggregate amount of commitments under the facility will increase to $1.0 billion from $750.0 million and the maximum covenant level will be temporally revised. to date, we have not borrowed under this credit facility, but we may borrow in the future and use the proceeds for repayment of existing indebtedness, stock repurchases, acquisitions, capital expenditures, working capital and other lawful corporate purposes. the terms of the facility impose restrictions on our ability to undertake certain transactions, to create certain liens on assets and to incur certain subsidiary indebtedness. in addition, the credit agreement contains a consolidated leverage ratio covenant of total consolidated funded debt to consolidated earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (ebitda) of not greater than 3.0 to 1.0. as of october 29, 2016, we were compliant with these covenants. see note 15, revolving credit facility, of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k for further information on our revolving credit facility.
stock repurchase program our common stock repurchase program has been in place since august 2004. in the aggregate, our board of directors has authorized us to repurchase $6.2 billion of our common stock under the program. under the program, we may repurchase outstanding shares of our common stock from time to time in the open market and through privately negotiated transactions. unless terminated earlier by resolution of our board of directors, the repurchase program will expire when we have repurchased all shares authorized under the program. as of october 29, 2016, we had repurchased a total of approximately 147.0 million shares of our common stock for approximately $5.4 billion under this program. as of october 29, 2016, an additional $792.5 million worth of shares remains available for repurchase under the current authorized program. the repurchased shares are held as authorized but unissued shares of common stock. we also from time to time repurchase shares in settlement of employee minimum tax withholding obligations due upon the vesting of restricted stock units. as a result of our proposed acquisition of linear, we have temporarily suspended our share repurchase program. while we do not plan to resume share repurchases in the near term, we expect to continue repurchasing our common stock over the long-term.
capital expenditures net additions to property, plant and equipment were $127.4 million in fiscal 2016 and were funded with a combination of cash on hand and cash generated from operations. we expect capital expenditures for fiscal 2017 to be in the range of $125.0 million to $145.0 million. these capital expenditures will be funded with a combination of cash on hand and cash generated from operations.
dividends on november 21, 2016, our board of directors declared a cash dividend of $0.42 per outstanding share of common stock. the dividend will be paid on december 13, 2016 to all shareholders of record at the close of business on december 2, 2016 and is expected to total approximately $129.4 million. we currently expect quarterly dividends to continue at $0.42 per share, although they remain subject to determination and declaration by our board of directors. the payment of future dividends, if any, will be based on several factors, including our financial performance, outlook and liquidity.
contractual obligations the table below summarizes our contractual obligations and the amounts we owe under these contracts in specified periods as of october 29, 2016:
operating leases (a)                                       $82,625               $34,328             $33,431                 $11,472                        $3,394
(a)   certain of our operating lease obligations include escalation clauses. these escalating payment requirements are reflected in the table.
(b)   this payment reflects the amount of commitment and structuring fees related to bridge financing commitments, due upon the closing or termination of the proposed acquisition of linear. the timing of due date of the payment is estimated based upon the estimated closing of date of the acquisition. see note 16, debt, of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k for more information on the bridge financing commitments.
(c)   these payments relate to obligations under our deferred compensation plan. the deferred compensation plan allows certain members of management and other highly-compensated employees and non-employee directors to defer receipt of all or any portion of their compensation. the amount in the "more than 5 years" column of the table represents the remaining total balance under the deferred compensation plan to be paid to participants who have not terminated employment. since we cannot reasonably estimate the timing of withdrawals for participants who have not yet terminated employment, we have included the future obligation to these participants in the "more than 5 years" column of the table.
(d)   our funding policy for our foreign defined benefit plans is consistent with the local requirements of each country. the payment obligations in the table are estimates of our expected contributions to these plans for fiscal year 2017. the actual future payments may differ from the amounts presented in the table and reasonable estimates of payments beyond one year are not practical because of potential future changes in variables, such as plan asset performance, interest rates and the rate of increase in compensation levels.
certain of our acquisitions involve the potential payment of contingent consideration. the table above does not reflect any such obligations, which could be up to $8.5 million, as the timing and amounts are uncertain.
the table above does not reflect future obligations related to the long-term financing we have not yet incurred but expect to incur in connection with our proposed acquisition of linear, as these obligations will be contingent upon the closing of the acquisition. these obligations consist of the expected issuance of approximately $11.6 billion in both short- and long-term
indebtedness, plus the interest expense associated with them. see note 16, debt, of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k for more information on the financing commitments.
as of october 29, 2016, our total liabilities associated with uncertain tax positions was $81.7 million, which are included in "other non-current liabilities" in our consolidated balance sheet contained in item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k. due to the complexity associated with our deferred taxes and tax uncertainties, we cannot make a reasonably reliable estimate of the period in which we expect to settle the non-current liabilities associated with these deferred taxes and uncertain tax positions. therefore, we have not included these deferred taxes and uncertain tax positions in the above contractual obligations table.
the expected timing of payments and the amounts of the obligations discussed above are estimated based on current information available as of october 29, 2016.
off-balance sheet arrangements as of october 29, 2016, we had no off-balance sheet financing arrangements.
new accounting pronouncements from time to time, new accounting pronouncements are issued by the financial accounting standards board (fasb) and are adopted by us as of the specified effective date. unless otherwise discussed, management believes that the impact of recently issued standards will not have a material impact on our future financial condition and results of operations. see note 2t, new accounting pronouncements, of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k for a description of recently issued and adopted accounting pronouncements, including the dates of adoption and impact on our historical financial condition and results of operations.
revenue recognition in may 2014, the fasb issued accounting standards update (asu) 2014-09, revenue from contracts with customers (asu 2014-09), which supersedes nearly all existing revenue recognition guidance under u.s. gaap. the core principle of asu 2014-09 is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. additionally, the guidance requires improved disclosures to help users of financial statements better understand the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers. the fasb has issued several amendments and updates to the new revenue standard, including guidance related to when an entity should recognize revenue gross as a principal or net as an agent and how an entity should identify performance obligations.  as amended, asu 2014-09 is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after december 15, 2017, which is our first quarter of fiscal 2019. early adoption is permitted for all entities only as of annual reporting periods beginning after december 15, 2016, including interim reporting periods within that reporting period. as described in note 2n, revenue recognition, of the notes to the consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 of this annual report on from 10-k, we defer revenue and the related cost of sales on shipments to distributors until the distributors resell the products to their customers. upon adoption of asu 2014-09, we will no longer be permitted to defer revenue until sale by the distributor to the end customer, but rather, will be required to estimate the effects of returns and allowances provided to distributors and record revenue at the time of sale to the distributor. we are continuing to evaluate the future impact and method of adoption of asu 2014-09 and related amendments on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. we are considering early adoption of the new standard using the modified retrospective method in fiscal 2018. our ability to early adopt the standard is dependent on system readiness and the completion of the analysis necessary to meet the requirements under asu 2014-09.
critical accounting policies and estimates management's discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations is based upon the consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with u.s. gaap. the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience, knowledge of current conditions and beliefs of what could occur in the future based on available information. we consider the following accounting policies to be both those most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and those that require the most subjective judgment. if actual results differ significantly from management's estimates and projections, there could be a material effect on our financial statements. we also have other policies that we consider key accounting policies, such as our policy for revenue recognition, including the deferral of revenue on sales to distributors until the products are sold to the end user; however, the application of these policies does not require us to make significant estimates or judgments that are difficult or subjective.
revenue recognition revenue from product sales to customers is generally recognized when title passes, which is upon shipment in the u.s. and for certain foreign counties. revenue from product sales to other foreign countries is subsequent to product shipment. title for these shipments to these other foreign countries ordinarily passes within a week of shipment. accordingly, we defer the revenue recognized relating to these other foreign countries until title has passed. for multiple element arrangements, we allocate arrangement consideration among the elements based on the relative fair values of those elements as determined using vendor-specific objective evidence or third-party evidence. we use our best estimate of selling price to allocate arrangement consideration between the deliverables in cases where neither vendor-specific objective evidence nor third-party evidence is available. a reserve for sales returns and allowances for customers is recorded based on historical experience or specific identification of an event necessitating a reserve.
revenue from contracts with the united states government, government prime contractors and some commercial customers is generally recorded on a percentage of completion basis, using either units delivered or costs incurred as the measurement basis for progress toward completion. the output measure is used to measure results directly and is generally the best measure of progress toward completion in circumstances in which a reliable measure of output can be established. estimated revenue in excess of amounts billed is reported as unbilled receivables. contract accounting requires judgment in estimating costs and assumptions related to technical issues and delivery schedule. contract costs include material, subcontract costs, labor and an allocation of indirect costs. the estimation of costs at completion of a contract is subject to numerous variables involving contract costs and estimates as to the length of time to complete the contract. changes in contract performance, estimated gross margin, including the impact of final contract settlements, and estimated losses are recognized in the period in which the changes or losses are determined.
in all regions of the world, we defer revenue and the related cost of sales on shipments to distributors until the distributors resell the products to their customers. as a result, our revenue fully reflects end customer purchases and is not impacted by distributor inventory levels. sales to distributors are made under agreements that allow distributors to receive price-adjustment credits and to return qualifying products for credit, as determined by us, in order to reduce the amounts of slow-moving, discontinued or obsolete product from their inventory. these agreements limit such returns to a certain percentage of the value of our shipments to that distributor during the prior quarter. in addition, distributors are allowed to return unsold products if we terminate the relationship with the distributor. given the uncertainties associated with the levels of price-adjustment credits to be granted to distributors, the sales price to the distributor is not fixed or determinable until the distributor resells the products to their customers. therefore, we defer revenue recognition from sales to distributors until the distributors have sold the products to their customers.
inventory valuation we value inventories at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out method) or market. because of the cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry, changes in inventory levels, obsolescence of technology, and product life cycles, we write down inventories to net realizable value. we employ a variety of methodologies to determine the net realizable value of inventory. while a portion of the calculation is determined via reference to the age of inventory and lower of cost or market calculations, an element of the calculation is subject to significant judgments made by us about future demand for our inventory. if actual demand for our products is less than our estimates, additional adjustments to existing inventories may need to be recorded in future periods. to date, our actual results have not been materially different than our estimates, and we do not expect them to be materially different in the future.
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts, when appropriate, for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments. if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate, our actual losses may exceed our estimates, and additional allowances would be required. to date, our actual results have not been materially different than our estimates, and we do not expect them to be materially different in the future.
long-lived assets we review property, plant, and equipment and finite lived intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of assets may not be recoverable. recoverability of these assets is determined by comparison of their carrying value to the estimated future undiscounted cash flows that the assets are expected to generate over their remaining estimated lives. if such assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized in earnings equals the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds their fair value determined by either a quoted market price, if any, or a value determined by utilizing a discounted cash flow technique. although we have recognized no material impairment adjustments related to our property, plant, and equipment and identified intangible assets during the past three fiscal years,
except those made in conjunction with restructuring actions, deterioration in our business in the future could lead to such impairment adjustments in future periods. evaluation of impairment of long-lived assets requires estimates of future operating results that are used in the preparation of the expected future undiscounted cash flows. actual future operating results and the remaining economic lives of our long-lived assets could differ from the estimates used in assessing the recoverability of these assets. these differences could result in impairment charges, which could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. in addition, in certain instances, assets may not be impaired but their estimated useful lives may have decreased. in these situations, we amortize the remaining net book values over the revised useful lives. we review indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment annually, on the first day of the fourth quarter (on or about august 1) or more frequently if indicators of impairment exist. we perform a qualitative assessment on our indefinite-lived intangible assets to determine whether it is more likely-than not that the indefinite-lived intangible asset is impaired. if it is determined that the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset is less than the carrying value, we would compare the fair value of the intangible asset with its carrying amount and recognize an impairment equal to any amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds the fair value.
goodwill goodwill is subject to annual impairment tests or more frequently if indicators of potential impairment exist and suggest that the carrying value of goodwill may not be recoverable from estimated discounted future cash flows. we test goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level (operating segment or one level below an operating segment) on an annual basis in the fourth quarter (on or about august 1) or more frequently if we believe indicators of impairment exist. for our latest annual impairment assessment that occurred as of july 31, 2016, we identified our reporting units to be our seven operating segments. the performance of the test involves a two-step process. the first step of the impairment test involves comparing the fair values of the applicable reporting units with their aggregate carrying values, including goodwill. we determine the fair value of our reporting units using a weighting of the income and market approaches. under the income approach, we use a discounted cash flow methodology which requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions related to forecasted revenues, gross profit margins, operating income margins, working capital cash flow, perpetual growth rates, and long-term discount rates, among others. for the market approach, we use the guideline public company method. under this method we utilize information from comparable publicly traded companies with similar operating and investment characteristics as the reporting units, to create valuation multiples that are applied to the operating performance of the reporting unit being tested, in order to obtain their respective fair values. in order to assess the reasonableness of the calculated reporting unit fair values, we reconcile the aggregate fair values of our reporting units determined, as described above, to its current market capitalization, allowing for a reasonable control premium. if the carrying amount of a reporting unit, calculated using the above approaches, exceeds the reporting unit's fair value, we perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test to determine the amount of impairment loss. the second step of the goodwill impairment test involves comparing the implied fair value of the affected reporting unit's goodwill with the carrying value of that reporting unit's goodwill.
business combinations under the acquisition method of accounting, we recognize tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values. we record the excess of the fair value of the purchase consideration over the value of the net assets acquired as goodwill. the accounting for business combinations requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions, especially with respect to intangible assets and the fair value of contingent payment obligations. critical estimates in valuing purchased technology, customer lists and other identifiable intangible assets include future cash flows that we expect to generate from the acquired assets. if the subsequent actual results and updated projections of the underlying business activity change compared with the assumptions and projections used to develop these values, we could experience impairment charges which could be material. in addition, we have estimated the economic lives of certain acquired assets and these lives are used to calculate depreciation and amortization expense. if our estimates of the economic lives change, depreciation or amortization expenses could be accelerated or slowed.
we record contingent consideration resulting from a business combination at its fair value on the acquisition date. we generally determine the fair value of the contingent consideration using the income approach methodology of valuation. each reporting period thereafter, we revalue these obligations and record increases or decreases in their fair value as an adjustment to operating expenses within the consolidated statement of income. changes in the fair value of the contingent consideration can result from changes in assumed discount periods and rates, and from changes pertaining to the achievement of the defined milestones. significant judgment is employed in determining the appropriateness of these assumptions as of the acquisition date and for each subsequent period. accordingly, future business and economic conditions, as well as changes in any of the assumptions described above, can materially impact the amount of contingent consideration expense we record in any given period.
accounting for income taxes we must make certain estimates and judgments in determining income tax expense for financial statement purposes. these estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of tax credits, benefits, and deductions, and in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities, which arise from differences in the timing of the recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purposes, as well as the interest and penalties relating to these uncertain tax positions. we assessed the likelihood of the realization of deferred tax assets and concluded that a valuation allowance is needed to reserve the amount of the deferred tax assets that may not be realized due to the uncertainty of the timing and amount of the realization of certain state credit carryovers. in reaching our conclusion, we evaluated certain relevant criteria including the existence of deferred tax liabilities that can be used to realize deferred tax assets, the taxable income in prior carryback years in the impacted state jurisdictions that can be used to absorb net operating losses and taxable income in future years. our judgments regarding future profitability may change due to future market conditions, changes in u.s. or international tax laws and other factors. these changes, if any, may require material adjustments to these deferred tax assets, resulting in a reduction in net income or an increase in net loss in the period when such determinations are made, which in turn, may result in an increase or decrease to our tax provision in a subsequent period.
we account for uncertain tax positions by determining if it is "more likely than not" that a tax position will be sustained by the appropriate taxing authorities prior to recording any benefit in the financial statements. an uncertain income tax position is not recognized if it has less than a 50% likelihood of being sustained. for those tax positions where it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained, we have recorded the largest amount of tax benefit with a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information. for those income tax positions where it is not more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained, no tax benefit has been recognized in the financial statements. we reevaluate these uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis. this evaluation is based on factors including, but not limited to, changes in known facts or circumstances, changes in tax law, effectively settled issues under audit, and new audit activity. a change in these factors would result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision.
in the ordinary course of global business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain. some of these uncertainties arise as a consequence of cost reimbursement and royalty arrangements among related entities. although we believe our estimates are reasonable, no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different than that which is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals. in the event our assumptions are incorrect, the differences could have a material impact on our income tax provision and operating results in the period in which such determination is made. in addition to the factors described above, our current and expected effective tax rate is based on then-current tax law. significant changes during the year in enacted tax law could affect these estimates.
stock-based compensation stock-based compensation expense associated with stock options and related awards is recognized in the consolidated statements of income. determining the amount of stock-based compensation to be recorded requires us to develop estimates to be used in calculating the grant-date fair value of stock options and market-based restricted stock units. we calculate the grant-date fair values of stock options using the black-scholes valuation model. the use of valuation models requires us to make estimates of key assumptions such as expected option term and stock price volatility to determine the fair value of a stock option. the estimate of these key assumptions is based on historical information and judgment regarding market factors and trends. as it relates to our market-based restricted stock units, we utilize the monte carlo simulation valuation model to value these awards. the monte carlo simulation model utilizes multiple input variables that determine the probability of satisfying the performance conditions stipulated in the award grant and calculates the fair market value for the market-based restricted stock units granted. the monte carlo simulation model also uses stock price volatility and other variables to estimate the probability of satisfying the performance conditions, including the possibility that the market condition may not be satisfied, and the resulting fair value of the award. we recognize the expense related to these on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, which is generally five years for stock options and three years for restricted stock units. see note 3, stock-based compensation and shareholders' equity, of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k for more information related to stock based compensation.
contingencies from time to time, in the ordinary course of business, various claims, charges and litigation are asserted or commenced against us arising from, or related to, contractual matters, patents, trademarks, personal injury, environmental matters, product liability, insurance coverage and personnel and employment disputes. we periodically assess each matter to determine if a contingent liability should be recorded. in making this determination, we may, depending on the nature of the matter, consult with internal and external legal counsel and technical experts. based on the information we obtain, combined with our judgment regarding all the facts and circumstances of each matter, we determine whether it is probable that a contingent loss
may be incurred and whether the amount of such loss can be reasonably estimated. if a loss is probable and reasonably estimable, we record a contingent loss. in determining the amount of a contingent loss, we consider advice received from experts in the specific matter, current status of legal proceedings, settlement negotiations that may be ongoing, prior case history and other factors. if the judgments and estimates made by us are incorrect, we may need to record additional contingent losses that could materially adversely impact our results of operations.

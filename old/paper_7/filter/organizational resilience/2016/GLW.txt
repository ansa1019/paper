·   environment
overview strategy and capital allocation framework in october 2015, corning announced a new strategy and capital allocation framework ("the framework") that reflects the company's financial and operational strengths, as well as its ongoing commitment to increasing shareholder value.  the framework outlines our leadership priorities, and articulates the opportunities we see across our businesses.  we designed the framework to create significant value for shareholders by focusing our portfolio and leveraging our financial strength.  under our framework we target generating $26 billion to $30 billion of cash through 2019, returning more than $12.5 billion to shareholders and investing $10 billion to sustain our leadership positions and deliver growth.
our probability of success increases as we invest in our world-class capabilities.  over the next three years, corning will concentrate approximately 80% of its research, development and engineering investment and capital spending on a cohesive set of three core technologies, four manufacturing and engineering platforms, and five market-access platforms.  this strategy will allow us to quickly apply our talents and repurpose our assets as needed.
performance against the framework since introducing the framework, we have distributed approximately $6 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends.  our board also approved a new $4 billion share repurchase authorization in december 2016, and annual dividend increases of 12.5% in 2016 and 14.8% in february 2017 as part of our ongoing commitment to return cash to our investors.
within our portfolio, we realigned our interest in dow corning, which created significant value for shareholders, including unlocking $4.8 billion in cash.  we strengthened our position in optical communications with two acquisitions to expand our access to various segments of the telecommunications market.  we also entered into a joint venture with saint-gobain sekurit to develop automotive glazing solutions.
we also utilized our financial strength in 2016 to continue our focus on innovation, resulting in the launch of new products and traction with customers on key growth initiatives, including:
·   gorilla® glass 5, which offers superior drop performance versus its predecessor and competitive technologies; expanding our cover-glass portfolio with vibrant® gorilla® glass, which enables high-resolution designs for smartphones, tablets, and notebooks; and gorilla® glass sr+ for wearable devices.
·   leveraging our competitive advantages and market-leading products to continue to win business in the optical market, with customer commitments and demand that support the capacity expansions now underway.
·   winning business in the automotive sector for both substrates and our new gas particulate filters. we anticipate that our gas particulate filters will increase our sales opportunity by a factor of 3-to-4 per vehicle.
·   expanding the opportunities for corning gorilla glass in the automotive market.
2016 results our sales grew in total in 2016 driven by year-over-year growth in most of our operating segments.  the first quarter was our weakest, driven by a combination of slow demand in some markets and production issues related to the implementation of new manufacturing software, which constrained our ability to manufacture product.  momentum built steadily throughout the year and our performance in the second half of 2016 was significantly improved from the first half.
net sales in the year ended december 31, 2016 were $9,390 million, an increase of $279 million, or 3%, when compared to the year ended december 31, 2015.  the increase was primarily driven by the display technologies segment and the corning pharmaceutical technologies business, up $152 million and $84 million, respectively.  the optical communications, specialty materials and life sciences segments also increased, up $25 million, $17 million and $18 million, respectively.
for the year ended december 31, 2016, we generated net income of $3.7 billion, or $3.23 per share, compared to net income of $1.3 billion, or $1.00 per share, for 2015.  when compared to last year, the $2.4 billion increase in net income was due to the following items (amounts presented after tax):
·   a $2.7 billion non-taxable gain and $105 million positive tax adjustment on the strategic realignment of our ownership interest in dow corning completed on may 31, 2016;
·   the positive change in the amounts recorded for tax law changes, valuation allowance adjustments and other discrete tax items of $104 million; and
·   a decrease of $61 million in the defined benefit pension plans mark-to-market loss, driven by higher returns on pension assets.
partially offsetting these events were the following items:
·   lower net income in the display technologies, specialty materials and life sciences segments. the largest decrease was in the display technologies segment, down $160 million, or 15%, primarily driven by lcd glass price declines which were slightly higher than 10% and a decrease of $289 million in net realized gains from our yen and won-denominated currency hedge contracts;
·   the resolution of an investigation by the u.s. department of justice and related costs in the total amount of $86 million;
·   an increase of $71 million in acquisition and transaction related costs, driven primarily by expenses associated with the strategic realignment of our ownership interest in dow corning; and
·   the increase in unrealized losses from our foreign currency translation hedges in the amount of $47 million.
the translation impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates positively affected corning's consolidated net income in the year ended december 31, 2016 in the amount of $229 million when compared to 2015, largely due to the strengthening of the japanese yen versus the u.s. dollar.  this impact was more than offset by the decrease of $283 million in the realized gain from our foreign currency translation hedges.
2017 corporate outlook in 2017, corning will continue to advance the objectives of its strategy and capital allocation framework, which sets its leadership priorities and articulates opportunities across its businesses.  in the display technologies segment, we expect the rate of growth in both retail market and glass demand to be in the mid-single digit percentage, and an overall favorable lcd glass price environment, with price declines more moderate than in 2016.  in the optical communications segment, we anticipate sales to increase by a low-teens percentage over 2016.  in the environmental technologies segment, we expect sales to be consistent to up slightly from 2016, driven by continued sales growth in the auto market, offset somewhat by lower heavy-duty volume.  we expect growth in the specialty materials segment, the amount of which will depend on the timing and extent of customers deploying gorilla glass 5 and other corning innovations.  in the life sciences segment, we expect low-single digit sales growth, ahead of forecasted market growth rates.

·   an increase of $152 million in the display technologies segment, driven by the positive impact from the strengthening of the japanese yen in the amount of $370 million and a mid-single digit percentage volume increase, offset somewhat by lcd glass price declines slightly higher than 10%;
·   an increase of $25 million in the optical communications segment, driven primarily by an increase of $76 million in sales of carrier products and the impact of a small acquisition completed in the second quarter of 2016, partially offset by production issues related to the implementation of new manufacturing software, which constrained our ability to manufacture product in the first half of 2016;
·   a decrease of $21 million in the environmental technologies segment driven by a decline of $78 million in sales of diesel products due to the weakening of the north american truck market, offset partially by an increase of $57 million in sales of light-duty substrates, driven by strength in the north american, european and chinese markets;
·   an increase of $17 million in the specialty materials segment, driven by an increase in sales of corning gorilla glass 5 and advanced optics products;
·   an increase of $18 million in the life sciences segment, driven by volume growth in europe, north america and china; and
·   an increase of $88 million in the all other segment, driven primarily by our glass tubing business acquired in the fourth quarter of 2015.
in the year ended december 31, 2016, the translation impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, primarily the japanese yen, positively affected corning's consolidated net sales in the amount of $330 million when compared to the same period in 2015.
·   a decrease of $765 million in the display technologies segment, driven by the depreciation of the japanese yen versus the u.s. dollar, which adversely impacted net sales in the amount of $446 million, and price declines in the low-teens on a percentage basis. although volume increased in the mid-single digits in percentage terms, growth was muted somewhat by weakness in demand for televisions, computer monitors and mobile computing products;
·   an increase of $328 million in the optical communications segment, driven by higher sales of enterprise network products, up $170 million, due to an acquisition completed in the first quarter of 2015 and an increase in data center products sales. sales of carrier network products also increased by $158 million driven by growth in fiber-to-the-home products in north america and the impact of two small acquisitions completed in the first quarter of 2015;
·   a decrease in the environmental technologies segment of $39 million, driven by the translation impact from movements in foreign currency exchange rates versus the u.s. dollar, primarily the euro, of $57 million and lower sales of light duty diesel products in europe, partially offset by higher volume for heavy-duty diesel and light-duty substrate products;
·   a decrease of $98 million in the specialty materials segment, driven primarily by a decline in advanced optics sales; and
·   a decrease of $41 million in the life sciences segment due to the impact of unfavorable movements in foreign exchange rates of $43 million.
in the year ended december 31, 2015, the translation impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, primarily the japanese yen and the euro, negatively affected corning's consolidated net sales in the amount of $663 million when compared to the same period in 2014.
in 2016, 2015 and 2014, sales in international markets accounted for 72%, 70% and 77%, respectively, of total net sales.
cost of sales the types of expenses included in the cost of sales line item are: raw materials consumption, including direct and indirect materials; salaries, wages and benefits; depreciation and amortization; production utilities; production-related purchasing; warehousing (including receiving and inspection); repairs and maintenance; inter-location inventory transfer costs; production and warehousing facility property insurance; rent for production facilities; and other production overhead.
gross margin in the year ended december 31, 2016, gross margin dollars increased $93 million, and gross margin as a percentage of net sales remained consistent at 40% when compared to the same period last year.  the increase in gross margin dollars was primarily driven by the positive impact from the strengthening of the japanese yen in the amount of $266 million, an increase in manufacturing efficiency and cost reductions in our display technologies and optical communications segments which added approximately $160 million, a more favorable mix of products sold in the optical communications segment and an increase in volume in the mid-single digit percentage in the display technologies segment. display technologies segment price declines slightly above 10% partially offset the increase.
in the year ended december 31, 2015, gross margin dollars and gross margin as a percentage of net sales both declined when compared to the same period in 2014, declining $399 million and 2%, respectively.  the negative impact of the depreciation of the japanese yen versus the u.s. dollar in the amount of $368 million and price declines in the display technologies segment in the low teens in percentage terms drove the decrease, but were partially offset by cost reductions and the impact of several small acquisitions in the optical communications segment, improvements in manufacturing performance in the display technologies and specialty materials segments and lower acquisition-related and restructuring costs.  additionally, our emerging innovation group and corning pharmaceutical technologies business added $26 million in gross margin dollars in 2015, reflecting the growing significance of new business development.
·   a decrease of $94 million in the loss on the mark-to-market of our defined benefit pension plans;
·   the positive impact of the change in the contingent consideration fair value adjustment of $43 million; and
·   the absence of $25 million of post-combination expenses incurred in 2015.
partially offsetting these events were:
·   an increase of $59 million in acquisition-related costs primarily related to the realignment of our equity interest in dow corning and an acquisition completed in the second quarter of 2016;
·   an increase of $49 million in litigation, regulatory and other legal costs, driven by the resolution of an investigation by the u.s. department of justice and an environmental matter in the amount of $98 million, partially offset by the gain of $56 million on the contribution of our equity interests in pcc and pce as partial settlement of the asbestos litigation; and
·   higher operating expenses in the optical communications, environmental technologies and specialty materials segments.
when compared to the same period in 2015, as a percentage of net sales, selling, general and administrative expenses decreased by 1%.
·   an increase of $133 million in our defined benefit pension plans mark-to-market loss;
·   the absence of the positive impact of a contingent consideration fair value adjustment of $249 million recorded in 2014; and
offsetting these increases somewhat were a decrease in variable compensation, lower spending in the display technologies and specialty materials segments and a decline in acquisition-related and post-combination expenses, which were higher last year due to additional costs incurred related to the acquisition of the remaining equity interests of samsung corning precision materials.
when compared to the same period in 2014, as a percentage of net sales, selling, general and administrative expenses in the year ended december 31, 2015 increased driven by lower net sales.
the types of expenses included in the selling, general and administrative expenses line item are: salaries, wages and benefits; travel; professional fees; and depreciation and amortization, utilities, and rent for administrative facilities.
research, development and engineering expenses in the year ended december 31, 2016, research, development and engineering expenses declined $27 million when compared to the same period in 2015 driven by the impact of a joint development agreement with a display technologies customer, offset partially by project development spending in the optical communications, environmental technologies and specialty materials segments.  as a percentage of net sales, research, development and engineering expenses remained consistent with the same period in 2015.
in the year ended december 31, 2015, research, development and engineering expenses decreased by $46 million when compared to the same period in 2014, driven by lower variable compensation and a decrease in the display technologies and specialty materials segments.  as a percentage of net sales, research, development and engineering expenses remained consistent with the same period in 2014.
restructuring, impairment, and other charges corning recorded restructuring, impairment, and other charges and credits in 2016 and 2014, which affect the comparability of our results for the periods presented.  additional information on restructuring and asset impairment is found in note 2 (restructuring, impairment and other charges) to the consolidated financial statements.  a description of those charges and credits follows:
2016 activity for the year ended december 31, 2016, we recorded charges of $77 million for employee related costs, asset disposals, and exit costs associated with restructuring activities with total cash expenditures of approximately $12 million.
2015 activity for the year ended december 31, 2015, we did not record significant restructuring, impairment and other charges or reversals.  cash expenditures for restructuring activities were $40 million.
2014 activity for the year ended december 31, 2014, we recorded charges of $71 million for workforce reductions, asset disposals and write-offs, and exit costs for restructuring activities with total cash expenditures of approximately $39 million.
equity in earnings of affiliated companies the following provides a summary of equity earnings of affiliated companies (in millions):
(1)   results include equity earnings for dow corning, which includes the silicones business and hemlock semiconductor business, through may 31, 2016, the date of the realignment of our ownership interest in dow corning.
on may 31, 2016, corning completed the strategic realignment of its equity investment in dow corning corporation ("dow corning") pursuant to the transaction agreement announced on december 10, 2015.  under the terms of the transaction agreement, corning exchanged with dow corning its 50% stock interest in dow corning for 100% of the stock of a newly formed entity, which holds an equity interest in hemlock semiconductor group and approximately $4.8 billion in cash.
the equity in earnings line on our income statement for the year ended december 31, 2016 reflects both the equity earnings from the silicones and polysilicones (hemlock semiconductor) businesses of dow corning from january 1, 2016 through may 31, 2016, the closing date of the transaction agreement, and seven months of equity earnings from hemlock semiconductor group.  prior to the realignment of dow corning, equity earnings from the hemlock semiconductor business were reported on the equity in earnings line in corning's income statement, net of dow corning's 35% u.s. tax.  additionally, corning reported its tax on equity earnings from dow corning on the tax provision line on its income statement at a u.s. tax provision rate of 7%.  as part of the realignment, hemlock semiconductor group was converted to a partnership.  each of the partners is responsible for the taxes on their portion of equity earnings.  therefore, post-realignment, hemlock semiconductor group's equity earnings is reported before tax on the equity in earnings line and corning's tax is reported on the tax provision line.
refer to note 7 (investments) to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.
translated earnings contracts included in the line item translated earnings contract (loss) gain, net, is the impact of foreign currency hedges which hedge our translation exposure arising from movements in the japanese yen, south korean won, euro, new taiwan dollar and chinese yuan against the u.s. dollar and its impact on our net earnings.  the following table provides detailed information on the impact of our translated earnings contract losses and gains:

income before income taxes the translation impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates positively affected corning's income before income taxes in the year ended december 31, 2016 in the amount of $304 million when compared to 2015.  this impact was partially offset by the decrease in the realized gain from our foreign currency translation hedges related to translated earnings of $452 million.
benefit (provision) for income taxes our benefit (provision) for income taxes and the related effective income tax rates were as follows (dollars in millions):
benefit (provision) for income taxes             $3         $(147)             $(1,096)
the effective income tax rate for 2016 differed from the u.s. statutory rate of 35% primarily due to the following items:
·   rate differences on income (loss) of consolidated foreign companies, including the benefit of excess foreign tax credits resulting from the inclusion of foreign earnings in u.s. income; and
·   the tax-free nature of the realignment of our equity interest in dow corning during the period, as well as the release of the deferred tax liability related to corning's tax on dow corning's undistributed earnings as of the date of the transaction.
the effective income tax rate for 2015 differed from the u.s. statutory rate of 35% primarily due to the following items:
·   rate differences on income (loss) of consolidated foreign companies, including the benefit of excess foreign tax credits resulting from the inclusion of foreign earnings in u.s. income;
·   the impact of equity in earnings of nonconsolidated affiliates reported in the financials, net of tax;
·   $63 million tax expense for unrecognized tax benefit primarily for positions taken related to net transfer pricing adjustments (offset with benefit for competent authority relief); and
·   $100 million tax benefit primarily related to change in judgment on the realizability of deferred tax assets which is partially offset with tax expense from deferred tax allowance increases.
corning continues to indefinitely reinvest substantially all of its foreign earnings, with the exception of an immaterial amount of current earnings that have very low or no tax cost associated with their repatriation.  our current analysis indicates that we have sufficient u.s. liquidity, including borrowing capacity, to fund foreseeable u.s. cash needs without requiring the repatriation of foreign cash.  one time or unusual items may impact our ability or intent to keep our foreign earnings and cash indefinitely reinvested.  as of december 31, 2016, taxes have not been provided on approximately $12.6 billion of accumulated foreign unremitted earnings that are expected to remain invested indefinitely.  while it remains impracticable to calculate the tax cost of repatriating our total unremitted foreign earnings, such cost could be material to the results of operations of corning in a particular period.
we do not expect a material change to the amount of unrecognized tax benefits in the next 12 months.
refer to note 6 (income taxes) to the consolidated financial statements for further details regarding income tax matters.
net income attributable to corning incorporated as a result of the items discussed above, net income and per share data was as follows (in millions, except per share amounts):

for the year ended december 31, 2016, comprehensive income increased by $2,995 million when compared to the same period in 2015, driven by an increase of $2,356 million in net income attributable to corning incorporated, the positive impact of the change in foreign currency translation adjustments and an increase in unamortized actuarial gains for postretirement benefit plans.
the decrease in the loss on foreign currency translation adjustments for the year ended december 31, 2016 in the amount of $486 million (after-tax) was driven by the following items:  1) the decrease in the loss on the translation of corning's consolidated subsidiaries in the amount of $398 million, largely driven by the strengthening of the japanese yen; and 2) the decrease in the loss in the translation of corning's equity method investments in the amount of $88 million, driven by the realignment of our ownership interests in dow corning.
the increase in unamortized actuarial gains for postretirement benefit plans in the amount of $120 million (after-tax) is due to the following:  1) the decrease of $65 million related to the reclassification of actuarial gains to the income statement, largely due to higher pension asset returns; 2) an increase in actuarial losses of $3 million; and 3) a decrease of $188 million in unamortized losses related to our equity companies. the significant change was driven by the release of dow corning's unamortized actuarial loss, which was included in the gain on the realignment of our ownership interests in dow corning.
for the year ended december 31, 2015, comprehensive income decreased by $286 million when compared to the same period in 2014, driven by a decrease of $1,133 million in net income attributable to corning incorporated, offset by the positive impact of the change in foreign currency translation adjustments and the increase in unamortized gains for postretirement benefit plans.
the decrease in the loss on foreign currency translation adjustments for the year ended december 31, 2015 in the amount of $483 million (after-tax) was driven by the following items:  1) the decrease in the loss in the translation of corning's consolidated subsidiaries in the amount of $334 million;  2) the decrease in the loss in the translation of corning's equity method investments in the amount of $13 million; and 3) the absence of the reclassification of a gain to net income in 2014 in the amount of $136 million related to the acquisition of samsung corning precision materials.
the increase in unamortized gains for postretirement benefit plans in the amount of $402 million (after-tax) is due to the following:  1) the increase in the reclassification to the income statement of $81 million of actuarial losses in our defined benefit pension plans, largely driven by lower investment returns; 2) a decrease in actuarial losses of $119 million; and 3) the increase in actuarial gains of $202 million from our equity affiliate dow corning.
see note 13 (employee retirement plans) and note 17 (shareholders' equity) to the consolidated financial statements for additional details.
core performance measures in managing the company and assessing our financial performance, we supplement certain measures provided by our consolidated financial statements with measures adjusted to exclude certain items, to arrive at core performance measures.  we believe reporting core performance measures provides investors greater transparency to the information used by our management team to make financial and operational decisions.  corning has adopted the use of constant currency reporting for the japanese yen and south korean won, and uses an internally derived yen-to-dollar management rate of ¥99 and won-to-dollar management rate of ₩1,100.
net sales, equity in earnings of affiliated companies and net income are adjusted to exclude the impacts of changes in the japanese yen and the south korean won, gains and losses on our translated earnings contracts, acquisition-related costs, certain discrete tax items, restructuring and restructuring-related charges, certain litigation-related expenses, pension mark-to-market adjustments and other items which do not reflect on-going operating results of the company or our equity affiliates.  management's discussion and analysis on our reportable segments has also been adjusted for these items, as appropriate.  these measures are not prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states ("gaap").  we believe investors should consider these non-gaap measures in evaluating our results as they are more indicative of our core operating performance and how management evaluates our operational results and trends.  these measures are not, and should not be viewed as a substitute for gaap reporting measures.  with respect to the company's outlooks for future periods, it is not able to provide reconciliations for these non-gaap measures because the company does not forecast the movement of the japanese yen and south korean won against the u.s. dollar, or other items that do not reflect ongoing operations, nor does it forecast items that have not yet occurred or are out of the company's control.  as a result, the company is unable to provide outlook information on a gaap basis.

in all segments except display technologies, core net sales are consistent with gaap net sales.  because a significant portion of revenues in the display technologies segment are denominated in japanese yen, this segment's net sales are adjusted to remove the impact of translating yen into dollars.  as of january 1, 2015, we use an internally derived management rate of ¥99, which is closely aligned to our current yen-denominated hedges related to translated earnings, and have recast all periods presented based on this rate in order to effectively remove the impact of changes in the japanese yen.
core net sales decreased by $90 million in the year ended december 31, 2016 when compared to the same period in 2015.  core net sales in the display technologies segment decreased by $218 million, or 6%, in the year ended december 31, 2016, driven by lcd glass price declines slightly higher than 10%, partially offset by an increase in volume of a mid-single digit percentage.
core net sales decreased by $155 million to $9.8 billion in the year ended december 31, 2015 when compared to the same period in 2014.  the decline was driven by a decrease of $318 million in the display technologies segment primarily due to price declines in the low-teens on a percentage basis.  although volume increased in the mid-single digits in percentage terms, growth was muted somewhat by weakness in demand for televisions, computer monitors and mobile computing products.
the translation impact from movements in foreign currency exchange rates in the years ended december 31, 2016 and 2015, excluding the japanese yen and south korean won, negatively affected core net sales in the amount of $39 million and $215 million, respectively, when compared to the prior years.
core equity in earnings of affiliated companies the following provides a summary of core equity in earnings of affiliated companies (in millions):
2016                             2015          2014            % change
(1)   results include equity earnings for dow corning, which includes the silicones business and hemlock semiconductor business, through may 31, 2016, the date of the realignment of our ownership interest in dow corning.
in the year ended december 31, 2016, we generated core earnings of $1,774 million, or $1.55 per share, compared to $1,882 million, or $1.40 per share, in the year ended december 31, 2015.  the decrease was due to declines in the display technologies and environmental technologies segments.  slightly offsetting the decline was higher core earnings in the optical communications segment, up $16 million, driven by higher sales volume in carrier network products, the favorable translation impact from movements in foreign currency exchange rates, excluding the japanese yen and south korean won, of $13 million and manufacturing efficiencies gained through cost reductions.
in the year ended december 31, 2015, we generated core earnings of $1,882 million, or $1.40 per share, compared to $2,023 million, or $1.42 per share in the year ended december 31, 2014.  the decrease was due to lower core earnings in the display technologies, environmental technologies, specialty materials and life sciences segments, and the unfavorable translation impact from movements in foreign currency exchange rates, excluding the japanese yen and south korean won, of $57 million.  slightly offsetting the decline is higher core earnings in the optical communications segment, up $61 million, driven by higher sales volume for both carrier network and enterprise network products, the favorable impact of several acquisitions completed this year and manufacturing efficiencies gained through cost reductions.
included in core earnings for the years ended december 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 is net periodic pension expense in the amount of $50 million, $62 million and $74 million, respectively, which excludes the annual pension mark-to-market adjustments.  in the years ended december 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, the mark-to-market adjustments were a pre-tax loss of $67 million, $165 million and $29 million, respectively.  refer to note 13 (employee retirement plans) to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.

reconciliation of non-gaap measures we utilize certain financial measures and key performance indicators that are not calculated in accordance with gaap to assess our financial and operating performance.  a non-gaap financial measure is defined as a numerical measure of a company's financial performance that (i) excludes amounts, or is subject to adjustments that have the effect of excluding amounts, that are included in the comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with gaap in the statement of income or statement of cash flows, or (ii) includes amounts, or is subject to adjustments that have the effect of including amounts, that are excluded from the comparable measure as calculated and presented in accordance with gaap in the statement of income or statement of cash flows.
core net sales, core equity in earnings of affiliated companies and core earnings are non-gaap financial measures utilized by our management to analyze financial performance without the impact of items that are driven by general economic conditions and events that do not reflect the underlying fundamentals and trends in the company's operations.

*   in the first quarter of 2015, we changed the yen-to-dollar management rate from ¥93 to ¥99 to closely align with the yen-denominated hedges entered into for the years 2015 through 2017. prior periods presented have been recast based on the new rate.
see "items excluded from gaap measures" below for the descriptions of the footnoted reconciling items.
items excluded from gaap measures items which we exclude from gaap measures to arrive at core performance measures are as follows:
(1)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    constant-currency adjustments:
constant-yen: because a significant portion of display technologies segment revenues and manufacturing costs are denominated in japanese yen, management believes it is important to understand the impact on core earnings of translating yen into dollars. presenting results on a constant-yen basis mitigates the translation impact of the japanese yen, and allows management to evaluate performance period over period, analyze underlying trends in our businesses, and establish operational goals and forecasts. as of january 1, 2015, we used an internally derived management rate of ¥99, which is closely aligned to our current yen portfolio of foreign currency hedges, and have recast all periods presented based on this rate in order to effectively remove the impact of changes in the japanese yen.
constant-won: because a significant portion of corning precision materials' costs are denominated in south korean won, management believes it is important to understand the impact on core earnings from translating won into dollars. presenting results on a constant-won basis mitigates the translation impact of the south korean won, and allows management to evaluate performance period over period, analyze underlying trends in our businesses, and establish operational goals and forecasts without the variability caused by the fluctuations caused by changes in the rate of this currency. we use an internally derived management rate of ₩1,100, which is consistent with historical prior period averages of the won.
(2)   translated earnings contract loss (gain): we have excluded the impact of the gains and losses of our translated earnings contracts for each period presented.
(3)   acquisition-related costs: these expenses include intangible amortization, inventory valuation adjustments and external acquisition-related deal costs.
(4)   discrete tax items and other tax-related adjustments: this represents the removal of discrete adjustments attributable to changes in tax law and changes in judgment about the realizability of certain deferred tax assets, as well as other non-operational tax-related adjustments, including the tax effect of transfer pricing out-of-period adjustments in 2014 and 2015.
(5)   litigation, regulatory and other legal matters: includes amounts related to the pittsburgh corning corporation (pcc) asbestos litigation, adjustments to our estimated liability for environmental-related items and other legal matters.
(6)   restructuring, impairment and other charges: this amount includes restructuring, impairment and other charges, including goodwill impairment charges and other expenses and disposal costs not classified as restructuring expense.
(7)   liquidation of subsidiary: the partial impact of non-restructuring related items due to the decision to liquidate a consolidated subsidiary that is not significant.
(8)   equity in earnings of affiliated companies: these adjustments relate to items which do not reflect expected on-going operating results of our affiliated companies, such as restructuring, impairment and other charges and settlements under "take-or-pay" contracts.
(9)   impacts from the acquisition of samsung corning precision materials: pre-acquisition gains and losses on previously held equity investment and other gains and losses related to the acquisition, including post-combination expenses, fair value adjustments to the indemnity asset related to contingent consideration and the impact of the withholding tax on a dividend from samsung corning precision materials.
(10)   post-combination expenses: post-combination expenses incurred as a result of an acquisition in the first quarter of 2015.
(11)   pension mark-to-market adjustment: mark-to-market pension gains and losses, which arise from changes in actuarial assumptions and the difference between actual and expected returns on plan assets and discount rates.
(12)   gain on realignment of equity investment: gain recorded upon the completion of the strategic realignment of our ownership interest in dow corning.
(13)   taiwan power outage: impact of the power outage that temporarily halted production at our tainan, taiwan manufacturing location in the second quarter of 2016. the impact includes asset write-offs and charges for facility repairs, offset somewhat by partial reimbursement through our insurance program.
·   environmental technologies - manufactures ceramic substrates and filters for automotive and diesel emission control applications.
·   specialty materials - manufactures products that provide more than 150 material formulations for glass, glass ceramics and fluoride crystals to meet demand for unique customer needs.
all other segments that do not meet the quantitative threshold for separate reporting have been grouped as "all other."  this group is primarily comprised of the results of corning's pharmaceutical technologies business, our non-lcd glass business, new product lines and development projects, as well as certain corporate investments such as eurokera and keraglass equity affiliates.
we prepared the financial results for our reportable segments on a basis that is consistent with the manner in which we internally disaggregate financial information to assist in making internal operating decisions.  we included the earnings of equity affiliates that are closely associated with our reportable segments in the respective segment's net income.  we have allocated certain common expenses among our reportable segments differently than we would for stand-alone financial information prepared in accordance with gaap.  our reportable segments include non-gaap measures which are not prepared in accordance with gaap.  we believe investors should consider these non-gaap measures in evaluating our results as they are more indicative of our core operating performance and how management evaluates our operational results and trends.  these measures are not, and should not be viewed as a substitute for gaap reporting measures.  for a reconciliation of non-gaap performance measures to their most directly comparable gaap financial measure, please see "reconciliation of non-gaap measures" above.  segment net income may not be consistent with measures used by other companies.  the accounting policies of our reportable segments are the same as those applied in the consolidated financial statements.

net sales in the display technologies segment increased by $--152 million, or 5%, in the year ended december 31, 2016 when compared to the same period in 2015, driven by the positive impact from the strengthening of the japanese yen in the amount of $370 million and a mid-single digit percentage volume increase driven by growth in television screen size.  this increase was partially offset by lcd glass price declines slightly higher than 10%.
·   the impact of price declines slightly higher than 10%;
·   a decrease of $289 million in the realized gain from our yen and won-denominated currency hedges; and
·   an increase of $44 million in asset write-off expenses.
the decrease in net income was partially offset by the following items:
·   an increase of $35 million in the gain on the fair value adjustment of the contingent consideration resulting from the acquisition of corning precision materials;
·   a decline in operating expenses.
the translation impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates positively impacted display technologies net income in the year ended december 31, 2016 in the amount of $213 million when compared to the same period in 2015.  this impact was more than offset by the decrease in the realized gain from our translated earnings contracts in the amount of $289 million.
when compared to the same period in 2014, the decrease in net sales of $765 million, or 20%, in the year ended december 31, 2015 was driven by price declines in the low-teens in percentage terms and the depreciation of the japanese yen versus the u.s. dollar, which adversely impacted net sales in the amount of $446 million.  sequentially, fourth quarter lcd glass price declines were the lowest sequential decline of 2015.  although volume increased in the mid-single digits in percentage terms, growth was muted somewhat by weakness in demand for televisions, computer monitors and mobile computing products.  additionally, in the third quarter of 2015, we experienced temporary share loss at one of our largest customers due to a contract dispute.  we resolved the dispute in the fourth quarter of 2015, and extended our long-term supply agreement with this customer to 2025.
·   the impact of price declines in the low-teens in percentage terms that more than offset the mid-single digit percent increase in volume;
·   a decrease of $184 million in the gain on the fair value adjustment of the contingent consideration resulting from the acquisition of corning precision materials; and
·   the absence of a gain on the settlement of an intellectual property dispute recorded in 2014 in the amount of $38 million.
the decrease in net income was partially offset by the following items:
·   improvements in manufacturing efficiency of $79 million;
·   a decline in transaction and acquisition-related costs in the amounts of $73 million and $37 million, respectively;
·   a decrease of $40 million in restructuring, impairment and other charges; and
·   a decline in operating expenses.
the translation impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates negatively impacted display technologies net income in the year ended december 31, 2015 in the amount of $233 million when compared to the same period in 2014.  this impact was partially offset by the increase in the realized gain from our translated earnings contracts in the amount of $126 million.
core performance
core net sales decreased by $218 million, or 6%, in the year ended december 31, 2016 when compared to the same period in 2015, driven by lcd glass price declines slightly higher than 10%, partially offset by a mid-single digit percentage volume increase.  core earnings also decreased in this period, down $69 million, or 6%, driven by lcd glass price declines slightly higher than 10%, partially offset by a mid-single digit percentage volume increase, improvements in manufacturing efficiency and a decline in operating expenses.
when compared to the same period in 2014, core net sales in the display technologies segment decreased by $318 million, or 8%, in the year ended december 31, 2015, driven primarily by price declines in the low-teens in percentage terms.  sequentially, lcd glass price declines in the fourth quarter remained moderate.  although volume increased in the mid-single digits in percentage terms, growth was muted somewhat by weakness in demand for televisions, computer monitors and mobile computing products.  additionally, in the third quarter of 2015, we experienced temporary share loss at one of our largest customers due to a contract dispute.  we resolved the dispute in the fourth quarter of 2015, and extended our long-term supply agreement with this customer to 2025.
core earnings in the display technologies segment in the year ended december 31, 2015 declined by $168 million, or 14%, when compared to the same period last year.  volume increases in the mid-single digits in percentage terms, lower manufacturing costs and a decline in operating expenses were more than offset by price declines in the low-teens and the absence of a gain on the settlement of an intellectual property dispute recorded in 2014 in the amount of $38 million.
other information the display technologies segment has a concentrated customer base comprised of lcd panel and color filter makers primarily located in japan, south korea, china and taiwan.  in 2016, 2015 and 2014, three customers of the display technologies segment, which individually accounted for more than 10% of segment net sales, accounted for a combined 65%, 62% and 61% of total segment sales in those years.  our near-term sales and profitability would be impacted if any of these significant customers were unable to continue to purchase our products.
corning has invested to expand capacity to meet the projected demand for lcd glass substrates.  in 2016, 2015 and 2014, capital spending in this segment was $464 million, $594 million and $492 million, respectively.
for full-year 2017, corning expects the rate of growth in both retail market and glass demand to be in the mid-single digit percentages.  in the first quarter of 2017, the company expects corning's volume to increase by mid-teen percentage year over year, and decline by mid-single digit percentage sequentially.  the company expects an overall favorable lcd glass price environment for the full year, with price declines more moderate than in 2016.

in the year ended december 31, 2016, net sales of the optical communications segment increased $25 million, or 1%, when compared to the same period in 2015, driven by an increase in carrier network sales.  the sales increase was driven by fiber-to-the-home products in north america, higher sales of optical fiber and the impact of an acquisition completed in the second quarter of 2016.  these increases were partially offset by production issues related to the implementation of new manufacturing software, which constrained our ability to manufacture product in the first half of 2016.  production returned to normal levels at the end of the second quarter.  the translation impact from movements in foreign currency exchange rates in 2016 negatively impacted optical communications net sales in the amount of $8 million, when compared to the same period in 2015.
net income in the optical communications segment increased $8 million, or 3%, in the year ended december 31, 2016 when compared to the same period in 2015.  the increase was driven by cost reductions and the continuation of the favorable shift toward sales of our solutions products, partially offset by the impact of the production issues described above, costs incurred related to a small acquisition completed in the second quarter of 2016 and restructuring and asset write-off expenses.  movements in foreign exchange rates positively impacted net income in the amount of $12 million when compared to 2015.
in the year ended december 31, 2015, net sales of the optical communications segment increased by $328 million, or 12%, when compared to the same period in 2014, driven by an increase in both carrier network and enterprise network products.  carrier networks increased by $158 million, driven by higher sales of fiber-to-the-home and cable products in north america and the impact of recent acquisitions, offset somewhat by lower sales of wireless products and fiber and cable products in europe.  sales declined in europe driven by lower volume and the negative impact of movements in the euro exchange rate versus the u.s. dollar.  enterprise network sales grew by $170 million, primarily due to the impact of an acquisition completed in 2015 and an increase in data center product sales.  the translation impact from movements in foreign currency exchange rates in 2015 negatively impacted optical communications net sales in the amount of $101 million when compared to the same period in 2014.
the increase in net income of $43 million, or 22%, was primarily driven by higher sales volume for both carrier network and enterprise network products and manufacturing efficiencies gained through cost reductions, offset somewhat by acquisition-related and post-combination expenses associated with three acquisitions completed in the first quarter of 2015.  also somewhat offsetting the increase were price declines and a small legal settlement.  the translation impact from movements in foreign currency exchange rates did not significantly impact net income of this segment in the year ended december 31, 2015 when compared to the same period in 2014.
core performance
core earnings increased $16 million, or 6%, in the year ended december 31, 2016, driven by higher sales of our solutions products and cost reductions, partially offset by the impact of the production issues described above.  movements in foreign exchange rates positively impacted core earnings in the amounts of $12 million when compared to 2015.
in the year ended december 31, 2015, core earnings increased by $61 million, or 28%, driven by higher sales volume for both carrier network and enterprise network products and manufacturing efficiencies gained through cost reductions, offset somewhat by price declines.
the optical communications segment has a concentrated customer base.  in the year ended december 31, 2016, one customer, which individually accounted for more than 10% of segment net sales, accounted for 15% of total segment net sales.  in the year ended december 31, 2015, two customers, which individually accounted for more than 10% of segment net sales, accounted for 22% of total segment net sales.  in the year ended december 31, 2014, one customer, which individually accounted for more than 10% of segment net sales, accounted for 11% of total segment net sales.

net sales in the environmental technologies segment decreased by $21 million, or 2%, in the year ended december 31, 2016 when compared to the same period in 2015, driven by a decrease of $78 million in sales of diesel products due to the weakening of the heavy-duty diesel truck market in north america, offset partially by an increase of $57 million in light-duty substrates sales, driven by strength in the north american, european and chinese markets.  net income decreased by $28 million, or 17%, driven by lower sales of heavy-duty diesel products and our investment in capacity for our gas particulate filters.  movements in foreign exchange rates versus the u.s. dollar negatively impacted net sales and net income in this segment in the amounts of $22 million and $8 million, respectively, in the year ended december 31, 2016, when compared to the same period in 2015.
in the year ended december 31, 2015, net sales of this segment decreased by $39 million, or 4%, when compared to the same period in 2014.  sales of automotive light-duty substrates declined driven almost entirely by the negative impact of movements in the euro exchange rate versus the u.s. dollar, partially offset by higher volume in north america and europe.  sales of diesel products also declined in these periods, driven by lower sales of light-duty diesel products in europe and the negative impact of the movements in the euro exchange rate, partially offset by higher volume for heavy-duty diesel.  the translation impact from movements in foreign currency exchange rates versus the u.s. dollar, primarily the euro, negatively impacted net sales in the environmental technologies segment in 2015 in the amount of $57 million when compared to the same period in 2014.
net income declined in the year ended december 31, 2015 by $17 million, or 10%, when compared to the same period in 2014, driven predominantly by lower sales, the unfavorable impact of the depreciation of the euro versus the u.s. dollar and facility expansion costs to support growth in china.  the translation impact from movements in foreign currency exchange rates versus the u.s. dollar, primarily the euro, negatively impacted net income in the environmental technologies segment in the amount of $21 million in the year ended december 31, 2015 when compared to the same period in 2014.
core performance
core earnings decreased by $25 million, or 16%, in the year ended december 31, 2016, driven by the items impacting our "as reported" results described above.
core earnings declined by $22 million, or 12%, in the year ended december 31, 2015, when compared to the same period in 2014, driven predominantly by lower sales, the unfavorable impact of the depreciation of the euro versus the u.s. dollar and facility expansion costs to support growth in china.  the translation impact from movements in foreign currency exchange rates versus the u.s. dollar, primarily the euro, negatively impacted net income in the environmental technologies segment in the amount of $21 million in the year ended december 31, 2015 when compared to the same period in 2014.
the environmental technologies segment sells to a concentrated customer base of catalyzer and emission control systems manufacturers, who then sell to automotive and diesel engine manufacturers.  although our sales are to the emission control systems manufacturers, the use of our substrates and filters is generally required by the specifications of the automotive and diesel vehicle or engine manufacturers.  for 2016, 2015 and 2014, net sales to three customers, which individually accounted for more than 10% of segment sales, accounted for 85%, 86% and 88%, respectively, of total segment sales.  while we are not aware of any significant customer credit issues with our direct customers, our near-term sales and profitability would be impacted if any individual customers were unable to continue to purchase our products.
for the first quarter of 2017, year-over-year segment sales are expected to be consistent to down slightly.  full-year 2017 sales are expected to be consistent to up slightly from last year with continued strength in the automotive market and lower demand for heavy-duty diesel products.  sales of the company's new gas particulate filters are expected to begin during the second half of 2017.

the increase in net sales of this segment in the year ended december 31, 2016 reflects the impact of an acquisition in the corning pharmaceutical technologies business completed in the fourth quarter of 2015 and an increase in sales in our emerging businesses.  the increase in the net loss of this segment was driven by asset write-offs in emerging businesses, offset slightly by the addition of the corning pharmaceutical technologies business net income.
the increase in net sales of this segment in the year ended december 31, 2015 reflects the impact of an acquisition in the corning pharmaceutical technologies business completed in the fourth quarter of 2015 and an increase in sales in our emerging businesses.  the slight increase in the net loss of this segment was driven by a goodwill impairment loss of $29 million, offset by higher net income in the pharmaceutical technologies and corning precision materials' non-lcd glass businesses.
liquidity and capital resources financing and capital structure the following items impacted corning's financing and capital structure during 2016 and 2015:
·   in the third quarter of 2016, corning's board of directors approved a $1 billion increase to our commercial paper program, raising it to $2 billion. if needed, this program is supported by our $2 billion revolving credit facility that expires in 2019. corning did not have outstanding commercial paper at december 31, 2016.
·   in the second quarter of 2015, we issued $375 million of 1.50% senior unsecured notes that mature on may 8, 2018 and $375 million of 2.90% senior unsecured notes that mature on may 15, 2022. the net proceeds of $745 million will be used for general corporate purposes. we can redeem these notes at any time, subject to certain customary terms and conditions.
common stock dividends on february 3, 2016, corning's board of directors declared a 12.5% increase in the company's quarterly common stock dividend, which increased the quarterly dividend from $0.12 to $0.135 per share of common stock, beginning with the dividend to be paid in the first quarter of 2016.  the company paid four quarterly dividends of $0.135 during the year ended december 31, 2016 and paid four quarterly dividends of $0.12 during the year ended december 31, 2015.
on february 1, 2017, corning's board of directors declared a 14.8% increase in the company's quarterly common stock dividend, which increased the quarterly dividend from $0.135 to $0.155 per share of common stock, beginning with the dividend to be paid in the first quarter of 2017.  this increase marks the sixth dividend increase since october 2011.
fixed rate cumulative convertible preferred stock, series a on january 15, 2014, corning designated a new series of its preferred stock as fixed rate cumulative convertible preferred stock, series a, par value $100 per share, and issued 1,900 shares of preferred stock at an issue price of $1 million per share, for an aggregate issue price of $1.9 billion, to samsung display in connection with the acquisition of its equity interests in samsung corning precision materials.  corning also issued to samsung display an additional 400 shares of fixed rate cumulative convertible preferred stock at closing, for an aggregate issue price of $400 million in cash.
dividends on the preferred stock are cumulative and accrue at the annual rate of 4.25% on the per share issue price of $1 million.  the dividends are payable quarterly as and when declared by the company's board of directors.  the preferred stock ranks senior to our common stock with respect to payment of dividends and rights upon liquidation.  the preferred stock is not redeemable except in the case of a certain deemed liquidation event, the occurrence of which is under the control of the company.  the preferred stock is convertible at the option of the holder and the company upon certain events, at a conversion rate of 50,000 shares of corning's common stock per one share of preferred stock, subject to certain anti-dilution provisions.  as of december 31, 2016, the preferred stock has not been converted, and none of the anti-dilution provisions have been triggered.  following the seventh anniversary of the closing of the acquisition of samsung corning precision materials, the preferred stock will be convertible, in whole or in part, at the option of the holder.  the company has the right, at its option, to cause some or all of the shares of preferred stock to be converted into common stock, if, for 25 trading days (whether or not consecutive) within any period of 40 consecutive trading days, the closing price of common stock exceeds $35 per share.  if the aforementioned right becomes exercisable before the seventh anniversary of the closing, the company must first obtain the written approval of the holders of a majority of the preferred stock before exercising its conversion right.  the preferred stock does not have any voting rights except as may be required by law.
customer deposits in december 2015, corning announced that with the support of the hefei government it will locate a gen 10.5 glass manufacturing facility in the hefei xinzhan general pilot zone in anhui province, china.  glass substrate production from the new facility is expected to support mass production of lcd panels for large-size televisions beginning in 2018.
as part of this investment, corning and a chinese customer have entered into a long-term supply agreement that commits the customer to the purchase of gen 10.5 glass substrates from the corning manufacturing facility in hefei.  this agreement stipulates that the customer will provide a non-refundable cash deposit in the amount of approximately $400 million to corning to secure rights to an amount of glass that is produced by corning over the next 10 years.  corning has collected the full amount of this deposit, adjusted for foreign exchange movements, receiving $185 million of this deposit in 2016 and $197 million in 2015.  as glass is shipped to the customer, corning will recognize revenue and issue credit memoranda to reduce the amount of the customer deposit liability, which are applied against customer receivables resulting from the sale of glass.  in 2016 and 2015, there were no credit memoranda issued.
capital spending capital spending totaled $1.1 billion in 2016, slightly below the amount spent in 2015.  spending in our display technologies and optical communications segments represented 41% and 22%, respectively.  we expect our 2017 capital expenditures to be approximately $1.5 billion, driven by expansions related to the gen 10.5 glass manufacturing facility in china, the addition of capacity to support the new gas-particulate filters business in the environmental technologies segment and investment to support general business growth in the optical communications and specialty materials segments.
cash flows summary of cash flow data (in millions):
net cash provided by operating activities                  $2,521         $2,809              $4,709
net cash provided by operating activities decreased $288 million in the year ended december 31, 2016 when compared to 2015, driven largely by a decrease in net income excluding non-cash gains, an increase in accounts receivable in the optical communications and specialty materials segments, up $81 and $70 respectively, partially offset by an increase in accounts payable and other current liabilities.  a decrease of $58 million in dividends received from equity affiliates, driven by the strategic realignment of our ownership interest in dow corning, also negatively impacted cash flow from operations.
net cash provided by investing activities increased substantially, up $4,347 million, in the year ended december 31, 2016 when compared to 2015, driven by $4,818 million in cash received upon the realignment of dow corning, a decrease of $120 million in capital expenditures and a decrease of $399 million in acquisition spending, partially offset by a decrease of $452 million in realized gains on our translated earnings contracts.
net cash used in financing activities in the year ended december 31, 2016 increased $2,703 when compared to 2015, driven by an increase of $999 million in share repurchases, the repayment of $481 million of commercial paper outstanding in 2015 and the absence of cash received from the issuance of long-term debt in the amount of $745 million in the third quarter of 2015.
net cash provided by operating activities decreased significantly in the year ended december 31, 2015, when compared to the same period last year, due to the absence of a special one-time dividend of $1,574 million received from samsung corning precision materials in the first quarter of 2014, lower net income and cash outflows from working capital movements, offset somewhat by the receipt of a $197 million customer deposit and the adjustment to net income related to gains on foreign currency hedges and other noncash operating adjustments.  cash outflows from working capital movements were largely driven by an increase in variable compensation paid in 2015 and an increase in inventory in the display technologies segment.
net cash used in investing activities decreased in the year ended december 31, 2015, when compared to the same period last year, due to net liquidations of short-term investments and an increase in realized gains on our translated earnings contracts, offset by higher capital spending and several acquisitions that were completed in 2015.
net cash used in financing activities in the year ended december 31, 2015 increased slightly when compared to the same period last year, driven by an increase in share repurchases and the absence of cash received from the issuance of preferred stock, offset by proceeds received from the issuance of long-term debt and commercial paper.
defined benefit pension plans we have defined benefit pension plans covering certain domestic and international employees.  our largest single pension plan is corning's u.s. qualified plan.  at december 31, 2016, this plan accounted for 77% of our consolidated defined benefit pension plans' projected benefit obligation and 86% of the related plans' assets.
we have historically contributed to the u.s. qualified pension plan on an annual basis in excess of the irs minimum requirements.  in 2016, we made voluntary cash contributions of $73 million to our domestic defined benefit pension plan and $16 million to our international pension plans.  in 2015, we made voluntary cash contributions of $65 million to our domestic defined benefit pension plan and $35 million to our international pension plans.  we are not subject to any mandatory contributions in 2017, and do not anticipate making voluntary cash contributions to our u.s. qualified pension plan.  we anticipate contributing up to $23 million to our international pension plans in 2017.

restructuring for the year ended december 31, 2016, we recorded charges of $77 million for employee related costs, asset disposals, and exit costs associated with some minor restructuring activities in all of the segments with total cash expenditures of approximately $12 million.
for the year ended december 31, 2015, we did not record significant restructuring, impairment and other charges or reversals.  cash expenditures for restructuring activities were $40 million.
for the year ended december 31, 2014, we recorded charges of $71 million for workforce reductions, asset disposals and write-offs, and exit costs for restructuring activities with total cash expenditures of approximately $39 million.

management assessment of liquidity we ended the fourth quarter of 2016 with approximately $5.3 billion of cash and cash equivalents.  our cash and cash equivalents are held in various locations throughout the world and are generally unrestricted.  although approximately 62% of the consolidated amount was held outside of the united states at december 31, 2016, we have sufficient u.s. liquidity, including borrowing capacity, to fund foreseeable u.s. cash needs without requiring the repatriation of foreign cash.  we utilize a variety of financing strategies to ensure that our worldwide cash is available in the locations in which it is needed.
it is our policy to manage our exposure to changes in interest rates.  to manage interest rate exposure, the company, from time to time, enters into interest rate swap agreements.  we are currently party to two interest rate swaps that are designated as fair value hedges and economically exchange a notional amount of $550 million of previously issued fixed rate long-term debt to floating rate debt.  under the terms of the swap agreements, we pay the counterparty a floating rate that is indexed to the one-month libor rate.
corning also has a commercial paper program pursuant to which we may issue short-term, unsecured commercial paper notes.  on july 20, 2016, corning's board of directors approved an increase to the allowable maximum aggregate principal amount outstanding at any time from $1 billion to $2 billion.  under this program, the company may issue the notes from time to time and will use the proceeds for general corporate purposes.  the company's $2 billion revolving credit facility is available to support obligations under the commercial paper program, if needed.  corning did not have outstanding commercial paper at december 31, 2016.
share repurchases during 2014, corning repurchased 98.1 shares for approximately $2 billion through an accelerated share repurchase agreement and open market repurchases as part of the $2 billion share repurchase program announced on october 22, 2013 and made effective concurrent with the closing of corning's acquisition of samsung corning precision materials on january 15, 2014 (the "march 2014 repurchase program").
during 2015, corning repurchased 167 million shares for approximately $3.25 billion through an accelerated share repurchase agreement and open market repurchases as part of a repurchase program authorized by corning's board of directors in december 2014 (the "december 2014 repurchase program") and repurchase programs authorized by corning's board of directors in july 2015 and october 2015 (the "2015 repurchase programs").
during 2016, corning repurchased 197.1 million shares for approximately $4.2 billion through an accelerated share repurchase agreement and open market repurchases as part of the 2015 repurchase programs.
refer to note 17 (shareholders' equity) to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.
other we complete comprehensive reviews of our significant customers and their creditworthiness by analyzing their financial strength at least annually or more frequently for customers where we have identified a measure of increased risk.  we closely monitor payments and developments which may signal possible customer credit issues.  we currently have not identified any potential material impact on our liquidity resulting from customer credit issues.
our major source of funding for 2017 and beyond will be our operating cash flow and our existing balances of cash and cash equivalents and proceeds from any issuances of debt.  we believe we have sufficient liquidity for the next several years to fund operations, share repurchase programs, acquisitions, the asbestos litigation, research and development, capital expenditures, scheduled debt repayments and dividend payments.
corning also has access to a $2 billion unsecured committed revolving credit facility.  this credit facility includes a leverage ratio financial covenant.  the required leverage ratio, which measures debt to total capital, is a maximum of 50%.  at december 31, 2016, our leverage using this measure was 18% and we are in compliance with the financial covenant.
our debt instruments contain customary event of default provisions, which allow the lenders the option of accelerating all obligations upon the occurrence of certain events.  in addition, some of our debt instruments contain a cross default provision, whereby an uncured default in excess of a specified amount on one debt obligation of the company, also would be considered a default under the terms of another debt instrument.  as of december 31, 2016, we were in compliance with all such provisions.
management is not aware of any known trends or any known demands, commitments, events or uncertainties that will result in or that are reasonably likely to result in a material increase or decrease in our liquidity.  in addition, other than items discussed, there are no known material trends, favorable or unfavorable, in our capital resources and no expected material changes in the mix and relative cost of such resources.
translated earnings contracts in the first quarter of 2013, corning executed a series of purchased collars that expired quarterly across a two-year period to hedge its translation exposure resulting from movements in the japanese yen against the u.s. dollar.  beginning in the second quarter of 2013 and continuing throughout 2015, corning entered into a series of zero cost average rate collars and average rate forwards to hedge the translation impact of japanese yen on corning's projected 2015, 2016 and 2017 net income.  additionally, in january 2016, corning extended its foreign exchange hedging program to hedge a significant portion of its projected yen exposure for the period 2018 through 2022.  in the year ended december 31, 2016, we recorded a pre-tax net loss of $459 million, and in the years ended december 31, 2015 and 2014, we recorded pre-tax net gains of $113 million and $1,406 million, respectively, related to changes in the fair value of these derivative instruments.  included in these amounts are realized gains of $207 million, $686 million and $280 million, respectively.  the gross notional value outstanding for purchased collars and average rate forwards which hedge our exposure to the japanese yen at december 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 was $14.9 billion, $8.3 billion and $9.8 billion, respectively.
we have entered into zero-cost collars and average rate forwards to hedge our translation exposure resulting from movements in the south korean won and its impact on our net earnings.  in the year ended december 31, 2016, we recorded a pre-tax net gain of $7 million, and the years ended december 31, 2015 and 2014, we recorded a pre-tax net loss of $36 million and $37 million, respectively, related to changes in the fair value of these instruments.  included in these amounts are realized losses of $7 million, $33 million and $6 million, respectively.  these instruments had a gross notional value outstanding at december 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 of $1.2 billion, $3.3 billion and $2.3 billion, respectively.
we have entered into a portfolio of zero-cost collars and average rate forwards to hedge against our euro translation exposure.  in the fourth quarter of 2016, the zero-cost collars expired.  in the years ended december 31 2016 and 2015, we recorded net pre-tax gains of $15 million and $3 million, respectively.  at december 31, 2016, the euro-denominated average rate forwards had a gross notional amount of $278 million, and at december 31, 2015, the zero-cost collars and average rate forwards had a gross notional value of $345 million.
in 2016, we entered into a portfolio of average rate forwards to hedge against our translation exposure resulting from movements in the chinese yuan and the new taiwan dollar ("twd").  these instruments begin settling in the first quarter of 2017.  in the year ended december 31 2016, we recorded a net pre-tax unrealized loss of $11 million on the yuan-denominated translation hedges.  at december 31, 2016, the yuan-denominated average rate forwards had a gross notional amount of $275 million, and the twd average rate forwards had a gross notional value of $56 million.
these purchased collars, zero-cost collars, zero cost average rate collars and average rate forwards are not designated as accounting hedges, and changes in their fair value are recorded in earnings in the translated earnings contract (loss) gain, net line of the consolidated statements of income.
off balance sheet arrangements off balance sheet arrangements are transactions, agreements, or other contractual arrangements with an unconsolidated entity for which corning has an obligation to the entity that is not recorded in our consolidated financial statements.
corning's off balance sheet arrangements include guarantee contracts.  at the time a guarantee is issued, the company is required to recognize a liability for the fair value or market value of the obligation it assumes.  in the normal course of our business, we do not routinely provide significant third-party guarantees.  generally, third-party guarantees provided by corning are limited to certain financial guarantees, including stand-by letters of credit and performance bonds, and the incurrence of contingent liabilities in the form of purchase price adjustments related to attainment of milestones.  these guarantees have various terms, and none of these guarantees are individually significant.
refer to note 14 (commitments, contingencies and guarantees) to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.
for variable interest entities, we assess the terms of our interest in each entity to determine if we are the primary beneficiary.  the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity is the party that absorbs a majority of the entity's expected losses, receives a majority of its expected residual returns, or both, as a result of holding variable interests, which are the ownership, contractual, or other pecuniary interests in an entity that change with changes in the fair value of the entity's net assets excluding variable interests.
corning has identified eleven entities that qualify as a variable interest entity.  these entities are not considered to be significant to corning's consolidated statements of position.
corning does not have retained interests in assets transferred to an unconsolidated entity that serve as credit, liquidity or market risk support to that entity.

(4)   the estimate of interest payments assumes interest is paid through the date of maturity or expiration of the related debt, based upon stated rates in the respective debt instruments.
(5)   at december 31, 2016, $48 million was included on our balance sheet related to uncertain tax positions. of this amount, we are unable to estimate when any of that amount will become payable.
(6)   purchase obligations are enforceable and legally binding obligations which primarily consist of raw material and energy-related take-or-pay contracts.
(7)   see note 7 (investments) to the consolidated financial statements for additional details.
we are required, at the time a guarantee is issued, to recognize a liability for the fair value or market value of the obligation it assumes.  in the normal course of our business, we do not routinely provide significant third-party guarantees.  generally, third-party guarantees provided by corning are limited to certain financial guarantees, including stand-by letters of credit and performance bonds, and the incurrence of contingent liabilities in the form of purchase price adjustments related to attainment of milestones.  these guarantees have various terms, and none of these guarantees are individually significant.
we believe a significant majority of these guarantees and contingent liabilities will expire without being funded.
environment corning has been named by the environmental protection agency (the agency) under the superfund act, or by state governments under similar state laws, as a potentially responsible party for 17 active hazardous waste sites.  under the superfund act, all parties who may have contributed any waste to a hazardous waste site, identified by the agency, are jointly and severally liable for the cost of cleanup unless the agency agrees otherwise.  it is corning's policy to accrue for its estimated liability related to superfund sites and other environmental liabilities related to property owned by corning based on expert analysis and continual monitoring by both internal and external consultants.  at december 31, 2016 and 2015, corning had accrued approximately $43 million (undiscounted) and $37 million (undiscounted), respectively, for its estimated liability for environmental cleanup and related litigation.  based upon the information developed to date, management believes that the accrued reserve is a reasonable estimate of the company's liability and that the risk of an additional loss in an amount materially higher than that accrued is remote.
critical accounting estimates the preparation of financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported therein.  the estimates that required us to make difficult, subjective or complex judgments, including future projections of performance and relevant discount rates, are set forth below.
impairment of assets held for use we are required to assess the recoverability of the carrying value of long-lived assets when an indicator of impairment has been identified.  we review our long-lived assets in each quarter to assess whether impairment indicators are present.  we must exercise judgment in assessing whether an event of impairment has occurred.
manufacturing equipment includes certain components of production equipment that are constructed of precious metals, primarily platinum and rhodium.  these metals are not depreciated because they have very low physical losses and are repeatedly reclaimed and reused in our manufacturing process over a very long useful life.  precious metals are reviewed for impairment as part of our assessment of long-lived assets.  this review considers all of the company's precious metals that are either in place in the production process; in reclamation, fabrication, or refinement in anticipation of re-use; or awaiting use to support increased capacity.  precious metals are only acquired to support our operations and are not held for trading or other non-manufacturing related purposes.
examples of events or circumstances that may be indicative of impairments include, but are not limited to:
·   a significant decrease in the market price of an asset;
·   a significant change in the extent or manner in which a long-lived asset is being used or in its physical condition;
·   a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate that could affect the value of the asset, including an adverse action or assessment by a regulator;
·   an accumulation of costs significantly in excess of the amount originally expected for the acquisition or construction of an asset;
·   a current-period operating or cash flow loss combined with a history of operating or cash flow losses or a projection or forecast that demonstrates continuing losses associated with the use of an asset; and
·   a current expectation that, more likely than not, an asset will be sold or otherwise disposed of significantly before the end of its previously estimated useful life.
for purposes of recognition and measurement of an impairment loss, a long-lived asset or assets is grouped with other assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities.  we must exercise judgment in assessing the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities.  for the majority of our reportable segments, we concluded that locations or businesses which share production along the supply chain must be combined in order to appropriately identify cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities.
for long-lived assets, when impairment indicators are present, we compare estimated undiscounted future cash flows, including the eventual disposition of the asset group at market value, to the assets' carrying value to determine if the asset group is recoverable.  this assessment requires the exercise of judgment in assessing the future use of and projected value to be derived from the assets to be held and used.  assessments also consider changes in asset utilization, including the temporary idling of capacity and the expected timing for placing this capacity back into production.  if there is an impairment, a loss is recorded to reflect the difference between the assets' fair value and carrying value.  this may require judgment in estimating future cash flows and relevant discount rates and residual values in estimating the current fair value of the impaired assets to be held and used.
for an asset group that fails the test of recoverability, the estimated fair value of long-lived assets is determined using an "income approach" that starts with the forecast of all the expected future net cash flows including the eventual disposition at market value of long-lived assets, and also considers the fair market value of all precious metals.  we assess the recoverability of the carrying value of long-lived assets at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities.  if there is an impairment, a loss is recorded to reflect the difference between the assets' fair value and carrying value.  our estimates are based upon our historical experience, our commercial relationships, and available external information about future trends.  we believe fair value assessments are most sensitive to market growth and the corresponding impact on volume and selling prices and that these are also more subjective than manufacturing cost and other assumptions.  the company believes its current assumptions and estimates are reasonable and appropriate.
at december 31, 2016 and december 31, 2015, the carrying value of precious metals was higher than the fair market value by $890 million and $976 million, respectively.  the majority of these precious metals are utilized by the display technologies and specialty materials segments.  corning believes these precious metal assets to be recoverable due to the significant positive cash flow in both segments.  the potential for impairment exists in the future if negative events significantly decrease the cash flow of these segments.  such events include, but are not limited to, a significant decrease in demand for products or a significant decrease in profitability in our display technologies or specialty materials segments.
impairment of goodwill we are required to make certain subjective and complex judgments in assessing whether an event of impairment of goodwill has occurred, including assumptions and estimates used to determine the fair value of our reporting units.  we test for goodwill impairment at the reporting unit level and our reporting units are the operating segments or the components of operating segments which constitute businesses for which discrete financial information is available and is regularly reviewed by segment management.
corning has recorded goodwill in the display technologies, optical communications, specialty materials, life sciences and all other operating segments.  on a quarterly basis, management performs a qualitative assessment of factors in each reporting unit within these operating segments to determine whether there have been any triggering events.  the two-step impairment test is required only if we conclude that it is more likely than not that a reporting unit's fair value is less than its carrying amount.  we perform a detailed, two-step process every three years if no indicators suggest a test should be performed in the interim.  we use this calculation as quantitative validation of the step-zero qualitative process that is performed during the intervening periods and does not represent an election to perform the two-step process in place of the step-zero review.
the following summarizes our qualitative process to assess our goodwill balances for impairment:
·   we assess qualitative factors in each of our reporting units which carry goodwill to determine whether it is necessary to perform the first step of the two-step quantitative goodwill impairment test.
·   the following events and circumstances are considered when evaluating whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount:
o   macroeconomic conditions, such as a deterioration in general economic conditions, fluctuations in foreign exchange rates and/or other developments in equity and credit markets;
o   market capital in relation to book value;
o   industry and market considerations, such as a deterioration in the environment in which an entity operates, material loss in market share and significant declines in product pricing;
o   cost factors, such as an increase in raw materials, labor or other costs;
o   overall financial performance, such as negative or declining cash flows or a decline in actual or forecasted revenue;
o   other relevant entity-specific events, such as material changes in management or key personnel; and
o   events affecting a reporting unit, such as a change in the composition or carrying amount of its net assets including acquisitions and dispositions.
the examples noted above are not all-inclusive, and the company will consider other relevant events and circumstances that affect the fair value of a reporting unit in determining whether to perform the first step of the goodwill impairment test.
our two-step goodwill recoverability assessment is based on our annual strategic planning process.  this process includes an extensive review of expectations for the long-term growth of our businesses and forecasted future cash flows.  our valuation method is an "income approach" using a discounted cash flow model in which cash flows anticipated over several periods, plus a terminal value at the end of that time horizon, are discounted to their present value using an appropriate rate of return.  our estimates are based upon our historical experience, our current knowledge from our commercial relationships, and available external information about future trends.
display technologies goodwill for the display technologies segment is tested at the reporting unit level, which is also the operating segment level consisting of two components.  for the purposes of the annual goodwill impairment assessment, we have aggregated these two components into one reporting unit based upon their similar economic characteristics.  on a quarterly basis in 2016, management performed a qualitative assessment of factors and determined there had not been any triggering events which would indicate that the display technologies reporting unit's fair value is less than its carrying amount.
in addition to assessing qualitative factors each quarter, we performed a quantitative goodwill recoverability test in 2015 for this reporting unit.  a discount rate of 5.8% and a growth rate of 1% were used in 2015.  the results of our impairment test indicated that the fair value of the reporting unit exceeded its book value by a significant amount, and as such, further goodwill impairment testing was not necessary.  we determined a range of discount rates between 3.8% and 7.8% and growth rates between 0% and 3% would not have affected our conclusion.
optical communications goodwill for the optical communications segment is tested at the reporting unit level, which is also the operating segment level consisting of two components.  for the purposes of the annual goodwill impairment assessment, we have aggregated these two components into one reporting unit based upon their similar economic characteristics.  on a quarterly basis in 2016, management performed a qualitative assessment of factors and determined there had not been any triggering events which would indicate that the optical communications reporting unit's fair value is less than its carrying amount.
in addition to assessing qualitative factors each quarter, we performed a quantitative goodwill recoverability test in 2015 for this reporting unit.  a discount rate of 5.6% and a growth rate of 3% were used in 2015.  the results of our impairment test indicated that the fair value of the reporting unit exceeded its book value by a significant amount, and as such, further goodwill impairment testing was not necessary.  we determined a range of discount rates between 3.6% and 7.6% and growth rates between 0% and 3% would not have affected our conclusion.
specialty materials goodwill for the specialty materials segment is tested at the reporting unit level, which is one level below an operating segment, as the goodwill is the result of transactions associated with a certain business within this operating segment.  on a quarterly basis in 2016, management performed a qualitative assessment of factors and determined there had not been any triggering events which would indicate that the specialty materials reporting unit's fair value is less than its carrying amount.
in addition to assessing qualitative factors each quarter, we performed a quantitative goodwill recoverability test in 2015 for this reporting unit.  a discount rate of 5.8% and a growth rate of 3% were used in 2015.  the results of our impairment test indicated that the fair value of the reporting unit exceeded its book value by a significant amount, and as such, further goodwill impairment testing was not necessary.  we determined a range of discount rates between 3.8% and 7.8% and growth rates between 0% and 3% would not have affected our conclusion.
life sciences goodwill for the life sciences segment is tested at the reporting unit level, which is also the operating segment level.  on a quarterly basis in 2016, management performed a qualitative assessment of factors and determined there had not been any triggering events which would indicate that the life sciences reporting unit's fair value is less than its carrying amount.
in addition to assessing qualitative factors each quarter, we performed a quantitative goodwill recoverability test in 2015 for this reporting unit.  a discount rate of 6% and a growth rate of 3% were used in 2015.  the results of our impairment test indicated that the fair value of the reporting unit exceeded its book value by a significant amount, and as such, further goodwill impairment testing was not necessary.  we determined a range of discount rates between 4% and 8% and growth rates between 0% and 3% would not have affected our conclusion.
all other all other segment is comprised of various operating segments and corporate investments that do not meet the quantitative threshold for separate reporting.  goodwill for the all other segment is tested at the reporting unit level, which is also the operating segment level.  for the purposes of the annual goodwill impairment assessment, we have identified two reporting units in this segment that require an assessment of their goodwill.  on a quarterly basis in 2016, management performed a qualitative assessment of factors and determined there had not been any triggering events which would indicate that the reporting units' fair value is less than the carrying amount.
in addition to assessing qualitative factors each quarter, we performed a quantitative goodwill recoverability test in 2015 for this reporting unit.  a discount rate of 7.4% and a growth rate of 3% were used in 2015.  the results of our impairment test indicated that the book value of one of the reporting units exceeded its fair value by 80%.  we determined a range of discount rates between 5.4% and 9.4% and growth rates between 0% and 3% would not have affected our conclusion.  corning concluded that a step 2 analysis was required to measure the impairment loss for this reporting unit.
our step 2 test consisted of identifying the underlying net assets in the reporting unit, allocating the implied purchase price to the asset and liabilities of the reporting unit and the calculation of the implied fair value of goodwill and the resulting impairment loss.  in december 2015, we recorded a goodwill impairment loss of $29 million related to this reporting unit.
restructuring charges and impairments resulting from restructuring actions we are required to assess whether and when a restructuring event has occurred and in which periods charges related to such events should be recognized.  we must estimate costs of plans to restructure including, for example, employee termination costs.  restructuring charges require us to exercise judgment about the expected future of our businesses, of portions thereof, their profitability, cash flows and in certain instances eventual outcome.  the judgment involved can be difficult, subjective and complex in a number of areas, including assumptions and estimates used in estimating the future profitability and cash flows of our businesses.
restructuring events often give rise to decisions to dispose of or abandon certain assets or asset groups which, as a result, require impairment.  we are required to carry assets to be sold or abandoned at the lower of cost or fair value.  we must exercise judgment in assessing the fair value of the assets to be sold or abandoned.
income taxes we are required to exercise judgment about our future results in assessing the realizability of our deferred tax assets.  inherent in this estimation process is the requirement for us to estimate future book and taxable income and possible tax planning strategies.  these estimates require us to exercise judgment about our future results, the prudence and feasibility of possible tax planning strategies, and the economic environments in which we do business.  it is possible that actual results will differ from assumptions and require adjustments to allowances.
corning accounts for uncertain tax positions in accordance with fasb asc topic 740, income taxes.  as required under fasb asc topic 740, we only record tax benefits for technical positions that we believe have a greater than 50% likelihood of being sustained on their technical merits and then only to the extent of the amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon settlement.  in estimating these amounts, we must exercise judgment around factors such as the weighting of the tax law in our favor, the willingness of a tax authority to aggressively pursue a particular position, or alternatively, consider a negotiated compromise, and our willingness to dispute a tax authorities assertion to the level of appeal we believe is required to sustain our position.  as a result, it is possible that our estimate of the benefits we will realize for uncertain tax positions may change when we become aware of new information affecting these judgments and estimates.
equity method investments on may 31, 2016, corning completed the strategic realignment of its equity investment in dow corning pursuant to the transaction agreement announced on december 10, 2015.  under the terms of the transaction agreement, corning exchanged with dow corning its 50% stock interest in dow corning for 100% of the stock of a newly formed entity, which holds an equity interest in hemlock semiconductor group and approximately $4.8 billion in cash.
the equity in earnings line on our income statement for the year ended december 31, 2016 reflects both the equity earnings from the silicones and polysilicones (hemlock semiconductor) businesses of dow corning from january 1, 2016 through may 31, 2016, the closing date of the transaction agreement, and seven months of equity earnings from hemlock semiconductor group.  prior to the realignment of dow corning, equity earnings from the hemlock semiconductor business were reported on the equity in earnings line in corning's income statement, net of dow corning's 35% u.s. tax.  additionally, corning reported its tax on equity earnings from dow corning on the tax provision line on its income statement at a u.s. tax provision rate of 7%.  as part of the realignment, hemlock semiconductor group was converted to a partnership.  each of the partners is responsible for the taxes on their portion of equity earnings.  therefore, post-realignment, hemlock semiconductor group's equity earnings is reported before tax on the equity in earnings line and corning's tax is reported on the tax provision line.
at december 31, 2016 and 2015, the carrying value of our equity method investments was $269 million and $1.9 billion, respectively.  we review our equity method investments for indicators of impairment on a periodic basis or if events or circumstances change to indicate the carrying amount may be other-than-temporarily impaired.  when such indicators are present, we then perform an in-depth review for impairment.  an impairment assessment requires the exercise of judgment related to key assumptions such as forecasted revenue and profitability, forecasted tax rates, foreign currency exchange rate movements, terminal value assumptions, historical experience, our current knowledge from our commercial relationships, and available external information about future trends.  as of december 31, 2016 and 2015, we have not identified any instances where the carrying values of our equity method investments were not recoverable.
fair value measures as required, corning uses two kinds of inputs to determine the fair value of assets and liabilities: observable and unobservable.  observable inputs are based on market data or independent sources, while unobservable inputs are based on the company's own market assumptions.  once inputs have been characterized, we prioritize the inputs used to measure fair value into one of three broad levels.  characterization of fair value inputs is required for those accounting pronouncements that prescribe or permit fair value measurement.  in addition, observable market data must be used when available and the highest-and-best-use measure should be applied to non-financial assets.  corning's major categories of financial assets and liabilities required to be measured at fair value are short-term and long-term investments, certain pension asset investments and derivatives.  these categories use observable inputs only and are measured using a market approach based on quoted prices in markets considered active or in markets in which there are few transactions.
derivative assets and liabilities may include interest rate swaps and forward exchange contracts that are measured using observable quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities.  included in our forward exchange contracts are foreign currency hedges that hedge our translation exposure resulting from movements in the japanese yen, south korean won, euro, new taiwan dollar and chinese yuan.  these contracts are not designated as accounting hedges, and changes in their fair value are recorded in earnings in the translated earnings contract (loss) gain, net line of the consolidated statements of income.  in arriving at the fair value of corning's derivative assets and liabilities, we have considered the appropriate valuation and risk criteria, including such factors as credit risk of the relevant party to the transaction.  amounts related to credit risk are not material.
refer to note 16 (fair value measurements) to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.
probability of litigation outcomes we are required to make judgments about future events that are inherently uncertain.  in making determinations of likely outcomes of litigation matters, we consider the evaluation of legal counsel knowledgeable about each matter, case law, and other case-specific issues.  see part ii - item 3. legal proceedings for a discussion of the material litigation matters we face.
other possible liabilities we are required to make judgments about future events that are inherently uncertain.  in making determinations of likely outcomes of certain matters, including certain tax planning and environmental matters, these judgments require us to consider events and actions that are outside our control in determining whether probable or possible liabilities require accrual or disclosure.  it is possible that actual results will differ from assumptions and require adjustments to accruals.
pension and other postretirement employee benefits (opeb)
corning offers employee retirement plans consisting of defined benefit pension plans covering certain domestic and international employees and postretirement plans that provide health care and life insurance benefits for eligible retirees and dependents.  the costs and obligations related to these benefits reflect the company's assumptions related to general economic conditions (particularly interest rates), expected return on plan assets, rate of compensation increase for employees and health care trend rates.  the cost of providing plan benefits depends on demographic assumptions including retirements, mortality, turnover and plan participation.  while management believes that the assumptions used are appropriate, differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions may affect corning's employee pension and other postretirement obligations, and current and future expense.
costs for our defined benefit pension plans consist of two elements:  1) on-going costs recognized quarterly, which are comprised of service and interest costs, expected return on plan assets and amortization of prior service costs; and 2) mark-to-market gains and losses outside of the corridor, where the corridor is equal to 10% of the greater of the benefit obligation or the market-related value of plan assets at the beginning of the year, which are recognized annually in the fourth quarter of each year.  these gains and losses result from changes in actuarial assumptions for discount rates and the differences between actual and expected return on plan assets.  any interim remeasurements triggered by a curtailment, settlement or significant plan changes, as well as any true-up to the annual valuation, are recognized as a mark-to-market adjustment in the quarter in which such event occurs.
costs for our opeb plans consist of on-going costs recognized quarterly, and are comprised of service and interest costs, amortization of prior service costs and amortization of actuarial gains and losses.  we recognize the actuarial gains and losses resulting from changes in actuarial assumptions for discount rates as a component of stockholders' equity on our consolidated balance sheets on an annual basis and amortize them into our operating results over the average remaining service period of employees expected to receive benefits under the plans, to the extent such gains and losses are outside of the corridor.
prior to the december 31, 2015 valuation of its defined benefit pension and opeb plans, corning used the traditional, single weighted-average discount rate approach to develop the obligation, interest cost and service cost components of net periodic benefit cost for its defined benefit pension and opeb plans.  the individual spot rates from the yield curve are used in measuring the pension plan projected benefit obligation (pbo) or opeb plan accumulated postretirement benefit obligation (apbo) at the measurement date.  the benefit obligation is effectively calculated as the aggregate present value at the measurement date of each future benefit payment related to past service, with each payment discounted using a spot rate from a high-quality corporate bond yield curve that matches the duration of the benefit payment.  under corning's traditional, single weighted-average discount rate approach, a single weighted-average rate is developed from the approach described above and rounded to the nearest 25 basis points.  traditionally, the weighted-average discount rate is determined at the plan measurement date, based on the same projected future benefit payments used in developing the benefit obligation.  the traditional single weighted-average discount rate represents the constant annual rate that would be required to discount all future benefit payments related to past service from the date of expected future payment to the measurement date such that the aggregate present value equals the benefit obligation.
beginning with the december 31, 2015 valuation of its defined benefit pension and opeb plans, corning changed its methodology of determining the service and interest cost components of net periodic pension and other postretirement benefit costs to a more granular approach.  under the new approach, the cash flows from each applicable pension and opeb plan are used to directly calculate the benefit obligation, service cost and interest cost using the spot rates from the applicable yield curve.
moving to a more granular approach has a limited impact on the determination of the respective benefit obligations.  the only impacts are as a result of the elimination of the rounding of the discount rate that occurred in the traditional approach and the use of specific cash flows for corning's non-qualified pension plans, while separately applying the yield curve to each separate opeb plan instead of aggregating the opeb plan cash flows.  this change will result in a decrease in the interest cost and service cost components of net periodic pension and opeb costs.  for the year ended december 31, 2017, net periodic pension and opeb costs will be lower by approximately $23 million and $5 million, respectively, due to this change.  for corning's pension plans, this change will increase the immediate recognition of actuarial losses (or decrease the immediate recognition of actuarial gains), due to corning's previous election to immediately recognize actuarial gains and losses outside of the corridor.  for corning's opeb plans, this change will increase the accumulated other comprehensive income (aoci) account balance due to the accumulation of lower actuarial gains or higher actuarial losses.  over time, the amortization of the actuarial losses from aoci will begin to reduce the savings from the lower interest cost and service cost.
this change was a change in accounting estimate and therefore was applied prospectively beginning with the measurement date of december 31, 2015.  no restatement of prior periods is required.
as of december 31, 2016, the projected benefit obligation (pbo) for u.s. pension plans was $3,289 million.
the following information illustrates the sensitivity to a change in certain assumptions for u.s. pension plans:
change in assumption                    effect on 2017       effect on pre-tax pension   december 31, 2016
25 basis point increase in expected return on assets   - 7 million the above sensitivities reflect the impact of changing one assumption at a time.  note that economic factors and conditions often affect multiple assumptions simultaneously and the effects of changes in key assumptions are not necessarily linear.  these changes in assumptions would have no effect on corning's funding requirements.
in addition, at december 31, 2016, a 25 basis point decrease in each spot rate would decrease stockholders' equity by $117 million before tax, and a 25 basis point increase in each spot rate would increase stockholders' equity by $111 million.  in addition, the impact of greater than a 25 basis point decrease in each spot rate would not be proportional to the first 25 basis point decrease in each spot rate.
the following table illustrates the sensitivity to a change in each spot rate assumption related to corning's u.s. opeb plans:
change in assumption             effect on 2017       effect on pre-tax opeb    december 31, 2016
*   accumulated postretirement benefit obligation (apbo).
the above sensitivities reflect the impact of changing one assumption at a time.  note that economic factors and conditions often affect multiple assumptions simultaneously and the effects of changes in key assumptions are not necessarily linear.
revenue recognition the company recognizes revenue when it is realized or realizable and earned.  in certain instances, revenue recognition is based on estimates of fair value of deliverables as well as estimates of product returns, allowances, discounts, and other factors.  these estimates are supported by historical data.  corning also has contractual arrangements with certain customers in which we recognize revenue on a completed contract basis.  revenues under the completed-contract method are recognized upon substantial completion, defined as acceptance by the customer and compliance with performance specifications as agreed upon in the contract, which in certain instances require estimates and judgments in determining the timing of substantial completion of the contract.  while management believes that the estimates used are appropriate, differences in actual experience or changes in estimates may affect corning's future results.
share-based compensation share-based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense over the requisite service period.  determining the fair value of stock-based awards at the grant date requires judgment, including estimating expected dividends.  in addition, judgment is also required in estimating the amount of share-based awards that are expected to be forfeited.  if actual results differ significantly from these estimates, share-based compensation expense and our results of operations could be impacted.
new accounting standards refer to note 1 (summary of significant accounting policies) to the consolidated financial statements.
forward-looking statements the statements in this annual report on form 10-k, in reports subsequently filed by corning with the securities and exchange commission (sec) on form 10-q and form 8-k, and related comments by management that are not historical facts or information and contain words such as "will," "believe," "anticipate," "expect," "intend," "plan," "seek," "see," "would," and "target" and similar expressions are forward-looking statements.  such statements relate to future events that by their nature address matters that are, to different degrees, uncertain.  these forward-looking statements relate to, among other things, the company's future operating performance, the company's share of new and existing markets, the company's revenue and earnings growth rates, the company's ability to innovate and commercialize new products, and the company's implementation of cost-reduction initiatives and measures to improve pricing, including the optimization of the company's manufacturing capacity.
although the company believes that these forward-looking statements are based upon reasonable assumptions regarding, among other things, current estimates and forecasts, general economic conditions, its knowledge of its business, and key performance indicators that impact the company, actual results could differ materially.  the company does not undertake to update forward-looking statements.  some of the risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in or implied by the forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to:

item 7: management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the following overview is a high-level discussion of our operating results, as well as some of the trends and drivers that affect our business. management believes that an understanding of these trends and drivers provides important context for our results for the fiscal year ended march 31, 2017, as well as our future prospects. this summary is not intended to be exhaustive, nor is it intended to be a substitute for the detailed discussion and analysis provided elsewhere in this form 10-k, including in the "business" section and the "risk factors" above, the remainder of this "management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ("md&a")", and the consolidated financial statements and related notes.
about electronic arts we are a global leader in digital interactive entertainment. we develop, market, publish and distribute games content and services that can be played by consumers on a variety of platforms, which include game consoles, pcs, mobile phones and tablets. in our games, we use established brands that we either wholly own (such as battlefield, mass effect, need for speed, the sims and plants v. zombies), or license from others (such as fifa, madden nfl and star wars). we also publish and distribute games developed by third parties (e.g., titanfall).
financial results our key financial results for our fiscal year ended march 31, 2017 were as follows:
•   digital revenue was $2,874 million, up 19 percent year-over-year. digital revenue comprised 59 percent of total net revenue.
•   operating expenses were $2,323 million, up 8 percent year-over-year. on a constant currency basis, we estimate that total operating expenses would have been $2,349 million, up 10 percent year over year.
•   operating income was $1,224 million, up 36 percent year-over-year.
•   net income was $967 million, down 16 percent year-over-year. the decrease was primarily attributable to the $453 million income tax benefit in fiscal year 2016 related to the reversal of a significant portion of our deferred tax valuation allowance.
•   operating cash flow was $1,383 million, up 13 percent year-over-year.
from time to time, we make comparisons of current periods to prior periods with reference to constant currency. constant currency comparisons are based on translating local currency amounts in the current period at actual foreign exchange rates from the prior comparable period. we evaluate our financial performance on a constant currency basis in order to facilitate period-to-period comparisons without regard to the impact of changing foreign currency exchange rates.
trends in our business digital business. players increasingly purchase our games digitally and engage with the live services associated with our portfolio of games. for example, the ultimate team mode incorporated into iterations of our fifa, madden nfl and nhl franchises and live services available digitally for our star wars, battlefield and sims franchises have extended the life of those games by engaging players for longer periods of time. our digital transformation is also creating opportunities in platforms, content models and modalities of play. for example, we have leveraged franchises typically associated with consoles and traditional pc gaming, such as fifa, madden nfl, the sims, simcity and star wars, to create mobile and pc free-to-download games that are monetized through a business model in which we sell incremental content and/or features in discrete transactions. we also provide our ea access service on xbox one and origin access service on pc which offer players access to a selection of ea games and other benefits for a monthly or annual fee.
our digital transformation also gives us the opportunity to strengthen our player network. we are investing in a technology foundation to enable us to build personalized player relationships that can last for years instead of days or weeks by connecting our players to us and to each other. this connection allows us to market and deliver content and services for popular franchises like fifa, battlefield and star wars to our players more efficiently. that same foundation also enables new player-centric ways to discover and try new experiences, such as our subscription-based ea access and origin access services.
we significantly increased our digital net revenue from $2,199 million in fiscal year 2015 to $2,409 million in fiscal year 2016 and $2,874 million during fiscal year 2017. we expect this portion of our business to continue to grow through fiscal year 2018 and beyond as we continue to focus on developing and monetizing products and services that can be delivered digitally.
foreign currency exchange rates. international sales are a fundamental part of our business, and the strengthening of the u.s. dollar (particularly relative to the euro, british pound sterling, australian dollar, chinese yuan and south korean won) has a negative impact on our reported international net revenue, but a positive impact on our reported international operating expenses (particularly the swedish krona and canadian dollar) because these amounts are translated at lower rates as compared to periods in which the u.s. dollar is weaker. volatility in exchange rates remains elevated as compared to historical standards, and macroeconomic factors such as events related to the united kingdom's vote to leave the european union inject uncertainty. while we use foreign currency hedging contracts to mitigate some foreign currency exchange risk, these activities are limited in the protection that they provide us and can themselves result in losses.
mobile and pc free-to-download games. the global adoption of mobile devices and a business model for those devices that allows consumers to try new games with no up-front cost and pay for additional content or in-game items, has led to significant growth in the mobile gaming industry. we expect this growth to continue during our 2018 fiscal year. likewise, the wide consumer acceptance of free-to-download, microtransaction-based pc games played over the internet has broadened our consumer base. we expect revenue generated from mobile and pc free-to-download games to remain an important part of our business.
concentration of sales among the most popular games. in all major segments of our industry, we see a large portion of games sales concentrated on the most popular titles. similarly, a significant portion of our revenue historically has been derived from games based on a few popular franchises, several of which we have released on an annual or bi-annual basis. the increased importance of live services revenue to our business has accelerated this trend. live services revenue includes digital extra content, subscriptions, advertising and other digital revenues. for example, we derive a material portion of our revenue from the ultimate team game mode included in our annualized fifa, madden nfl and nhl games.
recurring revenue sources.  our business model includes revenue that we deem recurring in nature, such as revenue from our annualized titles (such as fifa and madden nfl) and associated services, our ongoing mobile business and subscription programs. we have been able to forecast revenue from these areas of our business with greater confidence than for new offerings.  as we continue to leverage the digital transformation in our industry and incorporate new content models and modalities of play into our games, our goal is to continue to look for opportunities to expand the recurring portion of our business.
net sales.  in order to improve transparency into our business, we disclose an operating performance metric, net sales. net sales is defined as the net amount of products and services sold digitally or sold-in physically in the period.
net sales were $4.9 billion for the fiscal year ended march 31, 2017, driven by sales of fifa 17 and battlefield 1 during the fiscal year. net sales increased $376 million or 8% as compared to the fiscal year ended march 31, 2016 due primarily to stronger sales associated with our fifa franchise and first-person shooter titles on a year-over-year basis. digital net sales were $3.0 billion for the fiscal year ended march 31, 2017, an increase of $503 million or 20% as compared to the fiscal year ended march 31, 2016. the increase in digital net sales was driven by the ongoing digital transformation, as players increasingly purchase our games digitally and engage with our live services. specifically, full game downloads net sales grew $222 million or 44% year-over-year primarily from a higher percentage of full game downloads of battlefield 1 in fiscal year 2017, as compared to fiscal year 2016's first-person shooter title, star wars battlefront. in addition, extra content grew $177 million or 16% year-over-year driven by increased net sales associated with ultimate team services.
recent developments stock repurchase program. in may 2017, a special committee of our board of directors, on behalf of the full board of directors, authorized a new program to repurchase up to $1.2 billion of our common stock. this stock repurchase program expires on may 31, 2019. under this program, we may purchase stock in the open market or through privately-negotiated transactions in accordance with applicable securities laws, including pursuant to pre-arranged stock trading plans. the timing
and actual amount of the stock repurchases will depend on several factors including price, capital availability, regulatory requirements, alternative investment opportunities and other market conditions. we are not obligated to repurchase a specific number of shares under this program and it may be modified, suspended or discontinued at any time. we are actively repurchasing shares under this program.
in april 2017, we completed the stock repurchase authorization approved by our board of directors in may 2015. during fiscal year 2017, we repurchased approximately 6.5 million shares for approximately $508 million pursuant to the may 2015 repurchase program.
critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states ("u.s. gaap"). the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, contingent assets and liabilities, and revenue and expenses during the reporting periods. the policies discussed below are considered by management to be critical because they are not only important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations, but also because application and interpretation of these policies requires both management judgment and estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain and unknown. as a result, actual results may differ materially from our estimates.
revenue recognition, sales returns and allowances, and bad debt reserves we derive revenue principally from sales of interactive software games, and related content and services on game consoles, pcs, mobile phones and tablets. we evaluate revenue recognition based on the criteria set forth in fasb accounting standards codification ("asc") 605, revenue recognition and asc 985-605, software: revenue recognition. we classify our revenue as either product revenue or service and other revenue.
product revenue. our product revenue includes revenue associated with the sale of software games or related product content or updates, whether delivered digitally (e.g., full-game downloads, extra-content) or via a physical disc (e.g., packaged goods), and licensing of game software to third-parties. product revenue also includes revenue from mobile full game downloads that do not require our hosting support (e.g., premium mobile games) in order to utilize the game or related content (i.e. can be played with or without an internet connection), and sales of tangible products such as hardware, peripherals, or collectors' items.
service and other revenue. our service revenue includes revenue recognized from time-based subscriptions, games, content or updates that requires our hosting support in order to utilize the game or related content (i.e., can only be played with an internet connection). this includes (1) entitlements to content that are accessed through hosting services (e.g., microtransactions for internet-based, social network and free-to-download mobile games), (2) massively multi-player online ("mmo") games (both software game and subscription sales), (3) subscriptions for our battlefield premium, ea and origin access, and pogo-branded online game services, and (4) allocated service revenue from sales of software games with a service of online activities (e.g., online playability). our other revenue includes advertising and non-software licensing revenue.
with respect to the allocated service revenue from sales of software games with a service of online activities ("online services") mentioned above, our allocation of proceeds between product and service revenue for presentation purposes is based on management's best estimate of the selling price of the online services with the residual value allocated to product revenue. our estimate of the selling price of the online services are comprised of several factors including, but not limited to, prior selling prices for the online services, prices charged separately by other third-party vendors for similar service offerings, and a cost-plus-margin approach. we review the estimated selling price of the online services on a regular basis and use this methodology consistently to allocate revenue between product and service for software game sales with online services.
we evaluate and recognize revenue when all four of the following criteria are met:
•   evidence of an arrangement. evidence of an agreement with the customer that reflects the terms and conditions to deliver the related products or services must be present.
•   fixed or determinable fee. if a portion of the arrangement fee is not fixed or determinable, we recognize revenue as the amount becomes fixed or determinable.
•   collection is deemed probable. collection is deemed probable if we expect the customer to be able to pay amounts under the arrangement as those amounts become due. if we determine that collection is not probable as the amounts become due, we generally conclude that collection becomes probable upon cash collection.
•   delivery. for packaged goods, delivery is considered to occur when a product is shipped and the risk of loss and rewards of ownership have transferred to the customer. for digital downloads, delivery is considered to occur when the software is made available to the customer for download. for services and other, delivery is generally considered to occur as the service is delivered, which is determined based on the underlying service obligation. if there is significant uncertainty of acceptance, revenue is recognized once acceptance is reasonably assured.
online-enabled games the majority of our software games and related content have online connectivity whereby a consumer may be able to download unspecified content or updates on a when-and-if-available basis ("unspecified updates") for use with the original game software. in addition, we may also offer a service of online activities (e.g., online playability) without a separate fee. u.s. gaap requires us to account for the consumer's right to receive unspecified updates or the service of online activities for no additional fee as a "bundled" sale, or multiple-element arrangement.
we have an established historical pattern of providing unspecified updates (e.g., player roster updates to madden nfl 17) to online-enabled games and related content at no additional charge to the consumer. because we do not have vendor-specific objective evidence of fair value ("vsoe") for these unspecified updates, we are required by current u.s. gaap to recognize as revenue the entire sales price of these online-enabled games and related content over the period we expect to offer the unspecified updates to the consumer ("estimated offering period").
estimated offering period because the offering period is not an explicitly defined period, we must make an estimate of the offering period. determining the estimated offering period is inherently subjective and is subject to regular revision based on historical online usage. for example, in determining the estimated offering period for unspecified updates associated with our online-enabled games, we consider the period of time consumers are online as online connectivity is required. on an annual basis, we review consumers' online gameplay of all online-enabled games that have been released 12 to 24 months prior to the evaluation date. for example, if our evaluation date is april 1, 2016, we evaluate all online-enabled games released between april 1, 2014 and march 31, 2015. based on this population of games, for all players that register the game online within the first six months of release of the game to the general public, we compute the weighted-average number of days for each online-enabled game, based on when a player initially registers the game online to when that player last plays the game online. we then compute the weighted-average number of days for all online-enabled games by multiplying the weighted-average number of days for each online-enabled game by its relative percentage of total units sold from these online-enabled games (i.e., a game with more units sold will have a higher weighting to the overall computation than a game with fewer units sold). under a similar computation, we also consider the estimated period of time between the date a game unit is sold to a reseller and the date the reseller sells the game unit to an end consumer (i.e., time in channel). based on these two calculations we then consider the method of distribution. for example, physical software games sold at retail would have a composite offering period equal to the online gameplay plus time in channel as opposed to digitally distributed software games which are delivered immediately via digital download and thus have no concept of channel. additionally, we consider results from prior analyses, known and expected online gameplay trends, as well as disclosed service periods for competitors' games in determining the estimated offering period for future sales.
while we consistently apply this methodology, inherent assumptions used in this methodology include which online-enabled games to sample, whether to use only units that have registered online, whether to weight the number of days for each game, whether to weight the days based on the units sold of each game, determining the period of time between the date of sale to reseller and the date of sale to the consumer and assessing online gameplay trends.
we recognize revenue from the sale of online-enabled games for which we do not have vsoe for the unspecified updates on a straight-line basis, generally over an estimated nine-month period beginning in the month after shipment for physical games sold through retail and an estimated six-month period for digitally-distributed games.
because the majority of our sales are subject to a deferral period of generally six to nine months, our deferred net revenue (online-enabled games) balance is material. this balance increases from period to period by the revenue being deferred for current sales and is reduced by the recognition of revenue from prior sales that were deferred (i.e., the "net change" in the deferred balance). however, given the seasonal sales nature of our business, the net change in the deferred balance may be material from period to period. for example, because our sales have historically been highest in the fiscal third quarter, the deferred net revenue (online-enabled games) balance generally increases significantly in the third fiscal quarter. similarly, because sales have historically been lowest in the first fiscal quarter, the deferred net revenue (online-enabled games) balance generally decreases significantly in the first fiscal quarter of a fiscal year.
other multiple-element arrangements in some of our multiple-element arrangements, we sell non-software products with software and/or software-related offerings. these non-software products are generally music soundtracks, peripherals or ancillary collectors' items, such as figurines and comic books. revenue for these arrangements is allocated to each separate unit of accounting for each deliverable using the relative selling prices of each deliverable in the arrangement based on the selling price hierarchy described below. if the arrangement contains more than one software deliverable, the arrangement consideration is allocated to the software deliverables as a group and then allocated to each software deliverable.
we determine the selling price for a non-software product deliverable based on the following selling price hierarchy: vsoe (i.e., the price we charge when the non-software product is sold separately) if available, third-party evidence ("tpe") of fair value (i.e., the price charged by others for similar non-software products) if vsoe is not available, or our best estimate of selling price ("besp") if neither vsoe nor tpe is available. determining the besp is a subjective process that is based on multiple factors including, but not limited to, recent selling prices and related discounts, market conditions, customer classes, sales channels and other factors. provided the other three revenue recognition criteria other than delivery have been met, we recognize revenue upon delivery to the customer as we have no further obligations.
we must make assumptions and judgments in order to (1) determine whether and when each element is delivered, (2) determine whether vsoe exists for each undelivered element, and (3) allocate the total price among the various elements, as applicable. changes to any of these assumptions and judgments, or changes to the elements in the arrangement, could cause a material increase or decrease in the amount of revenue that we report in a particular period.
principal agent considerations we evaluate sales of our interactive software games, extra-content, and services from our subscription offerings via third party storefronts, including digital channel storefronts such as microsoft's xbox store, sony's playstation store, apple app store, and google play, in order to determine whether or not we are acting as the primary obligor in the sale to the end consumer, which we consider in determining if revenue should be reported gross or net of fees retained by the storefront. key indicators that we evaluate in determining gross versus net treatment include but are not limited to the following:
•   the party responsible for delivery/fulfillment of the product or service to the end consumer
•   the party responsible for the billing, collection of fees and refunds to the end consumer
•   the storefront and terms of sale that govern the end consumer's purchase of the product or service
•   the party that sets the pricing with the end consumer and has credit risk based on evaluation of the above indicators, we have determined that generally the third party is considered the primary obligor to end consumers for the sale of our interactive software games. we therefore report revenue related to these arrangements net of the fees retained by the storefront.
sales returns and allowances and bad debt reserves we reduce revenue for estimated future returns and price protection which may occur with our distributors and retailers ("channel partners"). price protection represents our practice to provide our channel partners with a credit allowance to lower their wholesale price on a particular product that they have not resold to end consumers. the amount of the price protection is generally the difference between the old wholesale price and the new reduced wholesale price. in certain countries for our pc and console packaged goods software products, we also have a practice of allowing channel partners to return older software products in the channel in exchange for a credit allowance. as a general practice, we do not give cash refunds.
when evaluating the adequacy of sales returns and price protection allowances, we analyze the following: historical credit allowances, current sell-through of our channel partners' inventory of our software products, current trends in retail and the video game industry, changes in customer demand, acceptance of our software products, and other related factors. in addition, we monitor the volume of sales to our channel partners and their inventories, as substantial overstocking in the distribution channel could result in high returns or higher price protection in subsequent periods.
in the future, actual returns and price protections may materially exceed our estimates as unsold software products in the distribution channels are exposed to rapid changes in consumer preferences, market conditions or technological obsolescence due to new platforms, product updates or competing software products. while we believe we can make reliable estimates regarding these matters, these estimates are inherently subjective. accordingly, if our estimates change, our returns and price protection allowances would change and would impact the total net revenue, accounts receivable and deferred net revenue that we report.
we determine our allowance for doubtful accounts by evaluating the following: customer creditworthiness, current economic trends, historical experience, age of current accounts receivable balances, and changes in financial condition or payment terms of our customers. significant management judgment is required to estimate our allowance for doubtful accounts in any accounting period. the amount and timing of our bad debt expense and cash collection could change significantly as a result of a change in any of the evaluation factors mentioned above.
royalties and licenses our royalty expenses consist of payments to (1) content licensors, (2) independent software developers, and (3) co-publishing and distribution affiliates. license royalties consist of payments made to celebrities, professional sports organizations, movie studios and other organizations for our use of their trademarks, copyrights, personal publicity rights, content and/or other intellectual property. royalty payments to independent software developers are payments for the development of intellectual property related to our games. co-publishing and distribution royalties are payments made to third parties for the delivery of products.
royalty-based obligations with content licensors and distribution affiliates are either paid in advance and capitalized as prepaid royalties or are accrued as incurred and subsequently paid. these royalty-based obligations are generally expensed to cost of revenue generally at the greater of the contractual rate or an effective royalty rate based on the total projected net revenue for contracts with guaranteed minimums. significant judgment is required to estimate the effective royalty rate for a particular contract. because the computation of effective royalty rates requires us to project future revenue, it is inherently subjective as our future revenue projections must anticipate a number of factors, including (1) the total number of titles subject to the contract, (2) the timing of the release of these titles, (3) the number of software units and amount of extra content that we expect to sell, which can be impacted by a number of variables, including product quality, number of platforms we release on, the timing of the title's release and competition, and (4) future pricing. determining the effective royalty rate for our titles is particularly challenging due to the inherent difficulty in predicting the popularity of entertainment products. furthermore, if we conclude that we are unable to make a reasonably reliable forecast of projected net revenue, we recognize royalty expense at the greater of contract rate or on a straight-line basis over the term of the contract. accordingly, if our future revenue projections change, our effective royalty rates would change, which could impact the amount and timing of royalty expense we recognize.
prepayments made to thinly capitalized independent software developers and co-publishing affiliates are generally made in connection with the development of a particular product, and therefore, we are generally subject to development risk prior to the release of the product. accordingly, payments that are due prior to completion of a product are generally expensed to research and development over the development period as the services are incurred. payments due after completion of the product (primarily royalty-based in nature) are generally expensed as cost of revenue.
our contracts with some licensors include minimum guaranteed royalty payments, which are initially recorded as an asset and as a liability at the contractual amount when no performance remains with the licensor. when performance remains with the licensor, we record guarantee payments as an asset when actually paid and as a liability when incurred, rather than recording the asset and liability upon execution of the contract.
each quarter, we also evaluate the expected future realization of our royalty-based assets, as well as any unrecognized minimum commitments not yet paid to determine amounts we deem unlikely to be realized through product and service sales. any impairments or losses determined before the launch of a product are generally charged to research and development expense. impairments or losses determined post-launch are charged to cost of revenue. we evaluate long-lived royalty-based assets for impairment using undiscounted cash flows when impairment indicators exist. if impairment exists, then the assets are
written down to fair value. unrecognized minimum royalty-based commitments are accounted for as executory contracts, and therefore, any losses on these commitments are recognized when the underlying intellectual property is abandoned (i.e., cease use) or the contractual rights to use the intellectual property are terminated.
income taxes we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for both (1) the expected impact of differences between the financial statement amount and the tax basis of assets and liabilities and (2) the expected future tax benefit to be derived from tax losses and tax credit carryforwards. we record a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets when it is considered more likely than not that all or a portion of our deferred tax assets will not be realized. in making this determination, we are required to give significant weight to evidence that can be objectively verified.
in addition to considering forecasts of future taxable income, we are also required to evaluate and quantify other possible sources of taxable income in order to assess the realization of our deferred tax assets, namely the reversal of existing deferred tax liabilities, the carryback of losses and credits as allowed under current tax law, and the implementation of tax planning strategies. evaluating and quantifying these amounts involves significant judgments. each source of income must be evaluated based on all positive and negative evidence; this evaluation involves assumptions about future activity.
in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2016, we realized significant u.s. pre-tax income for both the fourth quarter and the fiscal year ended march 31, 2016. as a result, we released the valuation allowance against all of the u.s. federal deferred tax assets and a portion of the u.s. state deferred tax assets during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2016. we continue to maintain a valuation allowance related to specific u.s. state deferred tax assets and foreign capital loss carryovers, due to uncertainty about the future realization of these assets.
prior to the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2016, we considered all undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries to be indefinitely reinvested outside of the united states and, accordingly, no u.s. taxes had been provided thereon. during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2016, we reevaluated our intent to indefinitely reinvest all earnings of foreign subsidiary companies, and concluded that a portion of earnings of certain subsidiaries will no longer be considered to be indefinitely reinvested. we currently intend to continue to indefinitely reinvest a substantial majority of the undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries outside of the united states. in the ordinary course of our business, there are many transactions and calculations where the tax law and ultimate tax determination is uncertain. as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements, we are required to estimate our income taxes in each jurisdiction in which we operate prior to the completion and filing of tax returns for such periods. this process requires estimating both our geographic mix of income and our uncertain tax positions in each jurisdiction where we operate. these estimates involve complex issues and require us to make judgments about the likely application of the tax law to our situation, as well as with respect to other matters, such as anticipating the positions that we will take on tax returns prior to our preparing the returns and the outcomes of disputes with tax authorities. the ultimate resolution of these issues may take extended periods of time due to examinations by tax authorities and statutes of limitations. in addition, changes in our business, including acquisitions, changes in our international corporate structure, changes in the geographic location of business functions or assets, changes in the geographic mix and amount of income, as well as changes in our agreements with tax authorities, valuation allowances, applicable accounting rules, applicable tax laws and regulations, rulings and interpretations thereof, developments in tax audit and other matters, and variations in the estimated and actual level of annual pre-tax income can affect the overall effective tax rate.
recent proposals to lower the u.s. corporate income tax rate would require us to reduce our net deferred tax assets upon enactment of new tax legislation, with a corresponding, one-time, non-cash increase in income tax expense.
results of operations our fiscal year is reported on a 52- or 53-week period that ends on the saturday nearest march 31. our results of operations for the fiscal year ended march 31, 2017 and 2015 contained 52 weeks each and ended on april 1, 2017 and march 28, 2015, respectively. our results of operations for the fiscal year ended march 31, 2016 contained 53 weeks and ended on april 2, 2016. for simplicity of disclosure, all fiscal periods are referred to as ending on a calendar month end.
net revenue net revenue consists of sales generated from (1) video games sold as digital downloads or as packaged goods and designed for play on game consoles and pcs, (2) video games for mobile phones and tablets, (3) separate software products and extra-content and online game services associated with these products, (4) licensing our game software to third parties, (5) allowing other companies to manufacture and sell our products in conjunction with other products, and (6) advertisements on our online web pages and in our games. we recognize revenue from the sale of online-enabled games for which we do not have vsoe for the unspecified updates on a straight-line basis, generally over an estimated six-month period for digitally-delivered games and content and an estimated nine-month period beginning in the month after shipment for physical games sold through retail.
we provide two different measures of our net revenue. (1) net revenue by product revenue and service and other revenue, and (2) net revenue by composition, which is primarily based on method of distribution. management places a greater emphasis and focus on assessing our business through a review of the net revenue by composition (digital, and packaged goods and other) than by net revenue by product revenue and service and other revenue.
comparison of fiscal year 2017 to fiscal year 2016
net revenue for fiscal year 2017, net revenue was $4,845 million and increased $449 million, or 10 percent, as compared to fiscal year 2016. this increase was driven by an $809 million increase in revenue primarily from the star wars, battlefield, and fifa franchises. this increase was partially offset by a $360 million decrease in revenue primarily from the dragon age, the sims, and nhl franchises, and the simpsons tapped out.
net revenue by product revenue and service and other revenue our net revenue by product revenue and service and other revenue for fiscal years 2017 and 2016 was as follows (in millions):
2017                                2016                        $ change          % change net revenue:

product revenue for fiscal year 2017, product net revenue was $2,640 million, primarily driven by fifa 17, battlefield 1, and star wars battlefront. product net revenue increased $143 million, or 6 percent, as compared to fiscal year 2016. this increase was driven by a $526 million increase primarily from the battlefield and star wars franchises, and titanfall 2. this increase was partially offset by a $383 million decrease primarily from the dragon age, fifa, the sims, and need for speed franchises.
service and other revenue for fiscal year 2017, service and other net revenue was $2,205 million, primarily driven by fifa ultimate team, star wars: galaxy of heroes, and need for speed 2015. service and other net revenue for fiscal year 2017 increased $306 million, or 16 percent, as compared to fiscal year 2016. this increase was driven by a $404 million increase primarily from fifa ultimate team and the star wars and need for speed franchises. this increase was partially offset by a $98 million decrease primarily from the simpsons tapped out, titanfall, the sims freeplay, and battlefield 4 premium.
supplemental net revenue by composition as we continue to evolve our business and more of our products are delivered to consumers digitally, we place a greater emphasis and focus on assessing our business performance through a review of net revenue by composition.

cost of product revenue cost of product revenue consists of (1) manufacturing royalties, net of volume discounts and other vendor reimbursements, (2) certain royalty expenses for celebrities, professional sports leagues, movie studios and other organizations, and independent software developers, (3) inventory costs, (4) expenses for defective products, (5) write-offs of post launch prepaid royalty costs and losses on previously unrecognized licensed intellectual property commitments, (6) amortization of certain intangible assets,
(7) personnel-related costs, and (8) warehousing and distribution costs. we generally recognize volume discounts when they are earned from the manufacturer (typically in connection with the achievement of unit-based milestones); whereas other vendor reimbursements are generally recognized as the related revenue is recognized.
cost of product revenue decreased by $45 million, or 4.8 percent in fiscal year 2017, as compared to fiscal year 2016. this decrease was driven primarily by a reduction in licensing costs as a result of a change in mix of our titles (i.e. star wars battlefront was a fiscal 2016 title that had royalties associated with it while battlefield 1 was a fiscal 2017 title that does not bear royalties). this was partially offset by the recognition of a $15 million impairment charge on an acquisition-related intangible asset, as well an increase in royalty costs associated with fifa 17 and titanfall 2.
cost of service and other revenue cost of service and other revenue consists primarily of (1) royalty costs, (2) data center, bandwidth and server costs associated with hosting our online games and websites, (3) inventory costs, (4) platform processing fees from operating our website-based games on third party platforms, and (5) credit card fees associated with our service revenue.
cost of service and other revenue decreased by $11 million, or 2.6 percent in fiscal year 2017, as compared to fiscal year 2016. the decrease was primarily due to a decrease in inventory costs due to the launch of need for speed 2015 during fiscal year
2016 without a comparable service game launch during fiscal year 2017, partially offset by the recognition of a $10 million impairment charge on a royalty-based asset, and an increase in royalty costs associated with fifa ultimate team and star wars: galaxy of heroes during fiscal year 2017.
total cost of revenue as a percentage of total net revenue during fiscal year 2017, total cost of revenue as a percentage of total net revenue decreased by 4.0 percent as compared to the fiscal year ended march 31, 2016. this decrease was primarily due to an increase in the proportion of our digital net revenues to packaged goods and other net revenues, as well as lower royalties expense associated with our current year title mix as compared to fiscal year 2016.
research and development research and development expenses consist of expenses incurred by our production studios for personnel-related costs, related overhead costs, contracted services, depreciation and any impairment of prepaid royalties for pre-launch products. research and development expenses for our online products include expenses incurred by our studios consisting of direct development and related overhead costs in connection with the development and production of our online games. research and development expenses also include expenses associated with our digital platform, software licenses and maintenance, and management overhead.

research and development expenses increased by $96 million, or 9 percent, in fiscal year 2017, as compared to fiscal year 2016. this $96 million increase was primarily due to a (1) $41 million increase in contracted services primarily driven by an increase in development advances to third-party developers associated with the star wars franchise, (2) an aggregate $32 million pre-launch loss on previously unrecognized minimum royalty-based commitments and impairment on royalty-based assets, and (3) a $23 million increase in personnel-related costs primarily resulting from an increase in headcount. these increases were partially offset by the quarter ended june 30, 2016 containing 13 weeks of personnel costs as compared to 14 weeks in the prior fiscal year, as well as a reduction in losses of $10 million from our cash flow hedging program in fiscal 2017 as compared to fiscal 2016. we use hedges to protect against currency exchange rate movements in our research and development expenses.
marketing and sales
marketing and sales expenses consist of personnel-related costs, related overhead costs, advertising, marketing and promotional expenses, net of qualified advertising cost reimbursements from third parties.

marketing and sales expenses increased by $51 million, or 8 percent, in fiscal year 2017, as compared to fiscal year 2016. this $51 million increase was driven by higher advertising expenses associated with our fiscal year 2017 game launches, primarily battlefield 1 and titanfall 2, as compared to advertising expenses associated with our fiscal year 2016 game launches.
general and administrative general and administrative expenses consist of personnel and related expenses of executive and administrative staff, corporate functions such as finance, legal, human resources, and information technology, related overhead costs, fees for professional services such as legal and accounting, and allowances for doubtful accounts.

general and administrative expenses increased by $33 million, or 8 percent, in fiscal year 2017, as compared to fiscal year 2016. this $33 million increase was primarily due to (1) a $12 million increase in facility-related expense primarily due to office expansions, (2) a $7 million increase in contracted services primarily due to higher legal expenses, and (3) a $6 million increase in personnel-related costs resulting from an increase in headcount.
income taxes provision for (benefit from) income taxes for fiscal years 2017 and 2016 was as follows (in millions):
our effective tax rate for fiscal year 2017 was 20.1 percent. our effective tax rate for the fiscal year 2017 differs from the statutory rate of 35.0 percent primarily due to non-u.s. profits subject to a reduced or zero tax rates. the effective tax rate for fiscal year 2017 differs from fiscal year 2016 primarily due to the reversal of a significant portion of our deferred tax valuation allowance recorded in fiscal year 2016. excluding the impact of the reversal of the valuation allowance, our effective tax rate for fiscal year 2016 would have been 19.8 percent, which differs from the statutory rate of 35.0 percent primarily due to non-u.s. profits subject to a reduced or zero tax rates.
in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2016, we realized significant u.s. pre-tax income for both the fourth quarter and the fiscal year ended march 31, 2016. as a result, we released the valuation allowance against all of the u.s. federal deferred tax assets and a portion of the u.s. state deferred tax assets during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2016. accordingly, we recorded a $453 million income tax benefit in fiscal year 2016 for the reversal of a significant portion of our deferred tax valuation allowance.
because of the release of the valuation allowance in fiscal year 2016, we do not anticipate that our effective tax rates for fiscal year 2018 and future periods will be as significantly affected by changes in our deferred tax valuation allowance as they were prior to fiscal year 2017. our effective tax rates for fiscal year 2018 and future periods will continue to depend on a variety of factors, including changes in our business such as acquisitions and intercompany transactions, changes in our international structure, changes in the geographic location of business functions or assets, changes in the geographic mix of income, changes in or termination of our agreements with tax authorities, applicable accounting rules, applicable tax laws and regulations, rulings and interpretations thereof, developments in tax audit and other matters, and variations in our annual pre-tax income or loss. with the adoption of asu 2016-09 in the first quarter of fiscal year 2018, the inclusion of excess tax benefits and deficiencies as a component of our income tax expense will increase volatility within our provision for income taxes as the amount of excess tax benefits or deficiencies from stock-based compensation awards are dependent on our stock price at the date the awards vest.
historically, we have considered all undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries to be indefinitely reinvested outside of the united states and, accordingly, no u.s. taxes have been provided thereon. during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2016, we reevaluated our intent to indefinitely reinvest all earnings of foreign subsidiary companies, and concluded that a portion of earnings of certain subsidiaries will no longer be considered to be indefinitely reinvested. we currently intend to continue to indefinitely reinvest a substantial majority of the undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries outside of the united states.

cost of service and other revenue cost of service and other revenue increased by $15 million, or 3.7 percent in fiscal year 2016, as compared to fiscal year 2015. the increase was primarily due to an increase in inventory costs due to the launch of need for speed 2015 during fiscal year 2016, partially offset by a decrease in inventory costs due to titanfall, launched for the xbox 360 during fiscal year 2015.

income taxes provision for (benefit from) income taxes for fiscal years 2016 and 2015 was as follows (in millions):
in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2016, we realized significant u.s. pre-tax income for both the fourth quarter and the fiscal year ended march 31, 2016. as a result, we released the valuation allowance against all of the u.s. federal deferred tax assets
and a portion of the u.s. state deferred tax assets during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2016. accordingly, we recorded a $453 million income tax benefit in fiscal year 2016 for the reversal of a significant portion of our deferred tax valuation allowance.
our effective tax rate for fiscal year 2016 was a tax benefit of 31.8 percent, primarily due to the reversal of the u.s. deferred tax valuation allowance. excluding the impact of the reversal of the valuation allowance, our effective tax rate for fiscal year 2016 would have been 19.8 percent, which differs from the statutory rate of 35.0 percent primarily due to non-u.s. profits subject to a reduced or zero tax rates.
our effective tax rate for the fiscal year 2015 differs from the statutory rate of 35.0 percent as a result of the utilization of u.s. deferred tax assets subject to a valuation allowance, excess tax benefit from stock-based compensation deduction allocated directly to contributed capital and non-u.s. profits subject to a reduced or zero tax rates.
prior to the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2016, we considered all undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries to be indefinitely reinvested outside of the united states and, accordingly, no u.s. taxes had been provided thereon. during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2016, we issued the senior notes and announced a $500 million stock repurchase program. in light of these future obligations, we reevaluated our intent to indefinitely reinvest all earnings of foreign subsidiary companies, and concluded that a portion of earnings of certain subsidiaries will no longer be considered to be indefinitely reinvested. as a result, we recognized a deferred tax liability of $43 million for u.s. income taxes with respect to such earnings. we currently intend to continue to indefinitely reinvest a substantial majority of the undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries outside of the united states.

changes in cash flow comparison of fiscal year 2017 to fiscal year 2016
operating activities. cash provided by operating activities increased $160 million during fiscal year 2017 as compared to fiscal year 2016. the increase is primarily driven by a $385 million increase in sales related to fifa 17, battlefield 1, and titanfall 2. this was partially offset by a $263 million decrease associated with a net increase in accounts receivable balances as of march 31, 2017 as compared to march 31, 2016 primarily due to the timing of game launches and higher digital sales during the three months ended march 31, 2017.
investing activities. cash used in investing activities increased $275 million during fiscal year 2017 as compared to fiscal year 2016 primarily driven by a $585 million increase in the purchase of short-term investments and a $30 million increase in capital expenditures. this was partially offset by a $340 million increase in proceeds from the sales and maturities of short-term investments.
financing activities. cash used in financing activities increased $228 million during fiscal year 2017 as compared to fiscal year 2016 primarily due to the of the issuance of senior notes for $989 million offset by the repurchases of our common stock for $510 million, both of which occurred during fiscal 2016. also, we had a $35 million decrease in proceeds from the exercise of
stock options and a $21 million decrease in excess tax benefit from stock-based compensation, which were offset by a $307 million decrease in repayments related to our convertible notes during fiscal year 2017 as compared to fiscal year 2016.
cash flow reclassifications. the adoption of asu 2016-09 in the first quarter of fiscal year 2018 will require two changes to our cash flow presentation. first, excess tax benefits are required to be presented as operating activities rather than financing activities. second, cash payments to taxing authorities in connection with shares withheld to meet statutory tax withholding requirements are required to be presented as a financing activity because such payments represent an entity's cash outflow to reacquire the entity's shares. we currently classify cash paid to taxing authorities for shares withheld as an operating activity. both of these changes are expected to increase our cash provided by operating activities and increase our cash used in financing activities. for more information, see part ii, item 8 of this form 10-k in the notes to consolidated financial statements in note 1 - description of business and summary of significant accounting policies to the consolidated financial statements.
comparison of fiscal year 2016 to fiscal year 2015
operating activities. cash provided by operating activities increased $156 million during fiscal year 2016 as compared to fiscal year 2015. the increase was driven by a $281 million increase in net income, partially offset by the settlement of noncurrent operating obligations.
investing activities. cash used in investing activities increased $14 million during fiscal year 2016 as compared to fiscal year 2015 primarily driven by a $230 million increase in purchases of short-term investments. this was partially offset by a $214 million increase in proceeds from the sales and maturities of short-term investments during fiscal year 2016 as compared to fiscal year 2015.
financing activities. cash used in financing activities increased $51 million during fiscal year 2016 as compared to fiscal year 2015 due to a $681 million increase in repurchases of shares of our common stock mainly driven by the repurchase program authorized in february 2016, and $470 million of repayments of our convertible notes in connection with conversions of the convertible notes prior to maturity. this was offset by (1) $989 million net proceeds from the issuance of senior notes during february 2016, (2) a $64 million increase in excess tax benefit from stock-based compensation recognized, and (3) a $47 million increase in proceeds from the exercise of stock options and espp.
short-term investments due to our mix of fixed and variable rate securities, our short-term investment portfolio is susceptible to changes in short-term interest rates. as of march 31, 2017, our short-term investments had gross unrealized losses of $3 million, or less than 1 percent of the total in short-term investments, and gross unrealized gains of less than $1 million, or less than 1 percent of the total in short-term investments. from time to time, we may liquidate some or all of our short-term investments to fund operational needs or other activities, such as capital expenditures, business acquisitions or stock repurchase programs. depending on which short-term investments we liquidate to fund these activities, we could recognize a portion, or all, of the gross unrealized gains or losses.
convertible notes and convertible note hedge in july 2011, we issued $632.5 million aggregate principal amount of 0.75% convertible senior notes due 2016 (the "convertible notes"). the convertible notes matured in july 2016. during fiscal year 2017, we repaid $163 million of the principal balance of the convertible notes and issued approximately 2.9 million shares of common stock to noteholders with a fair value of $222 million, resulting in a loss on extinguishment of $0.3 million. during fiscal year 2017, we received 2.9 million shares of our common stock under the convertible note hedge.
warrants in connection with the issuance of the convertible notes in july 2011, we also issued warrants (the "warrants") to independent third parties. the warrants had a dilutive effect with respect to our common stock to the extent that the market price per share of our common stock exceeded $41.14 on or prior to the expiration date of the warrants. the warrants expired on january 12, 2017. we issued a total of 9.6 million shares upon exercise of the warrants during fiscal year 2017.

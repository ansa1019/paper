selling, general and administrative expenses were essentially flat, primarily reflecting lower charges in 2020 for the 2019 organizational efficiency plan and resolving our affordable care act risk corridors claim against the united states federal government in the third quarter of 2020. these decreases were offset by the return of the health insurance industry tax.
key transactions and business developments organizational efficiency plan as discussed in note 15 to the consolidated financial statements, during the fourth quarter of 2021, the company approved a strategic plan to drive operational efficiencies. we believe this plan, coupled with the previously announced divestiture of the international life, accident and supplemental health benefits businesses (described below), will further leverage the company's ongoing growth to drive operational efficiency through enhancements to organizational structure and increased use of automation and shared services. in connection with these plans, cigna has updated its reporting segments to align with the new business reporting structure and recognized a charge in the fourth quarter of 2021 in the amount of $168 million, pre-tax ($119 million, after-tax). we expect to realize annualized after-tax savings of approximately $180 million. a substantial portion of the savings is expected to be realized in 2022. although a substantial portion of the actions associated with these strategic steps have been reflected in the charge recognized in the fourth quarter of 2021, additional amounts are expected to be recorded in the second quarter of 2022 as we finalize our plans following the completion of the divestiture. see note 15 for further information regarding our organizational efficiency charge.

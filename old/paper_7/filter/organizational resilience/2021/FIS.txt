as of the end of 2021, our achievement of revenue synergies from the worldpay acquisition have exceeded our targets, driven by successful cross-sell of our heritage fis solutions into heritage worldpay clients and leveraging our heritage worldpay sales and distribution teams, expanding on our existing relationships with financial institutions to establish merchant referral agreements and optimizing our network routing capabilities. we have also exceeded our original target for expense synergies, as we have successfully integrated organizational structures, reduced corporate overhead and achieved cost savings within our operating environment.

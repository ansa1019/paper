item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations.
the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto and the other financial and operating information included elsewhere in this annual report.
this discussion contains "forward-looking statements" as that term is defined in the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 and in other securities laws. see "cautionary note regarding forward-looking statements" on page iii of this annual report and "item 1a. risk factors" beginning on page 9 of this annual report.
in march 2020, the world health organization declared a novel strain of coronavirus ("covid-19") a pandemic. while we have broad geographic and customer diversification with operations in 63 countries and no single customer accounting for more than approximately 1% of revenue during the year ended december 31, 2021, covid-19 is a global pandemic impacting numerous industries and geographies. while our service operations have increased from the reductions we experienced during the first and second quarter of 2020, future service revenues remain uncertain and will be dependent on the severity of the covid-19 pandemic, including new variants of covid-19 that may emerge.
project summit in october 2019, we announced project summit, our global program designed to better position us for future growth and achievement of our strategic objectives. as of december 31, 2021, we have completed project summit. as a result of the program we have simplified our global structure, rebalanced resources to focus on higher growth areas, realigned our management structure to create a more dynamic, agile organization, made investments to enhance the customer experience and leveraged new technology solutions that enabled us to modernize our service delivery model and more efficiently utilize our fleet, labor and real estate. project summit has improved annual adjusted ebitda (as defined below) by approximately $375.0 million exiting 2021, of which approximately $160.0 million and $165.0 million were realized in 2021 and 2020, respectively, with the remainder to come in 2022.
2021                       $160 million exiting 2021               $375 million the implementation of project summit resulted in total operating expenditures ("restructuring charges") of approximately $450.0 million that primarily consisted of: (1) employee severance costs; (2) internal costs associated with the development and implementation of project summit initiatives; (3) professional fees, primarily related to third party consultants who assisted with the design and execution of various initiatives as well as project management activities and (4) system implementation and data conversion costs. the following table presents (in millions) total restructuring charges related to project summit from the inception of project summit through december 31, 2021 and for the years ended december 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019:
from the inception of project summit through december 31, 2021
we have also incurred approximately $33.8 million in capital expenditures related to project summit from the inception of project summit through december 31, 2021.
iron mountain 2021 form 10-k part ii divestments intellectual property management business on june 7, 2021, we sold our intellectual property management ("ipm") business, also known as our technology escrow services business, which we predominantly operated in the united states, for total gross consideration of approximately $215.4 million (the "ipm divestment"). as a result of the ipm divestment, we recorded a gain on sale of approximately $179.0 million to other (income) expense, net, during the year ended december 31, 2021, the substantial majority of which was recorded during the second quarter of 2021, representing the excess of the fair value of the consideration received over the sum of the carrying value of the ipm business. our ipm business represented approximately $14.2 million, $32.8 million and $33.2 million of total revenues for the years ended december 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively, and approximately $6.8 million, $16.0 million and $17.2 million of total net income for the years ended december 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
iron mountain consumer storage in march 2019, we contributed our customer contracts and certain intellectual property and other assets used by us to operate our consumer storage business in the united states and canada (the "im consumer storage assets") and approximately $20.0 million in cash (gross of certain transaction expenses) (the "cash contribution") to a strategic partnership (the "makespace jv") established by us and makespace labs, inc. ("makespace") pursuant to a transaction which closed on march 19, 2019 (the "consumer storage transaction"). upon the closing of the consumer storage transaction, the makespace jv owned (i) the im consumer storage assets, (ii) the cash contribution and (iii) the customer contracts, intellectual property and certain other assets used by makespace to operate its consumer storage business in the united states. as part of the consumer storage transaction, we received an initial equity interest of approximately 34% in the makespace jv (the "makespace investment"). in the second quarter of 2020, we committed to participate in a round of equity funding for the makespace jv whereby we contributed $36.0 million of the $45.0 million being raised in installments between may 2020 through october 2021. at december 31, 2021, we owned 49.99% of the outstanding equity in the makespace jv.
in connection with the consumer storage transaction and the makespace investment, we also entered into a storage and service agreement with the makespace jv to provide certain storage and related services to the makespace jv (the "makespace agreement"). revenues and expenses associated with the makespace agreement are presented as a component of our global rim business segment. during the years ended december 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, we recognized revenue of approximately $34.7 million, $33.6 million and $22.5 million, respectively, associated with the makespace agreement.
as a result of the consumer storage transaction, we recorded a gain on sale of approximately $4.2 million to other (income) expense, net, during the first quarter of 2019, representing the excess of the fair value of the consideration received over the sum of the carrying value of our consumer storage operations and (ii) the cash contribution.
as described in note 4 to notes to consolidated financial statements included in this annual report, we have concluded that the divestments of ipm and the im consumer storage assets in the consumer storage transaction do not meet the criteria to be reported as discontinued operations in our consolidated financial statements.
general results of operations - key trends
•in spite of the covid-19 pandemic, we have experienced relatively steady volume in our global rim business segment, with organic storage rental revenue growth driven primarily by revenue management. we expect organic storage rental revenue growth to benefit from revenue management and volume to be relatively stable in the near term.
•our organic service revenue growth is primarily due to increases in our service activity, particularly in regions where governments have lifted or eased covid-19-related restrictions on our customers' non-essential business operations. we expect organic service revenue growth in 2022 to benefit from our new and existing digital offerings.
•we expect revenue and adjusted ebitda growth to accelerate in 2022 with continued focus on new product and service offerings, innovation, customer solutions and market expansion.
iron mountain 2021 form 10-k part ii our revenues consist of storage rental revenues as well as service revenues and are reflected net of sales and value-added taxes. storage rental revenues, which are considered a key driver of financial performance for the storage and information management services industry, consist primarily of recurring periodic rental charges related to the storage of materials or data (generally on a per unit basis) that are typically retained by customers for many years and revenues associated with our data center operations. service revenues include charges for related service activities, the most significant of which include: (1) the handling of records, including the addition of new records, temporary removal of records from storage, refiling of removed records, customer termination and permanent withdrawal fees, project revenues, and courier operations, consisting primarily of the pickup and delivery of records upon customer request; (2) destruction services, consisting primarily of secure shredding of sensitive documents and the subsequent sale of shredded paper for recycling, the price of which can fluctuate from period to period; (3) digital solutions, including the scanning, imaging and document conversion services of active and inactive records, and consulting services; and (4) data center services, including set up, monitoring and support of our customers' assets which are protected in our data center facilities, and special project services, including data center fitout. our service revenue growth has been negatively impacted by declining activity rates as stored records are becoming less active. while customers continue to store their records and tapes with us, they are less likely than they have been in the past to retrieve records for research and other purposes, thereby reducing service activity levels.
breakdown of revenues cost of sales (excluding depreciation and amortization) consists primarily of labor, including wages and benefits for field personnel, facility occupancy costs (including rent and utilities), transportation expenses (including vehicle leases and fuel), other product cost of sales and other equipment costs and supplies. of these, labor and facility occupancy costs are the most significant. selling, general and administrative expenses consist primarily of wages and benefits for management, administrative, it, sales, account management and marketing personnel, as well as expenses related to communications and data processing, travel, professional fees, bad debts, training, office equipment and supplies.
cost of sales (excluding depreciation and amortization) and selling, general and administrative expenses for the year ended december 31, 2021 consists of the following:
cost of sales        selling, general and administrative expenses iron mountain 2021 form 10-k part ii trends in facility occupancy costs are impacted by:•the total number of facilities we occupy;•the mix of properties we own versus properties we lease;•fluctuations in per square foot occupancy costs; and•the levels of utilization of these properties.trends in total wages and benefits in dollars and as a percentage of total consolidated revenue are influenced by:•changes in headcount and compensation levels;•achievement of incentive compensation targets;•workforce productivity; and•variability in costs associated with medical insurance and workers' compensation.the expansion of our international businesses has impacted the major cost of sales components and selling, general and administrative expenses.•our international operations are more labor intensive relative to revenue than our operations in north america and, therefore, labor costs are a higher percentage of international operational revenue.•the overhead structure of our expanding international operations has generally not achieved the same level of overhead leverage as our north american operations, which may result in an increase in selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of consolidated revenue as our international operations become a larger percentage of our consolidated results.
our depreciation and amortization charges result primarily from depreciation related to storage systems, which include racking structures, buildings, building and leasehold improvements and computer systems hardware and software. amortization relates primarily to customer relationship intangible assets, contract fulfillment costs and data center lease-based intangible assets. both depreciation and amortization are impacted by the timing of acquisitions.
our consolidated revenues and expenses are subject to the net effect of foreign currency translation related to our operations outside the united states. it is difficult to predict the future fluctuations of foreign currency exchange rates and how those fluctuations will impact our consolidated statements of operations. as a result of the relative size of our international operations, these fluctuations may be material on individual balances. our revenues and expenses from our international operations are generally denominated in the local currency of the country in which they are derived or incurred. therefore, the impact of currency fluctuations on our operating income and operating margin is partially mitigated. in order to provide a framework for assessing how our underlying businesses performed excluding the effect of foreign currency fluctuations, we compare the percentage change in the results from one period to another period in this report using constant currency presentation. the constant currency growth rates are calculated by translating the 2020 results at the 2021 average exchange rates and the 2019 results at the 2020 average exchange rates. constant currency growth rates are a non-gaap measure.
iron mountain 2021 form 10-k part ii the following table is a comparison of underlying average exchange rates of the foreign currencies that had the most significant impact on our united states dollar-reported revenues and expenses:

the percentage of united states dollar-reported revenues for all other foreign currencies was 14.6%, 13.8% and 12.7% for the years ended december 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
non-gaap measures adjusted ebitda adjusted ebitda is defined as income (loss) from continuing operations before interest expense, net, provision (benefit) for income taxes, depreciation and amortization (inclusive of our share of adjusted ebitda from our unconsolidated joint ventures), and excluding certain items we do not believe to be indicative of our core operating results, specifically:
•acquisition and integration costs•restructuring charges•intangible impairments•(gain) loss on disposal/write-down of property, plant and equipment, net (including real estate)       •other (income) expense, net•stock-based compensation expense•covid-19 costs (as defined below)
adjusted ebitda margin is calculated by dividing adjusted ebitda by total revenues. we also show adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda margin for each of our reportable operating segments under "results of operations - segment analysis" below.
iron mountain 2021 form 10-k part ii adjusted ebitda excludes both interest expense, net and the provision (benefit) for income taxes. these expenses are associated with our capitalization and tax structures, which we do not consider when evaluating the operating profitability of our core operations. adjusted ebitda also does not include depreciation and amortization expenses, in order to eliminate the impact of capital investments, which we evaluate by comparing capital expenditures to incremental revenue generated and as a percentage of total revenues. adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda margin should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for, other measures of financial performance reported in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america ("gaap"), such as operating income, income (loss) from continuing operations, net income (loss) or cash flows from operating activities from continuing operations (as determined in accordance with gaap).

funds from operations ("ffo") is defined by the national association of real estate investment trusts ("nareit") as net income (loss) excluding depreciation on real estate assets, gains on sale of real estate, net of tax, and amortization of data center leased-based intangibles. ffo (nareit) does not give effect to real estate depreciation because these amounts are computed, under gaap, to allocate the cost of a property over its useful life. because values for well-maintained real estate assets have historically increased or decreased based upon prevailing market conditions, we believe that ffo (nareit) provides investors with a clearer view of our operating performance. our most directly comparable gaap measure to ffo (nareit) is net income (loss).
although nareit has published a definition of ffo, we modify ffo (nareit), as is common among reits seeking to provide financial measures that most meaningfully reflect their particular business ("ffo (normalized)"). our definition of ffo (normalized) excludes certain items included in ffo (nareit) that we believe are not indicative of our core operating results, specifically:

critical accounting estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with gaap. the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and for the period then ended. on an ongoing basis, we evaluate the estimates used. we base our estimates on historical experience, actuarial estimates, current conditions and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. these estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and are not readily apparent from other sources. actual results may differ from these estimates. the following should be read in conjunction with note 2 to notes to consolidated financial statements included in this annual report, which provides a summary of our significant accounting policies. our critical accounting estimates include the following, which are listed in no particular order:
iron mountain 2021 form 10-k part ii revenue recognition revenue is recognized when or as control of promised goods or services is transferred to the customer, in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services. see note 2.r. to notes to consolidated financial statements included in this annual report for additional details on our revenue recognition policies. revenue for all our lines of business, with the exception of storage revenues in our global data center business (which is subject to leasing guidance), is recognized in accordance with accounting standards codification ("asc") 606, revenue from contracts with customers ("asc 606"), the application of which requires that we make estimates and judgements that may affect the amount and timing of revenue we recognize.
we have determined that the majority of our contracts contain series performance obligations which qualify to be recognized under a practical expedient available in asc 606 known as the "right to invoice." this determination allows variable consideration in such contracts to be allocated to and recognized in the period to which the consideration relates, which is typically the period in which it is billed, rather than requiring estimation of variable consideration at the inception of the contract.
from time to time, we make payments to entities that are also customers under a revenue contract. these payments are comprised of customer inducements (as defined in note 2.l. to notes to consolidated financial statements included in this annual report). consideration payable to a customer is treated as a reduction of the transaction price over periods ranging from one to 10 years. if the payment to the customer does not represent payment for a distinct service, revenue is recognized only up to the amount of consideration remaining after customer payment obligations are considered.
contract fulfillment costs are amortized over a three year term, which we have determined is consistent with the transfer of the underlying performance obligations to which the assets relate. different determinations on term length would result in differences in the amount and timing of amortization expense recognized.
accounting for acquisitions part of our growth strategy has been to acquire businesses. the purchase price of each acquisition has been determined after due diligence of the target business, market research, strategic planning and the forecasting of expected future results and synergies. estimated future results and expected synergies are subject to revisions as we integrate each acquisition and attempt to leverage resources.
accounting for acquisitions of a business has resulted in the capitalization of the cost in excess of the estimated fair value of the net assets acquired in each of these acquisitions as goodwill. we estimate the fair values of the assets acquired in each acquisition as of the date of acquisition and these estimates are subject to adjustment based on the final assessments of the fair value of intangible assets (primarily customer relationship and data center lease-based intangible assets), property, plant and equipment (primarily building, building improvements, leasehold improvements, data center infrastructure and racking structures), operating leases, contingencies and income taxes (primarily deferred income taxes). see note 3 to notes to consolidated financial statements included in this annual report for a description of recent acquisitions.
determining the fair values of the net assets acquired requires management's judgment and often involves the use of assumptions with respect to future cash inflows and outflows, discount rates and market data, among other items. as it relates to our data center acquisitions, the fair values of the net assets acquired requires management's judgment and often involves the use of assumptions with respect to (i) certain economic costs (as described more fully in note 2.l. to notes to consolidated financial statements included in this annual report) avoided by acquiring a data center operation with active tenants that would have otherwise been incurred if the data center operation was purchased vacant, (ii) market rental rates and (iii) expectations of lease renewals and extensions. due to the inherent uncertainty of future events, actual values of net assets acquired could be different from our estimated fair values and could have a material impact on our financial statements.
of the net assets acquired in our acquisitions, the fair value of owned buildings, including building improvements, customer relationship and data center lease-based intangible assets, racking structures and operating leases are generally the most common and most significant. for significant acquisitions or acquisitions involving new markets or new products, we generally use third parties to assist us in estimating the fair value of owned buildings, including building improvements, customer relationship and lease-based intangible assets and market rental rates for acquired operating leases. for acquisitions that are not significant or do not involve new markets or new products, we generally use third parties to assist us in estimating the fair value of acquired owned buildings, including building improvements, and market rental rates for acquired operating leases. when not using third party appraisals of the fair value of acquired net assets, the fair value of acquired customer relationship intangible assets, above and below market in-place operating leases, and racking structures is determined internally. the fair value of acquired racking structures is determined internally by taking current estimated replacement cost at the date of acquisition for the quantity of racking structures acquired, discounted to take into account the quality (e.g. age, material and type) of the racking structures. we use discounted cash flow models to determine the fair value of customer relationship assets, which requires a significant amount of judgment by management, including estimating expected lives of the relationships, expected future cash flows and discount rates. we determine the fair value of tangible data center assets using an estimated replacement cost at the date of acquisition, then discounting for age, economic and functional obsolescence.
iron mountain 2021 form 10-k part ii our estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable at that time but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable. assumptions may be incomplete or inaccurate, and unanticipated events and circumstances may occur, which may affect the accuracy of such assumptions. total property, plant and equipment and intangible assets acquired in our 2021 acquisitions were approximately $150.1 million and $44.9 million, respectively.
impairment of tangible and intangible assets assets subject to depreciation or amortization we review long-lived assets and all finite-lived intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. examples of events or circumstances that may be indicative of impairment include, but are not limited to:
•a significant decrease in the market price of an asset;
•a significant change in the extent or manner in which a long-lived asset is being used or in its physical condition;
•a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate that could affect the value of the asset;
•an accumulation of costs significantly greater than the amount originally expected for the acquisition or construction of an asset;
•a current-period operating or cash flow loss combined with a history of operating or cash flow losses or a projection or forecast that demonstrates continuing losses associated with the use of a long-lived asset; and
•a current expectation that, more likely than not, an asset will be sold or otherwise disposed of significantly before the end of its previously estimated useful life.
if events indicate the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable, recoverability of these assets is determined by comparing the sum of the forecasted undiscounted net cash flows of the operation to which the assets relate to their carrying amount. the operations are generally distinguished by the business segment and geographic region in which they operate. if it is determined that we are unable to recover the carrying amount of the assets, the long-lived assets are written down, on a pro rata basis, to fair value. fair value is determined based on discounted cash flows or appraised values, depending upon the nature of the assets.
we did not record impairment charges for any of our long-lived asset and finite-lived intangibles during the years ended december 31, 2021 and 2020. during 2019, we recorded an impairment charge of approximately $24.0 million on the assets associated with the select offerings within our iron mountain iron cloud portfolio as we explored strategic options regarding how to maintain and support the infrastructure of select offerings within this portfolio.
goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets not subject to amortization goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized but are reviewed annually for impairment, or more frequently if impairment indicators arise. other than goodwill, we currently have no intangible assets that have indefinite lives and which are not amortized. see note 2.k. to notes to consolidated financial statements included in this annual report for additional details on our goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets policies.
we have selected october 1 as our annual goodwill impairment review date. we have performed our annual goodwill impairment review as of october 1, 2021, 2020 and 2019. we concluded that as of october 1, 2021, 2020 and 2019, goodwill was not impaired.
our reporting units at which level we performed our goodwill impairment analysis as of october 1, 2021 were as follows:
•north american records and information management reporting unit ("north america rim")•europe records and information management reporting unit ("europe rim")•latin america records and information management reporting unit ("latin america rim")•australia and new zealand records and information management reporting unit ("anz rim")         •asia records and information management reporting unit ("asia rim")•global data center•fine arts•entertainment services see note 2.k. to notes to consolidated financial statements included in this annual report for a description of our reporting units.
iron mountain 2021 form 10-k part ii based on our goodwill impairment analysis as of october 1, 2021, all of our reporting units had estimated fair values exceeding their carrying values by greater than 20%. our global data center reporting unit had an estimated fair value that exceeded its carrying value by approximately 23%. the reporting unit represented approximately $426.1 million, or 9.5%, of our consolidated goodwill balance at december 31, 2021. the following is a summary of the global data center reporting unit including the goodwill balance (in thousands), percentage by which the fair value of the reporting unit exceeded its carrying value, and certain key assumptions used by us in determining the fair value of the reporting unit as of october 1, 2021:

(1)for purposes of our goodwill impairment analysis, the term "capital expenditures" includes both growth investment and recurring capital expenditures. the capital expenditure assumptions in our goodwill impairment analysis include significant growth investment in the next three years.
(2)terminal growth rates are applied in year 10 of our discounted cash flow analysis.
reporting unit valuations have generally been determined using a combined approach based on the present value of future cash flows (the "discounted cash flow model") and market multiples (the "market approach"). there are inherent uncertainties and judgments involved when determining the fair value of the reporting units for purposes of our annual goodwill impairment testing. the following includes supplemental information to the table above for the data center reporting unit where the estimated fair value exceeded its carrying value by approximately 23% as of october 1, 2021. the success of this business and the achievement of certain key assumptions developed by management and used in the discounted cash flow model are contingent upon various factors including, but not limited to, (i) achieving growth from existing customers, (ii) sales to new customers, (iii) increased market penetration and (iv) accurately timing the capital investments related to expansions.
our global data center business footprint spans nine markets in the united states: denver, colorado; kansas city, missouri; boston, massachusetts; boyers, pennsylvania; manassas, virginia; edison, new jersey; columbus, ohio; and phoenix and scottsdale, arizona and seven international markets: amsterdam, london, singapore, frankfurt (directly and through an unconsolidated joint venture) and through unconsolidated joint ventures in mumbai, pune and noida. we provide enterprise-class data center facilities and hyperscale-ready capacity to protect mission-critical assets and ensure the continued operation of our customers' it infrastructure with secure, reliable and flexible data center options. data centers are highly specialized and secure assets that serve as centralized repositories of server, storage and network equipment. they are capital intensive and designed to provide the space, power, cooling and network connectivity necessary to efficiently operate mission-critical it equipment. the demand for data center infrastructure is being driven by many factors, but most importantly by significant growth in data as well as an increased demand for outsourcing. in order to attract and retain customers, as well as sustain growth in our existing and new markets, we must have the capability to tailor our facilities and invest capital to meet our customers' needs. our estimate of fair value reflects the expected growth in each of our data center markets along with the corresponding capital investments required to meet demand. the business is primarily comprised of acquisitions completed in 2018 and late 2017; therefore, we would expect that the fair value of this reporting unit would closely approximate its carrying value.
key factors that could reasonably be expected to have a negative impact on the estimated fair value of these reporting units and potentially result in impairment charges include, but are not limited to: (i) a deterioration in general economic conditions, (ii) significant adverse changes in regulatory factors or in the business climate, and (iii) adverse actions or assessment by regulators, all of which could result in adverse changes to the key assumptions used in valuing the reporting units. the inability to meet the assumptions used in the discounted cash flow model and market approach for each of the reporting units, or future adverse market conditions not currently known, could lead to a fair value that is less than the carrying value in any one of our reporting units.
reporting unit valuations have generally been determined using a combined approach based on the discounted cash flow model and market approach. the discounted cash flow model incorporates significant assumptions including future revenue growth rates, operating margins, discount rates and capital expenditures. the market approach requires us to make assumptions related to adjusted ebitda multiples. changes in economic and operating conditions impacting these assumptions or changes in multiples could result in goodwill impairments in future periods. in conjunction with our annual goodwill impairment reviews, we reconcile the sum of the valuations of all of our reporting units to our market capitalization as of such dates.
iron mountain 2021 form 10-k part ii although we believe we have sufficient historical and projected information available to us to test for goodwill impairment, it is possible that actual results could differ from the estimates used in our impairment tests. of the key assumptions that impact the goodwill impairment test, the expected future cash flows and discount rate are among the most sensitive and are considered to be critical assumptions, as changes to these estimates could have an effect on the estimated fair value of each of our reporting units. we have assessed the sensitivity of these assumptions on each of our reporting units as of october 1, 2021.
north america rim, europerim, latin america rim, anzrim, asia rim, fine arts and entertainment services        we noted that, based on the estimated fair value of these reporting units determined as of october 1, 2021:•a hypothetical decrease of 10% in the expected annual future cash flows of these reporting units, with all other assumptions unchanged, would have decreased the estimated fair value of these reporting units as of october 1, 2021 by a range of approximately 9.7% to 10.6% but would not, however, have resulted in the carrying value of any of these reporting units with goodwill exceeding their estimated fair value;•a hypothetical increase of 100 basis points in the discount rate, with all other assumptions unchanged, would have decreased the estimated fair value of these reporting units as of october 1, 2021 by a range of approximately 4.2% to 9.9% but would not, however, have resulted in the carrying value of any of these reporting units with goodwill exceeding their estimated fair value.
global data center                                                                                             we noted that, as of october 1, 2021, the estimated fair value of the reporting unit:•exceeds its carrying value by approximately 23%.accordingly, any significant negative change in either the expected annual future cash flows of the reporting unit or the discount rate may result in the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeding its estimated fair value.
at december 31, 2021, no factors were identified that would alter the conclusions of our october 1, 2021 goodwill impairment analysis. in making this assessment, we considered a number of factors including operating results, business plans, anticipated future cash flows, transactions and marketplace data. there are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and our judgment in applying them to the analysis of goodwill impairment.
income taxes as a reit, we are generally permitted to deduct from our federal taxable income the dividends we pay to our stockholders. the income represented by such dividends is not subject to federal taxation at the entity level but is taxed, if at all, at the stockholder level. the income of our domestic trss, which hold our domestic operations that may not be reit-compliant as currently operated and structured, is subject, as applicable, to federal and state corporate income tax. in addition, we and our subsidiaries continue to be subject to foreign income taxes in other jurisdictions in which we have business operations or a taxable presence, regardless of whether assets are held or operations are conducted through subsidiaries disregarded for federal income tax purposes or trss. we will also be subject to a separate corporate income tax on any gains recognized on the sale or disposition of any asset previously owned by a c corporation during a five-year period after the date we first owned the asset as a reit asset that are attributable to "built-in gains" with respect to that asset on that date. we will also be subject to a built-in gains tax on our depreciation recapture recognized into income as a result of accounting method changes in connection with our acquisition activities. if we fail to remain qualified for taxation as a reit, we will be subject to federal income tax at regular corporate income tax rates. even if we remain qualified for taxation as a reit, we may be subject to some federal, state, local and foreign taxes on our income and property in addition to taxes owed with respect to our trs operations. in particular, while state income tax regimes often parallel the federal income tax regime for reits, many states do not completely follow federal rules and some do not follow them at all. see note 10 to notes to consolidated financial statements included in this annual report for additional details on our tax policies.
accounting for income taxes requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the tax and financial reporting bases of assets and liabilities and for loss and credit carryforwards. we measure deferred tax assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates expected to be applied to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences and carryforwards are expected to be recovered or settled. the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities as a result of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that the change is enacted. valuation allowances are provided when recovery of deferred tax assets does not meet the more likely than not standard as defined in gaap. valuation allowances would be reversed as a reduction to the provision for income taxes if related deferred tax assets are deemed realizable based on changes in facts and circumstances relevant to the recoverability of the asset.
iron mountain 2021 form 10-k part ii at december 31, 2021, we have federal and state net operating loss carryforwards of which we are expecting an insignificant tax benefit to be realized. we have assets for foreign net operating losses of $85.5 million, with various expiration dates (and in some cases no expiration date), subject to a valuation allowance of approximately 47%. if actual results differ unfavorably from certain of our estimates used, we may not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred income tax assets and additional valuation allowances may be required. although we believe our estimates are reasonable, no assurance can be given that our estimates reflected in the tax provisions and accruals will equal our actual results. these differences could have a material impact on our income tax provision and operating results in the period in which such determination is made.
the evaluation of an uncertain tax position is a two-step process. the first step is a recognition process whereby we determine whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits of the position. the second step is a measurement process whereby a tax position that meets the more likely than not recognition threshold is calculated to determine the amount of benefit to recognize in the financial statements. the tax position is measured as the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement.
we are subject to income taxes in the united states and numerous foreign jurisdictions. we are subject to examination by various tax authorities in jurisdictions in which we have business operations or a taxable presence. we regularly assess the likelihood of additional assessments by tax authorities and provide for these matters as appropriate. as of december 31, 2021 and 2020, we had approximately $27.8 million and $26.0 million, respectively, of reserves related to uncertain tax positions. the reversal of these reserves will be recorded as a reduction of our income tax provision if sustained. although we believe our tax estimates are appropriate, the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could result in changes in our estimates.
following our conversion to a reit in 2014, we concluded that it was not our intent to reinvest our current and future undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries indefinitely outside the united states. as of december 31, 2016, we concluded that it is our intent to indefinitely reinvest our current and future undistributed earnings of certain of our unconverted foreign trss outside the united states. during 2021, as a result of the enactment of a tax law and the closing of various acquisitions, we reassessed this intention and concluded that it is no longer our intention to reinvest our undistributed earnings of our foreign trss indefinitely outside the united states. as a reit, future repatriation of incremental undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries will not be subject to federal or state income tax, with the exception of foreign withholding taxes. however, such future repatriations may require distributions to our stockholders in accordance with reit distribution rules, and any such distribution may then be taxable, as appropriate, at the stockholder level. we expect to provide for foreign withholding taxes on the current and future earnings of all of our foreign subsidiaries as the result of such reassessment.

primary factors influencing the change in reported consolidated cost of sales for the year ended december 31, 2021 compared to the year ended december 31, 2020 include the following:
•an increase in labor costs driven by an increase in service activity, particularly in regions where governments have lifted or eased covid-19 related restrictions on our customers' non-essential business operations, partially offset by benefits from project summit;
•an increase in facilities expenses driven by increases in rent expense, reflecting the impact from our sale-leaseback activity during the years ended december 31, 2020 and 2021 (which we expect to continue in 2022 as we continue to look for future opportunities to monetize a small portion of our owned industrial real estate assets as part of our ongoing capital recycling program), as well as increases in utilities and property taxes;
•an increase in product cost of sales and other driven by an increase in project activity; and
•an increase of $25.8 million due to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations.

primary factors influencing the change in reported consolidated selling, general and administrative expenses for the year ended december 31, 2021 compared to the year ended december 31, 2020 include the following:
•an increase in general, administrative and other expenses, driven by higher wages and benefits, stock-based compensation expense and bonus compensation accruals, partially offset by benefits from project summit, as well as lower professional fees and bad debt expense;
•an increase in sales, marketing and account management expenses, driven by higher compensation expense, primarily reflecting increased wages and sales commissions, as well as increased marketing costs; and
•an increase of $10.1 million due to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations.
depreciation and amortization our depreciation and amortization charges result primarily from depreciation related to storage systems, which include racking structures, buildings, building and leasehold improvements and computer systems hardware and software. amortization relates primarily to customer relationship intangible assets, contract fulfillment costs and data center lease-based intangible assets. both depreciation and amortization are impacted by the timing of acquisitions.
depreciation expense increased $17.5 million, or 3.9%, on a reported dollar basis for the year ended december 31, 2021 compared to the year ended december 31, 2020. see note 2.h. to notes to consolidated financial statements included in this annual report for additional information regarding the useful lives over which our property, plant and equipment is depreciated.

foreign currency transaction (gains) losses, net we recorded net foreign currency transaction gains of $15.8 million in the year ended december 31, 2021, based on period-end exchange rates. these gains resulted primarily from the impact of changes in the exchange rate of the euro and the british pound sterling against the united states dollar compared to december 31, 2020 on our intercompany balances with and between certain of our subsidiaries.
iron mountain 2021 form 10-k part ii debt extinguishment expense debt extinguishment expense represents the call premiums and write-off of unamortized deferred financing costs associated with the early redemption of the 6% senior notes due 2023, the 43/8% senior notes due 2021, the 5/% senior subordinated notes due 2024, the 53/8% cad senior notes due 2023, the 3% euro senior notes due 2025 and the 53/8% senior notes due 2026.

provision (benefit) for income taxes our effective tax rates for the years ended december 31, 2021 and 2020 were 28.0% and 7.9%, respectively. our effective tax rate is subject to variability in the future due to, among other items: (1) changes in the mix of income between our qrss and our trss, as well as among the jurisdictions in which we operate; (2) tax law changes; (3) volatility in foreign exchange gains and losses; (4) the timing of the establishment and reversal of tax reserves; and (5) our ability to utilize net operating losses that we generate.
the primary reconciling items between the federal statutory tax rate of 21.0% and our overall effective tax rate were:
the benefit derived from the dividends paid deduction of $8.2 million which was offset by (1) the impact of differences in the tax rates at which our foreign earnings are subject to, resulting in a tax provision of $9.9 million, and (2) foreign withholding taxes of $23.7 million, which were either paid during the year or accrued, for the deferred tax liability for the u.s. tax impact of undistributed earnings of foreign trss that are no longer intended to be permanently reinvested outside the united states.                      the benefit derived from the dividends paid deduction of $60.4 million and the impact of differences in the tax rates at which our foreign earnings are subject to, resulting in a tax provision of $9.5 million.
as a reit, we are entitled to a deduction for dividends paid, resulting in a substantial reduction of federal income tax expense. as a reit, substantially all of our income tax expense will be incurred based on the earnings generated by our foreign subsidiaries and our domestic trss.
we are subject to income taxes in the united states and numerous foreign jurisdictions. we are subject to examination by various tax authorities in jurisdictions in which we have business operations or a taxable presence. we regularly assess the likelihood of additional assessments by tax authorities and provide for these matters as appropriate. although we believe our tax estimates are appropriate, the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could result in changes in our estimates.

primary factors influencing the change in revenue and adjusted ebitda in our corporate and other business segment for the year ended december 31, 2021 compared to the year ended december 31, 2020 include the following:
•organic service revenue growth mainly driven by increased service activity levels in our fine arts business, particularly in regions where governments have lifted or eased covid-19 related restrictions on our customers' non-essential business operations; and
•a decrease in adjusted ebitda driven by higher wages, benefits and bonus compensation accruals, partially offset by benefits from project summit, decreased professional fees, ongoing cost containment measures and improved service revenue trends.

debt covenants the credit agreement (as defined in note 7 to notes of consolidated financial statements included in this annual report), our bond indentures and other agreements governing our indebtedness contain certain restrictive financial and operating covenants, including covenants that restrict our ability to complete acquisitions, pay cash dividends, incur indebtedness, make investments, sell assets and take other specified corporate actions. the covenants do not contain a rating trigger. therefore, a change in our debt rating would not trigger a default under the credit agreement, our bond indentures or other agreements governing our indebtedness. the credit agreement requires that we satisfy a fixed charge coverage ratio, a net total lease adjusted leverage ratio and a net secured debt lease adjusted leverage ratio on a quarterly basis and our bond indentures require that, among other things, we satisfy a leverage ratio (not lease adjusted) or a fixed charge coverage ratio (not lease adjusted), as a condition to taking actions such as paying dividends and incurring indebtedness.
the credit agreement uses ebitdar-based calculations and the bond indentures use ebitda-based calculations as the primary measures of financial performance for purposes of calculating leverage and fixed charge coverage ratios. the bond indenture ebitda-based calculations include our consolidated subsidiaries, other than those we have designated as "unrestricted subsidiaries" as defined in the bond indentures. generally, the credit agreement and the bond indentures use a trailing four fiscal quarter basis for purposes of the relevant calculations and require certain adjustments and exclusions for purposes of those calculations, which make the calculation of financial performance for purposes of those calculations under the credit agreement and bond indentures not directly comparable to adjusted ebitda as presented herein. these adjustments can be significant. for example, the calculation of financial performance under the credit agreement and certain of our bond indentures includes (subject to specified exceptions and caps) adjustments for non-cash charges and for expected benefits associated with (i) completed acquisitions, (ii) certain executed lease agreements associated with our data center business that have yet to commence, and (iii) restructuring and other strategic initiatives, such as project summit. the calculation of financial performance under our other bond indentures includes, for example, adjustments for non-cash charges and for expected benefits associated with (i) completed acquisitions, and (ii) events that are extraordinary, unusual or non-recurring, such as the covid-19 pandemic.
our leverage and fixed charge coverage ratios under the credit agreement as of december 31, 2021 are as follows:
december 31, 2021   maximum/minimum allowable net total lease adjusted leverage ratio                         5.3           maximum allowable of 6.5
net secured debt lease adjusted leverage ratio                  1.8           maximum allowable of 4.0
fixed charge coverage ratio                                     2.4           minimum allowable of 1.5
we are in compliance with our leverage and fixed charge coverage ratios under the credit agreement, our bond indentures and other agreements governing our indebtedness as of december 31, 2021. noncompliance with these leverage and fixed charge coverage ratios would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and liquidity.
our ability to pay interest on or to refinance our indebtedness depends on our future performance, working capital levels and capital structure, which are subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors which may be beyond our control. there can be no assurance that we will generate sufficient cash flow from our operations or that future financings will be available on acceptable terms or in amounts sufficient to enable us to service or refinance our indebtedness or to make necessary capital expenditures.

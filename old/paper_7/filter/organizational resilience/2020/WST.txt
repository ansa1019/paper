item 7.  management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the following discussion is intended to further the reader's understanding of the consolidated financial condition and results of operations of our company. it should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying footnotes included in part ii, item 8 of this form 10-k. these historical financial statements may not be indicative of our future performance. this management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contains a number of forward-looking statements, all of which are based on our current expectations and could be affected by the uncertainties and risks discussed in part i, item 1a of this form 10-k.
non-u.s. gaap financial measures for the purpose of aiding the comparison of our year-over-year results, we may refer to net sales and other financial results excluding the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. organic net sales exclude the impact from acquisitions and/or divestitures and translate the current-period reported sales of subsidiaries whose functional currency is other than usd at the applicable foreign exchange rates in effect during the comparable prior-year period. we may also refer to adjusted consolidated operating profit and adjusted consolidated operating profit margin, which exclude the effects of unallocated items. the unallocated items are not representative of ongoing operations, and generally include restructuring and related charges, certain asset impairments, and other specifically-identified income or expense items. the re-measured results excluding effects from currency translation, the impact from acquisitions and/or divestitures, and excluding the effects of unallocated items are not in conformity with u.s. gaap and should not be used as a substitute for the comparable u.s. gaap financial measures. the non-u.s. gaap financial measures are incorporated in our discussion and analysis as management uses them in evaluating our results of operations and believes that this information provides users with a valuable insight into our overall performance and financial position.

during 2020, we recorded a tax benefit of $20.8 million associated with stock-based compensation, an increase from the tax benefit of $10.3 million associated with stock-based compensation in 2019, and incurred less tax on international operations versus the prior year, which both contributed to the effective tax rate decline from 20.2% in 2019 to 18.1% in 2020.
during 2019, we recorded a net tax benefit of $0.3 million due to the impact of federal law changes enacted during the year, as well as a tax benefit of $10.3 million associated with stock-based compensation.
during 2018, we recorded a net tax benefit of $2.5 million for the estimated impact of the 2017 tax act and a tax benefit of $14.3 million associated with stock-based compensation. please refer to note 17, income taxes, for further discussion of the 2017 tax act.
please refer to note 17, income taxes, for further discussion of our income taxes.
equity in net income of affiliated companies equity in net income of affiliated companies represents the contribution to earnings from our 25% ownership interest in daikyo, which increased to 49% during the fourth quarter of 2019, and our 49% ownership interest in five companies majority-owned by a long-time partner located in mexico. please refer to note 7, affiliated companies, for further discussion. equity in net income of affiliated companies was $17.4 million, $8.9 million, and $7.6 million for the years 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively. equity in net income of affiliated companies increased by $8.5 million, or 95.5%, in 2020, primarily due to favorable operating results at daikyo and the mexico affiliates and increase in ownership of daikyo starting in the fourth quarter of 2019. equity in net income of affiliated companies increased by $1.3 million, or 17.1%, in 2019, primarily due to favorable operating results at daikyo.
financial condition, liquidity and capital resources cash flows the following table presents cash flow data for the years ended december 31:
net cash provided by operating activities       $472.5                     $367.2                    $288.6
net cash provided by operating activities
net cash provided by operating activities increased by $105.3 million in 2020, primarily due to improved operating results and changes in assets and liabilities.
net cash provided by operating activities increased by $78.6 million in 2019, primarily due to improved operating results and changes in assets and liabilities.
net cash used in investing activities decreased by $48.5 million in 2020, primarily due to 2019 investing activities that did not recur in 2020, such as our increase in daikyo ownership and the acquisition of our south korea distributor in 2019. these reductions in investing activities were offset in 2020 by an increase in capital expenditures to support our increased customer demands.
net cash used in investing activities increased by $127.2 million in 2019, primarily due to the increase in our ownership interest in daikyo, an increase in capital expenditures, and the acquisition of our distributor in south korea in 2019.
net cash used in financing activities increased by $100.3 million in 2020, primarily due an increase in purchases under our share repurchases program and given 2019 included new long-term borrowings while no such new borrowings occurred in 2020.
net cash used in financing activities decreased by $43.9 million in 2019, primarily due to borrowings of $90.0 million under our term loan, partially offset by net repayments of our outstanding long-term borrowings under our credit facility and increases in purchases under our share repurchases programs and dividend payments.
liquidity and capital resources the table below presents selected liquidity and capital measures as of:
working capital                         $870.3                  $717.1
cash and cash equivalents include all instruments that have maturities of ninety days or less when purchased. working capital is defined as current assets less current liabilities.
cash and cash equivalents - our cash and cash equivalents balance at december 31, 2020 consisted of cash held in depository accounts with banks around the world and cash invested in high-quality, short-term investments. the cash and cash equivalents balance at december 31, 2020 included $293.5 million of cash held by subsidiaries within the u.s. and $322.0 million of cash held by subsidiaries outside of the u.s. in response to the 2017 tax act, we reevaluated our position regarding permanent reinvestment of foreign subsidiary earnings and profits through 2017 (with the exception of china and mexico) and decided that those profits were no longer permanently reinvested. as of january 1, 2018, we reasserted indefinite reinvestment related to all post-2017 unremitted earnings in all of our foreign subsidiaries. in general, it is our practice and intention to permanently reinvest the earnings of our foreign subsidiaries and repatriate earnings only when the tax impact is de minimis, and that position has not changed subsequent to the one-time transition tax under the 2017 tax act, except as noted above. accordingly, no deferred taxes have been provided for withholding taxes or other taxes that would result upon repatriation of approximately $345.6 million of undistributed earnings from foreign subsidiaries to the u.s., as those earnings continue to be permanently reinvested. further, it is impracticable for us to estimate any future tax costs for any unrecognized deferred tax liabilities associated with our indefinite reinvestment assertion, because the actual tax liability, if any, would be dependent on complex analysis and calculations considering various tax laws, exchange rates, circumstances existing when there is a repatriation, sale or liquidation, or other factors.
working capital - working capital at december 31, 2020 increased by $153.2 million, or 21.4%, as compared to december 31, 2019, including an increase of $3.2 million due to foreign currency translation. excluding the impact of currency exchange rates, cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, inventories, and total current liabilities increased by $156.0 million, $52.5 million, $73.7 million, and $119.1 million, respectively. the increase in accounts receivable was due to increased sales activity. the increase in inventories that occurred in the period was to ensure we have sufficient inventory on hand to support the needs of our customers. the increase in total current liabilities was primarily due to increases in accounts payable, accrued salaries, wages and benefits, accrued expenses, and income taxes payable.
debt and credit facilities - the $2.1 million decrease in total debt at december 31, 2020, as compared to december 31, 2019, resulted from debt repayments under our term loan.
our sources of liquidity include our credit facility. at december 31, 2020, we had no outstanding borrowings under the credit facility. at december 31, 2020, the borrowing capacity available under the credit facility, including outstanding letters of credit of $2.5 million, was $297.5 million. we do not expect any significant limitations on our ability to access this source of funds. please refer to note 10, debt, for further discussion of our credit facility.
pursuant to the financial covenants in our debt agreements, we are required to maintain established interest coverage ratios and to not exceed established leverage ratios. in addition, the agreements contain other customary covenants, none of which we consider restrictive to our operations. at december 31, 2020, we were in compliance with all of our debt covenants, and we expect to continue to be in compliance with the terms of these agreements throughout 2021.
we believe that cash on hand and cash generated from operations, together with availability under our credit facility, will be adequate to address our foreseeable liquidity needs based on our current expectations of our business operations, capital expenditures and scheduled payments of debt obligations.
commitments and contractual obligations the following table summarizes our commitments and contractual obligations at december 31, 2020. these obligations are not expected to have a material impact on liquidity.
operating lease obligations                                   85.2                12.4                  19.7                 15.6                   37.5
(1)our business creates a need to enter into various commitments with suppliers, including for the purchase of raw materials and finished goods. in accordance with u.s. gaap, these purchase obligations are not reflected in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. these purchase commitments do not exceed our projected requirements and are in the normal course of business.
(2)for fixed-rate long-term debt, interest was based on principal amounts and fixed coupon rates at year-end. future interest payments on variable-rate debt were calculated using principal amounts and the applicable ending interest rate at year-end. interest on floating-rate derivative instruments was based on notional amounts and floating interest rates contractually obligated at year-end.
(3)represents acquisition-related contingencies. in connection with certain business acquisitions, we agreed to make payments to the sellers if and when certain operating milestones are achieved, such as sales and operating income targets.
(4)this table does not include obligations pertaining to pension and postretirement benefits because the actual amount and timing of future contributions may vary significantly depending upon plan asset performance, benefit payments, and other factors. in 2021, we expect to contribute $3.6 million to pension plans, of which $2.9 million is for international plans. in addition, we expect to contribute $0.7 million for other retirement benefits in 2021. please refer to note 15, benefit plans, for estimated benefit payments over the next ten years.
reserves for uncertain tax positions - the table above does not include $10.4 million of total gross unrecognized tax benefits as of december 31, 2020. due to the high degree of uncertainty regarding the timing of potential cash flows, we cannot reasonably estimate the settlement periods for amounts which may be paid.
letters of credit - we have letters of credit totaling $2.5 million supporting the reimbursement of workers' compensation and other claims paid on our behalf by insurance carriers. our accrual for insurance obligations was $3.0 million at december 31, 2020, of which $0.9 million is in excess of our deductible and, therefore, is reimbursable by the insurance company.
off-balance sheet arrangements at december 31, 2020, we had no off-balance sheet financing arrangements other than unconditional purchase obligations incurred in the ordinary course of business and outstanding letters of credit related to various insurance programs.
critical accounting policies and estimates management's discussion and analysis addresses consolidated financial statements that are prepared in accordance with u.s. gaap. the application of these principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions, some of which are subjective and complex, that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements. we believe the following accounting policies and estimates are critical to understanding and evaluating our results of operations and financial position:
revenue recognition: our revenue results from the sale of goods or services and reflects the consideration to which we expect to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. we record revenue based on a five-step model, in accordance with asc topic 606 ("asc 606"). following the identification of a contract with a customer, we identify the performance obligations (goods or services) in the contract, determine the transaction price, allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract, and recognize the revenue when (or as) we satisfy the performance obligations by transferring the promised goods or services to our customers. a good or service is transferred when (or as) the customer obtains control of that good or service.
we recognize the majority of our revenue, primarily relating to proprietary products product sales, at a point in time following the transfer of control of our products to our customers, which typically occurs upon shipment or delivery, depending on the terms of the related agreements.
we recognize revenue relating to our contract-manufactured products product sales and certain proprietary products product sales over time, as our performance does not create an asset with an alternative use to us and we have an enforceable right to payment for performance completed to date.
we recognize revenue relating to our development and tooling agreements over time, as our performance creates or enhances an asset that the customer controls as the asset is created or enhanced.
for revenue recognized over time, revenue is recognized by applying a method of measuring progress toward complete satisfaction of the related performance obligation. when selecting the method for measuring progress, we select the method that best depicts the transfer of control of goods or services promised to our customers.
revenue for our contract-manufactured products product sales, certain proprietary products product sales, and our development and tooling agreements is recorded under an input method, which recognizes revenue on the basis of our efforts or inputs to the satisfaction of a performance obligation (for example, resources consumed, labor hours expended, costs incurred, time elapsed, or machine hours used) relative to the total expected inputs to the satisfaction of that performance obligation. the input method that we use is based on costs incurred.
the majority of the performance obligations within our contracts are satisfied within one year or less. performance obligations satisfied beyond one year include those relating to a nonrefundable customer payment of $20.0 million received in june 2013 in return for the exclusive use of the smartdose technology platform within a specific therapeutic area. as of december 31, 2020, there was $4.7 million of unearned income related to this payment, of which $0.9 million was included in other current liabilities and $3.8 million was included in other long-term liabilities. the unearned income is being recognized as income on a straight-line basis over the remaining term of the agreement. the agreement does not include a future minimum purchase commitment from the customer.
our revenue can be generated from contracts with multiple performance obligations. when a sales agreement involves multiple performance obligations, each obligation is separately identified and the transaction price is allocated based on the amount of consideration we expect to be entitled in exchange for transferring the promised good or service to the customer.
some customers receive pricing rebates upon attaining established sales volumes. we record rebate costs when sales occur based on our assessment of the likelihood that the required volumes will be attained. we also maintain an allowance for product returns, as we believe that we are able to reasonably estimate the amount of returns based on our substantial historical experience and specific identification of customer claims.
contract assets and liabilities result from transactions with revenue recorded primarily over time. if the measure of remaining rights exceeds the measure of the remaining performance obligations, we record a contract asset. contract assets are recorded on the consolidated balance sheet in accounts receivable, net, and other assets (current and noncurrent portions, respectively). contract assets included in accounts receivable, net, relate to the unbilled amounts of our product sales for which we have recognized revenue over time. contract assets included in other assets represent the remaining performance obligations of our development and tooling agreements. conversely, if the measure of the remaining performance obligations exceeds the measure of the remaining rights, we record a contract liability. contract liabilities are recorded on the consolidated balance sheet in other liabilities (current and noncurrent portions, respectively) and represent cash payments received in advance of our performance.
impairment of long-lived assets: long-lived assets, including property, plant and equipment and operating lease right-of-use assets, are tested for impairment whenever circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable. an asset is considered impaired if the carrying value of the asset exceeds the sum of the future expected undiscounted cash flows to be derived from the asset. once an asset is considered impaired, an impairment loss is recorded within other expense (income) for the difference between the asset's carrying value and its fair value. for assets held and used in the business, management determines fair value using estimated future cash flows to be derived from the asset, discounted to a net present value using an appropriate discount rate. for assets held for sale or for investment purposes, management determines fair value by estimating the proceeds to be received upon sale of the asset, less disposition costs.
impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets: goodwill is tested for impairment at least annually, following the completion of our annual budget and long-range planning process, or whenever circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable. goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level, which is the same as, or one level below, our operating segments. a goodwill impairment charge represents the amount by which a reporting unit's carrying amount exceeds its fair value, not to exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. considerable management judgment is necessary to estimate fair value. amounts and assumptions used in our goodwill impairment test, such as future sales, future cash flows and long-term growth rates, are consistent with internal projections and operating plans. amounts and assumptions used in our goodwill impairment test are also largely dependent on the continued sale of drug products delivered by injection and the packaging of drug products, as well as our timeliness and success in new-product innovation or the development and commercialization of proprietary multi-component systems. changes in the estimate of fair value, including the estimate of future cash flows, could have a material impact on our future results of operations and financial position. accounting guidance also allows entities to first assess qualitative factors, including macroeconomic conditions, industry and market considerations, cost factors, and overall financial performance, to determine whether it is necessary to perform the quantitative goodwill impairment test. we elected to follow this guidance for our annual impairment test. based upon our assessment, we determined that it was not more likely than not that the fair value of each of our reporting units was less than its carrying amount and determined that it was not necessary to perform the quantitative goodwill impairment test.
intangible assets with finite lives are amortized using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives, and reviewed for impairment whenever circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable.
employee benefits: we maintain funded and unfunded defined benefit pension plans in the u.s. and a number of other countries that cover employees who meet eligibility requirements. in addition, we sponsor postretirement benefit plans which provide healthcare benefits for eligible employees who retire or become disabled. postretirement benefit plans are limited to only those active employees who met the eligibility requirements as of january 1, 2017. the measurement of annual cost and obligations under these defined benefit pension and postretirement plans are subject to a number of assumptions, which are specific for each of our u.s. and foreign plans. the assumptions, which are reviewed at least annually, are relevant to both the plan assets (where applicable) and the obligation for benefits that will ultimately be provided to our employees. two of the most critical assumptions in determining pension expense are the discount rate and expected long-term rate of return on plan assets. other assumptions reflect demographic factors such as retirement age, rates of compensation increases, mortality and turnover and are evaluated periodically and updated to reflect our actual experience. for our funded plans, we consider the current and expected asset allocations of our plan assets, as well as historical and expected rates of return, in estimating the long-term rate of return on plan assets. one of the most critical assumptions in determining retiree mental plan expense is the discount rate. under u.s. gaap, differences between actual and expected results are generally accumulated in other comprehensive income (loss) as actuarial gains or losses and subsequently amortized into earnings over future periods.
changes in key assumptions could have a material impact on our future results of operations and financial position. we estimate that every 25-basis point reduction in our long-term rate of return assumption would increase pension expense by $0.6 million, and every 25-basis point reduction in our discount rate would decrease pension expense by $0.1 million. a decrease in the discount rate increases the present value of benefit obligations. our net pension underfunded balance at december 31, 2020 was $40.8 million, compared to $43.8 million at december 31, 2019. our underfunded balance for other postretirement benefits was $6.1 million at december 31, 2020, compared to $6.6 million at december 31, 2019.
income taxes: we estimate income taxes payable based upon current domestic and international tax legislation. in addition, deferred income taxes are recognized by applying enacted statutory tax rates to tax loss carryforwards and temporary differences between the tax basis and financial statement carrying values of our assets and liabilities. the enacted statutory tax rate applied is based on the rate expected to be applicable at the time of the forecasted utilization of the loss carryforward or reversal of the temporary difference. valuation allowances on deferred tax assets are established when it is more likely than not that all or a portion of a deferred tax asset will not be realized. the realizability of deferred tax assets is subject to our estimates of future taxable income, generally at the respective subsidiary company and country level. changes in tax legislation, business plans and other factors may affect the ultimate recoverability of tax assets or final tax payments, which could result in adjustments to tax expense in the period such change is determined.
when accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in our financial statements, we apply a more-likely-than-not threshold for financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return.

effective august 1, 2019, we adopted the new lease standard using the modified retrospective approach, under which financial results reported in prior periods were not restated. see note 1 to the financial statements in item 8 of this annual report for more information.
in fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2019 we acquired several companies including tsheets.com llc, exactor, inc., and applatix, inc. we have included their results of operations in our consolidated results of operations from their respective dates of acquisition. see note 6 in item 8 of this annual report for more information.
in march 2020 the world health organization declared the covid-19 outbreak as a pandemic. the covid-19 pandemic has had significant adverse impacts on the u.s. and global economies. we are conducting business with substantial modifications to employee work locations and employee travel, among other modifications. while we have not experienced significant disruptions to our operations thus far from the covid-19 pandemic, we are unable to predict the full impact that the covid-19 pandemic will have on our operations and future financial performance, including demand for our offerings, impact to our customers and partners, actions that may be taken by governmental authorities, and other factors identified in "risk factors" in item 1a of part i of this report.
in april 2020, intuit was approved as a non-bank small business administration lender for the paycheck protection program (ppp). the ppp was authorized under the coronavirus aid, relief, and economic security act (cares act) to provide small businesses loans to pay payroll and group health costs, salaries and commissions, mortgage and rent payments, utilities, and interest on other debt which is designed to provide assistance to small businesses during the covid-19 pandemic.
executive overview this overview provides a high level discussion of our operating results and some of the trends that affect our business. we believe that an understanding of these trends is important in order to understand our financial results for fiscal 2020 as well as our future prospects. this summary is not intended to be exhaustive, nor is it a substitute for the detailed discussion and analysis provided elsewhere in this annual report on form 10-k.
industry trends and seasonality industry trends artificial intelligence (ai) is transforming multiple industries, including financial technology. disruptive start-ups, emerging ecosystems and mega-platforms are harnessing new technology to create personalized experiences, deliver data-driven insights and increase speed of service. these shifts are creating a more dynamic and highly competitive environment where customer expectations are shifting around the world as more services become digitized and the array of choices continues to increase.
tables of contents seasonality historically, our consumer and strategic partner offerings have had a significant and distinct seasonal pattern as sales and revenue from our income tax preparation products and services are heavily concentrated in the period from november through april. this seasonal pattern has historically resulted in higher net revenues during our second and third quarters ending january 31 and april 30, respectively. in march 2020, as a relief measure in response to the covid-19 pandemic, the irs extended the filing deadline for the 2019 tax year from april 15, 2020 to july 15, 2020. additionally, all states with a personal income tax also extended their due dates, predominantly to july. as a result, there was a shift in sales and revenue from our third fiscal quarter to our fourth fiscal quarter during fiscal 2020. we expect the seasonality of our consumer and strategic partner businesses to continue to have a significant impact on our quarterly financial results in the future.
key challenges and risks our growth strategy depends upon our ability to initiate and embrace disruptive technology trends, to enter new markets, and to drive broad adoption of the products and services we develop and market. our future growth also increasingly depends on the strength of our third-party business relationships and our ability to continue to develop, maintain, and strengthen new and existing relationships. to remain competitive and continue to grow, we are investing significant resources in our product development, marketing, and sales capabilities, and we expect to continue to do so in the future.
as we offer more online services, the ongoing operation and availability of our platforms and systems and those of our external service providers is becoming increasingly important. because we help customers manage their financial lives, we face risks associated with the hosting, collection, use, and retention of personal customer information and data. we are investing significant management attention and resources in our information technology infrastructure and in our privacy and security capabilities, and we expect to continue to do so in the future.
for our consumer and professional tax offerings, we have implemented additional security measures and are continuing to work with state and federal governments to implement industry-wide security and anti-fraud measures, including sharing information regarding suspicious filings. we continue to invest in security measures and to work with the broader industry and government to protect our customers against this type of fraud.
for a complete discussion of the most significant risks and uncertainties affecting our business, please see "forward-looking statements" immediately preceding part i and "risk factors" in item 1a of part i of this report.
overview of financial results the most important financial indicators that we use to assess our business are revenue growth for the company as a whole and for each reportable segment; operating income growth for the company as a whole; earnings per share; and cash flow from operations. we also track certain non-financial drivers of revenue growth and, when material, identify them in the applicable discussions of segment results below. service offerings are a significant part of our business. our total service and other revenue was $6.0 billion or 79% of our total revenue in fiscal 2020 and we expect our total service and other revenue to continue to grow in the future.
tables of contents key highlights for fiscal 2020 include the following:
revenue of                small business &amp; self-employed revenue of   consumer revenue of
operating income of       net income of                                   diluted net income per share of
critical accounting policies and estimates in preparing our consolidated financial statements in accordance with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles (gaap), we are required to make estimates, assumptions, and judgments that can have a significant impact on our net revenue, operating income or loss and net income or loss, as well as on the value of certain assets and liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets. we believe that the estimates, assumptions, and judgments involved in the following accounting policies have the greatest potential impact on our consolidated financial statements, so we consider these to be our critical accounting policies:
•   revenue recognition
•   business combinations
•   goodwill, acquired intangible assets, and other long-lived assets - impairment assessments
•   accounting for income taxes - estimates of deferred taxes, valuation allowances, and uncertain tax positions our senior management has reviewed the development and selection of these critical accounting policies and their disclosure in this annual report on form 10-k with the audit and risk committee of our board of directors.
revenue recognition we derive our revenue primarily from the sale of online services such as tax, accounting, payroll, merchant payment processing and from packaged desktop software products and desktop software subscriptions. our contracts with customers often include promises to transfer multiple products and services. in determining how revenue should be recognized, a five-step process is used, which requires judgment and estimates within the revenue recognition process. the primary judgments include identifying the performance obligations in the contract and determining whether the performance obligations are distinct. if any of these judgments were to change it could cause a material increase or decrease in the amount of revenue we report in a particular period. for additional information, see "revenue recognition" in note 1 to the financial statements in item 8 of this annual report.
tables of contents the date of acquisition. we measure goodwill as the excess of consideration transferred, which we also measure at fair value, over the net of the acquisition date fair values of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed. the acquisition method of accounting requires us to exercise judgment and make significant estimates and assumptions regarding the fair values of the elements of a business combination as of the date of acquisition, including the fair values of identifiable intangible assets, deferred tax asset valuation allowances, liabilities related to uncertain tax positions, and contingencies. this method also requires us to refine these estimates over a one-year measurement period to reflect new information obtained about facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date that, if known, would have affected the measurement of the amounts recognized as of that date. if we are required to retroactively adjust provisional amounts that we have recorded for the fair values of assets and liabilities in connection with acquisitions, these adjustments could materially decrease our operating income and net income and result in lower asset values on our consolidated balance sheet.
significant estimates and assumptions that we must make in estimating the fair value of acquired technology, customer lists, and other identifiable intangible assets include future cash flows that we expect to generate from the acquired assets. if the subsequent actual results and updated projections of the underlying business activity change compared with the assumptions and projections used to develop these values, we could record impairment charges. in addition, we have estimated the economic lives of certain acquired assets and these lives are used to calculate depreciation and amortization expense. if our estimates of the economic lives change, depreciation or amortization expenses could be accelerated or slowed.
goodwill, acquired intangible assets and other long-lived assets - impairment assessments we estimate the fair value of acquired intangible assets and other long-lived assets that have finite useful lives whenever an event or change in circumstances indicates that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable. we test for potential impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets that have indefinite useful lives annually in our fourth fiscal quarter or whenever indicators of impairment arise. the timing of the annual test may result in charges to our consolidated statement of operations in our fourth fiscal quarter that could not have been reasonably foreseen in prior periods.
as described in "description of business and summary of significant accounting policies - goodwill, acquired intangible assets and other long-lived assets," in note 1 to the financial statements in item 8 of this annual report, in order to estimate the fair value of goodwill we use a weighted combination of a discounted cash flow model (known as the income approach) and comparisons to publicly traded companies engaged in similar businesses (known as the market approach). the income approach requires us to use a number of assumptions, including market factors specific to the business, the amount and timing of estimated future cash flows to be generated by the business over an extended period of time, long-term growth rates for the business, and a rate of return that considers the relative risk of achieving the cash flows and the time value of money. we evaluate cash flows at the reporting unit level. although the assumptions we use in our discounted cash flow model are consistent with the assumptions we use to generate our internal strategic plans and forecasts, significant judgment is required to estimate the amount and timing of future cash flows from each reporting unit and the relative risk of achieving those cash flows. when using the market approach, we make judgments about the comparability of publicly traded companies engaged in similar businesses. we base our judgments on factors such as size, growth rates, profitability, risk, and return on investment. we also make judgments when adjusting market multiples of revenue, operating income, and earnings for these companies to reflect their relative similarity to our own businesses. see note 5 to the financial statements in item 8 of this annual report for a summary of goodwill by reportable segment.
we estimate the recoverability of acquired intangible assets and other long-lived assets that have finite useful lives by comparing the carrying amount of the asset to the future undiscounted cash flows that we expect the asset to generate. in order to estimate the fair value of those assets, we estimate the present value of future cash flows from those assets. the key assumptions that we use in our discounted cash flow model are the amount and timing of estimated future cash flows to be generated by the asset over an extended period of time and a rate of return that considers the relative risk of achieving the cash flows and the time value of money. significant judgment is required to estimate the amount and timing of future cash flows and the relative risk of achieving those cash flows. we also make judgments about the remaining useful lives of acquired intangible assets and other long-lived assets that have finite lives. see note 5 to the financial statements in item 8 of this annual report for a summary of cost, accumulated amortization and weighted average life in years for our acquired intangible assets.
assumptions and estimates about future values and remaining useful lives are complex and often subjective. they can be affected by a variety of factors, including external factors such as industry and economic trends, and internal factors such as changes in our business strategy and our internal forecasts. for example, if our future operating results do not meet current forecasts or if we experience a sustained decline in our market capitalization that is determined to be indicative of a reduction in fair value of one or more of our reporting units, we may be required to record future impairment charges for goodwill and acquired intangible assets. impairment charges could materially decrease our future net income and result in lower asset values on our consolidated balance sheet.
during the fourth quarters of fiscal 2020, fiscal 2019, and fiscal 2018 we performed our annual goodwill impairment tests. using the methodology described in "description of business and summary of significant accounting policies - goodwill, acquired intangible assets and other long-lived assets," in note 1 to the financial statements in item 8 of this annual report, we determined that the estimated fair values of all of our reporting units exceeded their carrying values and that they were not impaired. in addition, during this analysis we concluded that the estimated fair values of all of our reporting units substantially exceeded their carrying values.
tables of contents accounting for share-based compensation plans restricted stock units (rsus) granted typically vest based on continued service. we value these time-based rsus at the date of grant using the intrinsic value method. we amortize the fair value of time-based rsus on a straight-line basis over the service period. certain rsus granted to senior management vest based on the achievement of pre-established performance or market goals. we estimate the fair value of performance-based rsus at the date of grant using the intrinsic value method and the probability that the specified performance criteria will be met. each quarter we update our assessment of the probability that the specified performance criteria will be achieved and adjust our estimate of the fair value of the performance-based rsus if necessary. we amortize the fair values of performance-based rsus over the requisite service period for each separately vesting tranche of the award. we estimate the fair value of market-based rsus at the date of grant using a monte carlo valuation methodology and amortize those fair values over the requisite service period for each separately vesting tranche of the award. the monte carlo methodology that we use to estimate the fair value of market-based rsus at the date of grant incorporates into the valuation the possibility that the market condition may not be satisfied. provided that the requisite service is rendered, the total fair value of the market-based rsus at the date of grant must be recognized as compensation expense even if the market condition is not achieved. however, the number of shares that ultimately vest can vary significantly with the performance of the specified market criteria. all of the rsus we grant have dividend rights that are subject to the same vesting requirements as the underlying equity awards, so we do not adjust the intrinsic (market) value of our rsus for dividends.
we use a lattice binomial model and the assumptions described in note 11 to the financial statements in item 8 of this annual report to estimate the fair value of stock options granted. we estimate the expected term of options granted based on implied exercise patterns using a binomial model. we estimate the volatility of our common stock at the date of grant based on the implied volatility of publicly traded one-year and two-year options on our common stock. our decision to use implied volatility is based upon the availability of actively traded options on our common stock and our assessment that implied volatility is more representative of future stock price trends than historical volatility. we base the risk-free interest rate that we use in our option valuation model on the implied yield in effect at the time of option grant on constant maturity u.s. treasury issues with equivalent remaining terms. we use an annualized expected dividend yield in our option valuation model. we adjust share-based compensation expense for actual forfeitures as they occur. we amortize the fair value of options on a straight-line basis over the requisite service periods of the awards, which are generally the vesting periods. we may elect to use different assumptions under our option valuation model in the future, which could materially affect our net income or loss and net income or loss per share. see note 11 to the financial statements in item 8 of this annual report for more information.
legal contingencies we are subject to certain legal proceedings, as well as demands, claims and threatened litigation that arise in the normal course of our business. we review the status of each significant matter quarterly and assess our potential financial exposure. if the potential loss from any claim or legal proceeding is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated, we record a liability and an expense for the estimated loss. if we determine that a loss is possible and the range of the loss can be reasonably determined, then we disclose the range of the possible loss. significant judgment is required in the determination of whether a potential loss is probable, reasonably possible, or remote as well as in the determination of whether a potential exposure is reasonably estimable. our accruals are based on the best information available at the time. as additional information becomes available, we reassess the potential liability related to our pending claims and litigation and may revise our estimates. potential legal liabilities and the revision of estimates of potential legal liabilities could have a material impact on our financial position and results of operations. see note 13 to the financial statements in item 8 of this annual report for more information.
accounting for income taxes - estimates of deferred taxes, valuation allowances, and uncertain tax positions we estimate our income taxes based on the various jurisdictions where we conduct business. significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide income tax provision. the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax rules and the potential for future adjustment of our uncertain tax positions by the united states internal revenue service or other taxing jurisdictions. we estimate our current tax liability and assess temporary differences that result from differing treatments of certain items for tax and accounting purposes. these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities, which we show on our consolidated balance sheet. we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be realized. to the extent we believe that realization is not likely, we establish a valuation allowance. when we establish a valuation allowance or increase this allowance in an accounting period, we record a corresponding tax expense in our consolidated statement of operations.
we record a valuation allowance to reflect uncertainties about whether we will be able to utilize our deferred tax assets before they expire. we assess the need for an adjustment to the valuation allowance on a quarterly basis. the assessment is based on our estimates of future sources of taxable income in the jurisdictions in which we operate and the periods over which our deferred tax assets will be realizable. while we have considered future taxable income in assessing the need for a valuation allowance for the periods presented, we could in the future be required to increase the valuation allowance to take into account additional deferred tax assets that we may be unable to realize. an increase in the valuation allowance could have an adverse impact on our income tax provision and net income in the period in which we record the change.
tables of contents we recognize and measure benefits for uncertain tax positions using a two-step approach. the first step is to evaluate the tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained upon audit, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes. for tax positions that are more likely than not of being sustained upon audit, the second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50% likely of being realized upon settlement. significant judgment is required to evaluate uncertain tax positions. we evaluate our uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis. our evaluations are based upon a number of factors, including changes in facts or circumstances, changes in tax law, correspondence with tax authorities during the course of audits and effective settlement of audit issues. changes in the recognition or measurement of uncertain tax positions could result in material increases or decreases in our income tax expense in the period in which we make the change, which could have a material impact on our effective tax rate and operating results. see note 10 to the financial statements in item 8 of this annual report for more information.

total net revenue increased $895 million or 13% in fiscal 2020 compared with fiscal 2019. our small business & self-employed segment revenue increased 15% primarily due to growth in the online ecosystem. our consumer segment revenue increased 13% primarily due to a shift in mix to our higher priced offerings including turbotax live and growth in turbotax federal units. see "segment results" later in this item 7 for more information.
operating income increased $322 million or 17% in fiscal 2020 compared with fiscal 2019. the increase was due to the higher revenue described above partially offset by higher costs for staffing, outside services, corporate related expenses, and a one time restructuring charge for severance expenses. see "operating expenses" later in this item 7 for more information.
net income increased $269 million or 17% in fiscal 2020 compared with fiscal 2019 due to the increase in operating income described above. diluted net income per share for fiscal 2020 increased 17% to $6.92, in line with the increase in net income.
segment results the information below is organized in accordance with our three reportable segments. all of our segments operate and sell to customers primarily in the united states. international total net revenue was less than 5% of consolidated total net revenue for all periods presented.
segment operating income is segment net revenue less segment cost of revenue and operating expenses. segment expenses do not include certain costs, such as corporate selling and marketing, product development, general and administrative expenses and share-based compensation expenses, which are not allocated to specific segments. these unallocated costs totaled $2.0 billion in fiscal 2020, $1.7 billion in fiscal 2019, and $1.6 billion in fiscal 2018. unallocated costs increased in fiscal 2020 compared with fiscal 2019 and in fiscal 2019 compared with fiscal 2018 due to increased corporate product development, selling and marketing, and general and administrative expenses in support of the growth of our businesses and higher share-based compensation expenses. segment expenses also do not include amortization of acquired technology and amortization of other acquired intangible assets which totaled $28 million in fiscal 2020, $26 million in fiscal 2019, and $21 million in fiscal 2018. see note 14 to the financial statements in item 8 of this annual report for reconciliations of total segment operating income to consolidated operating income for each fiscal year presented.

total operating expenses as a percentage of total net revenue decreased in fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019. total net revenue increased $895 million or 13% and total operating expenses increased $362 million or 10%. the increase in operating expenses was primarily driven by $176 million for higher staffing expenses due to higher headcount, $54 million for outside services, $52 million for corporate related expenses, $40 million for a one time restructuring charge for severance expenses, and $29 million for professional fees related to pending business combinations.
non-operating income and expenses interest expense interest expense of $14 million in fiscal 2020 consisted primarily of interest on our unsecured term loan, unsecured revolving credit facility, secured revolving credit facility, and senior unsecured notes. interest expense of $15 million in fiscal 2019 consisted primarily of interest on our unsecured term loan and secured revolving credit facility. see note 7 and note 8 to the financial statements in item 8 of this annual report for more information.
tables of contents
(2)   in accordance with authoritative guidance, we record gains and losses associated with executive deferred compensation plan assets in interest and other income and gains and losses associated with the related liabilities in operating expenses. the total amounts recorded in operating expenses for each period are approximately equal to the total amounts recorded in interest and other income in those periods.
income taxes our effective tax rates for fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2019 were approximately 17%. excluding the tax benefits related to share-based compensation, our effective tax rate for fiscal 2020 was approximately 21%. this rate did not differ significantly from the federal statutory rate of 21% as state income taxes and non-deductible share-based compensation were substantially offset by the benefit we received from the federal research and experimentation credit. excluding the tax benefits related to share-based compensation our effective tax rate for fiscal 2019 was approximately 24%. this differed from the federal statutory rate of 21% primarily due to state income taxes and non-deductible share-based compensation, which were partially offset by the benefit we received from the federal research and experimentation credit. see note 10 to the financial statements in item 8 of this annual report for more information about our effective tax rates.
at july 31, 2020, we had net deferred tax assets of $63 million which included a valuation allowance for state research and experimentation tax credit carryforwards, foreign loss carryforwards, foreign intangible deferred tax assets and state operating and capital loss carryforwards. see "critical accounting policies and estimates" earlier in this item 7 and note 10 to the financial statements in item 8 of this annual report for more information.
tables of contents liquidity and capital resources overview at july 31, 2020, our cash, cash equivalents and investments totaled $7.1 billion, an increase of $4.3 billion from july 31, 2019 due to the factors described in "statements of cash flows" below. our primary sources of liquidity have been cash from operations, which includes the collection of accounts receivable for products and services, the issuance of senior unsecured notes, and borrowings under our credit facilities. our primary uses of cash have been for research and development programs, selling and marketing activities, repurchases of our common stock under our stock repurchase programs, the payment of cash dividends, debt service costs and debt repayment, acquisitions of businesses, and capital projects. as discussed in "executive overview - industry trends and seasonality" earlier in this item 7, our business is subject to significant seasonality. the balance of our cash, cash equivalents and investments generally fluctuates with that seasonal pattern. we believe the seasonality of our business is likely to continue in the future.
the following table summarizes selected measures of our liquidity and capital resources at the dates indicated:
(dollars in millions)                                  july 31,             july 31,             $change           %change

ratio of current assets to current liabilities     2.3 : 1              1.8 : 1
we have historically generated significant cash from operations and we expect to continue to do so during fiscal 2021. our cash, cash equivalents, and investments totaled $7.1 billion at july 31, 2020, none of those funds were restricted, and approximately 97% of those funds were located in the u.s.
in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020, we borrowed the full $1 billion under our unsecured revolving credit facility and issued $2 billion in senior unsecured notes for general corporate purposes, which may include funding a portion of the pending acquisition of credit karma, and other possible acquisitions of businesses or assets or strategic investments. in august 2020, we repaid the $1 billion outstanding under the revolving credit facility. see "commitments for senior unsecured notes" later in this item 7 for more information.
based on past performance and current expectations, we believe that our cash and cash equivalents, investments, and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to meet anticipated seasonal working capital needs, capital expenditure requirements, contractual obligations (including the pending acquisition of credit karma), commitments, debt service requirements, and other liquidity requirements associated with our operations for at least the next 12 months. we believe that our financial resources will allow us to manage the impact of covid-19 on our business operations for the foreseeable future, which could include potential reductions in revenue and delays in payments from customers and partners.
we expect to return excess cash generated by operations to our stockholders through payment of cash dividends, after taking into account our operating and strategic cash needs. in connection with our pending acquisition of credit karma, we have temporarily suspended share repurchases.
our secured revolving credit facility is available to fund a portion of our loans to qualified small businesses. at july 31, 2020, $48 million was outstanding under the secured revolving credit facility. see "credit facilities" later in this item 7 for more information.
we evaluate, on an ongoing basis, the merits of acquiring technology or businesses, or establishing strategic relationships with and investing in other companies. our strong liquidity profile enables us to quickly respond to these kinds of opportunities.
tables of contents statements of cash flows the following table summarizes selected items from our consolidated statements of cash flows for fiscal 2020, fiscal 2019, and fiscal 2018. see the financial statements in item 8 of this annual report for complete consolidated statements of cash flows for those periods.

during fiscal 2020 we generated $2.4 billion in cash from operations. we also received $2 billion from the issuance of senior unsecured notes, $1 billion from borrowings under our unsecured revolving credit facility and $25 million from the net sales and maturities of investments. during the same period we used $561 million for the payment of cash dividends, $323 million for the repurchase of shares of our common stock under our stock repurchase programs, $137 million for capital expenditures, $33 million from the issuance of common stock under employee stock plans, net of payments for employee taxes withheld upon vesting of restricted stock units, $50 million for the repayment of debt, and $44 million for net originations of term loans.
during fiscal 2019 we generated $2.3 billion in cash from operations. we also received $48 million from borrowings under our secured revolving credit facility and $33 million from the issuance of common stock under employee stock plans, net of payments for employee taxes withheld upon vesting of restricted stock units. during the same period we used $556 million for the repurchase of shares of our common stock under our stock repurchase programs, $501 million for the payment of cash dividends, $155 million for capital expenditures, $64 million for the acquisition of a business net of cash acquired, $49 million for net originations of term loans, and $50 million for the repayment of debt.
stock repurchase programs and dividends on common stock as described in note 11 to the financial statements in item 8 of this annual report, during fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2019 we continued to repurchase shares of our common stock under a series of repurchase programs that our board of directors has authorized. at july 31, 2020, we had authorization from our board of directors to expend up to an additional $2.4 billion for stock repurchases. in connection with our pending acquisition of credit karma, we have temporarily suspended share repurchases.
we have continued to pay quarterly cash dividends on shares of our outstanding common stock. during fiscal 2020 we declared cash dividends that totaled $2.12 per share of outstanding common stock or approximately $562 million. in august 2020 our board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.59 per share of outstanding common stock payable on october 19, 2020 to stockholders of records at the close of business on october 12, 2020. we currently expect to continue paying comparable cash dividends on a quarterly basis; however, future declarations of dividends and the establishment of future record dates and payment dates are subject to the final determination of our board of directors.
business combinations on february 24, 2020, we entered into an agreement and plan of merger (the merger agreement) to acquire credit karma, inc. (credit karma), for $7.1 billion, subject to certain customary adjustments set forth in the merger agreement. the purchase price for credit karma will be payable in equal portions of cash and intuit common stock. the transaction is expected to close before the end of calendar year 2020 subject to receiving required regulatory approval. see note 6 to the financial statements in item 8 of this annual report for more information.
commitments for senior unsecured notes in june 2020, we issued $2 billion of senior unsecured notes comprised of the following:
•   $500 million of 0.650% notes due july 2023;
•   $500 million of 0.950% notes due july 2025;
tables of contents
•   $500 million of 1.650% notes due july 2030 (together, the notes).
interest is payable semiannually on january 15 and july 15 of each year, beginning on january 15, 2021. at july 31, 2020, our maximum commitment for interest payments under the notes was $164 million through the maturity dates.
the notes are senior unsecured obligations of intuit and rank equally with all existing and future unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness of intuit and are redeemable by us at any time, subject to a make-whole premium. upon the occurrence of change of control transactions that are accompanied by certain downgrades in the credit ratings of the notes, we will be required to repurchase the notes at a repurchase price equal to 101% of the aggregate outstanding principal plus any accrued and unpaid interest to but not including the date of repurchase. the indenture governing the notes requires us to comply with certain covenants. for example, the notes limit our ability to create certain liens and enter into sale and leaseback transactions. as of july 31, 2020 we were compliant with all covenants governing the notes. see note 8 to the financial statements in item 8 of this annual report for more information.
credit facilities unsecured revolving credit facility and term loan on may 2, 2019 we entered into an amended and restated credit agreement with certain institutional lenders for a credit facility with an aggregate principal amount of $1.4 billion, including a $400 million unsecured term loan that matures on february 1, 2021 and a $1 billion unsecured revolving credit facility that matures on may 2, 2024.
under the amended and restated credit agreement we may, subject to certain customary conditions including lender approval, on one or more occasions increase commitments under the unsecured revolving credit facility in an amount not to exceed $250 million in the aggregate and may extend the maturity date up to two times. advances under the unsecured revolving credit facility accrue interest at rates that are equal to, at our election, either bank of america's alternate base rate plus a margin that ranges from 0.0% to 0.1% or the london interbank offered rate (libor) plus a margin that ranges from 0.69% to 1.1%. actual margins under either election will be based on our senior debt credit ratings. in may 2020, we borrowed the full $1 billion under the unsecured revolving credit facility and at july 31, 2020, $1 billion was outstanding. in august 2020, we repaid the $1 billion outstanding under this revolving credit facility. we monitor counterparty risk associated with the institutional lenders that are providing the credit facility.
under the amended and restated credit agreement we may, subject to certain customary conditions including lender approval, on one or more occasions increase commitments under the term loan in an amount not to exceed $400 million in the aggregate. the term loan accrues interest at rates that are equal to, at our election, either bank of america's alternate base rate plus a margin that ranges from 0.0% to 0.125% or libor plus a margin that ranges from 0.625% to 1.125%. actual margins under either election will be based on our senior debt credit ratings. the term loan is subject to quarterly principal payments of $12.5 million through october 31, 2020, with the balance payable on february 1, 2021. at july 31, 2020, $338 million was outstanding under the term loan.
the amended and restated credit agreement includes customary affirmative and negative covenants, including financial covenants that require us to maintain a ratio of total gross debt to annual earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (ebitda) of not greater than 3.25 to 1.00 as of any date and a ratio of annual ebitda to annual interest expense of not less than 3.00 to 1.00 as of the last day of each fiscal quarter. as of july 31, 2020 we were compliant with all required covenants.
secured revolving credit facility on february 19, 2019 a subsidiary of intuit entered into a two-year $300 million secured revolving credit facility with a lender. the revolving credit facility is secured by cash and receivables of the subsidiary and is non-recourse to intuit inc. advances under this secured revolving credit facility are used to fund a portion of our loans to qualified small businesses and accrue interest at libor plus 2.39%. unused portions of the credit facility accrue interest at a rate of 0.5%. on march 2, 2020, we amended the secured revolving credit facility to extend the commitment term from february 19, 2021 to february 19, 2022 and the final maturity date from august 19, 2021 to august 19, 2022. the agreement includes certain affirmative and negative covenants, including financial covenants that require the subsidiary to maintain specified financial ratios. as of july 31, 2020 we were compliant with all required covenants. at july 31, 2020, $48 million was outstanding under this facility, with a weighted-average interest rate of 5.74%, which includes the unused facility fee. the outstanding balance is secured by cash and receivables of the subsidiary totaling $144 million.
cash held by foreign subsidiaries our cash, cash equivalents and investments totaled $7.1 billion at july 31, 2020. approximately 3% of those funds were held by our foreign subsidiaries and subject to repatriation tax considerations. these foreign funds were located primarily in the united kingdom, canada, and india. as a result of the 2017 tax act we do not expect to pay incremental u.s. taxes on repatriation. we have recorded income tax expense for canada and india withholding taxes on earnings that are not permanently reinvested. in the event that funds from foreign operations are repatriated to the united states, we would pay withholding taxes at that time.
tables of contents off-balance sheet arrangements at july 31, 2020, we did not have any significant off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined in item 303(a)(4)(ii) of regulation s-k.

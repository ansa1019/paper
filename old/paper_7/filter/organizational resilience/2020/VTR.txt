business summary and overview of 2020
ventas, inc., an s&p 500 company, is a real estate investment trust ("reit") operating at the intersection of healthcare and real estate, with a highly diversified portfolio of senior housing; life science, research and innovation; and healthcare properties; which we generally refer to as "healthcare real estate," located throughout the united states, canada and the united kingdom. as of december 31, 2020, we owned or managed through unconsolidated real estate entities approximately 1,200 properties (including properties classified as held for sale), consisting of senior housing communities, medical office buildings ("mobs"), life science, research and innovation centers, inpatient rehabilitation facilities ("irfs") and long-term acute care facilities ("ltacs"), and health systems. our company was originally founded in 1983 and is headquartered in chicago, illinois with an additional office in louisville, kentucky.
we primarily invest in a diversified portfolio of healthcare real estate assets through wholly owned subsidiaries and other co-investment entities. we operate through three reportable business segments: triple-net leased properties, senior living operations, which we also refer to as shop, and office operations. see our consolidated financial statements and the related notes, including "note 2 - accounting policies" and "note 19 - segment information," included in part ii, item 8 of this annual report. our senior housing properties are either operated under triple-net leases in our triple-net leased properties segment or through independent third-party managers in our senior living operations segment.
we aim to enhance shareholder value by delivering consistent, superior total returns by (1) generating reliable and growing cash flows, (2) maintaining a balanced, diversified portfolio of high-quality assets and (3) preserving our financial strength, flexibility and liquidity.
our ability to access capital in a timely and cost-effective manner is critical to the success of our business strategy because it affects our ability to satisfy existing obligations, including the repayment of maturing indebtedness, and to make future investments. factors such as general market conditions, interest rates, credit ratings on our securities, expectations of our potential future earnings and cash distributions, and the trading price of our common stock impact our access to and cost of external capital. for that reason, we generally attempt to match the long-term duration of our investments in real property with long-term financing through the issuance of shares of our common stock or the incurrence of long-term fixed rate debt.
covid-19 update during fiscal 2020 and continuing into fiscal 2021, the covid-19 pandemic has negatively affected our businesses in a number of ways and is expected to continue to do so.
operating results. our senior living operations segment, which we also refer to as shop, was significantly impacted by the covid-19 pandemic. occupancy decreased over the course of 2020, while operating expenses increased as our senior living communities responded to the pandemic, resulting in a significant decline in noi compared to 2019. our nnn senior housing tenants' performance was similarly affected by covid-19. during the course of 2020, we modified certain nnn senior housing leases to reset rent and provided other modest financial accommodations to certain nnn senior housing tenants who needed it as a result of covid-19. we also wrote-off previously accrued straight-line rental income related to nnn senior housing tenants due to covid-19.
however, we benefited from our ongoing strategy of diversification, with our office and nnn healthcare businesses demonstrating resilience in the face of the pandemic. the company's nnn healthcare tenants benefited from significant government financial support that was deployed early and has partially offset the direct financial impact of the pandemic. our office operations segment, which primarily serves mob and research and innovation tenants that were less impacted by the pandemic, delivered steady performance throughout the year.
provider relief grants. in the third and fourth quarter of 2020, we applied for grants under phase 2 and phase 3 of the provider relief fund administered by the u.s. department of health & human services ("hhs") on behalf of the assisted living communities in our senior living operations segment to partially mitigate losses attributable to covid-19. these grants are intended to reimburse eligible providers for expenses incurred to prevent, prepare for and respond to covid-19 and lost revenues attributable to covid-19. recipients are not required to repay distributions from the provider relief fund, provided that they attest to and comply with certain terms and conditions. see "government regulation-governmental response to the covid-19 pandemic" in part i, item 1 of this annual report.
during the fourth quarter of 2020, we received $34.3 million and $0.8 million in grants in connection with our phase 2 and phase 3 applications, respectively, and recognized these grants within property-level operating expenses in our consolidated statements of income. subsequent to december 31, 2020, we received $13.6 million in grants in connection with our phase 3 applications, which we expect to recognize in 2021. while we have received all amounts under our phase 2 applications and have begun to receive amounts under our phase 3 applications, there can be no assurance that our remaining applications will be approved or that additional funds will ultimately be received. any grants that are ultimately received and retained by us are not expected to fully offset the losses incurred in our senior living operating portfolio that are attributable to covid-19. further, although we continue to monitor and evaluate the terms and conditions associated with the provider relief fund distributions, we cannot assure you that we will be in compliance with all requirements related to the payments received under the provider relief fund.
capital conservation actions. in response to the covid-19 pandemic, we took precautionary steps to increase liquidity and preserve financial flexibility in light of the resulting uncertainty. see "-liquidity and capital resources; recent capital conservation actions." as of february 16, 2021, we had approximately $3.0 billion in liquidity, including availability under our revolving credit facility and cash and cash equivalents on hand, with no borrowings outstanding under our commercial paper program and negligible near-term debt maturing.
continuing impact. the trajectory and future impact of the covid-19 pandemic remains highly uncertain. the extent of the pandemic's continuing and ultimate effect on our operational and financial performance will depend on a variety of factors, including the speed at which available vaccines can be successfully deployed; the rate of acceptance of available vaccines, particularly among the residents and staff in our senior housing communities; the impact of new variants of the virus and the effectiveness of available vaccines against those variants; ongoing clinical experience, which may differ considerably across regions and fluctuate over time; and on other future developments, including the ultimate duration, spread and intensity of the outbreak, the availability of testing, the extent to which governments impose, roll-back or re-impose preventative restrictions and the availability of ongoing government financial support to our business, tenants and operators. due to these uncertainties, we are not able at this time to estimate the ultimate impact of the covid-19 pandemic on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
see "note 1 - description of business - covid-19 update" for a description of charges recognized during the year ended december 31, 2020 as a result of the covid-19 pandemic.
select 2020 and early 2021 highlights covid-19 response
•since the start of the covid-19 pandemic, in addition to actions described under "covid-19 update" above, we have consistently prioritized the health and safety of employees, residents, tenants and managers, serving as an important resource for information and best practices and leading our industry in testing, including through an early arrangement with mayo clinic laboratories.
•we executed on a multi-pronged capital conservation strategy to mitigate the impact of covid-19, including reducing our planned capital expenditures, reducing capital commitments, establishing a quarterly dividend of $0.45 per share beginning in the second quarter and adjusting the company's corporate cost structure.
ventas investment management
•we established a third party capital platform, ventas investment management ("vim"), bringing together our third party capital ventures under one umbrella, including the ventas life science and healthcare real estate fund, l.p. (the "ventas fund") and our research and innovation ("r&i") development joint venture with gic (the "r&i development jv") described below. as of december 31, 2020, vim had over $3 billion in assets under management.
•in march 2020, we formed the ventas fund, a perpetual life investment vehicle focused on investments in research and innovation centers, medical office buildings and senior housing communities in north america. we are the sponsor and general partner of the ventas fund. to seed the ventas fund, we contributed six stabilized research and innovation and medical office properties and received cash consideration of $620 million and a 21% interest in the ventas fund. in october 2020, the ventas fund acquired a portfolio of three life science properties in the south san francisco life science cluster for $1.0 billion.
•in october 2020, we formed the r&i development jv with gic. to seed the r&i development jv, we contributed our controlling interest in four in-progress university-based research and innovation development projects whose total expected cost approximates $930 million.
•during the year ended december 31, 2020, we acquired 10 properties for an aggregate consideration of $249.5 million.
•during the year ended december 31, 2020, we recognized $262.2 million of gains on sale of real estate including 2020, including $225.1 million for the sale of six properties to the ventas fund, $13.7 million for the sale of four in-progress development projects to the r&i development jv and and $23.4 million for the sale of 31 other properties.
•during the year ended december 31, 2020, we received aggregate proceeds of $106.1 million for the full repayment of the principal balances of various loans receivable with a weighted average interest rate of 8.3% that were due to mature between 2020 and 2025, resulting in total gains of $1.4 million.
liquidity and capital
•as of december 31, 2020, we had approximately $3.3 billion in liquidity, including availability under our revolving credit facility and cash and cash equivalents on hand, with no borrowings outstanding under our commercial paper program and negligible near-term debt maturing.
•in april 2020, we raised $500.0 million through the issuance of 4.75% senior notes due 2030.
•in october 2020,we reduced near-term debt maturities by retiring $236.3 million aggregate principal amount then outstanding of our 3.25% senior notes due 2022 at 104.14% of par value, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the payment date.
•during 2020, we sold an aggregate of 1.5 million shares of common stock under our "at-the-market" equity offering program for average gross proceeds of $44.88 per share.
•in january 2021, we entered into an amended and restated unsecured credit facility (the "new credit facility") comprised of a $2.75 billion unsecured revolving credit facility initially priced at libor plus 82.5 basis points.
•in february 2021, in order to reduce near-term maturities, we issued a make whole redemption for the entirety of the $400 million outstanding aggregate principal amount of 3.10% senior notes due january 2023. the redemption is expected to settle in march 2021, principally using cash on hand.
•in april 2020, we completed a transaction with affiliates of holiday retirement (with its affiliates, collectively, "holiday"), including entry into a new, terminable management agreement for our 26 independent living assets that were previously subject to a triple-net lease (the "holiday lease") with holiday.
environmental, social and governance
•during 2020, we continued our leadership in esg, receiving numerous accolades, including the 2020 nareit health care "leader in the light" award for a fourth consecutive year, the 2020 bloomberg gender-equality index for the second consecutive year, the 2020 dow jones sustainability world index for the second consecutive year and maintaining our industry-leading position in gresb.
critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements included in part ii, item 8 of this annual report have been prepared in accordance with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles ("gaap") set forth in the accounting standards codification ("asc"), as published by the financial accounting standards board ("fasb"). gaap requires us to make estimates and assumptions regarding future events that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. we base these estimates on our experience and assumptions we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. however, if our judgment or interpretation of the facts and circumstances relating to various transactions or other matters had been different, we may have applied a different accounting treatment, resulting in a different presentation of our financial statements. we periodically reevaluate our estimates and assumptions, and in the event they prove to be different from actual results, we make adjustments in subsequent periods to reflect more current estimates and assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain. we believe that the critical accounting policies described below, among others, affect our more significant estimates and judgments used in the preparation of our financial statements. for more information regarding our critical accounting policies, see "note 2 - accounting policies" of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in part ii, item 8 of this annual report.
principles of consolidation the consolidated financial statements included in part ii, item 8 of this annual report include our accounts and the accounts of our wholly owned subsidiaries and the joint venture entities over which we exercise control. all intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation, and our net earnings are reduced by the portion of net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests.
gaap requires us to identify entities for which control is achieved through means other than voting rights and to determine which business enterprise is the primary beneficiary of variable interest entities ("vies"). a vie is broadly defined as an entity with one or more of the following characteristics: (a) the total equity investment at risk is insufficient to finance the entity's activities without additional subordinated financial support; (b) as a group, the holders of the equity investment at risk lack (i) the ability to make decisions about the entity's activities through voting or similar rights, (ii) the obligation to absorb the expected losses of the entity, or (iii) the right to receive the expected residual returns of the entity; and (c) the equity investors have voting rights that are not proportional to their economic interests, and substantially all of the entity's activities either involve, or are conducted on behalf of, an investor that has disproportionately few voting rights. we consolidate our investment in a vie when we determine that we are its primary beneficiary. we may change our original assessment of a vie upon subsequent events such as the modification of contractual arrangements that affects the characteristics or adequacy of the entity's equity investments at risk and the disposition of all or a portion of an interest held by the primary beneficiary.
we identify the primary beneficiary of a vie as the enterprise that has both: (i) the power to direct the activities of the vie that most significantly impact the entity's economic performance; and (ii) the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits of the vie that could be significant to the entity. we perform this analysis on an ongoing basis.
accounting for real estate acquisitions when we acquire real estate, we first make reasonable judgments about whether the transaction involves an asset or a business. our real estate acquisitions are generally accounted for as asset acquisitions as substantially all of the fair value of the gross assets acquired is concentrated in a single identifiable asset or group of similar identifiable assets. regardless of whether an acquisition is considered a business combination or an asset acquisition, we record the cost of the businesses or assets acquired as tangible and intangible assets and liabilities based upon their estimated fair values as of the acquisition date.
we estimate the fair value of buildings acquired on an as-if-vacant basis or replacement cost basis and depreciate the building value over the estimated remaining life of the building, generally not to exceed 35 years. we determine the fair value of other fixed assets, such as site improvements and furniture, fixtures and equipment, based upon the replacement cost and depreciate such value over the assets' estimated remaining useful lives as determined at the applicable acquisition date. we determine the value of land either by considering the sales prices of similar properties in recent transactions or based on internal analyses of recently acquired and existing comparable properties within our portfolio. we generally determine the value of construction in progress based upon the replacement cost. however, for certain acquired properties that are part of a ground-up development, we determine fair value by using the same valuation approach as for all other properties and deducting the estimated cost to complete the development. during the remaining construction period, we capitalize project costs until the development has reached substantial completion. construction in progress, including capitalized interest, is not depreciated until the development has reached substantial completion.
intangibles primarily include the value of in-place leases and acquired lease contracts. we include all lease-related intangible assets and liabilities within acquired lease intangibles and accounts payable and other liabilities, respectively, on our consolidated balance sheets.
the fair value of acquired lease-related intangibles, if any, reflects: (i) the estimated value of any above or below market leases, determined by discounting the difference between the estimated market rent and in-place lease rent; and (ii) the estimated value of in-place leases related to the cost to obtain tenants, including leasing commissions, and an estimated value of the absorption period to reflect the value of the rent and recovery costs foregone during a reasonable lease-up period as if the acquired space was vacant. we amortize any acquired lease-related intangibles to revenue or amortization expense over the remaining life of the associated lease plus any assumed bargain renewal periods. if a lease is terminated prior to its stated expiration or not renewed upon expiration, we recognize all unamortized amounts of lease-related intangibles associated with that lease in operations over the shortened lease term.
we estimate the fair value of purchase option intangible assets and liabilities, if any, by discounting the difference between the applicable property's acquisition date fair value and an estimate of its future option price. we do not amortize the resulting intangible asset or liability over the term of the lease, but rather adjust the recognized value of the asset or liability upon sale.
in connection with an acquisition, we may assume rights and obligations under certain lease agreements pursuant to which we become the lessee of a given property. we generally assume the lease classification previously determined by the prior lessee absent a modification in the assumed lease agreement. we assess assumed operating leases, including ground leases, to determine whether the lease terms are favorable or unfavorable to us given current market conditions on the acquisition date. to the extent the lease terms are favorable or unfavorable to us relative to market conditions on the acquisition date, we recognize an intangible asset or liability at fair value and amortize that asset or liability to interest or rental expense in our consolidated statements of income over the applicable lease term. where we are the lessee, we record the acquisition date values of leases, including any above or below market value, within operating lease assets and operating lease liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets.
we estimate the fair value of noncontrolling interests assumed consistent with the manner in which we value all of the underlying assets and liabilities.
we calculate the fair value of long-term assumed debt by discounting the remaining contractual cash flows on each instrument at the current market rate for those borrowings, which we approximate based on the rate at which we would expect to incur a replacement instrument on the date of acquisition, and recognize any fair value adjustments related to long-term debt as effective yield adjustments over the remaining term of the instrument.
impairment of long-lived and intangible assets we periodically evaluate our long-lived assets, primarily consisting of investments in real estate, for impairment indicators. if indicators of impairment are present, we evaluate the carrying value of the related real estate investments in relation to the future undiscounted cash flows of the underlying operations. in performing this evaluation, we consider market conditions and our current intentions with respect to holding or disposing of the asset. we adjust the net book value of real estate properties and other long-lived assets to fair value if the sum of the expected future undiscounted cash flows, including sales proceeds, is less than book value. we recognize an impairment loss at the time we make any such determination.
estimates of fair value used in our evaluation of investments in real estate are based upon discounted future cash flow projections, if necessary, or other acceptable valuation techniques that are based, in turn, upon all available evidence including level three inputs, such as revenue and expense growth rates, estimates of future cash flows, capitalization rates, discount rates, general economic conditions and trends, or other available market data such as replacement cost or comparable transactions. our ability to accurately predict future operating results and cash flows and to estimate and determine fair values impacts the timing and recognition of impairments. while we believe our assumptions are reasonable, changes in these assumptions may have a material impact on our financial results.
revenue recognition we recognize rental revenues under our leases on a straight-line basis over the applicable lease term when collectability of substantially all rents is probable. we assess the probability of collecting substantially all rents under our leases based on several factors, including, among other things, payment history, the financial strength of the tenant and any guarantors, the historical operations and operating trends of the property, the historical payment pattern of the tenant, the type of property, the value of the underlying collateral, if any, expected future performance of the property and current economic conditions. if our evaluation of these factors indicates it is not probable that we will be able to collect substantially all rents under the lease, we record a charge to rental income. if we change our conclusions regarding the probability of collecting rent payments required by a lease, we may recognize adjustments to rental income in the period we make such change in our conclusions.
federal income tax we have elected to be treated as a reit under the applicable provisions of the internal revenue code of 1986, as amended (the "code"), for every year beginning with the year ended december 31, 1999. accordingly, we generally are not subject to federal income tax on net income that we distribute to our stockholders, provided that we continue to qualify as a reit. however, with respect to certain of our subsidiaries that have elected to be treated as taxable reit subsidiaries ("trs" or "trs entities"), we record income tax expense or benefit, as those entities are subject to federal income tax similar to regular corporations. certain foreign subsidiaries are subject to foreign income tax, although they did not elect to be treated as trss.
we account for deferred income taxes using the asset and liability method and recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in our financial statements or tax returns. under this method, we determine deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. any increase or decrease in the deferred tax liability that results from a change in circumstances, and that causes us to change our judgment about expected future tax consequences of events, is included in the tax provision when such changes occur. deferred income taxes also reflect the impact of operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. a valuation allowance is provided if we believe it is more likely than not that all or some portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. any increase or decrease in the valuation allowance that results from a change in circumstances, and that causes us to change our judgment about the realizability of the related deferred tax asset, is included in the tax provision when such changes occur.
we recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position claimed or expected to be claimed on a tax return only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. we recognize interest and penalties, if applicable, related to uncertain tax positions as part of income tax benefit or expense.
recently issued or adopted accounting standards we adopted asc topic 842, leases ("asc 842") on january 1, 2019, which introduced a lessee model that brings most leases on the balance sheet and, among other changes, eliminates the requirement in current gaap for an entity to use bright-line tests in determining lease classification.
asc 842 allows for several practical expedients which permit the following: no reassessment of lease classification or initial direct costs; use of the standard's effective date as the date of initial application; and no separation of non-lease components from the related lease components and, instead, to account for those components as a single lease component if certain criteria are met. we elected these practical expedients using the effective date as our date of initial application. therefore, financial information and disclosures under asc 842 are not provided for periods prior to january 1, 2019.
upon adoption, we recognized both right of use assets and lease liabilities for leases in which we lease land, real property or other equipment. we now also report revenues and expenses within our triple-net leased properties reportable business segment for real estate taxes and insurance that are escrowed and obligations of the tenants in accordance with their respective leases with us. this reporting had no impact on our net income. resident leases within our senior living operations reportable business segment and office leases also contain service elements. we elected the practical expedient to account for our resident and office leases as a single lease component. also, we now expense certain leasing costs, other than leasing commissions, as they are incurred. prior to the adoption of asc 842, gaap provided for the deferral and amortization of such costs over the applicable lease term. we are continuing to amortize any unamortized deferred lease costs as of december 31, 2018 over their respective lease terms.
as of january 1, 2019 we recognized operating lease assets of $361.7 million on our consolidated balance sheets which includes the present value of minimum lease payments as well as certain existing above and/or below market lease intangible values associated with such leases. also upon adoption, we recognized operating lease liabilities of $216.9 million on our consolidated balance sheets. the present value of minimum lease payments was calculated on each lease using a discount rate that approximates our incremental borrowing rate primarily adjusted for the length of the individual lease terms. as of the january 1, 2019 adoption date, we utilized discount rates ranging from 6.15% to 7.60% for our ground leases.
upon adoption, we recognized a cumulative effect adjustment to retained earnings of $0.6 million primarily relating to certain costs associated with unexecuted leases that were deferred as of december 31, 2018.
results of operations as of december 31, 2020, we operated through three reportable business segments: triple-net leased properties, senior living operations and office operations. in our triple-net leased properties segment, we invest in and own senior housing and healthcare properties throughout the united states and the united kingdom and lease those properties to healthcare operating companies under "triple-net" or "absolute-net" leases that obligate the tenants to pay all property-related expenses. in our senior living operations segment, we invest in senior housing communities throughout the united states and canada and engage independent operators, such as atria and sunrise, to manage those communities. in our office operations segment, we primarily acquire, own, develop, lease and manage mobs and research and innovation centers throughout the united states. information provided for "all other" includes income from loans and investments and other miscellaneous income and various corporate-level expenses not directly attributable to any of our three reportable business segments. assets included in "all other" consist primarily of corporate assets, including cash, restricted cash, loans receivable and investments, and miscellaneous accounts receivable.
our chief operating decision makers evaluate performance of the combined properties in each reportable business segment and determine how to allocate resources to those segments, in significant part, based on segment net operating income ("noi") and related measures. in addition to the information presented below, see "note 19 - segment information" of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in part ii, item 8 of this annual report for further information regarding our business segments and a discussion of our definition of segment noi. see "non-gaap financial measures" included elsewhere in this annual report for additional disclosure and reconciliations of net income attributable to common stockholders, as computed in accordance with gaap, to noi.
the table below shows our results of operations for the years ended december 31, 2020 and 2019 and the effect of changes in those results from period to period on our net income attributable to common stockholders.

nm-not meaningful in our triple-net leased properties reportable business segment, our revenues generally consist of fixed rental amounts (subject to contractual escalations) received from our tenants in accordance with the applicable lease terms. we report revenues and property-level operating expenses within our triple-net leased properties reportable business segment for real estate tax and insurance expenses that are paid from escrows collected from our tenants.
the triple-net leased properties segment noi decrease in 2020 over the prior year is attributable primarily to the transition of 26 independent living assets at the start of the second quarter 2020 operated by holiday from our triple-net portfolio to our senior housing operating portfolio, lower rental income from the brookdale lease modification at the start of the third quarter of 2020, and the covid-19 related write-off of previously accrued straight-line rental income during 2020 of $67.6 million (non-holiday assets), partially offset by the $50.2 million impact of terminating the holiday lease. we will continue to try to collect rent on a contractual basis for the tenants where straight-line rent has been written off, but we have determined that collectability is not probable due to covid-19.
occupancy rates may affect the profitability of our tenants' operations. the following table sets forth average continuing occupancy rates related to the triple-net leased properties we owned at december 31, 2020 and measured over the trailing 12 months ended september 30, 2020 (which is the most recent information available to us from our tenants) and average continuing occupancy rates related to the triple-net leased properties we owned at december 31, 2019 and measured over the 12 months ended september 30, 2019. the table excludes non-stabilized properties, properties owned through investments in unconsolidated real estate entities, certain properties for which we do not receive occupancy information and properties acquired or properties that transitioned operators for which we do not have a full four quarters of occupancy results.

resident fees and services include all amounts earned from residents at our senior housing communities, such as rental fees related to resident leases, extended healthcare fees and other ancillary service income. property-level operating expenses related to our senior living operations segment include labor, food, utilities, marketing, management and other costs of operating the properties.
the decrease in our senior living operations segment noi in 2020 over the prior year is primarily attributable to lower occupancy resulting from the covid-19 pandemic. in addition, noi has been negatively impacted by increased operating costs as a result of the covid-19 pandemic, which is partially offset by the receipt of $35.1 million in grants during the fourth quarter 2020 from hhs under the provider relief fund. we also had more properties in this segment because of the transition of 26 independent living assets at the start of the second quarter 2020 operated by holiday from our triple-net portfolio to our senior housing operating portfolio and the third quarter 2019 acquisition of 34 canadian senior housing communities via an equity partnership with le groupe maurice, which contributed to noi.

the decrease in our office operations segment noi in 2020 over the prior year is attributable to assets sold to the ventas fund in the first quarter of 2020, lease termination fees received in 2019, and covid-19 impacts including the write-off of previously accrued straight-line rental income during 2020 and reduced parking revenues. these reduction in noi were partially offset by active leasing at recently developed and redeveloped properties, improved tenant retention, contractual rent escalators, acquisitions and business interruption insurance proceeds.

the increase in our same-store office operations segment noi in 2020 over the prior year is attributable primarily to successful leasing, enhanced tenant retention, continued strong collections through the covid-19 pandemic and contractual rent escalations.
all other information provided for all other segment noi includes income from loans and investments and other miscellaneous income not directly attributable to any of our three reportable business segments. the $5.6 million decrease in all other segment noi in 2020 over the prior year is primarily due to reduced interest income from our loans receivable investments from lower libor-based interest rates, repayments of loans outstanding net of new issuances, partially offset by increased management fee revenues from investments in unconsolidated real estate entities. see "note 6 - loans receivable and investments" of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in part ii, item 8 of this annual report.
interest and other income the $3.4 million decrease in interest and other income in 2020 over the prior year is primarily due to 2019 income from the exercise of warrants related to our research and innovation properties, partially offset by a 2020 reduction of a liability related to an acquisition and interest income on short-term investments.
interest expense the $17.9 million increase in total interest expense in 2020 over the prior year is primarily attributable to an increase of $53.0 million due to higher debt balances, partially offset by a decrease of $35.5 million due to a lower effective interest rate. our weighted average effective interest rate was 3.5% for 2020, compared to 3.8% for 2019. capitalized interest for 2020 and 2019 was $9.6 million and $9.0 million, respectively.
depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization expense increased during 2020 compared to 2019, primarily due to an increase in real estate impairments during 2020 and asset acquisitions, including the 2019 acquisition of senior housing communities operated by lgm. this is partially offset by the impact of dispositions during 2020. see "note 1 - description of business - covid-19 update" for information regarding 2020 real estate impairment charges.
general, administrative and professional fees the $28.6 million decrease in general, administrative and professional fees in 2020 over the prior year is primarily a result of the capital conservation actions taken during 2020, including the june 2020 elimination of approximately 25% of corporate positions and a reduction in executives' salaries for the second half of 2020. see "2020 capital conservation actions" for information regarding these measures.
loss on extinguishment of debt, net the loss on extinguishment of debt, net in 2020 is due primarily to the notice of redemption of $236.3 million of our 3.25% senior notes due 2022. the loss on extinguishment of debt, net in 2019 was due primarily to the redemption and repayment of $600.0 million aggregate principal amounts then outstanding of our 4.25% senior notes due 2022. see "-liquidity and capital resources".
merger-related expenses and deal costs the $14.6 million increase in merger-related expenses and deal costs in 2020 over the prior year is due primarily to costs incurred as a result of the brookdale transaction and 2020 expenses related to severance and operator transitions.
allowance on loans receivable and investments the allowance on loans receivable and investments in 2020 is due to credit losses on certain of our non-mortgage loans receivable and government-sponsored pooled loan investments, less recoveries received during the year. see "note 1 - description of business - covid-19 update" for more information regarding these allowances.
other the $11.0 million change in other from income in 2019 to an expense in 2020 is primarily due to insurance recoveries received in 2019 and increased corporate-level insurance costs in 2020, partially offset by the change in fair value of stock warrants received in connection with the brookdale transaction.
income (loss) from unconsolidated entities the $4.3 million increase in income (loss) from unconsolidated entities for 2020 over 2019 is primarily due to our share of financial results from our unconsolidated entities in 2020, offset by an impairment of our investment in an unconsolidated operating entity in 2020. see "note 1 - description of business - covid-19 update" for information regarding 2020 impairment charges.
gain on real estate dispositions the $236.2 million increase in gain on real estate dispositions for 2020 over 2019 is due primarily to our contribution of six properties to the ventas fund in 2020.
income tax benefit the $40.2 million increase in income tax benefit related to continuing operations for 2020 over 2019 is primarily due to a $152.9 million deferred tax benefit related to the internal restructuring of certain u.s. taxable reit subsidiaries completed within the first quarter of 2020, partially offset by changes in the valuation allowance against deferred tax assets of certain of our trs entities. the restructuring benefit resulted from the transfer of assets subject to certain deferred tax liabilities from taxable reit subsidiaries to the entities other than the trs entities in this tax-free transaction.
our annual report for the year ended december 31, 2019, filed with the sec on february 24, 2020, contains information regarding our results of operations for the years ended december 31, 2019 and 2018 and the effect of changes in those results from period to period on our net income attributable to common stockholders.
non-gaap financial measures we consider certain non-gaap financial measures to be useful supplemental measures of our operating performance. a non-gaap financial measure is a measure of historical or future financial performance, financial position or cash flows that excludes or includes amounts that are not so excluded from or included in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with gaap. described below are the non-gaap financial measures used by management to evaluate our operating performance and that we consider most useful to investors, together with reconciliations of these measures to the most directly comparable gaap measures.
the non-gaap financial measures we present in this annual report may not be comparable to those presented by other real estate companies due to the fact that not all real estate companies use the same definitions. you should not consider these measures as alternatives to net income attributable to common stockholders (determined in accordance with gaap) as indicators of our financial performance or as alternatives to cash flow from operating activities (determined in accordance with gaap) as measures of our liquidity, nor are these measures necessarily indicative of sufficient cash flow to fund all of our needs. in order to facilitate a clear understanding of our consolidated historical operating results, you should examine these measures in conjunction with net income attributable to common stockholders as presented in our consolidated financial statements and other financial data included elsewhere in this annual report.
funds from operations and normalized funds from operations attributable to common stockholders historical cost accounting for real estate assets implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time. however, since real estate values historically have risen or fallen with market conditions, many industry investors deem presentations of operating results for real estate companies that use historical cost accounting to be insufficient by themselves. for that reason, we consider funds from operations attributable to common stockholders ("ffo") and normalized ffo to be appropriate supplemental measures of operating performance of an equity reit. in particular, we believe that normalized ffo is useful because it allows investors, analysts and our management to compare our operating performance to the operating performance of other real estate companies and between periods on a consistent basis without having to account for differences caused by non-recurring items and other non-operational events such as transactions and litigation. in some cases, we provide information about identified non-cash components of ffo and normalized ffo because it allows investors, analysts and our management to assess the impact of those items on our financial results.
we use the national association of real estate investment trusts ("nareit") definition of ffo. nareit defines ffo as net income attributable to common stockholders (computed in accordance with gaap), excluding gains or losses from sales of real estate property, including gains or losses on remeasurement of equity method investments, and impairment write-downs of depreciable real estate, plus real estate depreciation and amortization, and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and entities. adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and entities will be calculated to reflect ffo on the same basis. we define normalized ffo as ffo excluding the following income and expense items (which may be recurring in nature): (a) merger-related costs and expenses, including amortization of intangibles, transition and integration expenses, and deal costs and expenses, including expenses and recoveries relating to acquisition lawsuits; (b) the impact of any expenses related to asset impairment and valuation allowances, the write-off of unamortized deferred financing fees, or additional costs, expenses, discounts, make-whole payments, penalties or premiums incurred as a result of early retirement or payment of our debt; (c) the non-cash effect of income tax benefits or expenses, the non-cash impact of changes to our executive equity compensation plan, derivative transactions that have non-cash mark to market impacts on our consolidated statements of income and non-cash charges related to leases; (d) the financial impact of contingent consideration, severance-related costs and charitable donations made to the ventas charitable foundation; (e) gains and losses for non-operational foreign currency hedge agreements and changes in the fair value of financial instruments; (f) gains and losses on non-real estate dispositions and other unusual items related to unconsolidated entities; (g) expenses related to the reaudit and re-review in 2014 of our historical financial statements and related matters; (h) net expenses or recoveries related to natural disasters; and (i) any other incremental items set forth in the normalized ffo reconciliation included herein.
the following table summarizes our ffo and normalized ffo for each of the five years ended december 31, 2020. the decrease in normalized ffo for the year ended december 31, 2020 over the prior year is due to the impact of covid-19 on our senior housing business and increases in interest expense from incremental borrowings arising as a consequence of the impact of covid-19, partially offset by the positive impact of our third quarter 2019 acquisition of an interest in 34 canadian senior housing communities via an equity partnership with le groupe maurice.

adjusted ebitda we consider adjusted ebitda an important supplemental measure because it provides another manner in which to evaluate our operating performance and serves as another indicator of our credit strength and our ability to service our debt obligations. we define adjusted ebitda as consolidated earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (including non-cash stock-based compensation expense, asset impairment and valuation allowances), excluding gains or losses on extinguishment of debt, our partners' share of ebitda of consolidated entities, merger-related expenses and deal costs, expenses related to the reaudit and re-review in 2014 of our historical financial statements, net gains or losses on real estate activity, gains or losses on remeasurement of equity interest upon acquisition, changes in the fair value of financial instruments, unrealized foreign currency gains or losses, net expenses or recoveries related to natural disasters and non-cash charges related to leases, and including ventas' share of ebitda from unconsolidated entities and adjustments for other immaterial or identified items. the following table sets forth a reconciliation of net income attributable to common stockholders to adjusted ebitda:

noi we also consider noi an important supplemental measure because it allows investors, analysts and our management to assess our unlevered property-level operating results and to compare our operating results with those of other real estate companies and between periods on a consistent basis. we define noi as total revenues, less interest and other income, property-level operating expenses and office building services costs. cash receipts may differ due to straight-line recognition of certain rental income and the application of other gaap policies.

see "results of operations" for discussions regarding both segment noi and same-store segment noi. we define same-store as properties owned, consolidated and operational for the full period in both comparison periods and are not otherwise excluded; provided, however, that we may include selected properties that otherwise meet the same-store criteria if they are included in substantially all of, but not a full, period for one or both of the comparison periods, and in our judgment such inclusion provides a more meaningful presentation of our portfolio performance.
newly acquired or recently developed or redeveloped properties in our senior living operations segment will be included in same-store once they are stabilized for the full period in both periods presented. these properties are considered stabilized upon the earlier of (a) the achievement of 80% sustained occupancy or (b) 24 months from the date of acquisition or substantial completion of work. recently developed or redeveloped properties in our office operations and triple-net leased properties segments will be included in same-store once substantial completion of work has occurred for the full period in both periods presented. our senior living operations and triple-net leased properties that have undergone operator or business model transitions will be included in same-store once operating under consistent operating structures for the full period in both periods presented.
properties are excluded from same-store if they are: (i) sold, classified as held for sale or properties whose operations were classified as discontinued operations in accordance with gaap; (ii) impacted by materially disruptive events such as flood or fire; (iii) those properties that are currently undergoing a materially disruptive redevelopment; (iv) for our office operations, those properties for which management has an intention to institute a redevelopment plan because the properties may require major property-level expenditures to maximize value, increase noi, or maintain a market-competitive position and/or achieve property stabilization; or (v) for the senior living operations and triple-net leased segments, those properties that are scheduled to undergo operator or business model transitions, or have transitioned operators or business models after the start of the prior comparison period.
to eliminate the impact of exchange rate movements, all portfolio performance-based disclosures assume constant exchange rates across comparable periods, using the following methodology: the current period's results are shown in actual reported usd, while prior comparison period's results are adjusted and converted to usd based on the average exchange rate for the current period.
asset/liability management asset/liability management, a key element of enterprise risk management, is designed to support the achievement of our business strategy, while ensuring that we maintain appropriate and tolerable levels of market risk (primarily interest rate risk and foreign currency exchange risk) and credit risk. effective management of these risks is a contributing factor to the absolute levels and variability of our ffo and net worth. the following discussion addresses our integrated management of assets and liabilities, including the use of derivative financial instruments.
market risk we are exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates with respect to borrowings under our unsecured revolving credit facility, our secured construction revolver and our unsecured term loans, certain of our mortgage loans that are floating rate obligations, mortgage loans receivable that bear interest at floating rates and available for sale securities. these market risks result primarily from changes in libor rates or prime rates. to manage these risks, we continuously monitor our level of floating rate debt with respect to total debt and other factors, including our assessment of current and future economic conditions.
the table below sets forth certain information with respect to our debt, excluding premiums and discounts.
as of december 31,
percent of total debt:
weighted average interest rate at end of period:
the variable rate debt in the table above reflects, in part, the effect of $146.7 million notional amount of interest rate swaps with maturities ranging from march 2022 to may 2022, in each case that effectively convert fixed rate debt to variable rate debt. in addition, the fixed rate debt in the table above reflects, in part, the effect of $305.9 million and c$145.7 million notional amount of interest rate swaps with maturities ranging from january 2023 to december 2029, in each case that effectively convert variable rate debt to fixed rate debt. see "note 10 - senior notes payable and other debt" of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in part ii, item 8 of this annual report.
the decrease in our outstanding variable rate debt at december 31, 2020 compared to december 31, 2019 is primarily attributable to reduced borrowings on our revolving credit facility and commercial paper program, partially offset by the change in presentation of the secured revolving construction credit facility to variable rate debt. the secured revolving construction credit facility was previously reflected as fixed rate debt due to an interest rate swap which had effectively converted the associated interest expense from variable to fixed until its expiration in august 2020.
assuming a 100 basis point increase in the weighted average interest rate related to our variable rate debt and assuming no change in our variable rate debt outstanding as of december 31, 2020, interest expense on an annualized basis would increase by approximately $14.7 million, or $0.04 per diluted common share.
as of december 31, 2020 and 2019, our joint venture partners' aggregate share of total debt was $271.6 million and $228.2 million, respectively, with respect to certain properties we owned through consolidated joint ventures. total debt does not include our portion of debt related to investments in unconsolidated real estate entities, which was $213.0 million and $60.6 million as of december 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
the fair value of our fixed rate debt is based on current market interest rates at which we could obtain similar borrowings. increases in market interest rates typically result in a decrease in the fair value of fixed rate debt while decreases in market interest rates typically result in an increase in the fair value of fixed rate date. while changes in market interest rates affect the fair value of our fixed rate debt, these changes do not affect the interest expense associated with our fixed rate debt. therefore, interest rate risk does not have a significant impact on our fixed rate debt obligations until their maturity or earlier prepayment and refinancing. if interest rates have risen at the time we seek to refinance our fixed rate debt, whether at maturity or otherwise, our future earnings and cash flows could be adversely affected by additional borrowing costs. conversely, lower interest rates at the time of refinancing may reduce our overall borrowing costs.
to highlight the sensitivity of our fixed rate debt to changes in interest rates, the following summary shows the effects of a hypothetical instantaneous change of 100 basis points in interest rates:
as of december 31,
fair value reflecting change in interest rates:
the change in fair value of our fixed rate debt from december 31, 2019 to december 31, 2020 was due primarily to 2020 senior note issuances, net of repayments, partially offset by the change in presentation of the secured revolving construction credit facility to variable rate debt. the secured revolving construction credit facility was previously reflected as fixed rate debt due to an interest rate swap which had effectively converted the associated interest expense from variable to fixed until its expiration in august 2020.
as of december 31, 2020 and 2019, the fair value of our secured and non-mortgage loans receivable, based on our estimates of currently prevailing rates for comparable loans, was $565.7 million and $710.5 million, respectively. see "note 6 - loans receivable and investments" and "note 11 - fair values of financial instruments" of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in part ii, item 8 of this annual report.
as a result of our canadian and united kingdom operations, we are subject to fluctuations in certain foreign currency exchange rates that may, from time to time, affect our financial condition and operating performance. based solely on our results for the year ended december 31, 2020 (including the impact of existing hedging arrangements), if the value of the u.s. dollar relative to the british pound and canadian dollar were to increase or decrease by one standard deviation compared to the average exchange rate during the year, our normalized ffo per share for the year ended december 31, 2020 would decrease or increase, as applicable, by less than $0.01 per share or 1%. we will continue to mitigate these risks through a layered approach to hedging looking out for the next year and continual assessment of our foreign operational capital structure. nevertheless, we cannot assure you that any such fluctuations will not have an effect on our earnings.
concentration and credit risk we use concentration ratios to identify, understand and evaluate the potential impact of economic downturns and other adverse events that may affect our asset types, geographic locations, business models, and tenants, operators and managers. we evaluate concentration risk in terms of investment mix and operations mix. investment mix measures the percentage of our investments that is concentrated in a specific asset type or that is operated or managed by a particular tenant, operator or manager. operations mix measures the percentage of our operating results that is attributed to a particular tenant, operator or manager, geographic location or business model. the following tables reflect our concentration risk as of the dates and for the periods presented:
as of december 31,
research and innovation centers                              7.1                     8.7
health systems                                               5.2                     5.1
(1)ratios are based on the gross book value of consolidated real estate investments (excluding properties classified as held for sale) as of each reporting date.
operations mix by tenant and operator and business model:
(1)total revenues include medical office building and other services revenue, revenue from loans and investments and interest and other income (including amounts related to assets classified as held for sale).
(2)results exclude eight senior housing communities which are included in the senior living operations reportable business segment. 2018 results include the impact of a net non-cash charge of $21.3 million related to april 2018 lease extensions.
see "non-gaap financial measures" included elsewhere in this annual report for additional disclosure and reconciliations of net income attributable to common stockholders, as computed in accordance with gaap, to adjusted ebitda and noi, respectively.
we derive a significant portion of our revenues by leasing assets under long-term triple-net leases in which the rental rate is generally fixed with escalators, subject to certain limitations. some of our triple-net lease escalators are contingent upon the satisfaction of specified facility revenue parameters or based on increases in the consumer price index ("cpi"), with caps, floors or collars. we also earn revenues directly from individual residents in our senior housing communities that are managed by independent operators, such as atria and sunrise, and tenants in our office buildings. for the year ended december 31, 2020, 61.0% of our adjusted ebitda was derived from our senior living operations and office operations, for which rental rates may fluctuate more frequently upon lease rollovers and renewals due to shorter-term leases and changing economic or market conditions.
the concentration of our triple-net leased properties segment revenues and operating income that are attributed to brookdale senior living, ardent and kindred creates credit risk. if any of brookdale senior living, ardent or kindred becomes unable or unwilling to satisfy its obligations to us or to renew its leases with us upon expiration of the terms thereof, our financial condition and results of operations could decline, and our ability to service our indebtedness and to make distributions to our stockholders could be impaired. see "risk factors-our business operations and strategy risks-a significant portion of our revenues and operating income is dependent on a limited number of tenants and managers, including brookdale senior living, ardent, kindred, atria and sunrise." included in part i, item 1a of this annual report and "note 3 - concentration of credit risk" of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in part ii, item 8 of this annual report.
we regularly monitor and assess any changes in the relative credit risk of our significant tenants, and in particular those tenants that have recourse obligations under our triple-net leases. the ratios and metrics we use to evaluate a significant tenant's liquidity and creditworthiness depend on facts and circumstances specific to that tenant and the industry or industries in which it operates, including without limitation the tenant's credit history and economic conditions related to the tenant, its operations and the markets in which the tenant operates, that may vary over time. among other things, we may (i) review and analyze information regarding the real estate, senior housing and healthcare industries generally, publicly available information regarding the significant tenant, and information required to be provided by the tenant under the terms of its lease agreements with us, (ii) examine monthly or quarterly financial statements of the significant tenant to the extent publicly available or otherwise provided under the terms of our lease agreements, and (iii) participate in periodic discussions and in-person meetings with representatives of the significant tenant.  using this information, we calculate multiple financial ratios (which may, but do not necessarily, include leverage, fixed charge coverage and tangible net worth), after making certain adjustments based on our judgment, and assess other metrics we deem relevant to an understanding of the significant tenant's credit risk.
because atria and sunrise manage our properties in exchange for the receipt of a management fee from us, we are not directly exposed to the credit risk of our managers in the same manner or to the same extent as our triple-net tenants. however, we rely on our managers' personnel, expertise, technical resources and information systems, proprietary information, good faith and judgment to manage our senior living operations efficiently and effectively. we also rely on atria and sunrise to set appropriate resident fees, to provide accurate property-level financials results in a timely manner and otherwise operate our senior housing communities in compliance with the terms of our management agreements and all applicable laws and regulations. although we have various rights as the property owner under our management agreements, including various rights to terminate and exercise remedies under the agreements as provided therein, atria's or sunrise's failure, inability or unwillingness to satisfy its respective obligations under those agreements, to efficiently and effectively manage our properties or to provide timely and accurate accounting information with respect thereto could have a material adverse effect on us. see "risk factors-our business operations and strategy risks." included in part i, item 1a of this annual report.
we hold a 34% ownership interest in atria, which entitles us to customary minority rights and protections, as well as the right to appoint two of the six members on the atria board of directors.
triple-net lease performance and expirations any failure, inability or unwillingness by our tenants to satisfy their obligations under our triple-net leases could have a material adverse effect on us. also, if our tenants are not able or willing to renew our triple-net leases upon expiration, we may be unable to reposition the applicable properties on a timely basis or on the same or better economic terms, if at all. although our lease expirations are staggered, the non-renewal of some or all of our triple-net leases that expire in any given year could have a material adverse effect on us. during the year ended december 31, 2020, we had no triple-net lease renewals or expirations without renewal that, in the aggregate, had a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations for that period. see "risk factors-our business operations and strategy risks-if we must replace any of our tenants or managers, we may be unable to do so on as favorable terms, or at all, and we could be subject to delays, limitations and expenses, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations." included in part i, item ia of this annual report.
the following table summarizes our lease expirations in our triple-net leased properties segment currently scheduled to occur over the next 10 years as of december 31, 2020:
number ofproperties(1)                     2020 annualized base rent ("abr")(2)                     % of 2020 total triple-net leased properties segment rental income
(1)excludes assets sold or classified as held for sale, unconsolidated entities development properties not yet operational, unconsolidated joint ventures and land parcels.
(2)abr represents the annualized impact of the current period's cash base rent at 100% share for consolidated entities. abr does not include common area maintenance charges, the amortization of above/below market lease intangibles or other noncash items. abr is used only for the purpose of determining lease expirations.
liquidity and capital resources during 2020, our principal sources of liquidity were cash flows from operations, proceeds from the issuance of debt and equity securities, borrowings under our unsecured revolving credit facility, and proceeds from asset sales.
for the next 12 months, our principal liquidity needs are to: (i) fund operating expenses; (ii) meet our debt service requirements; (iii) repay maturing mortgage and other debt; (iv) fund acquisitions, investments and commitments and any development and redevelopment activities; (v) fund capital expenditures; and (vi) make distributions to our stockholders and unitholders, as required for us to continue to qualify as a reit. depending upon the availability of external capital, we believe our liquidity is sufficient to fund these uses of cash. we expect that these liquidity needs generally will be satisfied by a combination of the following: cash flows from operations, cash on hand, debt assumptions and financings (including secured financings), issuances of debt and equity securities, dispositions of assets (in whole or in part through joint venture arrangements with third parties) and borrowings under our revolving credit facilities and commercial paper program. however, an inability to access liquidity through multiple capital sources concurrently could have a material adverse effect on us.
while continuing decreased revenue and net operating income as a result of the covid-19 pandemic could lead to downgrades of our long-term credit rating and therefore adversely impact our cost of borrowing, we currently believe we will continue to have access to one or more debt markets during the duration of the pandemic and could seek to enter into secured debt financings or issue debt and equity securities to satisfy our liquidity needs, although no assurances can be made in this regard. see "covid-19 update." see "risk factors-our capital structure risks-we are highly dependent on access to the capital markets. limitations on our ability to access capital could have an adverse effect on us, including our ability to make required payments on our debt obligations, make distributions to our stockholders or make future investments necessary to implement our business strategy." included in part i, item 1a of this annual report.
2020 capital conservation actions in 2020, we executed on a multi-pronged capital conservation strategy to mitigate the impact of covid-19, which included reducing our planned capital expenditures and capital commitments. we also established a quarterly dividend of $0.45 per share beginning in the second quarter, which was a reduction from the first quarter dividend of $0.7925 per share. this action enabled us to conserve approximately $130 million of cash per quarter compared to the prior dividend level. also, in june 2020, we eliminated roles representing over 25% of our corporate positions, excluding onsite field personnel. for the second half of 2020, the base salaries of our ceo and other executive officers were voluntarily reduced by 20% and 10%, respectively. primarily as a result of these capital conservation actions, our 2020 general and administrative expenses are $29 million lower than 2019.
see "note 10 - senior notes payable and other debt" of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in part ii, item 8 of this annual report for further information regarding our significant financing activities.
credit facilities, commercial paper and unsecured term loans as of december 31, 2020, our unsecured credit facility was comprised of a $3.0 billion unsecured revolving credit facility priced at libor plus 0.875% based on the company's debt rating, which was scheduled to mature in 2021. in january 2021, we entered into an amended and restated unsecured credit facility (the "new credit facility") comprised of a $2.75 billion unsecured revolving credit facility initially priced at libor plus 0.825% based on the company's debt rating. the new credit facility matures in 2025, but may be extended at our option subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, for two additional periods of six months each. the new credit facility also includes an accordion feature that permits us to increase our aggregate borrowing capacity thereunder to up to $3.75 billion.
as of december 31, 2020, $39.4 million was outstanding under the unsecured revolving credit facility with an additional $24.9 million restricted to support outstanding letters of credit. in addition, we limit our utilization of the unsecured revolving credit facility, to the extent necessary, to support our commercial paper program when commercial paper notes are outstanding. we had $2.9 billion in available liquidity under the unsecured revolving credit facility as of december 31, 2020. in connection with the new credit facility, we paid off all amounts outstanding under the existing unsecured revolving credit facility as of january 29, 2021 by drawing down the same amount on the new credit facility.
our wholly owned subsidiary, ventas realty, limited partnership ("ventas realty"), may issue from time to time unsecured commercial paper notes up to a maximum aggregate amount outstanding at any time of $1.0 billion. the notes are sold under customary terms in the united states commercial paper note market and are ranked pari passu with all of ventas realty's other unsecured senior indebtedness. the notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by ventas, inc. as of december 31, 2020, we had no borrowings outstanding under our commercial paper program.
as of december 31, 2020, we had a $200.0 million unsecured term loan priced at libor plus 0.90% that matures in 2023.  the term loan also includes an accordion feature that effectively permits us to increase our aggregate borrowings thereunder to up to $800.0 million.
as of december 31, 2020, we had a $400.0 million secured revolving construction credit facility with $154.1 million of borrowings outstanding. the secured revolving construction credit facility matures in 2022 and is primarily used to finance the development of research and innovation centers and other construction projects.
as of december 31, 2020, we had a c$500 million unsecured term loan facility priced at canadian dollar offered rate ("cdor") plus 0.90% that matures in 2025.
senior notes in april 2020, ventas realty issued and sold $500.0 million aggregate principal amount of 4.75% senior notes due 2030 at an amount equal to 97.86% of par.
in october 2020, we redeemed, pursuant to a cash tender offer, $236.3 million aggregate principal amount then outstanding of our 3.25% senior notes due 2022 at 104.14% of par value, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the payment date. as a result, we recognized a loss on extinguishment of debt of $11.1 million during the year ended december 31, 2020.
as of december 31, 2020, we had outstanding $7.7 billion aggregate principal amount of senior notes issued by ventas realty ($263.7 million of which was co-issued by ventas realty's wholly owned subsidiary, ventas capital corporation), approximately $75.2 million aggregate principal amount of senior notes issued by nationwide health properties, inc. ("nhp") and assumed by our subsidiary, nationwide health properties, llc ("nhp llc"), as successor to nhp, in connection with our acquisition of nhp, and c$1.7 billion aggregate principal amount of senior notes issued by our subsidiary, ventas canada finance limited ("ventas canada"). all of the senior notes issued by ventas realty and ventas canada are unconditionally guaranteed by ventas, inc.
in february 2021, in order to reduce near-term maturities, we issued a make-whole redemption for the entirety of the $400 million outstanding aggregate principal amount of 3.10% senior notes due january 2023. the redemption is expected to settle in march 2021 and will be funded primarily with cash on hand.
we may, from time to time, seek to retire or purchase our outstanding senior notes for cash or in exchange for equity securities in open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions or otherwise. such repurchases or exchanges, if any, will depend on prevailing market conditions, our liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions, prospects for capital and other factors. the amounts involved may be material.
the indentures governing our outstanding senior notes require us to comply with various financial and other restrictive covenants. we were in compliance with all of these covenants at december 31, 2020.
mortgages at december 31, 2020 and 2019, our consolidated aggregate principal amount of mortgage debt outstanding was $2.1 billion and $2.0 billion, respectively, of which our share was $1.8 billion for both years.
under certain circumstances, contractual and legal restrictions, including those contained in the instruments governing our subsidiaries' outstanding mortgage indebtedness, may restrict our ability to obtain cash from our subsidiaries for the purpose of meeting our debt service obligations, including our payment guarantees with respect to ventas realty's and ventas canada finance limited's senior notes.
derivatives and hedging in the normal course of our business, interest rate fluctuations affect future cash flows under our variable rate debt obligations, loans receivable and marketable debt securities, and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations affect our operating results. we follow established risk management policies and procedures, including the use of derivative instruments, to mitigate the impact of these risks.
dividends during 2020, we declared four dividends totaling $2.1425 per share of our common stock, including a fourth quarter dividend of $0.45 per share. in order to continue to qualify as a reit, we must make annual distributions to our stockholders of at least 90% of our reit taxable income (excluding net capital gain). in addition, we will be subject to income tax at the regular corporate rate to the extent we distribute less than 100% of our reit taxable income, including any net capital gains. we intend to pay dividends greater than 100% of our taxable income, after the use of any net operating loss carryforwards, for 2021.
we expect that our cash flows will exceed our reit taxable income due to depreciation and other non-cash deductions in computing reit taxable income and that we will be able to satisfy the 90% distribution requirement. however, from time to time, we may not have sufficient cash on hand or other liquid assets to meet this requirement or we may decide to retain cash or distribute such greater amount as may be necessary to avoid income and excise taxation. if we do not have sufficient cash on hand or other liquid assets to enable us to satisfy the 90% distribution requirement, or if we desire to retain cash, we may borrow funds, issue additional equity securities, pay taxable stock dividends, if possible, distribute other property or securities or engage in a transaction intended to enable us to meet the reit distribution requirements or any combination of the foregoing.
capital expenditures the terms of our triple-net leases generally obligate our tenants to pay all capital expenditures necessary to maintain and improve our triple-net leased properties. however, from time to time, we may fund the capital expenditures for our triple-net leased properties through loans or advances to the tenants, which may increase the amount of rent payable with respect to the properties in certain cases. we may also fund capital expenditures for which we may become responsible upon expiration of our triple-net leases or in the event that our tenants are unable or unwilling to meet their obligations under those leases. we also expect to fund capital expenditures related to our senior living operations and office operations reportable business segments with the cash flows from the properties or through additional borrowings. we expect that these liquidity needs generally will be satisfied by a combination of the following: cash flows from operations, cash on hand, debt assumptions and financings (including secured financings), issuances of debt and equity securities, dispositions of assets (in whole or in part through joint venture arrangements with third parties) and borrowings under our revolving credit facilities.
to the extent that unanticipated capital expenditure needs arise or significant borrowings are required, our liquidity may be affected adversely. our ability to borrow additional funds may be restricted in certain circumstances by the terms of the instruments governing our outstanding indebtedness.
we are party to certain agreements that obligate us to develop senior housing or healthcare properties funded through capital that we and, in certain circumstances, our joint venture partners provide. as of december 31, 2020, we had 13 properties under development pursuant to these agreements, including three properties that are owned by unconsolidated real estate entities. in addition, from time to time, we engage in redevelopment projects with respect to our existing senior housing communities to maximize the value, increase noi, maintain a market-competitive position, achieve property stabilization or change the primary use of the property.
equity offerings from time to time, we may sell up to an aggregate of $1.0 billion of our common stock under an "at-the-market" equity offering program ("atm program"). as of december 31, 2020, we have $755.5 million remaining under our existing atm program. during the years ended december 31, 2020 and 2019, we sold 1.5 million and 2.7 million shares of our common stock under our atm program for gross proceeds of $44.88 and $66.75 per share, respectively. during the year ended december 31, 2018, we sold no shares of common stock under our atm program.
in june 2019, we sold 12.7 million shares of our common stock under a registered public offering for gross proceeds of $62.75 per share. we used the majority of the net proceeds to fund our lgm acquisition. see "note 4 - acquisitions of real estate property" of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in part ii, item 8 of this annual report for additional information regarding the lgm acquisition.

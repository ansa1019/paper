non-gaap financial measures in addition to our u.s. gaap results, we use adjusted results and other non-gaap metrics to evaluate our operating performance in the absence of certain items and for planning and forecasting of future periods. adjusted ebit, adjusted ebit margin, adjusted net earnings, adjusted diluted earnings per share, adjusted effective tax rate and organic constant currency are all non-gaap financial measures. please refer to the accompanying financial tables in the "non-gaap financial measures" section for a discussion of why adp believes these measures are important and for a reconciliation of non-gaap financial measures to their comparable gaap financial measures.
the global covid-19 pandemic has continued to evolve and our priority has been and continues to be the safety of our associates and the needs of our clients. in march 2020, we implemented our business continuity plan and took steps to shift over 98% of our workforce to work from home or off-site locations to ensure uninterrupted service to our clients across our solutions. while we are well-prepared to continue operating this way, we are in the early stages of bringing back a small portion of our workforce to the office on a volunteer-only basis. our sales force will continue to primarily engage with prospects and clients virtually; however, we are beginning to conduct face-to-face meetings in certain geographies to the extent our employees, clients, and prospects are ready to do so. we announced for our employees, excluding corporate officers, a one-time global associate assistance payment of $1,000 (or equivalent, based on the average wage parity in each country) in response to covid-19, totaling $50.4 million. we are also deeply embedded in our local communities and continue to support covid-19 relief efforts through financial donations and donations of medical supplies for hospital workers globally.
as a leading global provider of cloud-based human capital management ("hcm") technology solutions to employers around the world, we have continued to process payroll and tax obligations and provide other hcm services to our clients, despite the unexpected challenges that our clients and their employees around the world are facing. adp's efforts have been focused on providing information and tools to help clients understand and navigate the governmental relief that has been adopted globally. for example, the federal government in the united states enacted the families first coronavirus response act ("ffcra") and the coronavirus aid, relief, and economic security ("cares") act. adp has been working to provide support to all employers on the relief available under both laws. this includes an employer preparedness toolkit that helps explain the federal and state government relief, as well as a website dedicated to providing critical information about the small business administration paycheck protection program ("ppp"). during the second half of fiscal 2020, we rolled out a range of tools and reports to help our clients through the crisis and prepare for the recovery. we implemented over 1,000 feature changes to our products in response to 2,000 legislative updates in 60 countries, and we also had approximately 400,000 clients run over 2 million ppp reports for total loan values up to $115 billion dollars. many of those clients have also now run the necessary payroll reports to apply for their loans to be forgiven. as the global economy and landscape continues to evolve for our clients, whether due to legislative changes or other factors, adp is committed to supporting our clients to help them navigate these challenges.
the significant impact the covid-19 pandemic is having on our clients and the broader economy is in turn having an effect on our reported metrics. despite the fact that we have seen improvement as countries and states are in various stages of reopening and businesses gradually begin to bring a portion of their workers back, we've seen the impact on our full year fiscal 2020 results. employer services new business bookings was down 21% for fiscal 2020 as we saw bookings decline significantly and rapidly in mid-march due to the global social distancing guidelines coupled with the delayed decision making of our clients and prospects which continued into the fourth quarter. we also adjusted gross bookings as a result of client delays on implementation and the expectation that fewer client employees would come on board compared to when the business was originally signed. the peo average number of worksite employees increased 4% for fiscal 2020. our pays per control metric, which represents growth of the employee base for a large portion of our client base, showed a decline in the fourth quarter resulting in annual growth of negative 1.0% for fiscal 2020. in addition, we saw deterioration in employer services retention in fiscal 2020 of 20 basis points to 90.5% due to an increase in out-of-business losses.
while the challenges presented by covid-19 may affect the timing of our execution of parts of our strategy, we remain on a transformation journey, and our initiatives are yielding efficiencies and are focused on changing how we work. in fiscal 2020, we executed on our workforce optimization program and procurement transformation initiatives. for fiscal 2021, we are moving forward with a digital implementation and servicing initiative that leverages many of the capabilities we highlighted at our february 2020 innovation day. despite a challenging end to fiscal 2020, we continued to deliver profit growth during the year ended june 30, 2020. we will continue to monitor macro trends based on externally and internally available data and are using these indicators to drive real-time decisions as we remain committed to our long-term strategy.
we have a strong business model, a highly cash generative business with low capital intensity, and offer a suite of products that provide critical support to our clients' hcm functions. we generate sufficient free cash flow to satisfy our cash dividend and our modest debt obligations, which enables us to absorb the impact of downturns and remain steadfast in our reinvestments, our longer term strategy, and our commitments to shareholder friendly actions. we are committed to building upon our past successes by investing in our business through enhancements in research and development and by driving meaningful transformation in the way we operate. our financial condition remains solid at june 30, 2020 and we remain well positioned to support our associates and our clients.
results and analysis of consolidated operations total revenues for the year ended june 30, respectively:
growth:                          aÃÅ            3%
revenues for fiscal 2020 increased due to new business started from new business bookings, partially offset by business losses. our revenue growth includes one percentage point of pressure from foreign currency. refer to "analysis of reportable segments" for additional discussion of the increases in revenue for both of our reportable segments, employer services and professional employer organization ("peo") services.
total revenues in fiscal 2020 include interest on funds held for clients of $545.2 million, as compared to $561.9 million in fiscal 2019. the decrease in the consolidated interest earned on funds held for clients resulted from the decrease in our average interest rate earned to 2.1% in fiscal 2020, as compared to 2.2% in fiscal 2019. the decrease is partially offset by an increase in our average client funds balances of 2.1% to $26.0 billion in fiscal 2020 as compared to fiscal 2019.
change costs of revenues:
operating expenses                                                $7,404.1                      $7,080.9                      5    %
systems development and programming costs                            674.1                         636.3                      6    %
total costs of revenues                                            8,445.1                       8,021.6                      5    %
n/m - not meaningful operating expenses increased as our peo services zero-margin benefits pass-through costs increased to $2,907.7 million from $2,647.5 million in fiscal 2020 and 2019, respectively. additionally, operating expenses increased due to a change of $59.2 million in our estimated losses related to adp indemnity and a one-time global associate assistance payment in response to covid-19 ("associate assistance payment"). the increase was partially offset by the impact of foreign currency, reduced incentive compensation costs and reduced costs due to certain cost actions as a result of our transformation initiatives including procurement transformation initiatives in fiscal 2020.
systems development and programming costs increased for fiscal 2020 due to increased investments and costs to develop, support, and maintain our products, partially offset by capitalization of costs related to our strategic projects, including our next gen platforms. depreciation and amortization expense increased related to the amortization of our acquisitions of intangibles and internally developed software.
selling, general and administrative expenses decreased for fiscal 2020 due to reduced incentive compensation costs, broad-based efficiencies as a result of our transformation initiatives including procurement transformation initiatives, a decrease in net charges related to our transformation initiatives, reduced facilities costs as a result of covid-19, and impact of foreign currency. the decrease was partially offset by increased selling expenses, an increase in our allowance for doubtful accounts of $26.0 million as a result of an increase in estimated credit losses related to the impact of covid-19 on our clients ("increase in our allowance for doubtful accounts"), severance cost as a result of covid-19 of $25.4 million, a legal settlement accrual of $25.0 million, and an associate assistance payment.

other income, net, increased $36.9 million in fiscal 2020, as compared to fiscal 2019 due to the change in non-service components of pension (income)/expense, net, and the items described below. see note 10 of our consolidated financial statements for further details on non-service components of pension (income)/expense, net.
in fiscal 2020, the company recorded impairment charges of $29.9 million, which is comprised of $25.3 million as a result of recognizing certain owned facilities at fair value given intent to sell and accordingly classified as held for sale and vacating certain leased locations early and recorded total impairment charges of $4.6 million to operating right-of-use assets and certain related fixed assets associated with the vacated locations. in fiscal 2019, the company wrote down $12.1 million of internally developed software which was determined to have no future use due to redundant software identified as part of a recent acquisition.
in fiscal 2019, the company recognized a gain of $15.7 million in relation to the sale of an investment held at cost acquired in prior years and subsequently sold during fiscal 2019.
growth:        aÃÅ        6%       aÃÅ        50bps earnings before income taxes increased in fiscal 2020 due to the increases in revenues partially offset by the increases in expenses discussed above.
overall margin increased in fiscal 2020 as a result of our continued successful execution of our broad-based transformation initiatives including our procurement transformation initiatives as well as operating efficiencies. in addition, our margin improvement was aided by reduced incentive compensation costs, lower transformation initiative related charges of $60.9 million, and reduced facilities costs as result of covid-19. these were partially offset by incremental pressure from growth in our zero-margin benefits pass-throughs, an increase in selling expenses, an increase in amortization expense, a change in our estimated losses related to adp indemnity, an associate assistance payment, an increase in our allowance for doubtful accounts, severance costs as a result of covid-19, and a legal settlement accrual.
growth:        aÃÅ        6%       aÃÅ        60bps adjusted ebit excludes certain interest amounts, net charges related to our transformation initiatives, the impact of the severance charges related to covid-19, accrual for legal settlement, and the gain on sale of assets in the respective periods. for fiscal 2020, adjusted ebit increased due to increases in revenues offset by the increases in expenses discussed above. our adjusted ebit margin reflects changes described above in our ebit margin excluding the net charges noted above.
provision for income taxes the effective tax rate in fiscal 2020 and 2019 was 22.5% and 23.7%, respectively. the decrease in the effective tax rate is primarily due to the release of a valuation allowance related to foreign tax credit carryforwards, a reduction in the operating tax rate due to the mix between domestic and foreign earnings, the benefit of a foreign tax law change and lower reserves for uncertain tax positions during fiscal 2020 partially offset by favorable adjustments to prior year tax liabilities during fiscal 2019. refer to note 11, income taxes, within the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion.
adjusted provision for income taxes the adjusted effective tax rate in fiscal 2020 and 2019 was 22.6% and 23.8%, respectively. the drivers of the adjusted effective tax rate are the same as the drivers of the effective tax rate discussed above.
growth:        aÃÅ        8%       aÃÅ        9%
for fiscal 2020, the net earnings reflect the changes described above in our earnings before income taxes and our effective tax rate.
for fiscal 2020, diluted eps increased as a result of an increase in net earnings and the impact of fewer shares outstanding, resulting from the repurchase of approximately 6.2 million shares in fiscal 2020 and 6.5 million shares in fiscal 2019, partially offset by the issuances of shares under our employee benefit plans.
growth:        aÃÅ        7%       aÃÅ        9%

peo services' revenues increased 8% in fiscal 2020 due to a 4% increase in the average number of worksite employees in fiscal 2020 driven by an increase in the number of new peo services clients and growth in our existing clients. additionally, peo services' revenues, excluding zero-margin benefits pass-through costs, increased 5% in fiscal 2020 and includes pressure from lower workers compensation and state unemployment insurance ("sui") costs and related pricing.
earnings before income taxes peo services' earnings before income taxes decreased 2% in fiscal 2020 due to the increase in expenses partially offset by the increase in revenues discussed above. the increase in expenses was due to the increase in zero-margin benefits pass-through costs of $260.2 million described above and a change of $59.2 million in our estimated losses related to adp indemnity in fiscal 2020, as compared to fiscal 2019.
growth:        aÃÇ        130bps peo services' overall margin decreased for fiscal 2020 due to a change of $59.2 million in our estimated losses related to adp indemnity in fiscal 2020 as compared to fiscal 2019.
adp indemnity provides workers' compensation and employer's liability deductible reimbursement insurance protection for peo services' worksite employees up to $1 million per occurrence. peo services has secured a workers' compensation and employer's liability insurance policy that has a $1 million per occurrence retention and, in fiscal years 2012 and prior, aggregate stop loss insurance that covers any aggregate losses within the $1 million retention that collectively exceed a certain level, from an admitted and licensed insurance company of aig. we utilize historical loss experience and actuarial judgment to determine the estimated claim liability, and changes in estimated ultimate incurred losses are included in the peo segment. adp indemnity recorded a pre-tax loss of approximately $20 million in fiscal 2020 and a pre-tax benefit of approximately $39 million in fiscal 2019, which were primarily a result of changes in our estimated actuarial losses. beginning in fiscal year 2013, adp indemnity paid premiums to enter into reinsurance arrangements with ace american insurance company, a wholly-owned subsidiary of chubb limited, to cover substantially all losses incurred by adp indemnity during these policy years. each of these reinsurance arrangements limits our overall exposure incurred up to a certain limit. we believe the likelihood of ultimate losses exceeding this limit is remote. during fiscal 2020, adp indemnity paid a premium of $215 million to enter into a reinsurance arrangement with chubb limited to cover substantially all losses incurred by adp indemnity for the fiscal 2020 policy year to $1 million per occurrence related to the workers' compensation and employer's liability deductible reimbursement insurance protection for peo services' worksite employees. adp indemnity paid a premium of $240 million in july 2020 to enter into a reinsurance agreement with chubb to cover substantially all losses incurred by adp indemnity for fiscal 2021 policy year on terms substantially similar to the fiscal 2020 reinsurance policy.
other the primary components of "other" are certain corporate overhead charges and expenses that have not been allocated to the reportable segments, including corporate functions, costs related to our transformation office, an associate assistance payment, a legal settlement accrual, non-recurring gains and losses, the elimination of intercompany transactions, and other interest expense.

(a) we include the interest income earned on investments associated with our client funds extended investment strategy and interest expense on borrowings related to our client funds extended investment strategy as we believe these amounts to be fundamental to the underlying operations of our business model. the adjustments in the table above represent the interest income and interest expense that are not related to our client funds extended investment strategy and are labeled as "all other interest expense" and "all other interest income."
(b) in fiscal 2020, transformation initiatives include: (i) charges of $29.9 million related to impairment charges as a result of recognizing certain owned facilities at fair value given intent to sell and accordingly classified as held for sale and impairment charges of operating right-of-use assets and certain related fixed assets associated with the vacating of certain leased locations; (ii) charges of $29.1 million related to severance; (iii) charges of $28.5 million related to other transformation initiatives; all of which were partially offset by net reversals of charges related to voluntary early retirement program ("verp") and service alignment initiative ("sai") of $10.1 million. unlike certain other severance charges in prior periods that are not included as an adjustment to get to adjusted results, these specific charges relate to actions that are part of our broad-based, company-wide transformation initiatives.
(c) represents severance charges related to the impact of covid-19 pandemic. unlike other severance charges in prior periods that are not included as an adjustment to get to adjusted results, these specific charges relate to actions that are part of our broad-based, company-wide initiatives to address excess capacity across our business and functions due to the covid-19 pandemic.
(d) represents a legal settlement accrual related to the illinois biometric privacy act matter. refer to note 12 of our consolidated financial statements for additional detail.
(e) the income tax provision/(benefit) was calculated based on the annualized marginal rate in effect during the quarter of the adjustment.

financial condition, liquidity and capital resources as of june 30, 2020, cash and cash equivalents were $1.9 billion, which were primarily invested in time deposits and money market funds.
for corporate liquidity, we expect existing cash, cash equivalents, long-term marketable securities, cash flow from operations together with our $9.7 billion of committed credit facilities and our ability to access both long-term and short-term debt financing from the capital markets will be adequate to meet our operating, investing, and financing activities such as regular quarterly dividends, share repurchases, and capital expenditures for the foreseeable future. our financial condition remains solid at june 30, 2020 and have sufficient liquidity as note above; however, given the uncertainty in the rapidly changing market and economic conditions related to the covid-19 pandemic, we will continue to evaluate the nature and extent of the impact to our financial condition and liquidity.
for client funds liquidity, we have the ability to borrow through our financing arrangements under our u.s. short-term commercial paper program and our u.s., canadian and united kingdom short-term reverse repurchase agreements, together with our $9.7 billion of committed credit facilities and our ability to use corporate liquidity when necessary to meet short-term funding requirements related to client funds obligations. please see "quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk" for a further discussion of the risks, including with respect to the covid-19 pandemic, related to our client funds extended investment strategy. see note 8 of our consolidated financial statements for a description of our short-term financing including commercial paper.
operating, investing and financing cash flows our cash flows from operating, investing, and financing activities, as reflected in the statements of consolidated cash flows for the years ended 2020 and 2019 are summarized as follows:
2020                        2019                                      $ change cash provided by (used in):
operating activities                                                                                                          $3,026.2                          $2,688.3             $337.9
effect of exchange rate changes on cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash, and restricted cash equivalents                     (34.5)                            (28.8)              (5.7)
net change in cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash, and restricted cash equivalents                                          $257.4                            $254.1               $3.3
net cash flows provided by operating activities in fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2019 include cash payments for reinsurance agreements of $215.0 million and $218.0 million, respectively, which represent the policy premium for the entire fiscal year. the increase in operating cash provided is primarily due to growth in our business supplemented by a growth in non-cash expenses within operating activities and net favorable change in the components of working capital as compared to fiscal 2019.
net cash flows from investing activities changed due to the timing of proceeds and purchases of corporate and client funds marketable securities of $5,256.9 million, proceeds from the sale of assets and lower payments related to acquisitions of business, partially offset by payments related to acquisitions of intangibles and payments related to capital expenditures in fiscal 2020.
net cash flows from financing activities changed due to a net decrease in the cash flow from client funds obligations of $4,909.2 million, which is due to the timing of impounds from our clients and payments to our clients' employees and other payees, more cash returned to shareholders via dividends and share repurchases and a net repayment of reverse repurchase agreements in fiscal 2020.
we purchased approximately 6.2 million shares of our common stock at an average price per share of $160.61 during fiscal 2020, as compared to purchases of 6.5 million shares at an average price per share of $143.02 during fiscal 2019. from time to time, the company may repurchase shares of its common stock under its authorized share repurchase program. the company considers several factors in determining when to execute share repurchases, including, among other things, actual and potential acquisition activity, cash balances and cash flows, issuances due to employee benefit plan activity, and market conditions.
capital resources and client fund obligations on july 15, 2020, the company gave notice to the current holders of our intention to redeem the $1.0 billion 2.25% senior notes due september 15, 2020 on the call date of august 15, 2020. it is the company's intent to issue new long-term notes to fund this redemption and which also may be used for general corporate purposes. if necessary in the interim, the company intends to issue commercial paper to fund the notes' redemption until such time as the new notes are issued.
we have $2.0 billion of senior unsecured notes with maturity dates in 2020 and 2025. we may from time to time revisit the long-term debt market to refinance existing debt, finance investments including acquisitions for our growth, and maintain the appropriate capital structure. however, there can be no assurance that volatility in the global capital and credit markets would not impair our ability to access these markets on terms acceptable to us, or at all. see note 9 of our consolidated financial statements for a description of our notes.
our u.s. short-term funding requirements related to client funds are sometimes obtained on an unsecured basis through the issuance of commercial paper, rather than liquidating previously-collected client funds that have already been invested in available-for-sale securities. in june 2020, the company decreased its u.s. short-term commercial paper program to provide for the issuance of up to $9.7 billion from $10.3 billion in aggregate maturity value. our commercial paper program is rated a-1+ by standard and poor's and prime-1 ("p-1") by moody's. these ratings denote the highest quality commercial paper securities. maturities of commercial paper can range from overnight to up to 364 days. at june 30, 2020 and 2019, we had no commercial paper borrowing outstanding. details of the borrowings under the commercial paper program are as follows:
weighted average maturity (approximately in days)                       2 days                  2 days our u.s., canadian, and united kingdom short-term funding requirements related to client funds obligations are sometimes obtained on a secured basis through the use of reverse repurchase agreements, which are collateralized principally by government and government agency securities, rather than liquidating previously-collected client funds that have already been invested in available-for-sale securities. these agreements generally have terms ranging from overnight to up to five business days. we have successfully borrowed through the use of reverse repurchase agreements on an as-needed basis to meet short-term funding requirements related to client funds obligations. at june 30, 2020 and 2019, the company had $13.6 million and $262.0 million, respectively, of outstanding obligations related to the reverse repurchase agreements. details of the reverse repurchase agreements are as follows:
we vary the maturities of our committed credit facilities to limit the refinancing risk of any one facility. we have a $3.2 billion, 364-day credit agreement that matures in june 2021 with a one year term-out option. in addition, we have a five-year $3.75 billion credit facility and a five-year $2.75 billion credit facility maturing in june 2023 and june 2024, respectively, each with an accordion feature under which the aggregate commitment can be increased by $500 million, subject to the availability of additional commitments. the primary uses of the credit facilities are to provide liquidity to the commercial paper program and funding for general corporate purposes, if necessary. we had no borrowings through june 30, 2020 under the credit facilities. we believe that we currently meet all conditions set forth in the revolving credit agreements to borrow thereunder, and we are not aware of any conditions that would prevent us from borrowing part or all of the $9.7 billion available to us under the revolving credit agreements. see note 8 of our consolidated financial statements for a description of our short-term financing including credit facilities.
our investment portfolio does not contain any asset-backed securities with underlying collateral of sub-prime mortgages, alternative-a mortgages, sub-prime auto loans or sub-prime home equity loans, collateralized debt obligations, collateralized loan obligations, credit default swaps, derivatives, auction rate securities, structured investment vehicles or non-investment grade fixed-income securities. we own aaa-rated senior tranches of primarily fixed rate auto loan, credit card, equipment lease, and rate reduction receivables, secured predominantly by prime collateral. all collateral on asset-backed securities is performing as expected. in addition, we own senior debt directly issued by federal home loan banks and federal farm credit banks. our client funds investment strategy is structured to allow us to average our way through an interest rate cycle by laddering the maturities of our investments out to five years (in the case of the extended portfolio) and out to ten years (in the case of the long portfolio). this investment strategy is supported by our short-term financing arrangements necessary to satisfy short-term funding requirements relating to client funds obligations. see note 4 of our consolidated financial statements for a description of our corporate investments and funds held for clients.
capital expenditures for fiscal 2020 were $168.3 million, as compared to $162.7 million for fiscal 2019. we expect capital expenditures in fiscal 2021 to be between $175 million and $200 million.
contractual obligations the following table provides a summary of our contractual obligations at june 30, 2020:
operating lease obligations (3)                   $105.5                     $168.8                   $100.5                      $96.8                  $-                           $471.6
tax benefits (5)
compensation and benefits (6)                      $34.0                      $63.3                    $59.2                     $308.4                  $27.7                        $492.6
(1)these amounts represent the principal and interest payments of our debt.
(2)during fiscal 2020, we entered into a series of treasury rate lock transactions with an aggregate notional amount totaling $400.0 million, to hedge our exposure to changes in interest rates in anticipation of the refinancing of our fixed-rate notes due september 15, 2020. these amounts represent the aggregate fair value as of june 30, 2020, and is included in other current liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet. refer to note 9 of our consolidated financial statements for additional information.
(3)included in these amounts are various facilities and equipment leases. we enter into operating leases in the normal course of business relating to facilities and equipment. the majority of our lease agreements have fixed payment terms based on the passage of time. certain facility and equipment leases require payment of maintenance and real estate taxes and contain escalation provisions based on future adjustments in price indices. our future operating lease obligations could change if we exit certain contracts or if we enter into additional operating lease agreements.
(4)purchase obligations are comprised of a $240 million reinsurance premium with chubb for the fiscal 2021 policy year, as well as obligations related to software subscription licenses and purchase and maintenance agreements on our software, equipment, and other assets.
(5)based on current estimates, we expect to make cash payments up to $3.7 million in the next twelve months for obligations related to unrecognized tax benefits across various jurisdictions and tax periods. for $58.6 million of obligations related to unrecognized tax benefits we are unable to make reasonably reliable estimates as to the period in which cash payments are expected to be paid.
(6)compensation and benefits primarily relates to amounts associated with our employee benefit plans and other compensation arrangements.  these amounts exclude the estimated contributions to our defined benefit plans, which are expected to be $9.3 million in fiscal 2021.
in addition to the obligations quantified in the table above, we had obligations for the remittance of funds relating to our payroll and payroll tax filing services. as of june 30, 2020, the obligations relating to these matters, which are expected to be paid in fiscal 2021, total $25,831.6 million and were recorded in client funds obligations on our consolidated balance sheets. we had $26,708.1 million of cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities that were impounded from our clients to satisfy such obligations recorded in funds held for clients on our consolidated balance sheets as of june 30, 2020.
separately, adp indemnity paid a premium of $240 million in july 2020 to enter into a reinsurance agreement with chubb to cover substantially all losses incurred by adp indemnity for the fiscal 2021 policy year. at june 30, 2020, adp indemnity had total assets of $548.7 million to satisfy the actuarially estimated unpaid losses of $487.7 million for the policy years since july 1, 2003. adp indemnity paid claims of $4.4 million and $4.0 million, net of insurance recoveries, in fiscal 2020 and 2019, respectively. refer to the "analysis of reportable segments - peo services" above for additional information regarding adp indemnity.
in the normal course of business, we also enter into contracts in which we make representations and warranties that relate to the performance of our services and products. we do not expect any material losses related to such representations and warranties.
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our overall investment portfolio is comprised of corporate investments (cash and cash equivalents, and long-term marketable securities) and client funds assets (funds that have been collected from clients but have not yet remitted to the applicable tax authorities or client employees).
our corporate investments are invested in cash and cash equivalents and highly liquid, investment-grade marketable securities.  these assets are available for our regular quarterly dividends, share repurchases, capital expenditures and/or acquisitions, as well as other corporate operating purposes. all of our long-term fixed-income securities are classified as available-for-sale securities.
our client funds assets are invested with safety of principal, liquidity, and diversification as the primary objectives. consistent with those objectives, we also seek to maximize interest income and to minimize the volatility of interest income.  client funds assets are invested in highly liquid, investment-grade marketable securities, with a maximum maturity of 10 years at the time of purchase, and money market securities and other cash equivalents.
we utilize a strategy by which we extend the maturities of our investment portfolio for funds held for clients and employ short-term financing arrangements to satisfy our short-term funding requirements related to client funds obligations. our client funds investment strategy is structured to allow us to average our way through an interest rate cycle by laddering the maturities of our investments out to five years (in the case of the extended portfolio) and out to ten years (in the case of the long portfolio). as part of our client funds investment strategy, we use the daily collection of funds from our clients to satisfy other unrelated client funds obligations, rather than liquidating previously-collected client funds that have already been invested in available-for-sale securities. in circumstances where we experience a reduction in employment levels due to a slowdown in the economy, we may make tactical decisions to sell certain securities in order to reduce the size of the funds held for clients to correspond to client fund obligations. we minimize the risk of not having funds collected from a client available at the time such client's obligation becomes due by impounding, in virtually all instances, the client's funds in advance of the timing of payment of such client's obligation. as a result of this practice, we have consistently maintained the required level of client funds assets to satisfy all of our obligations.
there are inherent risks and uncertainties involving our investment strategy relating to our client funds assets. such risks include liquidity risk, including the risk associated with our ability to liquidate, if necessary, our available-for-sale securities in a timely manner in order to satisfy our client funds obligations. however, our investments are made with the safety of principal, liquidity, and diversification as the primary goals to minimize the risk of not having sufficient funds to satisfy all of our client funds obligations. we also believe we have significantly reduced the risk of not having sufficient funds to satisfy our client funds obligations by consistently maintaining access to other sources of liquidity, including our corporate cash balances, available borrowings under our $9.7 billion commercial paper program (rated a-1+ by standard and poor's and p-1 by moody's, the highest possible short-term credit ratings), and our ability to engage in reverse repurchase agreement transactions and available borrowings under our $9.7 billion committed credit facilities. the reduced availability of financing during periods of economic turmoil, including the covid-19 pandemic, even to borrowers with the highest credit ratings, may limit our ability to access short-term debt markets to meet the liquidity needs of our business. in addition to liquidity risk, our investments are subject to interest rate risk and credit risk, as discussed below.
we have established credit quality, maturity, and exposure limits for our investments. the minimum allowed credit rating at time of purchase for corporate, canadian government agency and canadian provincial bonds is bbb, for asset-backed securities is aaa, and for municipal bonds is a. the maximum maturity at time of purchase for bbb-rated securities is 5 years, for single a rated securities is 7 years, and for aa-rated and aaa-rated securities is 10 years. time deposits and commercial paper must be rated a-1 and/or p-1. money market funds must be rated aaa/aaa-mf.
average interest rates earned exclusive of realized
as of june 30:
during the three months ended june 30, 2020, the company made a decision to sell certain available-for-sale securities in the funds held for clients as the company anticipated client fund obligations would decline due to reduction in employment levels from a slowdown in the economy as a result of the covid-19 pandemic. to maintain the size of the funds held for clients in line with client fund obligations, the company reduced its holdings of available-for-sale securities in the funds held for clients and sold approximately $1.6 billion of its available-for-sale securities.
we are exposed to interest rate risk in relation to securities that mature, as the proceeds from maturing securities are reinvested. factors that influence the earnings impact of interest rate changes include, among others, the amount of invested funds and the overall portfolio mix between short-term and long-term investments. this mix varies during the fiscal year and is impacted by daily interest rate changes. the annualized interest rate earned on our entire portfolio decreased from 2.2% for fiscal 2019 to 2.1% for fiscal 2020. a hypothetical change in both short-term interest rates (e.g., overnight interest rates or the federal funds rate) and intermediate-term interest rates of 25 basis points applied to the estimated average investment balances and any related short-term borrowings would result in approximately a $17 million impact to earnings before income taxes over the ensuing twelve-month period ending june 30, 2021. a hypothetical change in only short-term interest rates of 25 basis points applied to the estimated average short-term investment balances and any related short-term borrowings would result in approximately an $8 million impact to earnings before income taxes over the ensuing twelve-month period ending june 30, 2021.
we are exposed to credit risk in connection with our available-for-sale securities through the possible inability of the borrowers to meet the terms of the securities.  we limit credit risk by investing in investment-grade securities, primarily aaa-rated and aa- rated securities, as rated by moody's, standard & poor's, dbrs for canadian dollar denominated securities, and fitch for asset-backed and commercial-mortgage-backed securities. approximately 79% of our available-for-sale securities held a aaa-rating or aa-rating at june 30, 2020. in addition, we limit amounts that can be invested in any security other than u.s. government and government agency, canadian government, and united kingdom government securities.
we operate and transact business in various foreign jurisdictions and are therefore exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates that could impact our consolidated results of operations, financial position, or cash flows. we manage our exposure to these market risks through our regular operating and financing activities and, when deemed appropriate, through the use of derivative financial instruments. we may use derivative financial instruments as risk management tools and not for trading purposes.
recently issued accounting pronouncements see note 1, recently issued accounting pronouncements, of notes to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements.
critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes have been prepared in accordance with u.s. gaap. the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates, judgments, and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses and other comprehensive income. we continually evaluate the accounting policies and estimates used to prepare the consolidated financial statements. the estimates are based on historical experience and assumptions believed to be reasonable under current facts and circumstances. actual amounts and results could differ from these estimates made by management. in addition, as the duration and severity of covid-19 pandemic are uncertain, certain of our estimates could require further judgment or modification and therefore carry a higher degree of variability and volatility. as events continue to evolve, our estimates may change materially in future periods. certain accounting policies that require significant management estimates and are deemed critical to our results of operations or financial position are revenue recognition (including deferred costs), goodwill and income taxes. refer to note 1, summary of significant accounting policies, of notes to the consolidated financial statements for discussion of our policies for revenue recognition (including deferred costs), goodwill and income taxes.
goodwill.  goodwill represents the excess of purchase price over the value assigned to the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets of businesses acquired. goodwill is tested annually for impairment or more frequently when an event or circumstance indicates that goodwill might be impaired.
the company's annual goodwill impairment assessment as of june 30, 2020 was performed for all reporting units using a quantitative approach by comparing the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value.  we estimated the fair value of each reporting unit using, as appropriate, the income approach, which is derived using the present value of future cash flows discounted at a risk-adjusted weighted-average cost of capital, and the market approach, which is based upon using market multiples of companies in similar lines of business.  significant assumptions used in determining the fair value of our reporting units include projected revenue growth rates, profitability projections, working capital assumptions, the weighted average cost of capital, the determination of appropriate market comparison companies, and terminal growth rates.  several of these assumptions including projected revenue growth rates and profitability projections are dependent on our ability to upgrade, enhance, and expand our technology and services to meet client needs and preferences.  as such, the determination of fair value requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions related to forecasts of future revenue and operating margins.  based upon the quantitative assessment, the company has concluded that goodwill is not impaired. as the assumptions used in the income approach and market approach can have a material impact on the fair value determinations, we performed a sensitivity analysis and determined that a one percentage point increase in the weighted-average cost of capital would not result in an impairment of goodwill for all reporting units and their fair values substantially exceeded their carrying values.

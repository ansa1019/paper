item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for discussion of 2018 items and year-over-year comparisons between 2019 and 2018 that are not included in this 2020 form 10-k, refer to "item 7. - management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations" found in our form 10-k for the year ended december 31, 2019, that was filed with the securities and exchange commission on february 20, 2020.
executive overview general humana inc., headquartered in louisville, kentucky, is a leading health and well-being company committed to helping our millions of medical and specialty members achieve their best health. our successful history in care delivery and health plan administration is helping us create a new kind of integrated care with the power to improve health and well‐being and lower costs. our efforts are leading to a better quality of life for people with medicare, families, individuals, military service personnel, and communities at large. to accomplish that, we support physicians and other health care professionals as they work to deliver the right care in the right place for their patients, our members. our range of clinical capabilities, resources and tools, such as in‐home care, behavioral health, pharmacy services, data analytics and wellness solutions, combine to produce a simplified experience that makes health care easier to navigate and more effective.
our industry relies on two key statistics to measure performance. the benefit ratio, which is computed by taking total benefits expense as a percentage of premiums revenue, represents a statistic used to measure underwriting profitability. the operating cost ratio, which is computed by taking total operating costs, excluding merger termination fee and related costs, net, and depreciation and amortization, as a percentage of total revenue less investment income, represents a statistic used to measure administrative spending efficiency.
during 2020 we took actions to protect, inform, and care for our members, providers, employees, and other stakeholders associated with the outbreak of the novel coronavirus, or covid-19. specifically, we highlight the following actions to support our members:
• waiving all cost sharing for covid-19 treatment and testing, including inpatient hospital admissions as well as in-network primary care, outpatient behavioral health, and telehealth visits, to reduce financial barriers to members seeking care and to re-engage with their physician, while continuing to encourage the use of telehealth;
• making it easier for members to be tested for covid-19 by offering at-home testing, as well as offering in-home preventive screening and diabetes testing kits to encourage members to seek preventive care that may have been delayed during the pandemic.
• proactively delivering safety kits, including face masks, to members and employee homes to facilitate access to care and support visits to providers safely;
• extending grace periods for premium payments for our fully-insured commercial group members, to ensure continuity of coverage during times of financial stress; and
• establishing a clinical outreach team to proactively engage with our most vulnerable members.
in addition, we took steps to support our provider partners and boost system viability by:
• increasing provider funding, simplifying and expanding claims processing and releasing advanced funding to providers, to get reimbursement payments to providers as quickly as possible and ease financial concerns so that members are able to continue to access the care and information they need; and
• expanding modifications to certain utilization management processes, to ease administrative stress and make sure providers are able to most efficiently care for their patients.
we also supported our workforce keeping them safe and addressing other needs during this time, highlighting the following:
• transitioning nearly 94% of the workforce to work-at-home and equipping them with the necessary technology and resources for a successful remote work environment.
• providing funding for emergency relief for elder and child caregiving and financial hardship from family job loss, food insecurity and household essentials.
• adjusting pay and leave policies to provide additional paid time off to manage personal challenges as a result of covid-19 including school closings and child care.
finally, we continued to support the communities we serve by donating $200 million to the humana foundation to address social determinants of health in an effort to promote more health days and encourage greater health equity.
the emergence and spread of covid-19 has impacted our business. beginning in the second half of march 2020, the implementation of stay-at-home and physical distancing orders and other restrictions on movement and economic activity resulted in the temporary deferral of non-essential care and significant reduction in hospital admissions and overall healthcare system utilization during april 2020. non-covid utilization then began to increase during may and june 2020, and continued to rebound throughout the third quarter and early in the fourth quarter of 2020, reaching approximately 95% of historic baseline levels as of the end of october 2020. then, in the latter half of november and accelerating throughout the month of december, we experienced a significant increase in covid-19 admissions in nearly all of the markets in which we operate across our medicare advantage, medicaid, and group commercial insurance business lines, resulting in higher covid-19 treatment and testing costs. during this period, we also experienced a corresponding decline in non-covid utilization in all service categories to well below the near baseline levels of non-covid utilization witnessed as late as the end of october 2020 (with non-covid utilization in our medicare advantage business running approximately 15% below normal levels at the close of the fourth quarter of 2020). the impact of this decline in non-covid utilization more than offset the higher covid-19 treatment and testing costs during this period. our 2020 results were also impacted by our ongoing pandemic relief efforts and strategic investments in our integrated care delivery model.
we currently anticipate that the higher levels of covid-19 admissions experienced late in 2020, and the corresponding decrease in non-covid utilization, will continue for at least the first few months of 2021. over the course of 2021, we then expect covid utilization to decline as more of our members are vaccinated, and that non-covid utilization will trend back to more normal levels. the significant disruption in utilization during 2020, and in particular the unanticipated decline in non-covid utilization in november and december, also impacted our ability to implement clinical initiatives to manage health care costs and chronic conditions of our members, and appropriately document their risk profiles. we currently expect this may impact our 2021 revenues under the risk adjustment payment model for medicare advantage plans, but that these trends will also normalize in 2022 as non-covid utilization trends back to more normal levels throughout 2021. however, the course and magnitude of these trends and their associated impact remains highly uncertain and subject to a significant number of variables and uncertainties including, among others, the severity and duration of the pandemic, continued actions taken to mitigate the spread of covid-19 (including new covid-19 variants) and in turn, relax those restrictions, the timing and degree in resumption of demand for deferred health care services, the pace of administration of covid-19 vaccines and the effectiveness of those vaccines, and level and cost of treatment and testing, all of which are difficult to predict. as such, our response to this global health crisis and the subsequent recovery will continue to evolve over the coming months.
business segments we manage our business with three reportable segments: retail, group and specialty, and healthcare services. beginning january 1, 2018, we exited the individual commercial fully-insured medical health insurance business, as well as certain other business in 2018, and therefore no longer report separately the individual commercial segment and the other businesses category in the current year. previously, the other businesses category included businesses that were not individually reportable because they did not meet the quantitative thresholds required by generally accepted accounting principles, primarily our closed-block of commercial long-term care insurance policies which were sold in 2018. the reportable segments are based on a combination of the type of health plan customer and adjacent businesses centered on well-being solutions for our health plans and other customers, as described below. these segment groupings are consistent with information used by our chief executive officer, the chief operating decision maker, to assess performance and allocate resources. see note 18 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8. - financial statements and supplementary data for segment financial information.
the retail segment consists of medicare benefits, marketed to individuals or directly via group medicare accounts. in addition, the retail segment also includes our contract with cms to administer the limited income newly eligible transition, or li-net, prescription drug plan program and contracts with various states to provide medicaid, dual eligible, and long-term support services benefits, which we refer to collectively as our state-based contracts. the group and specialty segment consists of employer group commercial fully-insured medical and specialty health insurance benefits marketed to individuals and employer groups, including dental, vision, and other supplemental health benefits, as well as administrative services only, or aso products. in addition, our group and specialty segment includes our military services business, primarily our tricare t2017 east region contract. the healthcare services segment includes services offered to our health plan members as well as to third parties, including pharmacy solutions, provider services, and clinical care service, such as home health and other services and capabilities to promote wellness and advance population health, including our non-consolidating minority investment in kindred at home and the strategic partnership with wcas to develop and operate senior-focused, payor-agnostic, primary care centers.
the results of each segment are measured by income before income taxes and equity in net earnings from equity method investments, or segment earnings. transactions between reportable segments primarily consist of sales of services rendered by our healthcare services segment, primarily pharmacy, provider, and clinical care services, to our retail and group and specialty segment customers. intersegment sales and expenses are recorded at fair value and eliminated in consolidation. members served by our segments often use the same provider networks, enabling us in some instances to obtain more favorable contract terms with providers. our segments also share indirect costs and assets. as a result, the profitability of each segment is interdependent. we allocate most operating expenses to our segments. assets and certain corporate income and expenses are not allocated to the segments, including the portion of investment income not supporting segment operations, interest expense on corporate debt, and certain other corporate expenses. these items are managed at a corporate level. these corporate amounts are reported separately from our reportable segments and are included with intersegment eliminations.
seasonality covid-19 disrupted the pattern of our quarterly earnings and operating cash flows in 2020 largely due to the temporary deferral of non-essential care which resulted in significant reductions in hospital admissions and lower overall healthcare system utilization during higher levels of covid-19 hospital admissions. similar impacts and seasonal disruptions from either higher or lower utilization are expected to persist as we respond to and recover from the covid-19 global health crisis.
one of the product offerings of our retail segment is medicare stand-alone prescription drug plans, or pdps, under the medicare part d program. our quarterly retail segment earnings and operating cash flows are impacted by the medicare part d benefit design and changes in the composition of our membership. the medicare part d benefit design results in coverage that varies as a member's cumulative out-of-pocket costs pass through successive stages of a member's plan period, which begins annually on january 1 for renewals. these plan designs generally result in us sharing a greater portion of the responsibility for total prescription drug costs in the early stages and less in the latter stages. as a result, the pdp benefit ratio generally decreases as the year progresses. in addition, the number of low income senior members as well as year-over-year changes in the mix of membership in our stand-alone pdp products affects the quarterly benefit ratio pattern.
in addition, the retail segment also experiences seasonality in the operating cost ratio as a result of costs incurred in the second half of the year associated with the medicare marketing season.
our group and specialty segment also experiences seasonality in the benefit ratio pattern. however, the effect is opposite of medicare stand-alone pdp in the retail segment, with the group and specialty segment's benefit ratio increasing as fully-insured members progress through their annual deductible and maximum out-of-pocket expenses.
recent transactions in the first quarter of 2020, we purchased privately held enclara healthcare, or enclara, one of the nation's largest hospice pharmacy and benefit management providers for cash consideration of approximately $709 million, net of cash received.
also, in the first quarter of 2020, we entered into a strategic partnership with wcas to accelerate the expansion of our primary care model. the wcas partnership opened 20 payor-agnostic, senior-focused primary care centers during 2020, and is expected to open an additional 30 over the next 2 years.
these transactions are more fully discussed in note 3 to the consolidated financial statements.
•our 2020 results reflect the continued implementation of our strategy to offer our members affordable health care combined with a positive consumer experience in growing markets. at the core of this strategy is our integrated care delivery model, which unites quality care, high member engagement, and sophisticated data analytics. our approach to primary, physician-directed care for our members aims to provide quality care that is consistent, integrated, cost-effective, and member-focused, provided by both employed physicians and physicians with network contract arrangements. the model is designed to improve health outcomes and affordability for individuals and for the health system as a whole, while offering our members a simple, seamless healthcare experience. we believe this strategy is positioning us for long-term growth in both membership and earnings. we offer providers a continuum of opportunities to increase the integration of care and offer assistance to providers in transitioning from a fee-for-service to a value-based arrangement. these include performance bonuses, shared savings and shared risk relationships. at december 31, 2020, approximately 2,650,100 members, or 67%, of our individual medicare advantage members were in value-based relationships under our integrated care delivery model, as compared to 2,407,000 members, or 67%, at december 31, 2019. medicare advantage and dual demonstration program membership enrolled in a humana chronic care management program was 910,600 at december 31, 2020, an increase of 4.8% from 868,800 at december 31, 2019. these members may not be unique to each program since members have the ability to enroll in multiple programs. the increase is driven by our improved process for identifying and enrolling members in the appropriate program at the right time, coupled with growth in special needs plans, or snp, membership.
•on january 15, 2021, centers for medicare & medicaid services, or cms, published its announcement of calendar year 2022 medicare advantage capitation rates and part c and part d payment policies, or the final rate notice. we expect the final rate notice to result in a 3.7% rate increase for non end stage renal disease, or esrd, medicare advantage business, excluding the impact of employer group waiver plan, or egwp, funding changes. our 3.7% rate increase compares to cms's estimate for the sector of 4.08% on a comparable basis, with the variance primarily driven by county rebasing and our geographic footprint. cms also establishes separate rates of payment for esrd beneficiaries enrolled in medicare advantage plans. we expect the final rate notice to result in a 5.0% rate increase in 2021 for esrd beneficiaries. our estimate of 5.0% is equivalent to cms's estimate.
the 2022 benchmark increase of 3.7% includes roughly 0.8% for the projected cost of covid-19 vaccines.
•net income was $3.4 billion for 2020 compared to $2.7 billion in 2019 and earnings per diluted common share increased $5.21 from $20.10 earnings per diluted common share in 2019 to $25.31 earnings per diluted common share in 2020. these comparisons were significantly impacted by the change in the fair value of publicly-traded equity securities, the net receipt of commercial risk corridor receivables previously written off, and the put/call valuation adjustments associated with certain equity method investments. the change in the fair value of our publicly-traded equity securities relates primarily to our common stock holdings, including both the gain resulting from the initial conversion of our prior ownership interest in certain privately held companies, primarily in oak street health, inc., or osh, into common stock upon such companies' initial public offering, or ipo, during the third quarter of 2020, and the subsequent changes in the market value of such securities from their ipo through the end of 2020. in 2020 we received $578 million, net of related fees and expenses pursuant to the u.s. supreme court ruling that the government is obligated to pay the losses under the risk corridor program. the receipt of the risk corridor payments was associated with losses incurred under the health care reform business in 2014 to 2016. the receipt of these risk corridor payments accounted for less than half of our accumulated losses before income taxes from this business during that time period. the impact of these adjustments to our consolidated income before income taxes and equity in net earnings and diluted earnings per common share was as follows for 2020.
change in the fair value of publicly-traded equity securities                      $745                     $-
receipt of commercial risk corridor receivables previously written-off                  578                  -
put/call valuation adjustments                                                    (103)                       506
change in the fair value of publicly-traded equity securities                     $4.32                     $-
receipt of commercial risk corridor receivables previously written-off             3.35                      -
put/call valuation adjustments                                                   (0.60)                   2.89
•excluding these adjustments, our results of operations reflect the impact of the ongoing covid-19 pandemic. comparisons were impacted by cost reductions due to lower non-covid utilization patterns from stay-at-home and physical distancing orders and other restrictions on movement offset by cost increases due to covid-19 treatment and testing costs and our ongoing pandemic relief efforts and strategic investments in our integrated care delivery model. these changes were also favorably impacted by a lower number of shares used to compute dilutive earnings per common share, primarily reflecting share repurchases completed during 2019, partially offset by a higher tax rate resulting from the return of the non-deductible health insurance industry fee in 2020.
health care reform the health care reform law enacted significant reforms to various aspects of the u.s. health insurance industry. certain significant provisions of the health care reform law include, among others, mandated coverage requirements, mandated benefits and guarantee issuance associated with commercial medical insurance, rebates to policyholders based on minimum benefit ratios, adjustments to medicare advantage premiums, the establishment of federally facilitated or state-based exchanges coupled with programs designed to spread risk among insurers, and the introduction of plan designs based on set actuarial values. in addition, the health care reform law established insurance industry assessments, including an annual health insurance industry fee. the annual health insurance industry fee, which is not deductible for income tax purposes and significantly increases our effective tax rate, was suspended in 2019, resumed for calendar year 2020 and, under current law, has been permanently repealed beginning in calendar year 2021.
it is reasonably possible that the health care reform law and related regulations, as well as other current or future legislative, judicial or regulatory changes such as the families first coronavirus response act (the "families first act"), the coronavirus aid, relief, and economic security act (the "cares act") and other legislative or regulatory action taken in response to covid-19 including restrictions on our ability to manage our provider network or otherwise operate our business, or restrictions on profitability, including reviews by regulatory bodies that may compare our medicare advantage profitability to our non-medicare advantage business profitability, or compare the profitability of various products within our medicare advantage business, and require that they remain within certain ranges of each other, increases in member benefits or changes to member eligibility criteria without corresponding increases in premium payments to us, or increases in regulation of our prescription drug benefit businesses, in the aggregate may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations (including restricting revenue, enrollment and premium growth in certain products and market segments, restricting our ability to expand into new markets, increasing our medical and operating costs, further lowering our medicare payment rates and increasing our expenses associated with assessments); our financial position (including our ability to maintain the value of our goodwill); and our cash flows.
we intend for the discussion of our financial condition and results of operations that follows to assist in the understanding of our financial statements and related changes in certain key items in those financial statements from year to year, including the primary factors that accounted for those changes. transactions between reportable segments primarily consist of sales of services rendered by our healthcare services segment, primarily pharmacy, provider, and clinical care services, to our retail and group and specialty segment customers and are described in note 18 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8. - financial statements and supplementary data in this 2020 form 10-k.
comparison of results of operations for 2020 and 2019
certain financial data on a consolidated basis and for our segments was as follows for the years ended december 31, 2020 and 2019:

(a)represents total benefits expense as a percentage of premiums revenue.
(b)represents total operating costs, excluding depreciation and amortization, as a percentage of total revenues less investment income.
premiums revenue consolidated premiums increased $11.2 billion, or 17.9%, from $62.9 billion for 2019 to $74.2 billion for 2020 primarily due to higher premium revenues from medicare advantage and state-based contracts membership growth, higher per member medicare advantage premiums, and the receipt of commercial risk corridor receivables previously written off, partially offset by the impact of declining stand-alone pdp and fully-insured group commercial medical membership as more fully described in the detailed segment results discussion that follows.
services revenue consolidated services revenue increased $376 million, or 26.1%, from $1.4 billion for 2019 to $1.8 billion for 2020, primarily due to an increase in services revenue in the healthcare services segment associated with higher external pharmacy revenues resulting from the enclara acquisition in the first quarter of 2020.
investment income investment income was $1.2 billion for 2020, increasing $653 million, or 130.3%, from 2019, primarily due to the $745 million change in fair value of publicly-traded equity securities during 2020.
benefits expense consolidated benefits expense was $61.6 billion for 2020, an increase of $7.8 billion, or 14.4%, from 2019. the consolidated benefit ratio for 2020 was 83.1%, a decrease of 250 basis points from 2019 primarily reflecting significantly depressed non-covid utilization in the first half of 2020 as well as the last two months of the fourth quarter, the reinstatement of the non-deductible health insurance industry fee in 2020 that was contemplated in the pricing and benefit design of our products, along with the receipt of the commercial risk corridor receivables previously written off. these decreases were partially offset by the meaningful covid-19 treatment and testing costs along with our ongoing pandemic relief efforts and strategic investments in our integrated care delivery model, as well as lower prior-period medical claims reserve development.
we experienced favorable medical claims reserve development related to prior fiscal years of $313 million in 2020 and $336 million in 2019. the favorable prior-period medical claims reserve development decreased the consolidated benefit ratio by approximately 40 basis points in 2020 and 50 basis points in 2019.
operating costs our segments incur both direct and shared indirect operating costs. we allocate the indirect costs shared by the segments primarily as a function of revenues. as a result, the profitability of each segment is interdependent.
consolidated operating costs increased $2.7 billion, or 36.2%, from 2019 to $10.1 billion in 2020 reflecting an increase in operating costs in the retail and the group and specialty segments as discussed in the detailed segment results discussion that follows.
the consolidated operating cost ratio for 2020 was 13.2%, increasing 170 basis points from 11.5% in 2019 primarily due to the reinstatement of the non-deductible health insurance industry fee in 2020, covid-19 related administrative costs, including those associated with purchasing personal protective equipment for our clinicians and the build-out of infrastructure necessary to support employees working remotely. higher marketing spend associated with the medicare annual election period, or aep, strategic investments in our integrated care delivery model and continued support for our constituents, including a $200 million contribution to the humana foundation to support the communities served by us, particularly those with social and health disparities, also contributed to the increase. these increases were partially offset by scale efficiencies associated with growth in our medicare advantage membership, significant operating cost efficiencies in 2020 driven by previously disclosed productivity initiatives, and the net impact of the receipt of the commercial risk corridor receivables previously written off. the nondeductible health insurance industry fee impacted the operating cost ratio by 160 basis points in 2020.
depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization in 2020 totaled $489 million compared to $458 million in 2019, an increase of 6.8%, primarily due to capital expenditures.
interest expense interest expense was $283 million for 2020 compared to $242 million for 2019, an increase of $41 million, or 16.9%. this increase primarily was due to the higher average borrowings outstanding.
income taxes our effective tax rate during 2020 was 28.0% compared to the effective tax rate of 22.0% in 2019. this change primarily was due to the reinstatement of the non-deductible health insurance industry fee in 2020. see note 12 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8. - financial statements and supplementary data for a complete reconciliation of the federal statutory rate to the effective tax rate.

•retail segment earnings were $3.0 billion in 2020, an increase of $782 million, or 35.0%, compared to $2.2 billion in 2019 primarily resulting from the net favorable impact of a lower benefit ratio, partially offset by a higher operating cost ratio as more fully described below.
•individual medicare advantage membership increased 375,500 members, or 10.5%, from 3,587,200 members as of december 31, 2019 to 3,962,700 members as of december 31, 2020, primarily due to membership additions associated with the 2020 annual election period, or aep, continued enrollment due to special elections, age-ins, and and dual eligible special need plans, or d-snp, members as well as the 2020 open election period, or oep, for medicare beneficiaries. the 2020 oep sales period, which ran from january 1 to march 31, 2020, added approximately 30,000 members. individual medicare advantage membership includes 406,100 d-snp members as of december 31, 2020, a net increase of 117,900, or 40.9%, from 288,200 december 31, 2019. for the full year 2021, we anticipate a net membership increase in our individual medicare advantage offerings of 425,000 members to 475,000 members.

•state-based medicaid membership increased 303,400 members, or 64.7%, from 469,000 members as of december 31, 2019 to 772,400 members as of december 31, 2020, primarily reflecting the impact of discontinuing the reinsurance agreement with caresource and the assumption of full financial risk for the existing kentucky medicaid contract as of january 1, 2020, as well as additional enrollment resulting from the current economic downturn due to the covid-19 pandemic.
•retail segment premiums increased $10.9 billion, or 19.3%, from 2019 to 2020 primarily due to higher premiums as a result of medicare advantage and state-based contracts membership growth and higher per member medicare advantage premiums. these favorable items were partially offset by the decline in membership in our stand-alone pdp offerings.
benefits expense
•the retail segment benefit ratio of 84.2% for 2020 decreased 220 basis points from 86.4% in 2019 primarily reflecting significantly depressed non-covid utilization in the first half of 2020 as well as in the last two months of 2020 and the reinstatement of the non-deductible health insurance industry fee in 2020 which was contemplated in the pricing and benefit design of our products. these were partially offset by meaningful covid-19 treatment costs and testing, our ongoing pandemic relief efforts and strategic investments in our integrated care delivery model, the impact from a shift in medicare membership mix, and lower favorable prior-period medical claims reserve development.
•the retail segment's benefits expense for 2020 included the beneficial effect of $266 million in favorable prior-year medical claims reserve development versus $386 million in 2019. this favorable prior-year medical claims reserve development decreased the retail segment benefit ratio by approximately 40 basis points in 2020 versus approximately 70 basis points in 2019.
operating costs
•the retail segment operating cost ratio of 11.0% for 2020 increased 160 basis points from 9.4% in 2019 primarily due to the reinstatement of the non-deductible health insurance industry fee in 2020, covid-19 related administrative costs as previously discussed, continued support for our constituents and strategic investments in our integrated care delivery model, and increased spending associated with medicare aep. these were partially offset by scale efficiencies associated with growth in our medicare advantage membership and significant operating cost efficiencies driven by previously disclosed productivity initiatives.

operating costs
•the healthcare services segment operating cost ratio of 96.3% for 2020 decreased 10 basis points from 96.4% in 2019 due to operational improvements and reduced utilization resulting from covid-19 in our provider services business, as well as significant operating cost efficiencies in 2020 driven by previously disclosed productivity initiatives. these decreases were partially offset by covid-19 administrative related costs, including expenses associated with additional safety measures taken for our pharmacy, provider, and clinical teams who have continued to provide services to members during the covid-19 pandemic. the increase further reflects higher costs incurred in the pharmacy business to ensure timely delivery of prescriptions amid the covid-19 pandemic and additional investments in the segment's provider business related to marketing and aep initiatives.
liquidity historically, our primary sources of cash have included receipts of premiums, services revenue, and investment and other income, as well as proceeds from the sale or maturity of our investment securities, and borrowings. our primary uses of cash historically have included disbursements for claims payments, operating costs, interest on borrowings, taxes, purchases of investment securities, acquisitions, capital expenditures, repayments on borrowings, dividends, and share repurchases. because premiums generally are collected in advance of claim payments by a period of up to several months, our business normally should produce positive cash flows during periods of increasing premiums and enrollment. conversely, cash flows would be negatively impacted during periods of decreasing premiums and enrollment. from period to period, our cash flows may also be affected by the timing of working capital items including premiums receivable, benefits payable, and other receivables and payables. our cash flows are impacted by the timing of payments to and receipts from cms associated with medicare part d subsidies for which we do not assume risk. the use of cash flows may be limited by regulatory requirements of state departments of insurance (or comparable state regulators) which require, among other items, that our regulated subsidiaries maintain minimum levels of capital and seek approval before paying dividends from the subsidiaries to the parent. our use of cash flows derived from our non-insurance subsidiaries, such as in our healthcare services segment, is generally not restricted by state departments of insurance (or comparable state regulators).

cash and cash equivalents increased to $4.7 billion at december 31, 2020 from $4.1 billion at december 31, 2019. the change in cash and cash equivalents for the years ended december 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 is summarized as follows:
net cash provided by operating activities                   $5,639                  $5,284                    $2,173
cash flow from operating activities the increase in operating cash flows in 2020 was primarily due to the impact of higher earnings and the timing of working capital items, in particular; the impact of medicare advantage membership growth on ibnr, described below, as claim payments related to new members lag the related premium collected.
the most significant drivers of changes in our working capital are typically the timing of payments of benefits expense and receipts for premiums. we illustrate these changes with the following summaries of benefits payable and receivables.

(1)ibnr represents an estimate of benefits payable for claims incurred but not reported (ibnr) at the balance sheet date and includes unprocessed claim inventories. the level of ibnr is primarily impacted by membership levels, medical claim trends and the receipt cycle time, which represents the length of time between when a claim is initially incurred and when the claim form is received and processed (i.e. a shorter time span results in a lower ibnr).
(2)reported claims in process represents the estimated valuation of processed claims that are in the post claim adjudication process, which consists of administrative functions such as audit and check batching and handling, as well as amounts owed to our pharmacy benefit administrator which fluctuate due to bi-weekly payments and the month-end cutoff.
(3)other benefits payable include amounts owed to providers under capitated and risk sharing arrangements.
the increase in benefits payable in 2020 was primarily due to an increase in ibnr, mainly as a result of medicare advantage membership growth. in addition, 2020 was impacted by an increase in the amounts owed to providers under capitated and risk sharing arrangements, primarily related to medicare advantage membership growth in risk sharing arrangements and higher provider surplus amounts driven by lower utilization due to covid-19.

military services receivables at december 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018 primarily consist of administrative services only fees owed from the federal government for administrative services provided under our tricare contracts.
many provisions of the health care reform law became effective in 2014, including the non-deductible health insurance industry fee. the annual health insurance industry fee, which is not deductible for income tax purposes and significantly increases our effective tax rate, was suspended in 2019, resumed for calendar year 2020 and, under current law, has been permanently repealed beginning in calendar year 2021. we paid the federal government annual health insurance industry fees of $1.18 billion in 2020.

our ongoing capital expenditures primarily relate to our information technology initiatives, support of services in our provider services operations including medical and administrative facility improvements necessary for activities such as the provision of care to members, claims processing, billing and collections, wellness solutions, care coordination, regulatory compliance and customer service. total capital expenditures, excluding acquisitions, were $964 million in 2020, $736 million in 2019, and $612 million in 2018. the increase in capital expenditures year over year was primarily due to information technology expenditures supporting our integrated care delivery model.
in 2018, we completed the sale of our wholly-owned subsidiary kmg america corporation, or kmg, to continental general insurance company, or cgic. upon closing, we funded the transaction with approximately $190 million of parent company cash contributed into kmg, subject to customary adjustments, in addition to the transfer of approximately $160 million of statutory capital with the sale. total cash and cash equivalents, including parent company funding, disposed at the time of sale, was $805 million. see note 3 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8. - financial statements and supplementary data.

cash flow from financing activities our financing cash flows are significantly impacted by the timing of claims payments and the related receipts from cms associated with medicare part d claim subsidies for which we do not assume risk. monthly prospective payments from cms for reinsurance and low-income cost subsidies are based on assumptions submitted with our annual bid. settlement of the reinsurance and low-income cost subsidies is based on a reconciliation made approximately 9 months after the close of each calendar year. claim payments were higher than receipts from cms associated with medicare part d claim subsidies for which we do not assume risk by $938 million, $560 million and $653 million in the 2020, 2019 and 2018 periods, respectively. our net receivable from cms for subsidies and brand name prescription drug discounts was $1.2 billion at december 31, 2020 compared to a net receivable of $229 million at december 31, 2019.
under our administrative services only tricare contract, health care costs payments for which we do not assume risk exceeded reimbursements from the federal government by $1 million and $63 million in the 2020 and 2019 periods, respectively, and reimbursements from the federal government exceeded health care costs payments for which we do not assume risk by $38 million in the 2018 period.
claim payments associated with cost sharing provisions of the health care reform law for which we do not assume risk were $25 million in the 2018 period.
in december 2020, we repaid $400 million aggregate principal amount of our 2.5% senior notes due on their maturity date of december 15, 2020.

in november 2018, we entered into a $1.0 billion term note agreement with a bank at a variable rate of interest due within one year. we repaid $350 million of the outstanding amount in 2018. for a detailed discussion of our debt please refer to note 13 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8. - financial statements and supplementary data.
we repurchased common shares for $1.82 billion, $1.07 billion and $1.09 billion in 2020, 2019 and 2018 under share repurchase plans authorized by the board of directors and in connection with employee stock plans.
we paid dividends to stockholders of $323 million in 2020, $291 million in 2019, and $265 million in 2018.
we entered into a commercial paper program in october 2014. net proceeds from issuance of commercial paper were $295 million in 2020 and the maximum principal amount outstanding at any one time during 2020 was $600 million. net repayments from the issuance of commercial paper were $360 million in 2019 and the maximum principal amount outstanding at any one time during 2019 was $801 million. net proceeds from issuance of commercial paper were $485 million in 2018 and the maximum principal amount outstanding at any one time during 2018 was $923 million.
the remainder of the cash used in or provided by financing activities in 2020, 2019, and 2018 primarily resulted from proceeds from stock option exercises and the change in book overdraft.

debt in december 2020, we repaid $400 million aggregate principal amount of our 2.5% senior notes due on their maturity date of december 15, 2020.
in march 2020, we issued $600 million of 4.500% senior notes due april 1, 2025 and $500 million of 4.875% senior notes due april 1, 2030. our net proceeds, reduced for the underwriters' discount and commission and offering expenses paid, were approximately $1,088 million as of december 31, 2020. we used the net proceeds for general corporate purposes.
in february 2020, we entered into a new $1 billion term loan commitment with a bank that matures 1 year after the first draw, subject to a 1 year extension. in march 2020, we made a draw on the entire term loan commitment of $1 billion. the facility fee, interest rate and financial covenants are consistent with those of our revolving credit agreement. the note was prepayable without penalty. we repaid the $1 billion outstanding balance in november 2020.
for a detailed discussion of our debt, including our senior notes, credit agreement and commercial paper program, please refer to note 13 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8. - financial statements and supplementary data.
acquisitions and divestiture during 2020, we completed the acquisition of privately held enclara, one of the nation's largest hospice pharmacy and benefit management providers for cash consideration of approximately $709 million, net of cash received. for a detailed discussion of our acquisitions and divestitures, please refer to notes 3 and 4 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8. - financial statements and supplementary data.
liquidity requirements we believe our cash balances, investment securities, operating cash flows, and funds available under our credit agreement and our commercial paper program or from other public or private financing sources, taken together, provide adequate resources to fund ongoing operating and regulatory requirements, acquisitions, future expansion opportunities, and capital expenditures for at least the next twelve months, as well as to refinance or repay debt, and repurchase shares.
adverse changes in our credit rating may increase the rate of interest we pay and may impact the amount of credit available to us in the future. our investment-grade credit rating at december 31, 2020 was bbb+ according to standard & poor's rating services, or s&p, and baa3 according to moody's investors services, inc., or moody's. a downgrade by s&p to bb+ or by moody's to ba1 triggers an interest rate increase of 25 basis points with respect to $250 million of our senior notes. successive one notch downgrades increase the interest rate an additional 25 basis points, or annual interest expense by $1 million, up to a maximum 100 basis points, or annual interest expense by $3 million.
in addition, we operate as a holding company in a highly regulated industry. humana inc., our parent company, is dependent upon dividends and administrative expense reimbursements from our subsidiaries, most of which are subject to regulatory restrictions. we continue to maintain significant levels of aggregate excess statutory capital and surplus in our state-regulated operating subsidiaries. cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments at the parent company decreased to $772 million at december 31, 2020 from $1.4 billion at december 31, 2019. this decrease primarily reflects common stock repurchases, insurance subsidiaries' capital contributions, repayment of debt and capital expenditures partially offset by insurance subsidiaries dividends, non-insurance subsidiaries' profits and net proceeds from debt issuance. our use of operating cash derived from our non-insurance subsidiaries, such as our healthcare services segment, is generally not restricted by departments of insurance (or comparable state regulatory agencies). our regulated insurance subsidiaries paid dividends to our parent company of $1.3 billion in 2020, $1.8 billion in 2019, and $2.3 billion in 2018. subsidiary capital requirements from significant premium growth has impacted the amount of regulated subsidiary dividends over the last two years. refer to our parent company financial statements and accompanying notes in schedule i - parent company financial information. the amount of ordinary dividends that may be paid to our parent company in 2021 is approximately $1.4 billion, in the aggregate. actual dividends paid may vary due to consideration of excess statutory capital and surplus and expected future surplus requirements related to, for example, premium volume and product mix.
regulatory requirements for a detailed discussion of our regulatory requirements, including aggregate statutory capital and surplus as well as dividends paid from the subsidiaries to our parent, please refer to note 16 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8. - financial statements and supplementary data.
off-balance sheet arrangements as of december 31, 2020, we were not involved in any special purpose entity, or spe, transactions. for a detailed discussion of off-balance sheet arrangements, please refer to note 17 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8. - financial statements and supplementary data.

critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america. the preparation of these financial statements and accompanying notes requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. we continuously evaluate our estimates and those critical accounting policies primarily related to benefits expense and revenue recognition as well as accounting for impairments related to our investment securities, goodwill, and long-lived assets. these estimates are based on knowledge of current events and anticipated future events and, accordingly, actual results ultimately may differ from those estimates. we believe the following critical accounting policies involve the most significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.
benefits expense recognition benefits expense is recognized in the period in which services are provided and includes an estimate of the cost of services which have been incurred but not yet reported, or ibnr. ibnr represents a substantial portion of our benefits payable as follows:
december 31, 2020                    percentage                   december 31, 2019                    percentage of total                                                          of total

our reserving practice is to consistently recognize the actuarial best point estimate within a level of confidence required by actuarial standards. for further discussion of our reserving methodology, including our use of completion and claims per member per month trend factors to estimate ibnr, refer to note 2 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8. - financial statements and supplementary data.
the completion and claims per member per month trend factors are the most significant factors impacting the ibnr estimate. the portion of ibnr estimated using completion factors for claims incurred prior to the most recent two months is generally less variable than the portion of ibnr estimated using trend factors. the following table illustrates the sensitivity of these factors assuming moderately adverse experience and the estimated potential impact on our operating results caused by reasonably likely changes in these factors based on december 31, 2020 data:
completion factor (a):                                             claims trend factor (b):
factor                  decrease in                                  factor                  decrease in change (c)                  benefits payable                         change (c)                  benefits payable
(a)reflects estimated potential changes in benefits payable at december 31, 2020 caused by changes in completion factors for incurred months prior to the most recent two months.
(b)reflects estimated potential changes in benefits payable at december 31, 2020 caused by changes in annualized claims trend used for the estimation of per member per month incurred claims for the most recent two months.
(c)the factor change indicated represents the percentage point change.
the following table provides a historical perspective regarding the accrual and payment of our benefits payable. components of the total incurred claims for each year include amounts accrued for current year estimated benefits expense as well as adjustments to prior year estimated accruals. refer to note 11 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8. - financial statements and supplementary data for retail and group and specialty segment tables including information about incurred and paid claims development as of december 31, 2020, net of reinsurance, as well as cumulative claim frequency and the total of ibnr included within the net incurred claims amounts.
the following table summarizes the changes in estimate for incurred claims related to prior years attributable to our key assumptions. as previously described, our key assumptions consist of trend and completion factors estimated using an assumption of moderately adverse conditions. the amounts below represent the difference between our original estimates and the actual benefits expense ultimately incurred as determined from subsequent claim payments.

as previously discussed, our reserving practice is to consistently recognize the actuarial best estimate of our ultimate liability for claims. actuarial standards require the use of assumptions based on moderately adverse experience, which generally results in favorable reserve development, or reserves that are considered redundant. we experienced favorable medical claims reserve development related to prior fiscal years of $313 million in 2020, $336 million in 2019, and $503 million in 2018. the table below details our favorable medical claims reserve development related to prior fiscal years by segment for 2020, 2019, and 2018.

the favorable medical claims reserve development for 2020, 2019, and 2018 primarily reflects the consistent application of trend and completion factors estimated using an assumption of moderately adverse conditions. our favorable development for each of the years presented above is discussed further in note 11 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8. - financial statements and supplementary data.
we continually adjust our historical trend and completion factor experience with our knowledge of recent events that may impact current trends and completion factors when establishing our reserves. because our reserving practice is to consistently recognize the actuarial best point estimate using an assumption of moderately adverse conditions as required by actuarial standards, there is a reasonable possibility that variances between actual trend and completion factors and those assumed in our december 31, 2020 estimates would fall towards the middle of the ranges previously presented in our sensitivity table.
revenue recognition we generally establish one-year commercial membership contracts with employer groups, subject to cancellation by the employer group on 30-day written notice. our medicare contracts with cms renew annually. our military services contracts with the federal government and certain contracts with various state medicaid programs generally are multi-year contracts subject to annual renewal provisions.
we receive monthly premiums from the federal government and various states according to government specified payment rates and various contractual terms. we bill and collect premiums from employer groups and members in our medicare and other individual products monthly. changes in premium revenues resulting from the periodic changes in risk-adjustment scores derived from medical diagnoses for our membership are estimated by projecting the ultimate annual premium and recognized ratably during the year with adjustments each period to reflect changes in the ultimate premium.
premiums revenue is estimated by multiplying the membership covered under the various contracts by the contractual rates. premiums revenue is recognized as income in the period members are entitled to receive services, and is net of estimated uncollectible amounts, retroactive membership adjustments, and adjustments to recognize rebates under the minimum benefit ratios required under the health care reform law. we estimate policyholder rebates by projecting calendar year minimum benefit ratios for the small group and large group markets, as defined by the health care reform law using a methodology prescribed by hhs, separately by state and legal entity. medicare advantage products are also subject to minimum benefit ratio requirements under the health care reform law. estimated calendar year rebates recognized ratably during the year are revised each period to reflect current experience. retroactive membership adjustments result from enrollment changes not yet processed, or not yet reported by an employer group or the government. we routinely monitor the collectability of specific accounts, the aging of receivables, historical retroactivity trends, estimated rebates, as well as prevailing and anticipated economic conditions, and reflect any required adjustments in current operations. premiums received prior to the service period are recorded as unearned revenues.
medicare risk-adjustment provisions cms utilizes a risk-adjustment model which apportions premiums paid to medicare advantage, or ma, plans according to health severity. the risk-adjustment model, which cms implemented pursuant to the balanced budget act of 1997 (bba) and the benefits improvement and protection act of 2000 (bipa), generally pays more for enrollees with predictably higher costs. under the risk-adjustment methodology, all ma plans must collect from providers and submit the necessary diagnosis code information to cms within prescribed deadlines. the cms risk-adjustment model uses this diagnosis data to calculate the risk-adjusted premium payment to ma plans. rates paid to ma plans are established under an actuarial bid model, including a process that bases our payments on a comparison of our beneficiaries' risk scores, derived from medical diagnoses, to those enrolled in the government's medicare ffs program. we generally rely on providers, including certain providers in our network who are our employees, to code their claim submissions with appropriate diagnoses, which we send to cms as the basis for our payment received from cms under the actuarial risk-adjustment model. we also rely on providers to appropriately document all medical data, including the diagnosis data submitted with claims. cms is phasing-in the process of calculating risk scores using diagnoses data from the risk adjustment processing system, or raps, to diagnoses data from the encounter data system, or eds. the raps process requires ma plans to apply a filter logic based on cms guidelines and only submit diagnoses that satisfy those guidelines. for submissions through eds, cms requires ma plans to submit all the encounter data and cms will apply the risk adjustment filtering logic to determine the risk scores. for 2020, 50% of the risk score was calculated from claims data submitted through eds. cms increased that percentage to 75% for 2021 and will complete the phased-in transition from raps to eds by using only eds data to calculate risk scores in 2022. the phase-in from raps to eds could result in different risk scores from each dataset as a result of plan processing issues, cms processing issues, or filtering logic differences between raps and eds, and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position, or cash flows. we estimate risk-adjustment revenues based on medical diagnoses for our membership. the risk-adjustment model, including cms changes to the submission process, is more fully described in item 1. - business under the section titled "individual medicare," and in item 1a. - risk factors.
investment securities investment securities totaled $13.8 billion, or 39% of total assets at december 31, 2020, and $11.4 billion, or 39% of total assets at december 31, 2019. the investment portfolio was primarily comprised of debt securities, detailed below, at december 31, 2020 and entirely at december 31, 2019. the fair value of investment securities were as follows at december 31, 2020 and 2019:
12/31/2020                    percentage                    12/31/2019                    percentage of total                                                    of total
u.s. treasury and agency obligations                          $616                           4.5     %                    $354                           3.1     %
approximately 96% of our debt securities were investment-grade quality, with a weighted average credit rating of aa- by s&p at december 31, 2020. most of the debt securities that were below investment-grade were rated bb, the higher end of the below investment-grade rating scale. tax-exempt municipal securities were diversified among general obligation bonds of states and local municipalities in the united states as well as special revenue bonds issued by municipalities to finance specific public works projects such as utilities, water and sewer, transportation, or education. our general obligation bonds are diversified across the united states with no individual state exceeding 1% of our total debt securities. our investment policy limits investments in a single issuer and requires diversification among various asset types.
gross unrealized losses and fair values aggregated by investment category and length of time that individual securities have been in a continuous unrealized loss position were as follows at december 31, 2020:
u.s. treasury and agency obligations                 $225                       $(1)                            $-                   $-                              $225                $(1)
prior to january 1, 2020, we applied the other-than-temporary impairment model for securities in an unrealized loss position which did not result in any material impairments for 2019 or 2018. beginning on january 1, 2020, we adopted the new current expected credit losses, or cecl, model which retained many similarities from the previous other-than-temporary impairment model except eliminating from consideration in the impairment analysis the length of time over which the fair value had been less than cost. also, under the cecl model, expected losses on available for sale debt securities are recognized through an allowance for credit losses rather than as reductions in the amortized cost of the securities. for debt securities whose fair value is less than their amortized cost which we do not intend to sell or are not required to sell, we evaluate the expected cash flows to be received as compared to amortized cost and determine if an expected credit loss has occurred. in the event of an expected credit loss, only the amount of the impairment associated with the expected credit loss is recognized in income with the remainder, if any, of the loss recognized in other comprehensive income. to the extent we have the intent to sell the debt security or it is more likely than not we will be required to sell the debt security before recovery of our amortized cost basis, we recognize an impairment loss in income in an amount equal to the full difference between the amortized cost basis and the fair value.
potential expected credit loss impairment is considered using a variety of factors, including the extent to which the fair value has been less than cost; adverse conditions specifically related to the industry, geographic area or financial condition of the issuer or underlying collateral of a debt security; changes in the quality of the debt security's credit enhancement; payment structure of the debt security; changes in credit rating of the debt security by the rating agencies; failure of the issuer to make scheduled principal or interest payments on the debt security and changes in prepayment speeds. for debt securities, we take into account expectations of relevant market and economic data. for example, with respect to mortgage and asset-backed securities, such data includes underlying loan level data and structural features such as seniority and other forms of credit enhancements. we estimate the amount of the expected credit loss component of a debt security as the difference between the amortized cost and the present value of the expected cash flows of the security. the present value is determined using the best estimate of future cash flows discounted at the implicit interest rate at the date of purchase. the expected credit loss cannot exceed the full difference between the amortized cost basis and the fair value.
the risks inherent in assessing the impairment of an investment include the risk that market factors may differ from our expectations, facts and circumstances factored into our assessment may change with the passage of time, or we may decide to subsequently sell the investment. the determination of whether a decline in the value of an investment is related to a credit event requires us to exercise significant diligence and judgment. the discovery of new information and the passage of time can significantly change these judgments. the status of the general economic environment and significant changes in the national securities markets influence the determination of fair value and the assessment of investment impairment. there is a continuing risk that declines in fair value may occur and additional material realized losses from sales or expected credit loss impairments may be recorded in future periods.
all issuers of debt securities we own that were trading at an unrealized loss at december 31, 2020 remain current on all contractual payments. after taking into account these and other factors previously described, we believe these unrealized losses primarily were caused by an increase in market interest rates in the current markets since the time the debt securities were purchased. at december 31, 2020, we did not intend to sell any debt securities with an unrealized loss position in accumulated other comprehensive income, and it is not likely that we will be required to sell these debt securities before recovery of their amortized cost basis. additionally, we did not record any material credit allowances for debt securities that were in an unrealized loss position at december 31, 2020. there were no material other-than-temporary impairments in 2019 or 2018.
goodwill and long-lived assets at december 31, 2020, goodwill and other long-lived assets represented 20% of total assets and 52% of total stockholders' equity, compared to 21% and 50%, respectively, at december 31, 2019.
we are required to test at least annually for impairment at a level of reporting referred to as the reporting unit, and more frequently if adverse events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset may be impaired. a reporting unit either is our operating segments or one level below the operating segments, referred to as a component, which comprise our reportable segments. a component is considered a reporting unit if the component constitutes a business for which discrete financial information is available that is regularly reviewed by management. we are required to aggregate the components of an operating segment into one reporting unit if they have similar economic characteristics. goodwill is assigned to the reporting unit that is expected to benefit from a specific acquisition.
we use the one-step process to review goodwill for impairment to determine both the existence and amount of goodwill impairment, if any. our strategy, long-range business plan, and annual planning process support our goodwill impairment tests. these tests are performed, at a minimum, annually in the fourth quarter, and are based on an evaluation of future discounted cash flows. we rely on this discounted cash flow analysis to determine fair value. however outcomes from the discounted cash flow analysis are compared to other market approach valuation methodologies for reasonableness. we use discount rates that correspond to a market-based weighted-average cost of capital and terminal growth rates that correspond to long-term growth prospects, consistent with the long-term inflation rate. key assumptions in our cash flow projections, including changes in membership, premium yields, medical and operating cost trends, and certain government contract extensions, are consistent with those utilized in our long-range business plan and annual planning process. if these assumptions differ from actual, including the impact of the health care reform law or changes in government reimbursement rates, the estimates underlying our goodwill impairment tests could be adversely affected. the fair value of our reporting units with significant goodwill exceeded carrying amounts by a substantial margin. however, unfavorable changes in key assumptions or combinations of assumptions including a significant increase in the discount rate, decrease in the long-term growth rate or substantial reduction in our underlying cash flow assumptions, including revenue growth rates, medical and operating cost trends, and projected operating income could have a significant negative impact on the estimated fair value of our clinical and provider reporting units, which accounted for $524 million and $761 million, respectively. impairment tests completed for 2020, 2019, and 2018 did not result in an impairment loss.
long-lived assets consist of property and equipment and other finite-lived intangible assets. these assets are depreciated or amortized over their estimated useful life, and are subject to impairment reviews. we periodically review long-lived assets whenever adverse events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable. in assessing recoverability, we must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine if an impairment loss may exist, and, if so, estimate fair value. we also must estimate and make assumptions regarding the useful life we assign to our long-lived assets. if these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future, we may be required to record impairment losses or change the useful life, including accelerating depreciation or amortization for these assets. there were no material impairment losses in the last three years.

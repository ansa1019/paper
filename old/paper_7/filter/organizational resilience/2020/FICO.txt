for our scores segment, our industry leading business-to-business fico® scores have achieved a multi-year expansion in the growing u.s. business-to-consumer market. we have launched numerous new fico® score-based products, and continue to grow our business-to-consumer partnership with experian, a leading global information services provider. this partnership provides consumers the fico® score that lenders most commonly use in evaluating credit when determining applicant eligibility for new credit cards, car loans, mortgages or other lines of credit and can be accessed through experian.com. the fico® score open access program, which allows our participating clients to provide their customers with a free fico® score along with content to help them understand the fico® score their lender uses, has more than 240 million consumer accounts with access to their free fico® scores. we continue to pursue additional partners to distribute fico® scores with their product offerings sold directly to consumers. during fiscal 2020, we announced the launch of the fico® resilience index, a new analytic tool designed to complement fico® score models by identifying those consumers who are most resilient to economic stress relative to other consumers within the same fico® score bands. fico® resilience index would enable industry participants to more precisely assess credit risk and extend credit to more consumers throughout the economic cycle by managing the risk that emerges during periods of economic stress.

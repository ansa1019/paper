(a)charts exclude the results of corporate and other, and eliminations.
2020 developments the following are the more significant developments in our businesses during 2020:
•covid-19 materially impacted our 2020 results of operations. while cable communications results were strong, nbcuniversal and sky results experienced material negative impacts due to the temporary closure of our theme parks and the postponement of sporting events, respectively.
•repaid $18.8 billion and issued $18.6 billion of long-term debt in 2020 ending the year with $11.7 billion of cash on hand. this financing activity resulted in a reduction in the weighted-average cost of debt due to the favorable interest rate environment and provides additional liquidity given the risks associated with the economic conditions caused by covid-19.
•revenue increased 3.4% to $60.1 billion, reflecting increases in high-speed internet, wireless, business services and advertising revenue, partially offset by declines in voice, video and other revenue.
•operating margin increased from 40.1% to 42.1%, reflecting increases in revenue from high-speed internet and business services and decreases in losses in our wireless business.
•total customer relationships increased by 1.6 million, total high-speed internet customers increased 2.0 million and total video customers decreased 1.4 million.
•capital expenditures decreased 4.4% to $6.6 billion, reflecting lower spending on customer premise equipment and support capital, partially offset by an increase in spending on scalable infrastructure.
•total nbcuniversal revenue decreased 17.3% to $28.1 billion and total nbcuniversal adjusted ebitda decreased 28.5% to $6.3 billion driven by the impacts of covid-19.
•cable networks and broadcast television segments revenue decreased 5.8% to $10.8 billion and 0.2% to $10.2 billion, respectively, reflecting decreases in advertising revenue, partially offset by increases in content licensing revenue. distribution revenue decreased at cable networks and increased at broadcast television.
•filmed entertainment segment revenue decreased 18.7% to $5.3 billion, reflecting lower theatrical and other revenues as a result of theater closures due to covid-19, partially offset by an increase in content licensing revenue.
•theme parks segment revenue decreased 68.9% to $1.8 billion and adjusted ebitda decreased from $2.5 billion to a loss of $541 million, reflecting the temporary theme parks closures due to covid-19.
•sky revenue decreased 3.3% to $18.6 billion. excluding the impact of foreign currency, sky revenue decreased 4.2% due to decreases in direct-to-consumer, advertising and content revenues driven by impacts of covid-19.
•sky adjusted ebitda decreased 37.0% to $2.0 billion. excluding the impact of foreign currency, sky adjusted ebitda decreased 37.6% primarily due to the decreases in revenue.
•launched peacock, our direct-to-consumer streaming service that features nbcuniversal content, which was made available to comcast customers in april 2020 and launched nationally in july 2020.
impacts of covid-19
covid-19 and measures taken to prevent its spread across the globe have impacted our businesses in a number of ways. our cable communications results of operations were strong in 2020, despite having been affected by the significant deterioration in domestic economic conditions and by the costs associated with our support of customer connectivity as people worked and learned remotely from home. covid-19 had material negative impacts on nbcuniversal and sky results of operations during comcast 2020 annual report on form 10-k
2020 primarily due to the temporary closure of our theme parks and disruption of professional sports seasons, respectively. we expect the impacts of the covid-19 pandemic will continue to have a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations over the near to medium term, although the extent of such impact will depend on restrictive governmental measures, further deterioration of the global economy and widespread availability of vaccines.
•our distribution network performed well under the stress of increased traffic and peak usage driven by increased video streaming, gaming and videoconferencing as customers worked and learned remotely from home.
•we incurred costs in 2020 associated with compensating personnel in roles affected by covid-19, primarily during the first half of the year. these costs included additional compensation for frontline personnel who worked to keep our customers connected to our services and compensation for certain personnel who were unable to work due to the closing or suspension of operations.
•beginning in march 2020 and continuing through june 2021, new qualifying customers for internet essentials, our low-income internet adoption program, receive 60 days of free internet services. we also implemented programs, primarily during the second quarter of 2020, under which we elected to waive certain fees and to not disconnect internet, voice or wireless services for customers for nonpayment, and we are providing customers a variety of flexible and extended payment options. as a result of these programs, our customer metrics for 2020 do not include customers in the free internet essentials offer or certain high-risk customers who continued to receive service following nonpayment. the number of customers excluded from our customer metrics was highest as of june 30, 2020 and these customers were excluded from second quarter net additions. the number of such customers decreased in the third and fourth quarters as some of these customers either began paying for service, resulting in customer net additions, or disconnected and no longer receive service. we expect the number of excluded customers to continue to decrease in future quarters.
•certain professional sports leagues were disrupted due to covid-19, generally resulting in postponed or canceled matches and reduced schedules. certain of our programming distribution agreements with regional sports networks include contractual adjustment provisions if a minimum number of sporting events does not occur. our programming expenses were reduced as a result of these provisions, and our revenue was negatively impacted in similar amounts as a result of adjustments that we passed through to our customers in 2020 and continue to pass through in the first quarter of 2021.
•the deterioration of economic conditions and increased economic uncertainty resulting from covid-19 have resulted in reduced demand for certain of our residential and business services and reduced spending from advertisers, which have had and, while we have seen some improvement over the course of 2020, likely will continue to have, negative impacts on our revenue over the near to medium term. in addition, we believe there is increased risk associated with collections on our outstanding receivables, and we have incurred, and may continue to incur, increases in our bad debt expense.
•the temporary closure of all of our theme parks had the most significant impact on our revenue and adjusted ebitda for the year ended december 31, 2020 on a consolidated basis. our parks in orlando and japan reopened with limited capacity in june 2020, while our park in hollywood remains closed. we expect the results of operations at our theme parks will continue to be negatively impacted in the near to medium term, and we cannot predict with certainty when the hollywood park will reopen, if any reopened parks will remain open or the level of attendance at any reopened parks. in addition, although we currently expect that universal beijing resort will open in 2021, we have delayed certain construction projects, including the development of the epic universe theme park in orlando.
•the deterioration of economic conditions caused by covid-19 resulted in significant reductions in advertising spend by our customers in the cable networks and broadcast television segments and, while we have seen some improvement over the course of 2020, we expect this trend to continue over the near to medium term. there has also been, and likely will continue to be, an acceleration of subscriber losses at our networks.
•we incurred costs in 2020 associated with compensating personnel who were unable to work due to the closing or suspension of operations due to covid-19, primarily during the first half of the year, including at our theme parks and at our production studios.
•the postponement and cancellation of many sporting events and professional sports seasons caused by covid-19 impacted our results of operations during 2020, since both advertising revenues and costs associated with broadcasting these programs are recognized when events are broadcast. while professional sports leagues generally resumed and completed their seasons in the second half of 2020, some had reduced numbers of events for the remainder of the interrupted seasons. certain of our sports programming rights agreements and distribution agreements with multichannel video providers require contractual adjustments if a minimum number of sporting events does not occur. our distribution revenue was negatively impacted as a result of credits accrued relating to these provisions; and the programming costs that we recognized as the remaining events occurred were also impacted. in addition, there have been, and there may be in the future, delays to the start of the current or upcoming seasons for certain professional sports leagues. when, or the extent to which, sporting events will occur in 2021 will impact the timing, and potentially the amount, of revenue and expense recognition. in addition, the 2020 tokyo olympics have been postponed from the third quarter of 2020 to the third quarter of 2021, resulting in a corresponding delay of the associated revenue and costs.
•the creation and availability of our film and television programming in the united states and globally have been disrupted, including from the suspension of studio production operations in the first half of 2020. our studio production operations have resumed at a limited capacity. additionally, with the temporary closure of many movie theaters worldwide, we have delayed or altered the theatrical distribution strategy for certain of our films, both domestically and internationally. delays in theatrical releases affect both current and future periods as a result of corresponding delays in subsequent content licensing windows. we expect results of operations in our filmed entertainment segment to continue to be negatively impacted over the near to medium term as a result of covid-19.
•direct-to-consumer revenue has been negatively impacted as a result of lower sports subscription revenue due to the disruption of professional sports seasons and future periods may be negatively impacted as a result of the reopening plans and the extent of reopening of our commercial customers. while sporting events generally resumed late in the second quarter of 2020 and the interrupted seasons were completed, there were delays to the start of the current seasons for certain sports, including european soccer. as a result, significant costs associated with broadcasting these programs were not recognized in 2020. covid-19 continues to result in uncertainty in the ultimate timing of when, or the extent to which, sporting events will occur in future periods; their broadcast is expected to impact the timing, and potentially the amount, of revenue and expense recognition.
•we temporarily suspended certain sales channels due to covid-19, which negatively impacted net customer additions and revenue in the first half of 2020. our sales channels generally resumed operations in june 2020.
•covid-19 has resulted in the deterioration of economic conditions and increased economic uncertainty in europe, intensifying what was an already deteriorating economic and advertising environment. these conditions negatively impacted revenue in 2020 and, while we have seen some improvement over the course of 2020, we expect covid-19 likely will continue to negatively impact advertising spend and consumer demand for our services in 2021. in addition, there is increased risk associated with collections on our outstanding receivables, and we have incurred and may continue to incur increases in our bad debt expense.
we have implemented and will continue to implement cost savings initiatives across our businesses that have impacted and will continue to impact our results of operations; certain costs incurred by our businesses in response to covid-19, including severance, are presented in corporate and other. our businesses implemented separate cost savings initiatives, with the most significant relating to severance at nbcuniversal in connection with the realignment of the operating structure in our television businesses as well as overall reductions in the cost base. we do not anticipate significant incremental costs to be incurred under these plans, and payments related to nbcuniversal employee severance are expected to be completed in 2021. nbcuniversal employee-related costs savings will be realized in operating costs and expenses primarily beginning in 2021 and a portion of these cost savings may be reallocated to investments in content and other strategic initiatives.
global financial markets have been volatile and domestic and global economic conditions continue to show signs of material weakness. at this point, it is impossible to predict the extent and duration of these and any other impacts of covid-19 to our businesses, or the degree to which demand for our products and services, or supply of key inputs to those products and services, will be affected. this uncertainty makes it challenging for management to estimate with precision the future performance of our businesses.
as of december 31, 2020, we evaluated whether the facts and circumstances and available information resulted in the need for an impairment assessment for any of our long-lived assets and concluded no assessment was required. refer to the critical comcast 2020 annual report on form 10-k accounting judgments and estimates section for discussion of our impairment testing of goodwill and cable franchise rights. we will continue to evaluate the impacts of covid-19 on our businesses, including the impacts of overall economic conditions, which could result in the recognition of an impairment charge in the future.
liquidity although negatively impacted by the effects of covid-19, we expect that our businesses will continue to generate significant cash flows from operating activities and we believe that these cash flows, together with our existing cash, cash equivalents and investments, available borrowings under our existing credit facilities and our ability to obtain future external financing, will be sufficient for us to meet our current and long-term liquidity and capital requirements. in 2020, we issued $18.6 billion of long-term debt, the proceeds of which were used to repay existing indebtedness and increase cash on our balance sheet in order to bolster liquidity and strengthen our financial position as a result of the increased uncertainty related to the duration and scope of the covid-19 pandemic. we also took actions to conservatively manage cash through reductions in costs and capital expenditures in 2020. we expect the timing of certain priorities may continue to be impacted, such as the pace of our debt reduction efforts and returning capital to shareholders, and the delay of certain capital projects.
competition all of our businesses operate in intensely competitive, consumer-driven and rapidly changing environments and compete with a growing number of companies that provide a broad range of communications products and services, and entertainment, news and information content to consumers. for additional information on the competition our businesses face, see item 1: business and item 1a: risk factors. within the business section, refer to the "competition" discussion, and within the risk factors section, refer to the risk factors entitled "our businesses operate in highly competitive and dynamic industries, and our businesses and results of operations could be adversely affected if we do not compete effectively" and "changes in consumer behavior driven by online video distribution platforms for viewing content continue to adversely affect our businesses and challenge existing business models."
seasonality and cyclicality each of our businesses is typically subject to seasonal and cyclical variations. see item 1: business and refer to the "seasonality and cyclicality" discussion within that section for additional information.

comcast 2020 annual report on form 10-k consolidated revenue the following graph illustrates the contributions to the change in consolidated revenue made by our cable communications, nbcuniversal and sky segments, as well as by corporate and other activities, including eliminations.
the primary drivers of the change in revenue from 2019 to 2020 were as follows:
•a decrease in our nbcuniversal segments revenue primarily due to the impacts of covid-19 resulting in decreased revenue at the theme parks, filmed entertainment, cable networks and broadcast segments.
•a decrease in corporate, other and eliminations revenue primarily due to an increase in eliminations as a result of the licensing of content between our nbcuniversal segments and peacock.
•a decrease in our sky segment revenue primarily due to the impacts of covid-19 resulting in decreased direct-to-consumer, advertising and content revenue, as well as the impact of foreign currency translation.
•growth in our cable communications segment revenue driven by increased revenue from high-speed internet, wireless, business services and advertising, partially offset by decreased revenue from voice, video and other revenue.
revenue for our segments and other businesses is discussed separately below under the heading "segment operating results."
comcast 2020 annual report on form 10-k consolidated costs and expenses the following graph illustrates the contributions to the change in consolidated operating costs and expenses, representing total costs and expenses excluding depreciation and amortization expense, made by our cable communications, nbcuniversal and sky segments, as well as by corporate and other activities, including eliminations.
the primary drivers of the change in operating costs and expenses from 2019 to 2020 were as follows:
•a decrease in nbcuniversal expenses primarily due to the impacts of covid-19, which led to decreased expenses in our filmed entertainment, theme parks, cable networks and broadcast segments.
•flat cable communications segment expenses primarily due to decreased advertising, marketing and promotion expenses and customer service expenses, offset by an increase in programming expenses, other expenses, technical product support costs, and franchise and other regulatory fees.
•an increase in corporate, other and eliminations expenses primarily due to certain costs incurred in response to covid-19, including severance charges related to our businesses, costs associated with peacock, and a legal settlement, partially offset by an increase in eliminations as a result of our licensing content between our nbcuniversal segments and peacock.
•an increase in our sky segment's expenses primarily due to an increase in other costs and direct network costs, partially offset by a decrease in programming and production costs and the impacts of foreign currency translation.
operating costs and expenses for our segments and our corporate operations, business development initiatives and other businesses are discussed separately below under the heading "segment operating results."
consolidated depreciation and amortization expense year ended december 31 (in millions)                   2020             2019             2018             % change             % change
percentage changes that are considered not meaningful are denoted with nm.
nbcuniversal and sky depreciation and amortization expense increased in 2020 primarily due to amortization of certain trade names beginning in the first quarter of 2020, which were previously accounted for as indefinite-lived intangible assets (see note 11). cable communications depreciation and amortization expense decreased due to lower spending on customer premise equipment and support capital, partially offset by an increase in spending on scalable infrastructure.
amortization expense from acquisition-related intangible assets totaled $2.3 billion, $2.0 billion and $1.1 billion for 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. amounts primarily relate to customer relationship intangible assets recorded in connection with the sky transaction in the fourth quarter of 2018 and the nbcuniversal transaction in 2011.
consolidated interest expense interest expense was flat in 2020 compared to 2019 as $360 million of charges related to the early redemption of senior notes were offset by lower weighted-average interest rates and a decrease in average debt outstanding.

equity in net income (losses) of investees, net the change in equity in net income (losses) of investees, net in 2020 compared to 2019 was primarily due to our investment in atairos group, inc. and our reduced share of net losses for other equity method investments. the income (losses) at atairos were driven by fair value adjustments on its underlying investments with income of $286 million in 2020 and losses of $64 million in 2019. see note 9 for additional information related to our investments.
realized and unrealized gains (losses) on equity securities, net realized and unrealized gains (losses) on equity securities, net in 2020 were primarily as a result of gains relating to transactions involving fanduel and pointsbet and a public offering by fubotv, as well as gains related to our investment in peloton, which was sold during 2020. realized and unrealized gains (losses) on equity securities, net in 2019 resulted primarily from gains related to our interests in snap, which was sold in 2019, and peloton as a result of its initial public offering in 2019. see note 9 for additional information related to our investments.
other income (loss), net the change in other income (loss), net in 2020 compared to 2019 was primarily due to the recognition of $219 million of gains related to the dilution of our hulu ownership in 2019, partially offset by foreign currency gains and lower impairments related to equity method investments in 2020.
consolidated income tax (expense) benefit our effective income tax rate in 2020 and 2019 was 23.9% and 21.6%, respectively.
in 2020, the effective income tax rate included $145 million of expense relating to the impact of tax law changes in the third quarter of 2020.
in 2019, the effective income tax rate included $125 million of benefits related to state income tax adjustments recognized in the third quarter of 2019.
consolidated net income attributable to noncontrolling interests and redeemable subsidiary preferred stock the decrease in net income attributable to noncontrolling interests and redeemable subsidiary preferred stock in 2020 compared to 2019 was primarily due to our acquisition of the remaining interest of one of our noncontrolling interests.

customer metrics are presented based on actual amounts. minor differences may exist due to rounding. customer relationships represent the number of residential and business customers that subscribe to at least one of our services. one product, two product, and three or more product customers represent residential customers that subscribe to one, two, or three or more of our services, respectively. for mdus, including buildings located on college campuses, whose residents have the ability to receive additional services, such as additional programming choices or our hd or dvr services, we count and report customers based on the number of potential billable relationships within each mdu. for mdus whose residents are not able to receive additional services, the mdu is counted as a single customer. residential high-speed internet and video customer metrics include certain customers that have prepaid for services. wireless lines represent the number of activated eligible wireless devices on customers' accounts. individual customer relationships may have multiple wireless lines. customer metrics for 2020 do not include certain high-risk customers who continue to receive service following nonpayment or customers in the free internet essentials offer (refer to "impacts of covid-19" for further discussion).

average monthly total revenue per customer relationship is impacted by rate adjustments and changes in the types and levels of services received by our residential and business services customers, as well as changes in advertising revenue. while revenue from our residential high-speed internet, video and voice services is also impacted by changes in the allocation of revenue among services sold in a bundle, the allocation does not impact average monthly total revenue per customer relationship. average rates in 2020 were negatively impacted by customer adjustments accrued as a result of provisions in our programming distribution agreements with regional sports networks related to canceled sporting events. for customers receiving bundled services, the revenue reduction was allocated across each of the services in the bundle.
each of our services has a different contribution to operating margin and we also use average monthly adjusted ebitda per customer relationship to evaluate the profitability of our customer base across our service offerings. we believe these metrics are useful to understand the trends in our business and average monthly adjusted ebitda per customer relationship is useful particularly as we continue to focus on growing our higher-margin businesses, including residential high-speed internet and business services.

other operating and administrative expenses expenses include salaries, employee benefits, rent and other overhead expenses.
expenses decreased in 2020 primarily due to lower costs associated with our movie ticketing and entertainment business and live stage plays, which were impacted by theater and entertainment venue closures as a result of covid-19.
advertising, marketing and promotion expenses expenses consist primarily of expenses associated with advertising for our theatrical releases and the marketing of our films on dvds and in digital formats. we incur significant marketing expenses before and throughout the release of a film in movie theaters. as a result, we typically incur losses on a film prior to and during the film's exhibition in movie theaters and may not realize profits, if any, until the film generates home entertainment and content licensing revenue. the costs associated with marketing films have generally increased in recent years and may continue to increase in the future.
expenses decreased in 2020 primarily due to lower spending on current period releases as a result of covid-19.

non-gaap financial measures consolidated adjusted ebitda adjusted ebitda is a non-gaap financial measure and is the primary basis used to measure the operational strength and performance of our businesses as well as to assist in the evaluation of underlying trends in our businesses. this measure eliminates the significant level of noncash depreciation and amortization expense that results from the capital-intensive nature of certain of our businesses and from intangible assets recognized in business combinations. it is also unaffected by our capital and tax structures, and by our investment activities, including the results of entities that we do not consolidate, as our management excludes these results when evaluating our operating performance. our management and board of directors use this financial measure to evaluate our consolidated operating performance and the operating performance of our operating segments and to allocate resources and capital to our operating segments. it is also a significant performance measure in our annual incentive compensation programs. additionally, we believe that adjusted ebitda is useful to investors because it is one of the bases for comparing our operating performance with that of other companies in our industries, although our measure of adjusted ebitda may not be directly comparable to similar measures used by other companies.
we define adjusted ebitda as net income attributable to comcast corporation before net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests and redeemable subsidiary preferred stock, income tax expense, investment and other income (loss), net, interest expense, depreciation and amortization expense, and other operating gains and losses (such as impairment charges related to fixed and intangible assets and gains or losses on the sale of long-lived assets), if any. from time to time we may exclude from adjusted ebitda the impact of certain events, gains, losses or other charges (such as significant legal settlements) that affect the period-to-period comparability of our operating performance.
we reconcile consolidated adjusted ebitda to net income attributable to comcast corporation. this measure should not be considered a substitute for operating income (loss), net income (loss), net income (loss) attributable to comcast corporation, or net cash provided by operating activities that we have reported in accordance with gaap.

constant currency constant currency and constant currency growth rates are non-gaap financial measures that present our results of operations excluding the estimated effects of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. certain of our businesses, including sky, have operations outside the united states that are conducted in local currencies. as a result, the comparability of the financial results reported in u.s. dollars is affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates. in our sky segment, we use constant currency and constant currency growth rates to evaluate the underlying performance of the business, and we believe it is helpful for investors to present operating results on a comparable basis year over year to evaluate its underlying performance.
constant currency and constant currency growth rates are calculated by comparing the prior year results adjusted to reflect the average exchange rates from the current year rather than the actual exchange rates that were in effect during the respective prior year.

liquidity and capital resources our businesses generate significant cash flows from operating activities. we believe that we will be able to continue to meet our current and long-term liquidity and capital requirements, including fixed charges, through our cash flows from operating activities; existing cash, cash equivalents and investments; available borrowings under our existing credit facilities; and our ability to obtain future external financing. we anticipate that we will continue to use a substantial portion of our cash flows in repaying our debt obligations, funding our capital expenditures, investing in business opportunities and returning capital to shareholders. refer to "impacts of covid-19" for additional discussion.
we maintain significant availability under our revolving credit facilities and our commercial paper programs to meet our short-term liquidity requirements. our commercial paper programs provide a lower-cost source of borrowing to fund our short-term working capital requirements. see note 6 for additional information on our revolving credit facilities. as of december 31, 2020, amounts available under our revolving credit facilities, net of amounts outstanding under our commercial paper programs and outstanding letters of credit and bank guarantees, totaled $9.2 billion.

the variance in changes in operating assets and liabilities in 2020 compared to 2019 was primarily due to the impacts of covid-19, including the timing of amortization and related payments for our film and television costs, which resulted from the comcast 2020 annual report on form 10-k         58
suspension of studio production operations partially offset by the timing of sporting events, as well as the extension of due dates for certain tax payments and accruals related to severance.
the decrease in income tax payments in 2020 was primarily due to lower taxable income from operations in 2020, partially offset by the taxable gain associated with the airtouch redemption which approximated the proceeds received.
investing activities net cash used in investing activities in 2020 consisted primarily of capital expenditures, cash paid for intangible assets, the construction of universal beijing resort, purchases of investments and the purchase of spectrum rights, which were partially offset by proceeds from sales of businesses and investments. net cash used in investing activities in 2019 consisted primarily of capital expenditures, cash paid for intangible assets, purchases of investments and the construction of universal beijing resort, which were partially offset by proceeds from sales of businesses and investments.
capital expenditures capital expenditures decreased in 2020 primarily due to decreases in spending by our theme parks segment as a result of covid-19 and by our cable communications segment, partially offset by increases in spending by our sky segment, reflecting the continued deployment of sky q and high-speed internet services.
our most significant recurring investing activity has been capital expenditures in our cable communications segment, and we expect that this will continue in the future. cable communications' capital expenditures decreased primarily due to lower spending on customer premise equipment and support capital, partially offset by an increase in spending on scalable infrastructure. the table below summarizes the capital expenditures we incurred in our cable communications segment in 2020, 2019 and 2018.
customer premise equipment                      $2,333          $2,659          $2,917
support capital                                    589             858             767
we expect our capital expenditures for 2021 will be focused on the continued investment in scalable infrastructure to increase network capacity in our cable communications segment; increased investment in line extensions for the expansion of both business services and residential; and the continued deployment of wireless gateways, our x1 platform, cloud dvr technology, sky q, and international dtc streaming platforms. in addition, while we expect to invest in existing and new attractions at our universal theme parks in the future, we have paused the construction of our additional theme park in orlando, florida. capital expenditures for subsequent years will depend on numerous factors, including acquisitions, competition, changes in technology, regulatory changes, the timing and rate of deployment of new services, the capacity required for existing services, and the timing of new attractions at our theme parks.
cash paid for intangible assets in 2020, cash paid for intangible assets was flat primarily due to decreases in expenditures for software development at our cable communications segment, offset by increases in expenditures for software development at both our sky segment and at corporate, primarily related to our development of sky q and peacock, respectively.
construction of universal beijing resort construction of universal beijing resort includes costs related to the construction of the universal theme park and resort in beijing, china. see note 7.
purchase of spectrum on september 2, 2020, the fcc announced the results of its cbrs spectrum auction. in connection with the auction, we acquired the rights to $459 million of spectrum.
comcast 2020 annual report on form 10-k proceeds from sales of businesses and investments in 2020, proceeds from sales of businesses and investments increased primarily due to $1.7 billion of proceeds received from the sale of our investment in airtouch in the second quarter of 2020. see note 9.
purchases of investments purchases of investments in 2020 were primarily related to capital contributions to atairos and in 2019 were primarily related to hulu, including the acquisition of our proportionate share of the interest previously held by at&t, and atairos.
financing activities net cash used in financing activities in 2020 consisted primarily of repayments of debt and the related early redemption payments presented in other financing activities, dividend payments and payments related to the redemption and repayment of subsidiary preferred shares in the second quarter of 2020 presented in other financing activities (see note 9), which were partially offset by proceeds from borrowings and proceeds from the settlement of cross currency swaps related to our debt presented in other financing activities. net cash used in financing activities in 2019 consisted primarily of repayments of debt and dividend payments, partially offset by proceeds from issuance of senior notes and a collateralized obligation.
in 2020, we made debt repayments of $18.8 billion, including the early redemption and purchase of senior notes maturing between 2020 and 2047 and optional repayments of term loans due 2021 to 2023 totaling $15.8 billion.
in 2020, we issued $12.5 billion of fixed-rate senior notes maturing between 2025 and 2062, $3.2 billion (using exchange rates on the date of issuance) of fixed-rate euro senior notes maturing between 2027 and 2040 and $1.8 billion (using exchange rates on the date of issuance) of fixed-rate sterling senior notes maturing between 2029 and 2036. in 2020, we made borrowings of $1.1 billion under the universal beijing resort term loan.
we have made, and may from time to time in the future make, optional repayments on our debt obligations, which may include repurchases or exchanges of our outstanding public notes and debentures, depending on various factors, such as market conditions. any such repurchases may be effected through privately negotiated transactions, market transactions, tender offers, redemptions or otherwise. see note 6 for additional information on our financing activities.
dividends our board of directors declared quarterly dividends totaling $4.3 billion in 2020. we paid dividends of $4.1 billion in 2020. in january 2021, our board of directors approved a 9% increase in our dividend to $1.00 per share on an annualized basis. we expect to continue to pay quarterly dividends, although each dividend is subject to approval by our board of directors.
the chart below summarizes our dividends paid in 2020, 2019 and 2018. in addition, we paid $534 million and $504 million in 2020 and 2019, respectively, related to employee taxes associated with the administration of our share-based compensation plans.
comcast 2020 annual report on form 10-k guarantee structure our debt is primarily issued at comcast, although we also have debt at certain of our subsidiaries as a result of acquisitions and other issuances. a substantial amount of this debt is subject to guarantees by comcast and by certain subsidiaries that we have put in place to simplify our capital structure. we believe this guarantee structure provides liquidity benefits to debt investors and helps to simplify credit analysis with respect to relative value considerations of guaranteed subsidiary debt.

(a)nbcuniversal, comcast cable and comcast holdings (included within other debt subject to one-way guarantees) are each consolidated subsidiaries subject to the periodic reporting requirements of the sec. the guarantee structures and related disclosures in this section, together with exhibit 22, satisfy these reporting obligations.
(b)universal beijing resort debt financing is secured by the assets of universal beijing resort and the equity interests of the investors. see note 7 for additional information.
cross-guarantees comcast, nbcuniversal and comcast cable (the "guarantors") fully and unconditionally, jointly and severally, guarantee each other's debt securities. nbcuniversal and comcast cable also guarantee other borrowings of comcast, including its revolving credit facility. these guarantees rank equally with all other general unsecured and unsubordinated obligations of the respective guarantors. however, the obligations of the guarantors under the guarantees are structurally subordinated to the indebtedness and other liabilities of their respective non-guarantor subsidiaries. the obligations of each guarantor are limited to the maximum amount that would not render such guarantor's obligations subject to avoidance under applicable fraudulent conveyance provisions of u.s. and non-u.s. law. each guarantor's obligations will remain in effect until all amounts payable with respect to the guaranteed securities have been paid in full. however, a guarantee by nbcuniversal or comcast cable of comcast's debt securities, or by nbcuniversal of comcast cable's debt securities, will terminate upon a disposition of such guarantor entity or all or substantially all of its assets.
the guarantors are each holding companies that principally hold investments in, borrow from and lend to non-guarantor subsidiary operating companies; issue and service third-party debt obligations; repurchase shares and pay dividends; and engage in certain corporate and headquarters activities. the guarantors are generally dependent on non-guarantor subsidiary operating companies to fund these activities.
as of december 31, 2020 and 2019, the combined guarantors have noncurrent notes payable to non-guarantor subsidiaries of $124 billion and $122 billion, respectively, and noncurrent notes receivable from non-guarantor subsidiaries of $26 billion and $21 billion, respectively. this financial information is that of the guarantors presented on a combined basis with intercompany balances between the guarantors eliminated. the combined financial information excludes financial information of non-guarantor subsidiaries. the underlying net assets of the non-guarantor subsidiaries are significantly in excess of the guarantor obligations. excluding investments in non-guarantor subsidiaries, external debt and the noncurrent notes payable and receivable with non-guarantor subsidiaries, the guarantors do not have material assets, liabilities or results of operations.
comcast 2020 annual report on form 10-k one-way guarantees comcast provides full and unconditional guarantees of certain debt issued by sky and other consolidated subsidiaries not subject to the periodic reporting requirements of the sec.
comcast also provides a full and unconditional guarantee of $138 million principal amount of subordinated debt issued by comcast holdings. comcast's obligations under this guarantee are subordinated and subject, in right of payment, to the prior payment in full of all of comcast's senior indebtedness, including debt guaranteed by comcast on a senior basis; and are structurally subordinated to the indebtedness and other liabilities of its non-guarantor subsidiaries (for purposes of this comcast holdings discussion, comcast cable and nbcuniversal are included within the non-guarantor subsidiary group). comcast's obligations as guarantor will remain in effect until all amounts payable with respect to the guaranteed debt have been paid in full. however, the guarantee will terminate upon a disposition of comcast holdings or all or substantially all of its assets. comcast holdings is a consolidated subsidiary holding company that directly or indirectly holds 100% and approximately 37% of our equity interests in comcast cable and nbcuniversal, respectively.
as of december 31, 2020 and 2019, comcast and comcast holdings, the combined issuer and guarantor of the guaranteed subordinated debt, have noncurrent senior notes payable to non-guarantor subsidiaries of $94 billion and $92 billion, respectively, and noncurrent notes receivable from non-guarantor subsidiaries of $23 billion and $18 billion, respectively. this financial information is that of comcast and comcast holdings presented on a combined basis with intercompany balances between comcast and comcast holdings eliminated. the combined financial information excludes financial information of non-guarantor subsidiaries of comcast and comcast holdings. the underlying net assets of the non-guarantor subsidiaries of comcast and comcast holdings are significantly in excess of the obligations of comcast and comcast holdings. excluding investments in non-guarantor subsidiaries, external debt and the noncurrent notes payable and receivable with non-guarantor subsidiaries, comcast and comcast holdings do not have material assets, liabilities or results of operations.

(b)collateralized obligation relates to a $5.2 billion term loan facility, the principal amount of which is fully secured by the minimum guaranteed proceeds under the put/call provisions related to our investment in hulu. see note 9.
(c)purchase obligations consist of agreements to purchase goods and services that are legally binding on us and specify all significant terms, including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased and price provisions. our purchase obligations related to cable communications and sky include programming contracts with cable networks and local broadcast television stations; contracts with customer premise equipment manufacturers; contracts with communications vendors and multichannel video providers for which we provide advertising sales representation; contracts to acquire handsets and other equipment; and other contracts entered into in the normal course of business. cable communications' and sky's programming contracts include amounts payable under fixed or minimum guaranteed commitments and do not represent the total fees that are expected to be paid under programming contracts, which we expect to be significantly higher because these contracts are generally based on the number of subscribers receiving the programming. our purchase obligations related to nbcuniversal and sky include commitments to acquire film and television programming, and broadcast rights relating to sporting events, such as the olympics, the nfl and european soccer leagues, as well as obligations under various creative talent agreements, including obligations to actors, producers and television personalities, and various other television commitments. purchase obligations do not include contracts with immaterial future commitments.
(d)other long-term liabilities reflected on the balance sheet consist primarily of deferred compensation obligations and postretirement, pension and postemployment benefit obligations. our total recorded liability of $2.8 billion related to participations and residuals are not included in the table above because we cannot make a reliable estimate of the period in which these obligations will be settled. liabilities for uncertain tax positions of $1.4 billion and the associated interest and penalties are not included in the table above because it is uncertain if or when these amounts will become payable. a contractual obligation with a carrying value of $1.1 billion is not included in the table above because it is uncertain if the arrangement will be settled. the contractual obligation involves an interest held by a third party in the revenue of certain theme parks. see note 16 for additional information related to this arrangement.
(e)our contractual obligations do not include our capital commitment related to our investment in atairos due to our inability to estimate the timing of this funding. as of december 31, 2020, our remaining commitment is $1.3 billion based on the capital calls received as of that date (see note 9).
(f)total contractual obligations are made up of the following components.
off-balance sheet arrangements as of december 31, 2020, we did not have any material off-balance sheet arrangements that are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.

comcast 2020 annual report on form 10-k critical accounting judgments and estimates the preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and the related disclosure of contingent assets and contingent liabilities. we base our judgments on our historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making estimates about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
we believe our judgments and related estimates associated with the valuation and impairment testing of goodwill and cable franchise rights and the accounting for film and television costs are critical in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting judgments and estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors, and the audit committee has reviewed the related disclosures below. see also notes 4 and 11.
valuation and impairment testing of goodwill and cable franchise rights we assess the recoverability of our goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, including cable franchise rights, annually as of july 1, or more frequently whenever events or substantive changes in circumstances indicate that the assets might be impaired. the assessment of recoverability may first consider qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit or an indefinite-lived intangible asset is less than its carrying amount. a quantitative assessment is performed if the qualitative assessment results in a more-likely-than-not determination or if a qualitative assessment is not performed.
goodwill goodwill results from business combinations and represents the excess amount of the consideration paid over the identifiable assets and liabilities recorded in the acquisition. we test goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level and have concluded that our reporting units are generally the same as our reportable segments. we evaluate the determination of our reporting units periodically or whenever events or substantive changes in circumstances occur. when performing a quantitative assessment, we estimate the fair values of our reporting units primarily based on a discounted cash flow analysis that involves significant judgment, including market participant estimates of future cash flows expected to be generated by the business and the selection of discount rates. when analyzing the fair values indicated under discounted cash flow models, we also consider multiples of adjusted ebitda generated by the underlying assets, current market transactions and profitability information.
we performed qualitative assessments in 2020 for goodwill in our cable communications and nbcuniversal segments. the qualitative assessments considered that the estimated fair values of these reporting units substantially exceeded their carrying values at the time of our previous quantitative assessments in 2018; changes in projected future cash flows; recent market transactions and overall macroeconomic conditions, including the effects of covid-19; discount rates; and changes in our market capitalization. based on these assessments, we concluded that it was more likely than not that the estimated fair values of our reporting units were higher than their carrying values and that the performance of a quantitative impairment test was not required. we performed a quantitative assessment in 2020 for goodwill in our sky segment and the estimated fair value of the reporting unit was higher than the carrying value. assets and liabilities resulting from a business combination are initially recorded at fair value and the risk of goodwill impairment is reduced as the value of the businesses in a reporting unit increases and as the carrying value of the reporting unit decreases due to the amortization of the historical cost of acquired long-lived assets over time. given the goodwill in our sky segment resulted from our recent acquisition of sky in the fourth quarter of 2018, the fair value is in close proximity to the carrying value of the sky reporting unit.
changes in market conditions, laws and regulations, and key assumptions made in future quantitative assessments, including expected cash flows, competitive factors and discount rates, could negatively impact the results of future impairment testing and could result in the recognition of an impairment charge.
cable franchise rights our cable franchise rights assets result from agreements we have with state and local governments that allow us to construct and operate a cable business within a specified geographic area. the value of a franchise is derived from the economic benefits we receive from the right to solicit new customers and to market additional services in a particular service area. the amounts we record for cable franchise rights are primarily a result of cable system acquisitions. typically when we acquire a cable system, the most significant asset we record is the value of the cable franchise rights. often these cable system acquisitions include multiple franchise areas. we currently serve approximately 6,400 franchise areas in the united states.
comcast 2020 annual report on form 10-k we have concluded that our cable franchise rights have an indefinite useful life since there are no legal, regulatory, contractual, competitive, economic or other factors which limit the period over which these rights will contribute to our cash flows. accordingly, we do not amortize our cable franchise rights.
for purposes of impairment testing, we have grouped the recorded values of our various cable franchise rights into our three cable communications divisions or units of account. we evaluate the unit of account periodically to ensure our impairment testing is performed at an appropriate level.
when performing a quantitative assessment, we estimate the fair values of our cable franchise rights primarily based on a discounted cash flow analysis that involves significant judgment, including the estimate of future cash flows and the selection of discount rates. when analyzing the fair values indicated under the discounted cash flow models, we also consider multiples of adjusted ebitda generated by the underlying assets, current market transactions and profitability information.
in 2020, we performed a qualitative assessment of our cable franchise rights. at the time of our previous quantitative assessment in 2018, the estimated fair values of our franchise rights substantially exceeded their carrying values. we also considered various factors that would affect the estimated fair values of our cable franchise rights in our qualitative assessment, including changes in our projected future cash flows associated with our cable communications segment; recent market transactions and overall macroeconomic conditions, including the effects of covid-19; discount rates; and changes in our market capitalization. based on this assessment, we concluded that it was more likely than not that the estimated fair values of our cable franchise rights were higher than the carrying values and that the performance of a quantitative impairment test was not required.
changes in market conditions, laws and regulations and key assumptions made in future quantitative assessments, including expected cash flows, competitive factors and discount rates, could negatively impact the results of future impairment testing and could result in the recognition of an impairment charge.
film and television content we capitalize costs for owned film and television content, including direct costs, production overhead, print costs, development costs and interest, as well as acquired libraries. we have determined that the predominant monetization strategy for the substantial majority of our content is on an individual basis. amortization for owned content predominantly monetized on an individual basis and accrued costs associated with participations and residual payments are recorded using the individual film forecast computation method, which recognizes the costs in the same ratio as the associated ultimate revenue.
our estimates of ultimate revenue for films generally include revenue from all sources that are expected to be earned within 10 years from the date of a film's initial release. these estimates are based on the distribution strategy and historical performance of similar content, as well as factors unique to the content itself. the most sensitive factor affecting our estimate of ultimate revenue for a film intended for theatrical release is the film's theatrical performance, as subsequent revenue from the licensing and sale of a film has historically exhibited a high correlation to its theatrical performance. upon a film's release, our estimates of revenue from succeeding markets, including from content licensing across multiple platforms and home entertainment sales, are revised based on historical relationships and an analysis of current market trends.
with respect to television series or other owned television programming, the most sensitive factor affecting our estimate of ultimate revenue is whether the series can be successfully licensed beyond its initial license window. initial estimates of ultimate revenue are limited to the amount of revenue attributed to the initial license window. once it is determined that a television series or other owned television programming can be licensed beyond the initial license window, revenue estimates for these additional windows or platforms, such as u.s. and international syndication, home entertainment, and other distribution platforms, are included in ultimate revenue. revenue estimates for produced episodes include revenue expected to be earned within 10 years of delivery of the initial episode or, if still in production, 5 years from the delivery of the most recent episode, if later.
we capitalize the costs of licensed content when the license period begins, the content is made available for use and the costs of the licenses are known. licensed content is amortized as the associated programs are broadcast. we recognize the costs of multiyear, live-event sports rights as the rights are utilized over the contract term based on estimated relative value. estimated relative value is generally based on the ratio of the current period revenue to the estimated ultimate revenue or the terms of the contract. our estimates of ultimate revenue for sports rights include estimates of advertising and subscribers receiving or viewing the broadcasts over the term of the agreements.
comcast 2020 annual report on form 10-k capitalized film and television costs are subject to impairment testing when certain triggering events are identified. the substantial majority of our owned content is evaluated for impairment on an individual title basis. licensed content that is not part of a film group is tested for impairment primarily on a channel, network or platform basis, with the exception of our broadcast networks and owned local broadcast television stations, which are tested on a daypart basis. sports rights are accounted for as executory contracts and are not subject to impairment. when performing an impairment assessment, we estimate fair value primarily based on a discounted cash flow analysis that involves significant judgment, including market participant estimates of future cash flows, which are supported by internal forecasts. adjustments to capitalized film and television costs were not material in any of the periods presented.

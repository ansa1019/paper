item 7.management's discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition organization and business segments description of the company and business segments johnson & johnson and its subsidiaries (the company) have approximately 134,500 employees worldwide engaged in the research and development, manufacture and sale of a broad range of products in the health care field. the company conducts business in virtually all countries of the world with the primary focus on products related to human health and well-being.
the company is organized into three business segments: consumer health (previously referred to as consumer), pharmaceutical and medical devices. the consumer health segment includes a broad range of products used in the baby care, oral care, skin health/beauty, over-the-counter pharmaceutical, women's health and wound care markets. these products are marketed to the general public and sold online (ecommerce) and to retail outlets and distributors throughout the world. the pharmaceutical segment is focused on six therapeutic areas, including immunology, infectious diseases, neuroscience, oncology, pulmonary hypertension, and cardiovascular and metabolic diseases. products in this segment are distributed directly to retailers, wholesalers, hospitals and health care professionals for prescription use. the medical devices segment includes a broad range of products used in the orthopaedic, surgery, interventional solutions (cardiovascular and neurovascular) and eye health fields. these products are distributed to wholesalers, hospitals and retailers, and used principally in the professional fields by physicians, nurses, hospitals, eye care professionals and clinics.
the executive committee of johnson & johnson is the principal management group responsible for the strategic operations and allocation of the resources of the company. this committee oversees and coordinates the activities of the consumer health, pharmaceutical and medical devices business segments.
in all of its product lines, the company competes with other companies both locally and globally, throughout the world. competition exists in all product lines without regard to the number and size of the competing companies involved. competition in research, involving the development and the improvement of new and existing products and processes, is particularly significant. the development of new and innovative products, as well as protecting the underlying intellectual property of the company's product portfolio, is important to the company's success in all areas of its business. the competitive environment requires substantial investments in continuing research. in addition, the development and maintenance of customer demand for the company's consumer products involves significant expenditures for advertising and promotion.
management's objectives with "our credo" as the foundation, the company's purpose is to blend heart, science and ingenuity to profoundly change the trajectory of health for humanity. the company is committed to bringing its full breadth and depth to ensure health for people today and for future generations. united around this common ambition, the company is poised to fulfill its purpose and successfully meet the demands of the rapidly evolving markets in which it competes.
the company is broadly based in human healthcare, and is committed to creating value by developing accessible, high quality, innovative products and services. new products introduced within the past five years accounted for approximately 25% of 2020 sales. in 2020, $12.2 billion was invested in research and development and $7.3 billion spent on acquisitions, reflecting management's commitment to create life-enhancing innovations and to create value through partnerships that will profoundly change the trajectory of health for humanity.
a critical driver of the company's success is the 134,500 diverse employees worldwide. employees are empowered and inspired to lead with the company's our credo and purpose as guides. this allows every employee to use the company's reach and size to advance the company's purpose, and to also lead with agility and urgency. leveraging the extensive resources across the enterprise enables the company to innovate and execute with excellence. this ensures the company can remain focused on addressing the unmet needs of society every day and invest for an enduring impact, ultimately delivering value to its patients, consumers and healthcare professionals, employees, communities and shareholders.
results of operations analysis of consolidated sales for discussion on results of operations and financial condition pertaining to the fiscal years 2019 and 2018 see the company's annual report on form 10-k for the fiscal year ended december 29, 2019, item 7. management's discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition.
in 2020, worldwide sales increased 0.6% to $82.6 billion as compared to an increase of 0.6% in 2019. these sales changes consisted of the following:
the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures on the worldwide sales growth was a negative impact of 0.3% in 2020 and a negative impact of 1.7% in 2019.
sales by u.s. companies were $43.1 billion in 2020 and $42.1 billion in 2019. this represents increases of 2.5% in 2020 and 0.5% in 2019. sales by international companies were $39.5 billion in 2020 and $40.0 billion in 2019. this represents a decrease of 1.3% in 2020 and an increase of 0.7% in 2019.
the five-year compound annual growth rates for worldwide, u.s. and international sales were 3.3%, 3.9% and 2.8%, respectively. the ten-year compound annual growth rates for worldwide, u.s. and international sales were 3.0%, 3.9% and 2.1%, respectively.
in 2020, sales by companies in europe achieved growth of 2.8% as compared to the prior year, which included operational growth of 2.0% and a positive currency impact of 0.8%. sales by companies in the western hemisphere (excluding the u.s.) experienced a sales decline of 10.2% as compared to the prior year, which included operational growth of 0.4% offset by a negative currency impact of 10.6%. sales by companies in the asia-pacific, africa region experienced a sales decline of 2.7% as compared to the prior year, including an operational decline of 3.1% partially offset by a positive currency impact of 0.4%.
the 2020 results benefited from the inclusion of a 53rd week. (see note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for annual closing date details). the company estimated that the fiscal year 2020 sales growth rate was enhanced by approximately 1.0%. while the additional week added a few days to sales, it also added a full week's worth of operating costs; therefore, the net earnings impact was negligible.
in 2020, the company utilized three wholesalers distributing products for all three segments that represented approximately 16.0%, 12.0% and 12.0% of the total consolidated revenues. in 2019, the company had three wholesalers distributing products for all three segments that represented approximately 15.0%, 12.0% and 11.0% of the total consolidated revenues.

** previously referred to as beauty the otc franchise sales of $4.8 billion increased 8.5% as compared to the prior year. growth was primarily attributable to sales from tylenol®  driven by covid-19 stocking demand, zyrtec®  due to competitor product out of stock and pepcid® due to competitive product withdrawal both in the u.s., and increased consumption in anti-smoking aids. international sales were negatively impacted by covid-19 and low incidence of cough and flu.
the skin health/beauty franchise sales were $4.5 billion in 2020, a decrease of 3.1% as compared to the prior year. the decline was primarily due to negative covid-19 related impacts and sku rationalization partially offset by growth in ecommerce and new product innovation.
the oral care franchise sales of $1.6 billion increased 7.4% as compared to the prior year primarily attributable to sales of listerine® mouthwash due to u.s. ecommerce and club channel growth, increased stocking demand related to covid-19 and new product launches in asia pacific.
the baby care franchise sales were $1.5 billion in 2020, a decrease of 9.4% compared to the prior year. the decline was primarily due to covid-19 related impacts, sku rationalization and the baby center divestiture in the u.s. partially offset by strength in aveeno® baby.
the women's health franchise sales were $0.9 billion in 2020, a decrease of 8.6% as compared to the prior year. the decline was primarily driven by covid-19 impacts.
the wound care/other franchise sales were $0.7 billion in 2020, an increase of 7.2% as compared to the prior year. growth was due to strong performance of neosporin® and band-aid® brand adhesive bandages and covid-19 related demand in the asia pacific region.

(2) inclusive of tracleer® which was previously disclosed separately immunology products sales were $15.1 billion in 2020, representing an increase of 7.9% as compared to the prior year driven by strong uptake of stelara® (ustekinumab) in crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis and strength in tremfya® (guselkumab) in psoriasis. this was partially offset by covid-19 related demand and lower sales of remicade® (infliximab) due to increased discounts/rebates and biosimilar competition.
the patents for remicade® (infliximab) in certain countries in europe expired in february 2015. biosimilar versions of remicade® have been introduced in certain markets outside the united states, resulting in a reduction in sales of remicade® in those markets. additional biosimilar competition will likely result in a further reduction in sales of remicade® in markets outside the united states. in the united states, a biosimilar version of remicade® was introduced in 2016, and additional competitors continue to enter the market. continued infliximab biosimilar competition in the u.s. market will result in a further reduction in u.s. sales of remicade®.
infectious disease products sales were $3.6 billion in 2020, representing an increase of 4.7% as compared to the prior year primarily due to strong sales of symtuza®  and  juluca®.  this was partially offset by lower sales of prezista® and prezcobix®/rezolsta® due to increased competition and loss of exclusivity of prezista® in certain countries outside the u.s.
neuroscience products sales were $6.5 billion, representing an increase of 3.5% as compared to the prior year. paliperidone long-acting injectables growth driven by sales of invega sustenna®/xeplion® (paliperidone palmitate) and invega trinza®/trevicta® from new patient starts and persistence. the growth was partially offset by migration from risperdal consta® (risperidone) and declines in concerta® (methylphenidate) due to competitive entrants.
oncology products achieved sales of $12.4 billion in 2020, representing an increase of 15.7% as compared to the prior year. contributors to the growth were strong sales of darzalex® (daratumumab) driven by patient uptake in all lines of therapy and the launch of a subcutaneous formulation in the u.s. and e.u.; imbruvica® (ibrutinib) due to market growth globally and maintaining strong share and the continued global launch uptake and share gains of erleada® (apalutamide). additionally, the growth was negatively impacted by declining sales of zytiga® (abiraterone acetate) and velcade® (bortezomib) due to generic competition.
pulmonary hypertension products achieved sales of $3.1 billion, representing an increase of 20.0% as compared to the prior year. sales growth of opsumit® (macitentan) and uptravi® (selexipag) were due to continued share gains and market growth. additionally, sales of tracleer® (bosentan) were negatively impacted by generics and migration to opsumit®.
cardiovascular/metabolism/other products sales were $4.9 billion, a decline of 6.0% as compared to the prior year. sales growth of invokana®/invokamet® (canagliflozin) were due to market growth and favorable channel mix dynamics in the u.s. and strength in the european region partially offset by u.s. share declines due to competitive pressures. the growth of xarelto® (rivaroxaban) was due to demand growth partially offset by higher rebates. lower sales of procrit®/ eprex® (epoetin alfa) were due to biosimilar competition.

consumer health segment:
in 2020, the consumer health segment loss before tax as a percent of sales was (7.6)% versus income before tax of 14.8% in 2019. the decrease in the income before tax as a percent of sales was primarily driven by the following:
•higher litigation expense of $3.9 billion in 2020 vs. $0.4 billion in 2019 (primarily associated with talc related reserves and certain settlements)
•the fiscal year 2019 included a gain of $0.3 billion related to the company's previously held equity investment in dr. ci:labo partially offset by:
•portfolio and investment optimization including execution of the ongoing sku rationalization program pharmaceutical segment:
in 2020, the pharmaceutical segment income before tax as a percent to sales was 33.9% versus 20.9% in 2019. the increase in the income before tax as a percent of sales was primarily driven by the following:
•lower litigation expense of $0.8 billion in 2020 vs. $4.3 billion in 2019 (primarily related to the agreement in principle to settle opioid litigation, of which $1.0 billion is in 2020 and $4.0 billion is in 2019)
•an in-process research and development charge of $0.9 billion in fiscal 2019 related to alios
•leveraging in selling, marketing and administrative expense medical devices segment: in 2020, the medical devices segment income before tax as a percent to sales was 13.3% versus 28.1% in 2019. the decrease in the income before tax as a percent to sales was primarily driven by the following:
•a gain of $2.0 billion related to the asp divestiture recorded in the fiscal 2019
•idle capacity costs associated with covid-19 related production slow downs in fiscal 2020
•establishment of obsolescence reserves and fixed cost deleveraging associated with the impact of covid-19 in fiscal 2020
•the negative impact of covid-19 on sales in fiscal 2020
•an in-process research and development charge of $0.2 billion in fiscal 2020 primarily related to the auris health acquisition partially offset by:
•a contingent consideration reversal of approximately $1.1 billion in fiscal 2020 related to the timing of certain developmental milestones associated with the auris health acquisition
restructuring: in the fiscal second quarter of 2018, the company announced plans to implement actions across its global supply chain that are intended to enable the company to focus resources and increase investments in critical capabilities, technologies and solutions necessary to manufacture and supply its product portfolio of the future, enhance agility and drive growth. the company expects these supply chain actions will include expanding its use of strategic collaborations, and bolstering its initiatives to reduce complexity, improving cost-competitiveness, enhancing capabilities and optimizing its network.  discussions regarding specific future actions are ongoing and are subject to all relevant consultation requirements before they are finalized. in total, the company expects these actions to generate approximately $0.6 to $0.8 billion in annual pre-tax cost savings that will be substantially delivered by 2022. the company expects to record pre-tax restructuring charges of approximately $1.9 to $2.3 billion. the company estimates that approximately 70% of the cumulative pre-tax costs will result in cash outlays. in 2020, the company recorded a pre-tax charge of $0.4 billion, which is included on the following lines of the consolidated statement of earnings, $0.2 billion in restructuring, $0.1 billion in other (income) expense and $0.1 billion in cost of products sold. total project costs of approximately $1.3 billion have been recorded since the restructuring was announced.
see note 20 to the consolidated financial statements for additional details related to the restructuring programs.
provision for taxes on income: the worldwide effective income tax rate was 10.8% in 2020 and 12.7% in 2019. during the fiscal first quarter of 2021, the internal revenue service published final regulations addressing the requirements for tax deductibility of settlement payments. the company recorded a pre-tax reserve for $4.0 billion in the fiscal year 2019 based on the agreement in principle to settle opioid litigation and recorded an additional pre-tax $1.0 billion in the fiscal third quarter of 2020 upon which an effective rate of 21.4% has been applied.
for discussion related to the fiscal 2020 provision for taxes refer to note 8 to the consolidated financial statements.
liquidity and capital resources liquidity & cash flows cash and cash equivalents were $14.0 billion at the end of 2020 as compared to $17.3 billion at the end of 2019.
the primary sources and uses of cash that contributed to the $3.3 billion decrease were:
23.5             cash generated from operating activities
0.1             effect of exchange rate and rounding
$14.0             q4 2020 cash and cash equivalents balance in addition, the company had $11.2 billion in marketable securities at the end of fiscal year 2020 and $2.0 billion at the end of fiscal year 2019. see note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for additional details on cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities.
cash flow from operations of $23.5 billion was the result of:
7.3             non-cash expenses and other adjustments primarily for depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation, asset write-downs and credit losses and accounts receivable allowances partially offset by the deferred tax provision and net gain on sale of assets/businesses
(1.2)             contingent consideration reversal (related to the timing of certain developmental milestones associated with the auris health acquisition) and rounding
$23.5             cash flow from operations investing activities use of $20.8 billion of cash was primarily used for:
$(7.3)             primarily related to the acquisitions of momenta, bermekimab and related assets from xbiotech inc. as well as the acquisition of all outstanding shares in verb surgical inc.
(9.0)             net purchases of investments
(1.0)             credit support agreements activity, net
0.3             proceeds from the disposal of assets/businesses, net
$(20.8)             net cash used for investing activities financing activities use of $6.1 billion of cash was primarily used for:
(3.2)             repurchase of common stock
(0.3)             credit support agreements activity, net
$(6.1)             net cash used for financing activities as of january 3, 2021, the company's notes payable and long-term debt was in excess of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. as of january 3, 2021, the net debt position was $10.1 billion as compared to the prior year of $8.4 billion. there was an increase in the net debt position due to increased borrowings in the fiscal third quarter of 2020. the debt balance at the end of 2020 was $35.3 billion as compared to $27.7 billion in 2019. considering recent market conditions and the on-going covid-19 crisis, the company has evaluated its operating cash flows and liquidity profile and does not foresee any significant incremental risk. the company anticipates that operating cash flows, the ability to raise funds from external sources, borrowing capacity from existing committed credit facilities and access to the commercial paper markets will continue to provide sufficient resources to fund operating needs, including the talc litigation and agreement in principle to settle opioid litigation of which the majority may be paid over the next two to three years. in addition, the company monitors the global capital markets on an ongoing basis and from time to time may raise capital when market conditions are favorable. in the fiscal third quarter of 2020, the company issued approximately $5.0 billion of commercial paper, with approximately $0.8 billion outstanding at year end. in the fiscal third quarter of 2020, the company issued senior unsecured notes for a total of $7.5 billion. for additional details on borrowings, see note 7 to the consolidated financial statements. the net proceeds from this offering were used to fund the momenta pharmaceuticals, inc. acquisition which closed on october 1, 2020 and for general corporate purposes. additionally, as a result of the tax cuts and jobs act (tcja), the company has access to its cash outside the u.s. at a significantly reduced cost.
the following table summarizes the company's material contractual obligations and their aggregate maturities as of january 3, 2021: to satisfy these obligations, the company intends to use cash from operations.
for tax matters, see note 8 to the consolidated financial statements. the table does not include activity related to business combinations or the company's approximate $0.9 billion in contractual supply commitments associated with its development of a covid-19 vaccine.
financing and market risk the company uses financial instruments to manage the impact of foreign exchange rate changes on cash flows. accordingly, the company enters into forward foreign exchange contracts to protect the value of certain foreign currency assets and liabilities and to hedge future foreign currency transactions primarily related to product costs. gains or losses on these contracts are offset by the gains or losses on the underlying transactions. a 10% appreciation of the u.s. dollar from the january 3, 2021 market rates would increase the unrealized value of the company's forward contracts by $121 million. conversely, a 10% depreciation of the u.s. dollar from the january 3, 2021 market rates would decrease the unrealized value of the company's forward contracts by $148 million. in either scenario, the gain or loss on the forward contract would be offset by the gain or loss on the underlying transaction, and therefore, would have no impact on future anticipated earnings and cash flows.
the company hedges the exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates, and the effect on certain assets and liabilities in foreign currency, by entering into currency swap contracts. a 1% change in the spread between u.s. and foreign interest rates on the company's interest rate sensitive financial instruments would either increase or decrease the unrealized value of the company's swap contracts by approximately $1,667 million. in either scenario, at maturity, the gain or loss on the swap contract would be offset by the gain or loss on the underlying transaction, and therefore, would have no impact on future anticipated cash flows.
the company does not enter into financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. further, the company has a policy of only entering into contracts with parties that have at least an investment grade credit rating. the counterparties to these contracts are major financial institutions and there is no significant concentration of exposure with any one counterparty. management believes the risk of loss is remote. the company entered into credit support agreements (csa) with certain derivative counterparties establishing collateral thresholds based on respective credit ratings and netting agreements. see note 6 to the consolidated financial statements for additional details on credit support agreements.
the company invests in both fixed rate and floating rate interest earning securities which carry a degree of interest rate risk. the fair market value of fixed rate securities may be adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates, while floating rate securities may produce less income than predicted if interest rates fall. a 1% (100 basis points) change in spread on the company's interest rate sensitive investments would either increase or decrease the unrealized value of cash equivalents and current marketable securities by approximately $36 million.
the company has access to substantial sources of funds at numerous banks worldwide. in september 2020, the company secured a new 364-day credit facility. total credit available to the company approximates $10 billion, which expires on september 9, 2021. interest charged on borrowings under the credit line agreement is based on either bids provided by banks, london interbank offered rates (libor), secured overnight financing rate (sofr) swap curve or other applicable market rate as allowed plus applicable margins. commitment fees under the agreement are not material.
total borrowings at the end of 2020 and 2019 were $35.3 billion and $27.7 billion, respectively. the increase in borrowings was the issuance of notes in 2020 when market conditions were favorable. in 2020, net debt (cash and current marketable securities, net of debt) was $10.1 billion compared to net debt of $8.4 billion in 2019. total debt represented 35.8% of total capital (shareholders' equity and total debt) in 2020 and 31.8% of total capital in 2019. shareholders' equity per share at the end of 2020 was $24.04 compared to $22.59 at year-end 2019.
a summary of borrowings can be found in note 7 to the consolidated financial statements.
on january 4, 2021, the board of directors declared a regular cash dividend of $1.01 per share, payable on march 9, 2021 to shareholders of record as of february 23, 2021.
other information critical accounting policies and estimates management's discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition are based on the company's consolidated financial statements that have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the u.s. (gaap). the preparation of these financial statements requires that management make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported for revenues, expenses, assets, liabilities and other related disclosures. actual results may or may not differ from these estimates. the company believes that the understanding of certain key accounting policies and estimates are essential in achieving more insight into the company's operating results and financial condition. these key accounting policies include revenue recognition, income taxes, legal and self-insurance contingencies, valuation of long-lived assets, assumptions used to determine the amounts recorded for pensions and other employee benefit plans and accounting for stock based awards.
the extent to which covid-19 impacts the company's business and financial results will depend on numerous evolving factors including, but not limited to, the magnitude and duration of covid-19, the extent to which it will impact worldwide macroeconomic conditions including interest rates, employment rates and health insurance coverage, the speed of the anticipated recovery, and governmental and business reactions to the pandemic. the company assessed certain accounting matters that generally require consideration of forecasted financial information in context with the information reasonably available to the company and the unknown future impacts of covid-19 as of january 3, 2021 and through the date of this report. the accounting matters assessed included, but were not limited to, the company's allowance for doubtful accounts and credit losses, inventory and related reserves, accrued rebates and associated reserves, and the carrying value of the goodwill and other long-lived assets. while there was not a material impact to the company's consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended january 3, 2021, the company's future assessment of the magnitude and duration of covid-19, as well as other factors, could result in material impacts to the company's consolidated financial statements in future reporting periods.
revenue recognition: the company recognizes revenue from product sales when obligations under the terms of a contract with the customer are satisfied; generally, this occurs with the transfer of control of the goods to customers. the company's global payment terms are typically between 30 to 90 days. provisions for certain rebates, sales incentives, trade promotions, coupons, product returns and discounts to customers are accounted for as variable consideration and recorded as a reduction in sales.
product discounts granted are based on the terms of arrangements with direct, indirect and other market participants, as well as market conditions, including consideration of competitor pricing. rebates are estimated based on contractual terms, historical experience, patient outcomes, trend analysis and projected market conditions in the various markets served. the company evaluates market conditions for products or groups of products primarily through the analysis of wholesaler and other third-party sell-through and market research data, as well as internally generated information.
sales returns are estimated and recorded based on historical sales and returns information. products that exhibit unusual sales or return patterns due to dating, competition or other marketing matters are specifically investigated and analyzed as part of the accounting for sales return accruals.
sales returns allowances represent a reserve for products that may be returned due to expiration, destruction in the field, or in specific areas, product recall. the sales returns reserve is based on historical return trends by product and by market as a percent to gross sales. in accordance with the company's accounting policies, the company generally issues credit to customers for returned goods. the company's sales returns reserves are accounted for in accordance with the u.s. gaap guidance for revenue recognition when right of return exists. sales returns reserves are recorded at full sales value. sales returns in the consumer health and pharmaceutical segments are almost exclusively not resalable. sales returns for certain franchises in the medical devices segment are typically resalable but are not material. the company infrequently exchanges products from inventory for returned products. the sales returns reserve for the total company has been approximately 1.0% of annual net trade sales during the fiscal years 2020 and 2019.
promotional programs, such as product listing allowances and cooperative advertising arrangements, are recorded in the same period as related sales. continuing promotional programs include coupons and volume-based sales incentive programs. the redemption cost of consumer coupons is based on historical redemption experience by product and value. volume-based incentive programs are based on the estimated sales volumes for the incentive period and are recorded as products are sold. these arrangements are evaluated to determine the appropriate amounts to be deferred or recorded as a reduction of revenue. the company also earns profit-share payments through collaborative arrangements of certain products, which are included in sales to customers. for all years presented, profit-share payments were less than 3.0% of the total revenues and are included in sales to customers.
in addition, the company enters into collaboration arrangements that contain multiple revenue generating activities. amounts due from collaborative partners for these arrangements are recognized as each activity is performed or delivered, based on the relative selling price. upfront fees received as part of these arrangements are deferred and recognized over the performance period. see note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for additional disclosures on collaborations.
reasonably likely changes to assumptions used to calculate the accruals for rebates, returns and promotions are not anticipated to have a material effect on the financial statements. the company currently discloses the impact of changes to assumptions in the quarterly or annual filing in which there is a material financial statement impact.
below are tables that show the progression of accrued rebates, returns, promotions, reserve for doubtful accounts and reserve for cash discounts by segment of business for the fiscal years ended january 3, 2021 and december 29, 2019.

(1)includes reserve for customer rebates of $707 million at january 3, 2021 and $499 million at december 29, 2019, recorded as a contra asset.
income taxes: income taxes are recorded based on amounts refundable or payable for the current year and include the results of any difference between u.s. gaap accounting and tax reporting, recorded as deferred tax assets or liabilities. the company estimates deferred tax assets and liabilities based on enacted tax regulations and rates. future changes in tax laws and rates may affect recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities.
the company has unrecognized tax benefits for uncertain tax positions. the company follows u.s. gaap, which prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. management believes that changes in these estimates would not have a material effect on the company's results of operations, cash flows or financial position.
the company has recorded deferred tax liabilities on all undistributed earnings prior to december 31, 2017 from its international subsidiaries. the company has not provided deferred taxes on the undistributed earnings subsequent to january 1, 2018 from certain international subsidiaries where the earnings are considered to be indefinitely reinvested. the company intends to continue to reinvest these earnings in those international operations. if the company decides at a later date to repatriate these earnings to the u.s., the company would be required to provide for the net tax effects on these amounts. the company estimates that the total tax effect of this repatriation would be approximately $0.7 billion under current enacted tax laws and regulations and at current currency exchange rates.
during the fiscal first quarter of 2021, the internal revenue service published final regulations addressing the requirements for tax deductibility of settlement payments. the company recorded a pre-tax reserve for $4.0 billion in fiscal 2019 based on the agreement in principle to settle opioid litigation and recorded an additional pre-tax $1.0 billion in the fiscal third quarter of 2020 upon which an effective rate of 21.4% has been applied.
see note 8 to the consolidated financial statements for further information regarding income taxes.
legal and self insurance contingencies: the company records accruals for various contingencies, including legal proceedings and product liability claims as these arise in the normal course of business. the accruals are based on management's judgment as to the probability of losses and, where applicable, actuarially determined estimates. the company has self insurance through a wholly-owned captive insurance company. in addition to accruals in the self insurance program, claims that exceed the insurance coverage are accrued when losses are probable and amounts can be reasonably estimated.
the company follows the provisions of u.s. gaap when recording litigation related contingencies. a liability is recorded when a loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated.
see notes 1 and 19 to the consolidated financial statements for further information regarding product liability and legal proceedings.
long-lived and intangible assets: the company assesses changes, both qualitatively and quantitatively, in economic conditions and makes assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows in evaluating the value of the company's property, plant and equipment, goodwill and intangible assets. as these assumptions and estimates may change over time, it may or may not be necessary for the company to record impairment charges.
employee benefit plans: the company sponsors various retirement and pension plans, including defined benefit, defined contribution and termination indemnity plans, which cover most employees worldwide. these plans are based on assumptions for the discount rate, expected return on plan assets, mortality rates, expected salary increases, health care cost trend rates and attrition rates. see note 10 to the consolidated financial statements for further details on these rates.
stock based compensation: the company recognizes compensation expense associated with the issuance of equity instruments to employees for their services. based on the type of equity instrument, the fair value is estimated on the date of grant using either the black-scholes option valuation model or a combination of both the black-scholes option valuation model and monte carlo valuation model, and is expensed in the financial statements over the service period. the input assumptions used in determining fair value are the expected life, expected volatility, risk-free rate and expected dividend yield. prior to fiscal 2020, for performance share units, the fair market value was calculated for each of the three component goals at the date of grant: operational sales, adjusted operational earnings per share and relative total shareholder return. beginning in fiscal 2020, for performance share units, the fair market value is calculated for the two component goals at the date of grant: adjusted operational earnings per share and relative total shareholder return. the fair values for the earnings per share goal of each performance share unit was estimated on the date of grant using the fair market value of the shares at the time of the award, discounted for dividends, which are not paid on the performance share units during the vesting period. the fair value for the relative total shareholder return goal of each performance share unit was estimated on the date of grant using the monte carlo valuation model. see note 16 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.
new accounting pronouncements refer to note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for recently adopted accounting pronouncements and recently issued accounting pronouncements not yet adopted as of january 3, 2021.
economic and market factors covid-19 considerations and business continuity the company has considered various internal and external factors in assessing the potential impact of covid-19 on its business and financial results based upon information available at this time, as follows:
•operating model: the company has a diversified business model across the healthcare industry with flexibility designed into its manufacturing, research and development clinical operations and commercial capabilities.
•supply chain: the company continues to leverage its global manufacturing footprint and dual-source capabilities while closely monitoring and maintaining critical inventory at major distribution centers away from high-risk areas to ensure adequate and effective distribution.
•business continuity: the robust, active business continuity plans across the company's network have been instrumental in preparing the company for events like covid-19 and the ability to meet the majority of patient and consumer needs remains uninterrupted.
•liquidity: the company's high-quality credit rating allows the company superior access to the financial capital markets for the foreseeable future. in the fiscal third quarter of 2020, the company issued approximately $5.0 billion of commercial paper, with approximately $0.8 billion outstanding at year end, for additional liquidity. additionally, in the fiscal third quarter of 2020, the company issued senior unsecured notes for a total of $7.5 billion. the net proceeds from this offering were used to fund the momenta pharmaceuticals, inc. acquisition on october 1, 2020 and for general corporate purposes.
•domestic and foreign legislation: the company will continue to assess and evaluate the on-going global legislative efforts to combat the covid-19 impact on economies and the sectors in which it participates. currently, the recent legislative acts put in place are not expected to have a material impact on the company's operations.
in fiscal 2020, the company entered into a series of contract manufacturing arrangements for vaccine production with third party contract manufacturing organizations. these arrangements provide the company with future supplemental commercial capacity for vaccine production and potentially transferable rights to such production if capacity is not required. amounts paid and contractually obligated to be paid to these contract manufacturing organizations of approximately $0.9 billion are reflected in the prepaid expenses and other, other assets, accrued liabilities and other liabilities accounts in the company's consolidated balance sheet upon execution of each agreement. additionally, the company has entered into certain vaccine development cost sharing arrangements with government related organizations.
the company is aware that its products are used in an environment where, for more than a decade, policymakers, consumers and businesses have expressed concerns about the rising cost of health care. in response to these concerns, the company has a long-standing policy of pricing products responsibly. for the period 2010 - 2020, in the u.s., the weighted average compound annual growth rate of the company's net price increases for health care products (prescription and over-the-counter drugs, hospital and professional products) was below the u.s. consumer price index (cpi).
the company operates in certain countries where the economic conditions continue to present significant challenges. the company continues to monitor these situations and take appropriate actions. inflation rates continue to have an effect on worldwide economies and, consequently, on the way companies operate. the company has accounted for operations in argentina (beginning in the fiscal third quarter of 2018) and venezuela as highly inflationary, as the prior three-year cumulative inflation rate surpassed 100%. this did not have a material impact to the company's results in the period. in the face of increasing costs, the company strives to maintain its profit margins through cost reduction programs, productivity improvements and periodic price increases.
in june 2016, the united kingdom (u.k.) held a referendum in which voters approved an exit from the european union (e.u.), commonly referred to as "brexit". the u.k. officially exited the e.u. on january 31, 2020, however, there was a transition period to allow time to agree the terms of a new trade deal. on december 30, 2020, the u.k., e.u. and the european atomic energy community (euratom) signed the eu-uk trade and cooperation agreement (tca). over the last few years, brexit has created global political and economic uncertainty and has led to volatility in exchange rates and interest rates, additional cost containment by third-party payors and changes in regulations. while the uk and eu have now agreed on a future trade and cooperation agreement, it is still unclear what the ultimate financial, trade, regulatory and legal implications the withdrawal of the u.k. from the e.u. will have. however, the company currently does not believe that these and other related effects will have a material impact on the company's consolidated financial position or operating results. as of january 3, 2021, the business of the company's u.k. subsidiaries represented less than 6% of the company's consolidated assets and less than 3% of the company's fiscal twelve months revenues.
the company is exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates. a 1% change in the value of the u.s. dollar as compared to all foreign currencies in which the company had sales, income or expense in 2020 would have increased or decreased the translation of foreign sales by approximately $384 million and net income by approximately $115 million.
governments around the world consider various proposals to make changes to tax laws, which may include increasing or decreasing existing statutory tax rates. a change in statutory tax rate in any country would result in the revaluation of the company's deferred tax assets and liabilities related to that particular jurisdiction in the period in which the new tax law is enacted.  this change would result in an expense or benefit recorded to the company's consolidated statement of earnings.  the company closely monitors these proposals as they arise in the countries where it operates. changes to the statutory tax rate may occur at any time, and any related expense or benefit recorded may be material to the fiscal quarter and year in which the law change is enacted.
the company faces various worldwide health care changes that may continue to result in pricing pressures that include health care cost containment and government legislation relating to sales, promotions and reimbursement of health care products.
changes in the behavior and spending patterns of purchasers of health care products and services, including delaying medical procedures, rationing prescription medications, reducing the frequency of physician visits and foregoing health care insurance coverage, as a result of the current global economic downturn, may continue to impact the company's businesses.
the company also operates in an environment increasingly hostile to intellectual property rights. firms have filed abbreviated new drug applications or biosimilar biological product applications with the fda or otherwise challenged the coverage and/or validity of the company's patents, seeking to market generic or biosimilar forms of many of the company's key pharmaceutical products prior to expiration of the applicable patents covering those products. in the event the company is not successful in defending the patent claims challenged in the resulting lawsuits, generic or biosimilar versions of the products at issue will be introduced to the market, resulting in the potential for substantial market share and revenue losses for those products, and which may result in a non-cash impairment charge in any associated intangible asset. there is also a risk that one or more competitors could launch a generic or biosimilar version of the product at issue following regulatory approval even though one or more valid patents are in place.
legal proceedings johnson & johnson and certain of its subsidiaries are involved in various lawsuits and claims regarding product liability, intellectual property, commercial and other matters; governmental investigations; and other legal proceedings that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of business.
the company records accruals for loss contingencies associated with these legal matters when it is probable that a liability will be incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. as of january 3, 2021, the company has determined that the liabilities associated with certain litigation matters are probable and can be reasonably estimated. the company has accrued for these matters and will continue to monitor each related legal issue and adjust accruals as might be warranted based on new information and further developments in accordance with asc 450-20-25. for these and other litigation and regulatory matters discussed below for which a loss is probable or reasonably possible, the company is unable to estimate the possible loss or range of loss beyond the amounts accrued. amounts accrued for legal contingencies often result from a complex series of judgments about future events and uncertainties that rely heavily on estimates and assumptions including timing of related payments. the ability to make such estimates and judgments can be affected by various factors including, among other things, whether damages sought in the proceedings are unsubstantiated or indeterminate; scientific and legal discovery has not commenced or is not complete; proceedings are in early stages; matters present legal uncertainties; there are significant facts in dispute; procedural or jurisdictional issues; the uncertainty and unpredictability of the number of potential claims; ability to achieve comprehensive multi-party settlements; complexity of related cross-claims and counterclaims; and/or there are numerous parties involved. to the extent adverse verdicts have been rendered against the company, the company does not record an accrual until a loss is determined to be probable and can be reasonably estimated.
in the company's opinion, based on its examination of these matters, its experience to date and discussions with counsel, the ultimate outcome of legal proceedings, net of liabilities accrued in the company's balance sheet, is not expected to have a material adverse effect on the company's financial position. however, the resolution of, or increase in accruals for, one or more of these matters in any reporting period may have a material adverse effect on the company's results of operations and cash flows for that period.

during the year ended december 31, 2022, revenues increased by $921 million as compared to the year ended december 31, 2021, representing growth of 5.0%, or 7.5% on a constant currency basis1. our recently completed acquisitions contributed 100 basis points to revenue growth while the previously disclosed sale of the samlink subsidiary, which was completed on february 1, 2022, negatively impacted revenue growth by 60 basis points.
revenue growth was strongest in our communications, media and technology and products and resources segments. revenues in our financial services segment reflect the negative impact of the previously disclosed sale of the samlink subsidiary, which was completed on february 1, 2022. for further details, see the "revenues - reportable business segments" section within the results of operations.
revenue growth was driven by our clients' continued adoption and integration of digital technologies as well as pricing improvements but was negatively impacted by challenges attracting and retaining personnel and slowing demand for our services through the second half of 2022. for the year ended december 31, 2022, our attrition, including both voluntary and involuntary, was 31.7% as compared to 30.8% for the year ended december 31, 2021. for the three months ended december 31, 2022, our annualized attrition rate, including both voluntary and involuntary, was 25.3% as compared to 34.6% for the three months ended december 31, 2021. attrition and hiring challenges have also resulted in increased cost of delivery.

business outlook see "overview" within part i, item 1. business for information on our four strategic priorities.
we expect clients to continue to contend with industry-specific changes driven by evolving digital technologies, uncertainty in the regulatory environment, industry consolidation and convergence as well as international trade policies and other macroeconomic factors, including the increasing uncertainty related to the global economy, which could affect their demand for our services.
as a global professional services company, we compete on the basis of the knowledge, experience, insights, skills and talent of our employees and the value they can provide to our clients. our success is dependent, in large part, on our ability to keep our supply of skilled employees, in particular those with experience in key digital areas, in balance with client demand. competition for skilled employees in the current labor market is intense and in 2021 and 2022, we experienced significantly elevated voluntary attrition. we saw improvement in our annualized attrition rate for the three months ended december 31, 2022 and we expect our annualized attrition rate for the first quarter of 2023 to be lower than our full year 2022 rate. attrition can be difficult to predict as it is impacted by both macroeconomic and internal factors. challenges attracting and retaining personnel have negatively impacted and may continue to negatively impact cost of delivery and our ability to satisfy client demand. further, our ongoing and anticipated future efforts with respect to recruitment, talent management and employee engagement may not be successful and may continue to result in increased compensation costs. while we strive to adjust pricing to reduce the impact of compensation increases on our operating margin, we may not be successful in fully recovering these increases, which could adversely affect our profitability.
the invasion of ukraine by russia and the sanctions and other measures being imposed in response to this conflict have increased the level of economic and political uncertainty worldwide. we do not have employees, facilities or significant operations in either russia or ukraine and revenues generated from clients in both countries were immaterial in both 2021 and 2022. however, the continuation of the hostilities or the expansion of the current conflict's scope into surrounding geographic areas could impact us or our clients, vendors or subcontractors, which could in turn impact our operations and financial performance. we continue to monitor the situation closely to ensure business continuity plans are in place for neighboring countries where we have a presence.
our future results may be affected by potential tax law changes and other potential regulatory changes, including possible u.s. corporate income tax reform and potentially increased costs for employment and post-employment benefits in india as a result of the code on social security, 2020. for additional information, see part i, item 1a. risk factors.

¡ % of revenues our cost of revenues consists primarily of salaries, incentive-based compensation, stock-based compensation expense, employee benefits, project-related immigration and travel for technical personnel, subcontracting and equipment costs relating to revenues. the increase, as a percentage of revenues, was due to higher compensation costs for delivery personnel (including employees and subcontractors) as well as a 30 basis point negative impact due to the impairment of certain capitalized costs related to a large volume-based contract with a health sciences client, partially offset by delivery efficiencies and the depreciation of the indian rupee against the u.s. dollar. challenges attracting and retaining highly qualified personnel have resulted in higher compensation costs.
sg&amp;a expenses (exclusive of depreciation and amortization expense)
sg&a expenses consist primarily of salaries, incentive-based compensation, stock-based compensation expense, employee benefits, immigration, travel, marketing, communications, management, finance, administrative and occupancy costs. the decrease, as a percentage of revenues, was primarily due to economies of scale that allowed us to leverage our cost structure over a larger organization, the beneficial impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements and the optimization of non-strategic sg&a expenses.

¡ % of revenues depreciation and amortization expense depreciation and amortization expense decreased by 0.2%, as a percentage of revenue in 2022 as compared to 2021 primarily due to scale, as the expense remained relatively flat while revenues increased.
operating margin and adjusted operating margin6 - overall our 2022 operating margin was positively impacted by economies of scale that allowed us to leverage our cost structure over a larger organization, delivery efficiencies and the depreciation of the indian rupee against the u.s. dollar, partially offset by increased compensation costs for our delivery personnel (including employees and subcontractors) as well as a 30 basis point negative impact due to the impairment of certain capitalized costs related to a large volume-based contract with a health sciences client. our 2021 gaap operating margin was negatively impacted by the class action settlement loss, which was excluded from our adjusted operating margin6 in 2021.

excluding the impact of applicable designated cash flow hedges, the depreciation of the indian rupee against the u.s. dollar positively impacted our operating margin by approximately 115 basis points in 2022, while in 2021 the appreciation of the indian rupee against the u.s. dollar negatively impacted our operating margin by approximately 5 basis points. each additional 1.0% change in exchange rate between the indian rupee and the u.s. dollar will have the effect of moving our operating margin by approximately 18 basis points (excluding the impact of our cash flow hedges). in 2022, the settlement of our cash flow hedges negatively impacted our operating margin by approximately 7 basis points, compared to a positive impact of 35 basis points in 2021.
* annualized attrition segment operating profit in 2022, we made certain changes to the internal measurement of segment operating profit for the purpose of evaluating segment performance and resource allocation. the primary reason for the change was to charge to the segments the costs that they directly manage and control. specifically, segment operating profit now includes costs related to non-delivery personnel that support consulting services, which were previously included in "unallocated costs." we have reported 2022 segment operating profits using the new allocation methodology and have recast the 2021 results to conform to the new methodology. segment operating profit and operating margin percentage were as follows:

the foreign currency exchange losses were attributed to the remeasurement of net monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currencies of our subsidiaries. the gains on foreign exchange forward contracts not designated as hedging instruments related to the realized and unrealized gains and losses on contracts entered into to offset our foreign currency exposures. as of december 31, 2022, the notional value of our undesignated hedges was $1,433 million. the increase in interest income and interest expense was each primarily attributable to higher interest rates in the current period.
the effective income tax rate in 2022 decreased as compared to the 2021 period primarily due to higher discrete tax benefits in 2022, such as the recognition in the third quarter of 2022 of an income tax benefit of $36 million related to a specific uncertain tax position that was previously unrecognized in our prior-year consolidated financial statements and the impact of depreciation of the indian rupee against the u.s. dollar on our undistributed foreign earnings, partially offset by changes in the geographic mix of taxable income. see note 11 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information.
¡ % of revenues non-gaap financial measures portions of our disclosure include non-gaap financial measures. these non-gaap financial measures are not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles and should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with gaap, and may be different from non-gaap financial measures used by other companies. in addition, these non-gaap financial measures should be read in conjunction with our financial statements prepared in accordance with gaap. the reconciliations of non-gaap financial measures to the corresponding gaap measures set forth below should be carefully evaluated.

we believe providing investors with an operating view consistent with how we manage the company provides enhanced transparency into our operating results. for internal management reporting and budgeting purposes, we use various gaap and non-gaap financial measures for financial and operational decision-making, to evaluate period-to-period comparisons, to determine portions of the compensation for executive officers and for making comparisons of our operating results to those of our competitors. we believe that the presentation of non-gaap financial measures, which exclude certain costs, read in conjunction with out reported gaap results and reconciliations to the most comparable gaap measure, as applicable, can provide useful supplemental information to our management and investors regarding financial and business trends relating to our financial condition and results of operations.
a limitation of using non-gaap financial measures versus financial measures calculated in accordance with gaap is that non-gaap financial measures do not reflect all of the amounts associated with our operating results as determined in accordance with gaap and may exclude costs that are recurring such as net non-operating foreign currency exchange gains or losses. in addition, other companies may calculate non-gaap financial measures differently than us, thereby limiting the usefulness of these non-gaap financial measures as a comparative tool. we compensate for these limitations by providing specific information regarding the gaap amounts excluded from non-gaap financial measures to allow investors to evaluate such non-gaap financial measures.

cognizant         december 31, 2022 form 10-k the effective tax rate related to non-operating foreign currency exchange gains and losses varies depending on the jurisdictions in which such income and expenses are generated and the statutory rates applicable in those jurisdictions. as such, the income tax effect of non-operating foreign currency exchange gains and losses shown in the above table may not appear proportionate to the net pre-tax foreign currency exchange gains and losses reported in our consolidated statements of operations.
(4)    during the three months ended september 30, 2022, we recognized an income tax benefit of $36 million related to a specific uncertain tax position that was previously unrecognized in our prior-year consolidated financial statements. the recognition of the benefit in the third quarter of 2022 was based on management's reassessment regarding whether this unrecognized tax benefit met the more-likely-than-not threshold in light of the lapse in the statute of limitations as to a portion of such benefit.
liquidity and capital resources cash generated from operations has historically been our primary source of liquidity to fund operations and investments to grow our business. as of december 31, 2022, we had cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of $2,501 million. additionally, as of december 31, 2022, we had available capacity under our credit facilities of approximately $2,000 million.
the following table provides a summary of our cash flows for the years ended december 31:
operating activities                               $2,568                  $2,495                           $73
other cash flow information7
operating activities7
the increase in cash provided by operating activities in 2022 compared to 2021 was primarily driven by higher income from operations.
we monitor turnover, aging and the collection of trade accounts receivable by client. our dso calculation includes trade accounts receivable, net of allowance for credit losses, and contract assets, reduced by the uncollected portion of our deferred revenue. dso was 74 days as of december 31, 2022 and 69 days as of december 31, 2021.
investing activities the decrease in cash used in investing activities in 2022 compared to 2021 was primarily driven by net maturities of investments in 2022 as compared to net purchases of investments in 2021 as well as lower payments for business combinations in 2022.
financing activities the increase in cash used in financing activities in 2022 compared to 2021 was primarily driven by higher repurchases of common stock.
in october 2022, we completed a debt refinancing and entered into the new credit agreement with a commercial bank syndicate providing for a $650 million new term loan and a $1,850 million unsecured revolving credit facility, which are each due to mature in october 2027. the credit agreement was terminated upon the closing of the new credit agreement and the proceeds from the new term loan were used primarily to repay our outstanding term loan balance. we are required under the new credit agreement to make scheduled quarterly principal payments on the new term loan beginning in december 2023. see note 10 to our consolidated financial statements. we believe that we currently meet all conditions set forth in the new credit agreement to borrow thereunder, and we are not aware of any conditions that would prevent us from borrowing part or all of the remaining available capacity under the revolving credit facility as of december 31, 2022 and through the date of this filing. as of december 31, 2022, we had no outstanding balance on our revolving credit facility.

cognizant         36       december 31, 2022 form 10-k in march 2022, our india subsidiary renewed its one-year 13 billion indian rupee ($157 million at the december 31, 2022 exchange rate) working capital facility, which requires us to repay any balances drawn down within 90 days from the date of disbursement. there is a 1.0% prepayment penalty applicable to payments made within 30 days of disbursement. this working capital facility contains affirmative and negative covenants and is renewable annually. as of december 31, 2022, there was no balance outstanding under the working capital facility.
capital allocation framework acquisitions share repurchases dividend payments our capital allocation framework anticipates the deployment of approximately 50% of our free cash flow8 for acquisitions, 25% for share repurchases and 25% for dividend payments. we review our capital allocation on an ongoing basis, considering our financial performance and liquidity position, investments required to execute our strategic plans and initiatives, acquisition opportunities, the economic outlook, regulatory changes and other relevant factors. as these factors may change over time, the actual amounts expended on stock repurchase activity, dividends, and acquisitions, if any, during any particular period cannot be predicted and may fluctuate from time to time.
other liquidity and capital resources information we seek to ensure that our worldwide cash is available in the locations in which it is needed. as part of our ongoing liquidity assessments, we regularly monitor the mix of our domestic and international cash flows and cash balances. we evaluate on an ongoing basis what portion of the non-u.s. cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments is needed locally to execute our strategic plans and what amount is available for repatriation back to the united states.
we expect operating cash flows, cash and short-term investment balances, together with the available capacity under our revolving credit facilities, to be sufficient to meet our operating requirements, including purchase commitments, tax payments, including tax reform act transition tax payments, and servicing our debt for the next twelve months. our tax reform act transition tax payments are due in annual installments of $94 million, $126 million and $157 million for the years 2023, 2024 and 2025, respectively. in 2022, our tax reform act transition tax payment was $50 million. we also have purchase commitments of approximately $350 million that will be paid over the next three years, of which approximately $150 million will be paid during the next twelve months. see note 7 to our consolidated financial statements for a description of our operating lease obligations.
provisions enacted in the tax reform act in december 2017 related to the capitalization of research and experimental expenditures became effective on january 1, 2022. these provisions require us to capitalize research and experimental expenditures and amortize them for tax purposes over five or fifteen years, depending on where the research is conducted. previously these expenses could be deducted in the year incurred. the implementation of these provisions has increased our income taxes payable in the united states for the 2022 tax year by approximately $300 million. the incremental tax amount related to the 2022 mandatory capitalization of research and experimental expenditures had not been paid as of december 31, 2022, and will be paid on or before april 15, 2023. we estimate an additional similar amount of cash taxes to be paid in 2023 related to the capitalization of 2023 research and experimental expenditures. the capitalized expenses are recorded as a deferred tax asset and do not significantly impact our effective income tax rate.
the ability to expand and grow our business in accordance with current plans, make acquisitions, meet long-term capital requirements beyond a twelve-month period and execute our capital return plan will depend on many factors, including the rate, if any, at which cash flow increases, our ability and willingness to pay for acquisitions with capital stock and the availability of public and private debt, including the ability to extend the maturity of or refinance our existing debt, and equity financing. we cannot be certain that additional financing, if required, will be available on terms and conditions acceptable to us, if at all.

cognizant         december 31, 2022 form 10-k critical accounting estimates management's discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our accompanying consolidated financial statements that have been prepared in accordance with gaap. we base our estimates on historical experience, current trends and on various other assumptions that are believed to be relevant at the time our consolidated financial statements are prepared. we evaluate our estimates on a continuous basis. however, the actual amounts may differ from the estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.
we believe the following accounting estimates are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our consolidated financial statements as they require the most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, resulting from the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. changes to these estimates could have a material effect on our results of operations and financial condition. our significant accounting policies are described in note 1 to our consolidated financial statements.
revenue recognition. revenues related to fixed-price contracts for application development and systems integration services, consulting or other technology services are recognized as the service is performed using the cost-to-cost method, under which the total value of revenues is recognized on the basis of the percentage that each contract's total labor cost to-date bears to the total expected labor costs. revenues related to fixed-price application maintenance, quality engineering and assurance and business process services are recognized using the cost-to-cost method, if the right to invoice is not representative of the value being delivered. the cost-to-cost method requires estimation of future costs, which is updated as the project progresses to reflect the latest available information. such estimates and changes in estimates involve the use of judgment. the cumulative impact of any revision in estimates is reflected in the financial reporting period in which the change in estimate becomes known. net changes in estimates of such future costs were immaterial to the consolidated results of operations for the periods presented.
income taxes. determining the consolidated provision for income taxes, deferred income tax assets (and related valuation allowance, if any) and liabilities requires significant judgment. we are required to calculate and provide for income taxes in each of the jurisdictions where we operate. changes in the geographic mix of income before taxes or estimated level of annual pre-tax income can affect our overall effective income tax rate. in addition, transactions between our affiliated entities are arranged in accordance with applicable transfer pricing laws, regulations and relevant guidelines. as a result, and due to the interpretive nature of certain aspects of these laws and guidelines, we have pending applications for apas before the taxing authorities in some of our most significant jurisdictions. it could take years for the relevant taxing authorities to negotiate and conclude these applications. the consolidated provision for income taxes may change period to period based on changes in facts and circumstances, such as settlements of income tax audits, the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations or finalization of our applications for apas.
our provision for income taxes also includes the impact of reserves established for uncertain income tax positions, as well as the related interest, which may require us to apply judgment to complex issues and may require an extended period of time to resolve. although we believe we have adequately reserved for our uncertain tax positions, no assurance can be given that the final outcome of these matters will not differ from our recorded amounts. we adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the closing of a tax audit or the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations. to the extent that the final outcome of these matters differs from the amounts recorded, such differences will impact the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made.
business combinations, goodwill and intangible assets. goodwill and intangible assets, including indefinite-lived intangible assets, arise from the accounting for business combinations. we account for business combinations using the acquisition method which requires us to estimate the fair value of identifiable assets acquired, liabilities assumed, including any contingent consideration, and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree to properly allocate purchase price to the individual assets acquired and liabilities assumed. the allocation of the purchase price utilizes estimates and assumptions in determining the fair values of identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed, especially with respect to intangible assets, including the timing and amount of forecasted revenues and cash flows, anticipated growth rates, client attrition rates and the discount rate reflecting the risk inherent in future cash flows.
at each acquisition date, we allocate goodwill and intangible assets to our reporting units based on how we expect each reporting unit to benefit from the respective business combination. our seven industry-based operating segments are our reporting units. we exercise judgment to allocate goodwill to the reporting units expected to benefit from each business combination. goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level on an annual basis and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value. these events or circumstances could include a significant change in the business climate, regulatory environment, established business plans, operating performance indicators or competition. evaluation of goodwill for impairment requires cognizant         december 31, 2022 form 10-k judgment, including the identification of reporting units, assignment of assets, liabilities and goodwill to reporting units and determination of the fair value of each reporting unit.
we estimate the fair value of our reporting units using a combination of an income approach, utilizing a discounted cash flow analysis, and a market approach, using market multiples. under the income approach, we estimate projected future cash flows, the timing of such cash flows and long-term growth rates, and determine the appropriate discount rate that reflects the risk inherent in the projected future cash flows. the discount rate used is based on a market participant weighted-average cost of capital and may be adjusted for the relevant risk associated with business-specific characteristics and the uncertainty related to the reporting unit's ability to execute on the projected future cash flows. under the market approach, we estimate fair value based on market multiples of revenues and earnings derived from comparable publicly-traded companies with characteristics similar to the reporting unit. the estimates used to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit change from year to year based on operating results, market conditions and other factors. changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value for each reporting unit.
based on our most recent evaluation of goodwill performed during the fourth quarter of 2022, we concluded that the goodwill in each of our reporting units was not at risk of impairment. as of december 31, 2022, our goodwill balance was $5,710 million.
we review our finite-lived assets, including our finite-lived intangible assets, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset group may not be recoverable. the carrying amount may not be recoverable when the sum of undiscounted expected future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of such asset groups. the impairment loss is determined as the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset group exceeds its fair value. assessing the fair value of asset groups involves significant estimates and assumptions including estimation of future cash flows, the timing of such cash flows and discount rates reflecting the risk inherent in future cash flows.

we manage our business organizationally through two segments: "products and systems integration" and "software and services." within these segments, we have principal product lines that also follow our three major technologies: lmr communications, video and command center. in january 2023, we began using command center as a naming convention, eliminating the "software" descriptor from command center software in order to inform investors that the company has software components more broadly across all technologies; this name change does not require any financial information to be reclassified from previous periods.

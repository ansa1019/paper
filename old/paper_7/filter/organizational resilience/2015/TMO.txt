item 7.   management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations reference is made throughout this management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations to notes to consolidated financial statements, which begin on page f-1 of this report.
overview the company develops, manufactures and sells a broad range of products that are sold worldwide. the company expands the product lines and services it offers by developing and commercializing its own technologies and by making strategic acquisitions of complementary businesses. the company's continuing operations fall into four business segments (see note 3): life sciences solutions, analytical instruments, specialty diagnostics and laboratory products and services.
recent acquisitions and divestitures the company's strategy is to augment internal growth at existing businesses with complementary acquisitions. the company's principal recent acquisitions and divestitures are described below.
on february 3, 2014, the company completed the acquisition of life technologies corporation for a total purchase price of $15.30 billion, net of cash acquired, including the assumption of $2.28 billion of debt. the company issued debt and common stock in late 2013 and early 2014 to partially fund the acquisition discussed below under the caption "liquidity and capital resources". life technologies was integrated into the life sciences solutions segment and provides innovative products and services to customers conducting scientific research and genetic analysis, as well as those in applied markets, such as forensics and food safety testing. life technologies' revenues totaled $3.87 billion in 2013.
on march 21, 2014, the company sold its legacy sera and media, gene modulation and magnetic beads businesses to ge healthcare for $1.06 billion, net of cash divested. the sale of these businesses resulted in a pre-tax gain of approximately $761 million included in restructuring and other costs (income), net. the businesses fell principally in the life sciences solutions segment. divestiture of these businesses was a condition to obtaining antitrust approval for the life technologies acquisition. revenues and operating income of the businesses sold were approximately $250 million and $64 million, respectively, for the year ended december 31, 2013 and $61 million and $12 million, respectively, in 2014 through the date of sale.
on august 15, 2014, the company sold its cole-parmer specialty channel business, part of the laboratory products and services segment, for $480 million in cash, net of cash divested. the sale of this business resulted in a pre-tax gain of approximately $134 million, included in restructuring and other costs (income), net. revenues and operating income of the business sold were approximately $232 million and $43 million, respectively, for the year ended december 31, 2013 and $149 million and $28 million, respectively, in 2014 through the date of sale.
on february 4, 2015, the company acquired advanced scientifics, inc., a north america-based global provider of single-use technologies for customized bioprocessing solutions, for approximately $289 million. advanced scientifics was integrated into the life sciences solutions segment and expands the company's bioprocessing offerings. revenues of advanced scientifics were approximately $80 million in 2014.
on september 30, 2015, the company acquired, within the laboratory products and services segment, alfa aesar, a u.k.-based global manufacturer of research chemicals from johnson matthey plc, for £257 million ($392 million) in cash. the acquisition expands the company's existing portfolio of chemicals, solvents and reagents. revenues of alfa aesar were approximately £78 million in 2014.
in january 2016, the company signed an agreement to acquire, within the life sciences solutions segment, affymetrix, inc., a north america-based provider of cellular and genetic analysis products, for approximately $1.3 billion in cash. the acquisition will expand the company's existing portfolio of antibodies and assays for high-growth flow cytometry and single-cell biology applications. revenues of affymetrix were $360 million in 2015. the transaction, which is expected to close by the end of the second quarter of 2016, is subject to the approval of affymetrix shareholders and the satisfaction of customary closing conditions, including regulatory approvals. the company expects to issue debt in advance of closing the acquisition of affymetrix to partially fund the acquisition.
management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview of results of operations and liquidity
laboratory products and services          6,661.5            39.3    %          6,601.5            39.1    %
sales in 2015 were $16.97 billion, an increase of $76 million from 2014. the unfavorable effects of currency translation resulted in a decrease in revenues of $938 million in 2015. sales increased $212 million due to acquisitions, net of divestitures. aside from the effects of currency translation, acquisitions and divestitures, revenues increased $803 million (5%) primarily due to increased demand. sales to customers in the company's primary end markets grew. demand from customers in pharmaceutical and biotech industries was particularly strong, while sales to industrial markets and academic and government markets grew modestly in 2015. sales growth was moderate in north america and europe and strong in asia. revenues and operating income of the company's non-u.s. operations are translated into u.s. dollars to report consolidated results. based on weakening of currency exchange rates against the u.s. dollar that occurred in 2015 and early 2016, the company currently expects that there will be a continued adverse effect on reported amounts of revenues and operating income in 2016 as a result of the stronger u.s. dollar.
in 2015, total company operating income and operating income margin were $2.34 billion and 13.8%, respectively, compared with $2.50 billion and 14.8%, respectively, in 2014. the decrease in operating income and operating income margin was primarily due to net gains of $895 million on the sale of businesses in 2014, offset in part by $450 million of charges in 2014 associated with the february 2014 acquisition of life technologies. the unfavorable impact of foreign currency exchange also contributed to the decrease in profitability. these factors that reduced operating income in 2015 were offset in part by productivity improvements, net of inflationary cost increases and, to a lesser extent, profit on higher sales in local currencies. the company's references throughout this discussion to productivity improvements generally refer to improved cost efficiencies from its practical process improvement (ppi) business system, reduced costs resulting from global sourcing initiatives, a lower cost structure following restructuring actions, including headcount reductions and consolidation of facilities, and low cost region manufacturing.
the company recorded a benefit from income taxes in 2015. in 2015, the company implemented tax planning initiatives related to non-u.s. subsidiaries. these initiatives resulted in additional foreign tax credits of $111 million, offset in part by additional u.s. income taxes of $46 million on the related foreign income (net benefit of $66 million), which reduced the company's effective rate by 3.4 percentage points. the company also implemented foreign tax credit planning in sweden which resulted in $80 million of foreign tax credits, with no related incremental u.s. income tax expense. in addition, the company recorded tax benefits totaling $54 million, or 2.8 percentage points, related to additional prior year foreign tax and other credits as well as restructuring and other costs associated with the 2014 acquisition of life technologies. the tax provision in the 2015 period was favorably affected by $37 million, or 1.9 percentage points, as a result of adjustments to deferred tax balances due to changes in tax rates. the effective tax rate in both 2015 and 2014 was also affected by relatively significant earnings in lower tax jurisdictions. due primarily to the non-deductibility of intangible asset amortization for tax purposes, the company's cash payments for income taxes were higher than its income tax expense for financial reporting purposes and totaled $477 million and $586 million in 2015 and 2014, respectively.
the company's effective tax rate was 9.2% in 2014. the 2014 provision for income taxes included $390 million related to gains on the sales of businesses. aside from the discrete tax on the gains, the company had a benefit from income taxes primarily due to restructuring and other costs associated with the acquisition of life technologies as well as an increase in the expected benefit from foreign tax credits. in 2014, non-u.s. subsidiaries of the company made cash and deemed distributions to the company's u.s. operations which resulted in no net tax cost. as a result of these distributions, the company generated u.s. foreign tax credits of $172 million, offset in part by additional u.s. income taxes of $55 million on the related foreign income. the net result of these transactions favorably affected the income tax provision by $117 million and reduced the company's effective tax rate by 5.6 percentage points in 2014. the federal tax credit for 2014 research and development activities favorably affected the tax provision in 2014 by $20 million, or 1.0 percentage point. in 2014, the company recognized a discrete
management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview of results of operations and liquidity (continued)
tax benefit of $15 million, or 0.7 percentage points, attributable to tax rulings related to non-u.s. subsidiaries. the tax provision in the 2014 period was favorably affected by $5.5 million, or 0.3 percentage points, as a result of adjustments to deferred tax balances due to changes in tax rates.
the company expects its effective tax rate in 2016 will be less than 3% based on currently forecasted rates of profitability in the countries in which the company conducts business and expected generation of foreign tax credits.
income from continuing operations increased to $1.98 billion in 2015, from $1.90 billion in 2014. the decrease in operating income in the 2015 period (discussed above) was more than offset by an increase in the income tax benefit in the 2015 period (discussed above) and a decrease in interest expense of $65 million primarily due to a reduction in outstanding debt and effective interest rates.
during 2015, the company's cash flow from operations totaled $2.82 billion compared with $2.62 billion for 2014. the increase resulted from cash disbursements in the 2014 period totaling $325 million related to the acquisition of life technologies, including severance obligations, third-party transaction/integration costs and monetizing certain equity awards held by life technologies employees at the date of acquisition, offset in part by lower payments in 2014 for incentive compensation as a result of life technologies having paid its annual incentive compensation prior to the acquisition.
as of december 31, 2015, the company's short-term debt totaled $1.05 billion, including $1.00 billion of senior notes, due in the next twelve months and $50 million of commercial paper obligations. the company has a revolving credit facility with a bank group that provides up to $2.00 billion of unsecured multi-currency revolving credit. if the company borrows under this facility, it intends to leave undrawn an amount equivalent to outstanding commercial paper to provide a source of funds in the event that commercial paper markets are not available. as of december 31, 2015, no borrowings were outstanding under the company's revolving credit facility, although available capacity was reduced by approximately $65 million as a result of outstanding letters of credit.
the company believes that its existing cash and cash equivalents of $452 million as of december 31, 2015 and its future cash flow from operations together with available borrowing capacity under its revolving credit agreement will be sufficient to meet the cash requirements of its existing businesses for the foreseeable future, including at least the next 24 months.
critical accounting policies and estimates the company's discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations is based upon its financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america. the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses and related disclosure of contingent liabilities. on an on-going basis, management evaluates its estimates, including those related to bad debts, inventories, business combinations, intangible assets and goodwill, sales returns, income taxes, contingencies and litigation, and pension costs. management believes the most complex and sensitive judgments, because of their significance to the consolidated financial statements, result primarily from the need to make estimates about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain. management bases its estimates on historical experience, current market and economic conditions and other assumptions that management believes are reasonable. the results of these estimates form the basis for judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities where the values are not readily apparent from other sources. actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
the company believes the following represent its critical accounting policies and estimates used in the preparation of its financial statements:
(a)   accounts receivable the company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to pay amounts due. such allowances totaled $70 million at december 31, 2015. the company estimates the amount of customer receivables that are uncollectible based on the age of the receivable, the creditworthiness of the customer and any other information that is relevant to the judgment. if the financial condition of the company's customers were to deteriorate, reducing their ability to make payments, additional allowances would be required.
management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies and estimates (continued)
expected demand and any other information that is relevant to the judgment. if ultimate usage or demand varies significantly from expected usage or demand, additional writedowns may be required.
(c)   intangible assets and goodwill the company uses assumptions and estimates in determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination. the determination of the fair value of intangible assets, which represent a significant portion of the purchase price in many of the company's acquisitions, requires the use of significant judgment with regard to (i) the fair value; and (ii) whether such intangibles are amortizable or non-amortizable and, if the former, the period and the method by which the intangible asset will be amortized. the company estimates the fair value of acquisition-related intangible assets principally based on projections of cash flows that will arise from identifiable intangible assets of acquired businesses. the projected cash flows are discounted to determine the present value of the assets at the dates of acquisition. definite-lived intangible assets totaled $11.51 billion at december 31, 2015. the company reviews definite-lived intangible assets for impairment when indication of potential impairment exists, such as a significant reduction in cash flows associated with the assets. actual cash flows arising from a particular intangible asset could vary from projected cash flows which could imply different carrying values from those established at the dates of acquisition and which could result in impairment of such asset.
the company evaluates goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment annually and when events occur or circumstances change that may reduce the fair value of the asset below its carrying amount. events or circumstances that might require an interim evaluation include unexpected adverse business conditions, economic factors, unanticipated technological changes or competitive activities, loss of key personnel and acts by governments and courts. goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets totaled $18.83 billion and $1.25 billion, respectively, at december 31, 2015. estimates of future cash flows require assumptions related to revenue and operating income growth, asset-related expenditures, working capital levels and other factors. different assumptions from those made in the company's analysis could materially affect projected cash flows and the company's evaluation of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment.
projections of profitability for 2016 and thereafter and indicated fair values based on peer revenues and earnings trading multiples were sufficient to conclude that no impairment of goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible assets existed at the end of the tenth fiscal month of 2015, the date of the company's impairment testing. there can be no assurance, however, that an economic downturn will not materially adversely affect peer trading multiples and the company's businesses such that they do not achieve their forecasted profitability and these assets become impaired. should the fair value of the company's goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible assets decline because of reduced operating performance, market declines, or other indicators of impairment, or as a result of changes in the discount rate, charges for impairment may be necessary.
(d)   revenues in instances where the company sells equipment with a related installation obligation, the company generally recognizes revenue related to the equipment when title passes. the company recognizes revenue related to the installation when it performs the installation. the allocation of revenue between the equipment and the installation is based on relative selling price at the time of sale. should the relative value of either the equipment or the installation change, the company's revenue recognition would be affected.
in instances where the company sells equipment with customer-specified acceptance criteria, the company must assess whether it can demonstrate adherence to the acceptance criteria prior to the customer's acceptance testing to determine the timing of revenue recognition. if the nature of customer-specified acceptance criteria were to change or grow in complexity such that the company could not demonstrate adherence, the company would be required to defer additional revenues upon shipment of its products until completion of customer acceptance testing.
the company records reductions to revenue for estimated product returns by customers. should a greater or lesser number of products be returned, additional adjustments to revenue may be required.
(e)   income taxes in the ordinary course of business there is inherent uncertainty in quantifying the company's income tax positions. the company assesses income tax positions and records tax benefits for all years subject to examination based upon management's evaluation of the facts, circumstances and information available at the reporting date. for those tax positions where it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained, the company has recorded the largest
management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies and estimates (continued)
amount of tax benefit with a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information. for those income tax positions where it is not more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained, no tax benefit has been recognized in the financial statements. the company's reserve for these matters totaled $350 million at december 31, 2015. where applicable, associated interest expense has also been recognized as a component of the provision for income taxes.
the company operates in numerous countries under many legal forms and, as a result, is subject to the jurisdiction of numerous domestic and non-u.s. tax authorities, as well as to tax agreements and treaties among these governments. determination of taxable income in any jurisdiction requires the interpretation of the related tax laws and regulations and the use of estimates and assumptions regarding significant future events, such as the amount, timing and character of deductions, permissible revenue recognition methods under the tax law and the sources and character of income and tax credits. changes in tax laws, regulations, agreements and treaties, currency exchange restrictions or the company's level of operations or profitability in each taxing jurisdiction could have an impact upon the amount of current and deferred tax balances and hence the company's net income.
the company estimates the degree to which tax assets and loss carryforwards will result in a benefit, based on expected profitability by tax jurisdiction, and provides a valuation allowance for tax assets and loss carryforwards that it believes will more likely than not go unused. if it becomes more likely than not that a tax asset or loss carryforward will be used, the company reverses the related valuation allowance. any such reversals are recorded as a reduction of the company's tax provision. the company's tax valuation allowance totaled $109 million at december 31, 2015. should the company's actual future taxable income by tax jurisdiction vary from estimates, additional allowances or reversals thereof may be necessary.
the company provides a liability for future income tax payments in the worldwide tax jurisdictions in which it operates. should tax return positions that the company expects are sustainable not be sustained upon audit, the company could be required to record an incremental tax provision for such taxes. should previously unrecognized tax benefits ultimately be sustained, a reduction in the company's tax provision would result.
(f)   contingencies and litigation the company records accruals for various contingencies, including legal proceedings, environmental, workers' compensation, product, general and auto liabilities, and other claims that arise in the normal course of business. the accruals are based on management's judgment, historical claims experience, the probability of losses and, where applicable, the consideration of opinions of internal and or external legal counsel and actuarial estimates. accruals of acquired businesses, including product liability and environmental accruals, were initially recorded at fair value and discounted to their net present value. additionally, the company records receivables from third-party insurers when recovery has been determined to be probable.
(g)   pension and other retiree benefits several of the company's u.s. and non-u.s. subsidiaries sponsor defined benefit pension and other retiree benefit plans. the cost and obligations of these arrangements are calculated using many assumptions to estimate the benefits that the employee earns while working, the amount of which cannot be completely determined until the benefit payments cease. major assumptions used in the accounting for these employee benefit plans include the discount rate, expected return on plan assets and rate of increase in employee compensation levels. assumptions are determined based on company data and appropriate market indicators in consultation with third-party actuaries, and are evaluated each year as of the plans' measurement date. net periodic pension costs for the company's pension and other postretirement benefit plans totaled $29 million in 2015. the company's unfunded benefit obligation totaled $528 million at year-end 2015 compared with $540 million at year-end 2014. should any of these assumptions change, they would have an effect on net periodic pension costs and the unfunded benefit obligation. for example, a 10% decrease in the discount rate would result in an annual increase in pension and other postretirement benefit expense of approximately $2 million and an increase in the benefit obligation of approximately $102 million.
as of december 31, 2015, the company expects to contribute between $30 and $50 million to its existing defined benefit pension plans in 2016.

sales in 2015 were $16.97 billion, an increase of $76 million from 2014. the unfavorable effects of currency translation resulted in a decrease in revenues of $938 million in 2015. sales increased $212 million due to acquisitions, principally life technologies, net of divestitures. aside from the effects of currency translation and acquisitions/divestitures, revenues increased $803 million (5%) primarily due to increased demand. sales to customers in the company's primary end markets grew. demand from customers in pharmaceutical and biotech industries was particularly strong. sales growth was moderate in north america and europe and strong in asia.
in 2015, total company operating income and operating income margin were $2.34 billion and 13.8%, respectively, compared with $2.50 billion and 14.8%, respectively, in 2014. the decrease in operating income and operating income margin was primarily due to net gains of $895 million on the sale of businesses in 2014, offset in part by $450 million of charges in 2014 associated with the february 2014 acquisition of life technologies. the unfavorable impact of foreign currency exchange also contributed to the decrease in profitability. these factors that reduced operating income in 2015 were offset in part by productivity improvements, net of inflationary cost increases and, to a lesser extent, profit on higher sales in local currencies.
in 2015, the company recorded restructuring and other costs, net, of $171 million, including $9 million of charges to cost of revenues for the sale of inventories revalued at the date of acquisition and, to a lesser extent, accelerated depreciation at facilities closing due to real estate consolidation; $46 million of charges to selling, general and administrative expenses primarily for charges associated with product liability litigation, third-party transaction and integration costs primarily related to the acquisitions of life technologies and alfa aesar, and accelerated depreciation at facilities closing due to real estate consolidation. in addition, the company recorded $82 million of cash restructuring costs primarily for actions to achieve synergies from the life technologies acquisition and for abandoned facilities costs associated with a manufacturing facility in the u.s. the company's other businesses incurred costs for continued headcount reductions and facility consolidations in an effort to streamline operations, including severance at several businesses and abandoned facility expenses at businesses that have been or are being consolidated, including the consolidation of operations within several facilities in the u.s., europe and asia. the company also recorded charges for litigation-related matters associated with acquired businesses and impairment of acquired technology in development. these costs were partially offset by gains on the sale of a small product line and real estate (see note 14).
in 2014, the company recorded restructuring and other income, net, of $140 million, including net gains on the sale of businesses and real estate of $895 million and $15 million, respectively, offset in part by $328 million of charges to cost of revenues primarily for the sale of inventories revalued at the date of acquisition; $131 million of charges to selling, general and administrative expenses primarily for transaction costs related to the acquisition of life technologies; and $29 million of charges for pension settlements. the company incurred $268 million of cash restructuring costs primarily associated with the life technologies acquisition including cash compensation to monetize certain equity awards held by life technologies employees at the date of acquisition and severance obligations to former executives and employees of life technologies. in addition, the company's other businesses incurred costs for continued headcount reductions and facility consolidations in an effort to streamline operations, including severance at several businesses and abandoned facility expenses at businesses that
management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations (continued)
have been or are being consolidated, including the consolidation of operations within several facilities in the u.s., europe and asia.
as of february 25, 2016, the company has identified restructuring actions that will result in additional charges of approximately $55 million in 2016 and expects to identify additional actions during 2016 which will be recorded when specified criteria are met, such as abandonment of leased facilities. approximately 70% of the additional charges will be incurred in the life sciences solutions segment, with the remainder incurred across the company's remaining segments. the restructuring projects for which charges were incurred in 2015 are expected to result in annual cost savings of approximately $100 million beginning in part in 2015 and, to a greater extent, in 2016, including $50 million in the life sciences solutions segment, $25 million in the analytical instruments segment, $10 million in the specialty diagnostics segment and $15 million in the laboratory products and services segment. the restructuring actions for which charges were incurred in 2014 resulted in annual cost savings of approximately $120 million beginning in part in 2014 and to a greater extent in 2015, including $80 million in the life sciences solutions segment, $10 million in the analytical instruments segment, $10 million in the specialty diagnostics segment and $20 million in the laboratory products and services segment.
segment results the company's management evaluates segment operating performance using operating income before certain charges/credits to cost of revenues and selling, general and administrative expenses, principally associated with acquisition-related activities; restructuring and other costs/income including costs arising from facility consolidations such as severance and abandoned lease expense and gains and losses from the sale of real estate and product lines; and amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets. the company also refers to this measure as adjusted operating income. the company uses this measure because it helps management understand and evaluate the segments' core operating results and facilitate comparison of performance for determining compensation (note 3). accordingly, the following segment data is reported on this basis.

management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations (continued)
income from the company's reportable segments increased 3% to $3.82 billion in 2015 due primarily to productivity improvements, net of inflationary costs increases and, to a lesser extent, profit on higher sales in local currencies, offset in part by the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange and strategic growth investments.

operating income margin              30.1   %              29.0   %      1.1 pt sales in the life sciences solutions segment increased $244 million to $4.44 billion in 2015 primarily due to the acquisition of life technologies, net of divestitures. had the acquisition of life technologies been completed at the beginning of 2013, revenues for the 2015 period would have decreased $25 million compared to pro forma 2014 revenues, including a decrease of $278 million due to the unfavorable effects of currency translation, offset in part by an increase of $213 million (5%) due to higher revenues at existing businesses and an increase of $40 million due to other acquisitions, net of dispositions. the increase in pro forma revenue at existing businesses was primarily due to increased demand for bioprocess production products as well as biosciences products.
operating income margin was 30.1% in 2015 compared to 29.0% in 2014. the increase resulted primarily from productivity improvements (including acquisition cost synergies), net of inflationary cost increases and favorable sales mix. these increases were offset in part by the unfavorable impact of foreign currency exchange and, to a lesser extent, by exclusion in 2014 of january's lower margin results for life technologies. results for january commonly have a lower margin rate than results for the balance of the quarter, due to the phasing of revenue and costs.

operating income margin was 15.0% in 2015 and 14.9% in 2014. the increase was primarily due to productivity improvements, net of inflationary cost increases as well as profit on incremental sales in local currencies offset in part by unfavorable sales mix and strategic growth investments.
other expense, net the company reported other expense, net, of $400 million and $416 million in 2015 and 2014, respectively (note 4). interest expense decreased $65 million primarily due to a reduction in outstanding debt and effective interest rates. in 2015, other items, net includes losses of $12 million on the early extinguishment of debt and costs of $7.5 million associated with entering into interest rate swap arrangements. in 2014, other items, net includes net gains of $9 million on the sale of investments.
provision for income taxes the company recorded a benefit from income taxes in 2015. in 2015, the company implemented tax planning initiatives related to non-u.s. subsidiaries. these initiatives resulted in additional foreign tax credits of $111 million, offset in part by additional u.s. income taxes of $46 million on the related foreign income (net benefit of $66 million), which reduced the company's effective rate by 3.4 percentage points. the company also implemented foreign tax credit planning in sweden which resulted in $80 million of foreign tax credits, with no related incremental u.s. income tax expense. in addition, the company recorded tax benefits totaling $54 million, or 2.8 percentage points, related to additional prior year foreign tax and other credits as well as restructuring and other costs associated with the 2014 acquisition of life technologies. the tax provision in the 2015 period was favorably affected by $37 million, or 1.9 percentage points, as a result of adjustments to deferred tax balances due to changes in tax rates. the effective tax rate in both 2015 and 2014 was also affected by relatively significant earnings in lower tax jurisdictions. due primarily to the non-deductibility of intangible asset amortization for tax purposes, the company's cash payments for income taxes were higher than its income tax expense for financial reporting purposes and totaled $477 million and $586 million in 2015 and 2014, respectively.
the company's effective tax rate was 9.2% in 2014. the 2014 provision for income taxes included $390 million related to gains on the sales of businesses. aside from the discrete tax on the gains, the company had a benefit from income taxes primarily due to restructuring and other costs associated with the acquisition of life technologies as well as an increase in the expected benefit from foreign tax credits. in 2014, non-u.s. subsidiaries of the company made cash and deemed distributions to the company's u.s. operations which resulted in no net tax cost. as a result of these distributions, the company generated u.s. foreign tax credits of $172 million, offset in part by additional u.s. income taxes of $55 million on the related foreign income. the net result of these transactions favorably affected the income tax provision by $117 million and reduced the company's effective tax rate by 5.6 percentage points in 2014. the federal tax credit for 2014 research and development activities favorably affected the tax provision in 2014 by $20 million, or 1.0 percentage point. in 2014, the company recognized a discrete tax benefit of $15 million, or 0.7 percentage points, attributable to tax rulings related to non-u.s. subsidiaries. the tax provision in the 2014 period was favorably affected by $5.5 million, or 0.3 percentage points, as a result of adjustments to deferred tax balances due to changes in tax rates.
management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations (continued)
the company expects its effective tax rate in 2016 will be less than 3% based on currently forecasted rates of profitability in the countries in which the company conducts business and expected generation of foreign tax credits.
the company has operations and a taxable presence in approximately 50 countries outside the u.s. all of these countries except one have a lower tax rate than the u.s. the countries in which the company has a material presence that have significantly lower tax rates than the u.s. include germany, the netherlands, singapore, sweden, switzerland and the united kingdom. the company's ability to obtain a benefit from lower tax rates outside the u.s. is dependent on its relative levels of income in countries outside the u.s. and on the statutory tax rates in those countries. based on the dispersion of the company's non-u.s. income tax provision among many countries, the company believes that a change in the statutory tax rate in any individual country is not likely to materially affect the company's income tax provision or net income, aside from any resulting one-time adjustment to the company's deferred tax balances to reflect a new rate.

sales in 2014 were $16.89 billion, an increase of $3.80 billion from 2013. sales increased $3.31 billion due to acquisitions, net of divestitures. the unfavorable effects of currency translation resulted in a decrease in revenues of $60 million in 2014. aside from the effects of currency translation and acquisitions/divestitures, revenues increased $549 million (4%) primarily due to increased demand. demand from biopharma customers remained strong. sales to customers in healthcare and industrial markets grew moderately while sales to academic and government markets grew modestly in 2014. sales growth was strong in europe and moderate in north america and asia.
in 2014, total company operating income and operating income margin were $2.50 billion and 14.8%, respectively, compared with $1.61 billion and 12.3%, respectively, in 2013. the increase in operating income and operating income margin was primarily due to net gains of $895 million on the sale of businesses, inclusion of life technologies' results from the date of acquisition and, to a lesser extent, productivity improvements, net of inflationary cost increases. these increases were offset in part by $450 million of charges associated with the acquisition, as discussed below, as well as $569 million of higher amortization expenses, also primarily related to the acquisition.
in 2014, the company recorded restructuring and other income, net, of $140 million, including net gains on the sale of businesses and real estate of $895 million and $15 million, respectively, offset in part by $328 million of charges to cost of revenues primarily for the sale of inventories revalued at the date of acquisition; $131 million of charges to selling, general and administrative expenses primarily for transaction costs related to the acquisition of life technologies; and $29 million of charges for pension settlements. the company incurred $268 million of cash restructuring costs primarily associated with the

life technologies acquisition including cash compensation to monetize certain equity awards held by life technologies employees at the date of acquisition and severance obligations to former executives and employees of life technologies. in addition, the company's other businesses incurred costs for continued headcount reductions and facility consolidations in an effort to streamline operations, including severance at several businesses and abandoned facility expenses at businesses that have been or are being consolidated, including the consolidation of operations within several facilities in the u.s., europe and asia (see note 14).
in 2013, the company recorded restructuring and other costs, net, of $180 million, including $29 million of charges to cost of revenues primarily related to the sale of inventories revalued at the date of acquisition and, to a lesser extent, accelerated depreciation on manufacturing assets to be abandoned due to facility consolidations and $74 million of charges to selling, general and administrative expenses primarily consisting of transaction costs related to the acquisition of life technologies, changes in estimates of contingent consideration for an acquisition and a charge associated with product liability litigation. the company incurred $78 million of cash restructuring costs primarily for continued headcount reductions and facility consolidations in an effort to streamline operations, including severance at several businesses and abandoned facility expenses at businesses that were being consolidated. the cash costs also included $4 million of transaction expenses related to the agreement to sell its sera and media, gene modulation and magnetic beads businesses (see note 2).
the restructuring actions for which charges were incurred in 2013 resulted in annual cost savings of approximately $80 million beginning in part in 2013 and to a greater extent in 2014, including $5 million in the life sciences solutions segment, $30 million in the analytical instruments segment, $20 million in the specialty diagnostics segment and $25 million in the laboratory products and services segment.

operating income margin was 14.9% in 2014 and 15.0% in 2013. the decrease resulted primarily from strategic growth investments offset in part by productivity improvements, net of inflationary cost increases.
other expense, net the company reported other expense, net, of $416 million and $290 million in 2014 and 2013, respectively (note 4). interest expense increased $218 million primarily due to the debt issued and assumed in connection with the acquisition of life technologies. in 2014, the company realized net gains of $9 million from equity and available-for-sale investments. in 2013, the company recorded $74 million of charges related to amortization of fees paid to obtain bridge financing commitments related to the acquisition of life technologies. also in 2013, the company irrevocably contributed appreciated available-for-sale investments that had a fair value of $27 million to two of its u.k. defined benefit plans, resulting in realization of a previously unrecognized gain of $11 million.
provision for income taxes the company's effective tax rates were 9.2% and 3.1% in 2014 and 2013, respectively. the 2014 provision for income taxes includes $390 million related to gains on the sales of businesses. aside from the discrete tax on the gains, the company had a benefit from income taxes primarily due to restructuring and other costs associated with the acquisition of life technologies as well as an increase in the expected benefit from foreign tax credits. in 2014, non-u.s. subsidiaries of the company made cash and deemed distributions to the company's u.s. operations which resulted in no net tax cost. as a result of these distributions, the company generated u.s. foreign tax credits of $172 million, offset in part by additional u.s. income taxes of $55 million on the related foreign income. the net result of these transactions favorably affected the income tax provision by $117 million and reduced the company's effective tax rate by 5.6 percentage points in 2014. the federal tax credit for 2014 research and development activities favorably affected the tax provision in 2014 by $20 million, or 1.0 percentage point. in 2014, the company recognized a discrete tax benefit of $15 million, or 0.7 percentage points, attributable to tax rulings related to non-u.s. subsidiaries. due primarily to the non-deductibility of intangible asset amortization, the company's cash payments (net of refunds) for income taxes were higher than its income tax expense for financial reporting purposes and totaled $586 million and $230 million in 2014 and 2013, respectively. the effective tax rate in both periods was also affected by relatively significant earnings in lower tax jurisdictions. the tax provision in the 2014 period was favorably affected by $5.5 million, or 0.3 percentage points, as a result of adjustments to deferred tax balances due to changes in tax rates.
in 2013, non-u.s. subsidiaries of the company made cash and deemed distributions to the company's u.s. operations which resulted in no net tax cost. as a result of these distributions, the company generated u.s. foreign tax credits of $160 million offset by additional u.s. income taxes of $56 million on the related foreign income. the net result of these transactions favorably affected the income tax provision by $104 million and reduced the company's effective tax rate by 7.9 percentage points in 2013. in addition, the effective tax rate in 2013 was also reduced by the u.s. congress' renewal in january 2013 of a tax credit for research and development activities for 2012 and 2013 and, to a lesser extent, financing costs associated with the acquisition of life technologies that are deductible in the u.s. the federal tax credit for 2012 and 2013 research and development activities favorably affected the tax provision in 2013 by $15 million, or 1.2 percentage points. the tax provision in the 2013 period was unfavorably affected by $5 million, or 0.4 percentage points, as a result of adjustments to deferred tax balances due to changes in tax rates and audit settlements.
management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources consolidated working capital was $1.59 billion at december 31, 2015, compared with $1.19 billion at december 31, 2014. included in working capital were cash and cash equivalents of $452 million at december 31, 2015 and $1.34 billion at december 31, 2014. the increase in working capital is primarily due to a decrease in current debt offset in part by lower cash balances.
cash provided by operating activities was $2.82 billion during 2015. increases in accounts receivable and inventories used cash of $149 million and $141 million, respectively, primarily to support growth in sales in local currencies. an increase in other assets used cash of $254 million primarily related to the timing of tax payments/refunds. an increase in other liabilities provided cash of $148 million primarily due to the timing of payments for income taxes and incentive compensation. cash payments for income taxes decreased to $477 million during 2015, compared with $586 million in 2014 that included taxes associated with gains on divestitures. the company made cash contributions to its pension and postretirement benefit plans totaling $38 million during 2015. payments for restructuring actions, principally severance costs and lease and other expenses of real estate consolidation, used cash of $97 million during 2015.
during 2015, the company's investing activities used $1.09 billion of cash. acquisitions used cash of $695 million. the company's investing activities also included the purchase of $423 million of property, plant and equipment. in january 2016, the company announced an agreement to acquire affymetrix for approximately $1.3 billion in cash. the transaction, which is expected to be completed by the end of the second quarter of 2016, is subject to the approval of affymetrix shareholders and the satisfaction of customary closing conditions, including applicable regulatory approvals. the company expects to issue debt in advance of closing the acquisition of affymetrix to partially fund the acquisition.
the company's financing activities used $2.49 billion of cash during 2015. repayments of long-term debt totaled $3.78 billion. issuance of senior notes provided cash of $1.80 billion and an increase in commercial paper obligations provided cash of $50 million. the company's financing activities also included the repurchase of $500 million of the company's common stock and the payment of $241 million in cash dividends, offset in part by $124 million of proceeds from employee stock option exercises. on november 12, 2015, the board of directors replaced the existing repurchase authorization with a new authorization to repurchase up to $1.00 billion of the company's common stock. at december 31, 2015, $1.00 billion was available for future repurchases of the company's common stock under this authorization. in the first quarter of 2016 through february 25, 2016, the company repurchased $500 million of its common stock under this authorization.
as of december 31, 2015, the company's short-term debt totaled $1.05 billion, including $1.00 billion of senior notes, due in the next twelve months and $50 million of commercial paper obligations. the company has a revolving credit facility with a bank group that provides up to $2.00 billion of unsecured multi-currency revolving credit. if the company borrows under this facility, it intends to leave undrawn an amount equivalent to outstanding commercial paper to provide a source of funds in the event that commercial paper markets are not available. as of december 31, 2015, no borrowings were outstanding under the company's revolving credit facility, although available capacity was reduced by approximately $65 million as a result of outstanding letters of credit.
approximately half of the company's cash balances and cash flows from operations are from outside the u.s. the company uses its non-u.s. cash for needs outside of the u.s. including acquisitions and repayment of acquisition-related intercompany debt to the u.s. in addition, the company also transfers cash to the u.s. using non-taxable returns of capital as well as dividends where the related u.s. foreign tax credit equals or exceeds any tax cost arising from the dividends. as a result of using such means of transferring cash to the u.s., the company does not expect any material adverse liquidity effects from its significant non-u.s. cash balances for the foreseeable future.
the company believes that its existing cash and cash equivalents of $452 million as of december 31, 2015 and its future cash flow from operations together with available borrowing capacity under its revolving credit agreement will be sufficient to meet the cash requirements of its existing businesses for the foreseeable future, including at least the next 24 months.

reserves for unrecognized tax benefits of $350 million have not been included in the above table due to the inability to predict the timing of tax audit resolutions.
the company has no material commitments for purchases of property, plant and equipment, other than those included in the above table, but expects that for 2016, such expenditures will approximate $415 to $430 million.
guarantees of residual value under lease arrangements for two facilities have not been included in the above table due to the inability to predict if and when the guarantees may require payment (see note 10). the residual value guarantees become operative at the end of the leases for up to a maximum of $111 million. the initial terms of these leases end in 2019 and 2020, although renewal options exist for each.
a guarantee of pension plan obligations of a divested business has not been included in the preceding table due to the inability to predict if and when the guarantee may require payment. the purchaser of the divested business has agreed to pay for the pension benefits, however the company was required to guarantee payment of these pension benefits should the purchaser fail to do so. the amount of the guarantee at december 31, 2015 was $41 million.

management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources (continued)
unknown conditions. however, the company has no reason to believe that these uncertainties would have a material adverse effect on its financial position, annual results of operations or cash flows.
the company has recorded liabilities for known indemnifications included as part of environmental liabilities. see item 1. business - environmental matters for a discussion of these liabilities.

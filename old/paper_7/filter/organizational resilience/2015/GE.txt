management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (md&a)
presentation the consolidated financial statements of general electric company (the company) combine the industrial manufacturing and services businesses of general electric company (ge) with the financial services businesses of general electric capital corporation, and its successor ge capital global holdings, llc (ge capital or financial services).
we believe that investors will gain a better understanding of our company if they understand how we measure and talk about our results. because of the diversity in our businesses, we present our financial statements in a three-column format, which allows investors to see our industrial operations separately from our financial services operations. we believe that this provides useful information to investors. when used in this report, unless otherwise indicated by the context, we use the terms to mean the following:
   ge - the adding together of all affiliates other than ge capital, whose continuing operations are presented on a one-line basis, giving effect to the elimination of transactions among such affiliates. transactions between ge and ge capital have not been eliminated at the ge level. we present the results of ge in the center column of our consolidated statements of earnings, financial position and cash flows. an example of a ge metric is ge cash from operating activities (ge cfoa).
   general electric capital corporation or gecc - the adding together of all affiliates of gecc, giving effect to the elimination of transactions among such affiliates.
   ge capital global holdings, llc or gecgh - the adding together of all affiliates of gecgh, giving effect to the elimination of transactions among such affiliates.
   ge capital or financial services - refers to gecc, or its successor gecgh, and is the adding together of all affiliates of ge capital giving effect to the elimination of transactions among such affiliates. we present the results of ge capital in the right-side column of our consolidated statements of earnings, financial position and cash flows.
   ge consolidated - the adding together of ge and ge capital, giving effect to the elimination of transactions between the two. we present the results of ge consolidated in the left-side column of our consolidated statements of earnings, financial position and cash flows.
   industrial - ge excluding the continuing operations of ge capital. we believe that this provides investors with a view as to the results of our industrial businesses and corporate items. an example of an industrial metric is industrial cfoa, which is ge cfoa excluding the effects of dividends from ge capital.
   industrial segment - the sum of our eight industrial reporting segments, without giving effect to the elimination of transactions among such segments. this provides investors with a view as to the results of our industrial segments, without inter-segment eliminations and corporate items. an example of an industrial segment metric is industrial segment revenue growth.
   total segment - the sum of our eight industrial segments and one financial services segment, without giving effect to the elimination of transactions among such segments. this provides investors with a view as to the results of all of our segments, without inter-segment eliminations and corporate items.
   ge capital verticals or verticals - the adding together of ge capital businesses that we expect to retain, principally its vertical financing businesses-ge capital aviation services (gecas), energy financial services (efs) and healthcare equipment finance-that relate to the company's core industrial domain and other operations, including working capital solutions, our run-off insurance activities, and allocated corporate costs.
prior to january 28, 2011, we operated a media company, nbc universal, inc. (nbcu). effective january 28, 2011, we held a 49% interest in a media entity that included the nbc universal businesses (nbcu llc). on march 19, 2013, we completed the sale of our remaining 49% common equity interest to comcast corporation.
we integrate acquisitions as quickly as possible. revenues and earnings from the date we complete the acquisition through the end of the fourth quarter following the acquisition are considered the acquisition effect of such businesses.
discussion of ge capital's total assets includes deferred income tax liabilities, which are presented within assets for purposes of our consolidated statement of financial position presentations for this filing.
amounts reported in billions in graphs within this report are computed based on the amounts in millions.  as a result, the sum of the components reported in billions may not equal the total amount reported in billions due to rounding.  certain columns and rows within the tables may not add due to the use of rounded numbers. percentages presented are calculated from the underlying numbers in millions.
the md&a should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes to the consolidated financial statements.
   backlog - unfilled customer orders for products and product services (expected life of contract sales for product services).
   borrowings as a percentage of total capital invested - for ge, the sum of borrowings and mandatorily redeemable preferred stock, divided by the sum of borrowings, mandatorily redeemable preferred stock, redeemable noncontrolling interest, noncontrolling interests and total shareowners' equity.
   digital revenues - revenues related to software-enabled product upgrades, internally developed software (including predix) and associated hardware, and software-enabled productivity solutions. these revenues are largely generated from our operating businesses and are included in their segment results.
   earnings per share (eps) - unless otherwise indicated, when we refer to earnings per share, it is the diluted per-share amount of "earnings from continuing operations attributable to common shareowners".

reorganization and exchange offers during december 2015, general electric capital corporation merged into ge. the merger and creation of a new intermediate holding company was part of a reorganization of ge capital's businesses (the reorganization) pursuant to which ge separated ge capital's international and u.s. operations. ge capital's international operations have been consolidated under a new international holding company (ge capital international holdings limited), which has a separate capital structure and is supervised by the u.k. prudential regulation authority. the reorganization, debt exchange offers (as described below) and establishment of ge capital international holdings limited were intended, among other things, to establish an efficient and simplified capital structure that is satisfactory to ge capital's regulators, a key step in terminating the nonbank sifi designation for ge capital. in addition, the debt exchange offers were designed to align the liabilities of ge capital international holdings limited to its assets from a maturity profile and liquidity standpoint, taking into consideration asset sales, and where appropriate, shortening the maturity profile of targeted liabilities.
as part of the ge capital exit plan, on september 21, 2015, ge capital commenced private offers to exchange (the exchange offers) up to $30 billion of certain outstanding debt for new notes with maturities of six months, five years, ten years or twenty years. on october 19, 2015, given the high level of participation, the offering was increased by $6 billion with the aggregate principal amount of $36 billion (representing $31 billion of outstanding principal and $5 billion of premium) of outstanding notes being tendered for exchange and settled on october 26, 2015. the new notes that were issued at closing are composed of $15.3 billion of 0.964% six month notes due april 2016, £0.8 billion of 1.363% six month notes due april 2016, $6.1 billion of 2.342% notes due 2020, $2.0 billion of 3.373% notes due 2025 and $11.5 billion of 4.418% notes due 2035. of the $16.2 billion exchanged into the six month notes, $1.3 billion had been previously classified in short term borrowings. ge capital will continue to evaluate the opportunity to repurchase debt while maintaining our liquidity at the levels communicated as part of the ge capital exit plan. the new notes have been fully, irrevocably and unconditionally guaranteed by ge.
immediately prior to the reorganization, ge capital had $5.0 billion in aggregate liquidation preference of series a, b and c preferred stock outstanding. in connection with the reorganization, on december 3, 2015, holders who previously held ge capital preferred stock were issued an aggregate liquidation preference of $5.9 billion of new ge series a, b and c preferred stock. the series a, b and c preferred stock bear an initial fixed interest rate of 4.00%, 4.10% and 4.20%, respectively, through their initial call date and are callable on june 15, 2022, december 15, 2022 and june 15, 2023, respectively. subsequent to the call date, the series a, b and c preferred stock will bear a floating interest rate equal to three-month libor plus 2.28%, 2.32% and 2.37%, respectively, thereafter.
subsequent to the issuance of the preferred stock on december 3, 2015, in response to investor feedback, ge launched an exchange offer on december 18, 2015 that allowed ge preferred stock investors to exchange their existing series a, b and c preferred stock into a series d ge preferred stock. these series d instruments bear an initial fixed interest rate of 5.00% through january 21, 2021, will bear a floating rate equal to three-month libor plus 3.33% thereafter and are callable on january 21, 2021. on january 20, 2016, $2.7 billion of series a, $2.0 billion of series b and $1.0 billion of series c were exchanged into $5.7 billion series d ge preferred stock. following the exchange, $0.1 billion of series a, $0.1 billion of series b and $0.1 billion of series c remain outstanding.
guarantee as part of the ge capital exit plan, on april 10, 2015, ge and ge capital entered into an amendment to their existing financial support agreement. under this amendment (the amendment), the company has provided a full and unconditional guarantee (the guarantee) of the payment of principal and interest on all tradable senior and subordinated outstanding long-term debt securities and all commercial paper issued or guaranteed by ge capital identified in the amendment. in the aggregate, the guarantee applied to approximately $85.8 billion of ge capital debt as of december 31, 2015. the guarantee replaced the requirement that the company make certain income maintenance payments to ge capital in certain circumstances. ge capital's u.s. public indentures were concurrently amended to provide the full and unconditional guarantee by the company set forth in the guarantee.
synchrony financial exchange offer on august 5, 2014, we completed the initial public offering (ipo) of our north american retail finance business, synchrony financial, as a first step in a planned, staged exit from that business. we received net proceeds from the ipo and underwriter's option of $2.8 billion and retained 84.6% of synchrony financial.
on october 19, 2015, ge commenced an offer to exchange ge common stock for common stock of ge capital's approximately 84.6% owned subsidiary, synchrony financial. on november 17, 2015, we completed the split-off of synchrony financial, through which the company accepted 671,366,809 shares of ge common stock from its shareholders in exchange for 705,270,833 shares of synchrony financial common stock that it owned and recorded an after-tax gain of $3.4 billion within discontinued operations. in connection with the public offering and sale of synchrony financial, ge capital indemnified synchrony financial and its directors, officers, and employees against the liabilities of gecc's businesses other than historical liabilities of the businesses that are part of synchrony financial's ongoing operations. with the completion of the split-off and the federal reserve board's (frb) subsequent approval of ge capital's application to deregister as a savings and loan holding company, ge capital is no longer a savings and loan holding company.
segment operations segment changes
   the power segment (formerly power &amp; water) was affected through the splitting out of the renewable energy business, principally the onshore wind business.
   a new segment named renewable energy was created that includes ge's legacy onshore wind business and the wind and hydro businesses acquired from alstom.
   energy management was affected through the formation of a joint venture with alstom.
   additionally, a portion of the distributed power business that provides turbines for oil &amp; gas applications was realigned from the power segment to the oil &amp; gas segment.
   transportation sold its signaling business to alstom.
   the remaining segments, healthcare, aviation, and appliances &amp; lighting were not affected by any significant segment changes in 2015.
   the financial services segment, previously referred to as ge capital, is now called capital. ge capital now refers to gecc or its successor, gecgh.
revenues and profit segment revenues include revenues and other income related to the segment.
segment profit is determined based on internal performance measures used by the chief executive officer (ceo) to assess the performance of each business in a given period. in connection with that assessment, the ceo may exclude matters such as charges for restructuring; rationalization and other similar expenses; acquisition costs and other related charges; technology and product development costs; certain gains and losses from acquisitions or dispositions; and litigation settlements or other charges, for which responsibility preceded the current management team.
segment profit excludes results reported as discontinued operations and material accounting changes. segment profit also excludes the portion of earnings or loss attributable to noncontrolling interests of consolidated subsidiaries, and as such only includes the portion of earnings or loss attributable to our share of the consolidated earnings or loss of consolidated subsidiaries.
segment profit excludes or includes interest and other financial charges and income taxes according to how a particular segment's management is measured:
   interest and other financial charges, income taxes and ge preferred stock dividends are excluded in determining segment profit (which we sometimes refer to as "operating profit") for the industrial segments.
   interest and other financial charges, income taxes and ge capital preferred stock dividends are included in determining segment profit (which we sometimes refer to as "net earnings") for the capital segment.
certain corporate costs, such as shared services, employee benefits and information technology are allocated to our segments based on usage. a portion of the remaining corporate costs is allocated based on each segment's relative net cost of operations.
alstom - acquisition impacting multiple segments on november 2, 2015, we completed the acquisition of alstom's thermal, renewables and grid businesses. the completion of the transaction followed the regulatory approval of the deal in over 20 countries and regions including the eu, u.s., china, india, japan and brazil. the purchase price was €9.2 billion (approximately $10.1 billion). the acquisition and alliances with alstom affected our power, renewable energy and energy management segments. see note 8 to the consolidated financial statements for further information.
for the two months that ge owned alstom in 2015, the entity contributed $(0.2) billion of operating profit to the industrial segments and $(0.2) billion of operating profit at corporate, resulting in an overall pre-tax loss of $(0.4) billion. offsetting the pre-tax loss was $0.4 billion of increased tax benefits principally related to the integration of our existing services business with alstom's services business.

products &amp; services capital's continuing financial services businesses and products are geared to utilize ge's industry-specific expertise in aviation, energy, infrastructure and healthcare to capitalize on market-specific opportunities and are further described below. in addition, we continue to operate our run-off insurance activities as part of our continuing operations. collectively, we refer to these businesses as verticals. products and services include:
   commercial lending and leasing (cll) - offers capital and services to industrials served by ge, including the healthcare industry through its healthcare equipment finance business. the cll business also provides factoring solutions through its working capital solutions business to the ge industrial businesses by purchasing ge customer receivables. beginning in 2016, this business will be referred to as industrial finance.
   energy financial services (efs) - invests in long-lived, capital intensive energy projects and companies by providing structured equity, debt, leasing, partnership financing, project finance and broad-based commercial finance.
   ge capital aviation services (gecas) - offers commercial aircraft financing and leasing for a wide range of aircraft types and financing options.
as a result of the ge capital exit plan, capital's real estate business, consumer business and most of its cll business are classified as discontinued operations and are no longer reported as part of the capital segment. all comparative prior period information has been reclassified to reflect real estate, consumer and most of cll as discontinued operations.
the businesses in which we engage are subject to competition from various types of financial institutions, including commercial banks, investment banks, leasing companies, independent finance companies, finance companies associated with manufacturers and insurance and reinsurance companies.
ge capital is a nonbank systemically important financial institution (nonbank sifi) under the dodd-frank wall street reform and consumer protection act (dfa). as a result, ge capital is subject to frb supervision as described in regulations and supervision. ge has discussed the ge capital exit plan with its regulators and staff of the financial stability oversight council (fsoc) and plans to file its application with the fsoc in early 2016 to terminate the fsoc's designation of ge capital as a nonbank sifi. with the completion of the synchrony financial split-off, and the frb's subsequent approval of ge capital's application to deregister as a saving and loan holding company, ge capital is no longer a savings and loan holding company. in addition, in connection with the december 2015 reorganization described in the ge capital exit plan section of the md&a, ge capital's international operations were consolidated under a new international holding company, ge capital international holdings limited. ge capital international holdings limited is a wholly-owned subsidiary of ge capital with its own capital structure and is supervised by the u.k. prudential regulation authority (pra). the pra's supervision includes capital and liquidity standards that could impact the payment of dividends to ge capital, and ge capital international holdings limited will remain subject to such supervision even if ge capital's designation as a nonbank sifi is terminated.

   the ge capital exit plan - on april 10, 2015, the company announced its plan to reduce the size of the financial services businesses through the sale of most of its assets over the following 24 months. it is expected that as a result of the ge capital exit plan, the capital businesses that will remain with ge will account for about $90 billion in ending net investment (eni), excluding liquidity, including about $40 billion in the u.s. eni is a metric used to measure the total capital invested in the financial services businesses. capital's eni, excluding liquidity* was $82 billion at december 31, 2015. further information on the ge capital exit plan is provided in the consolidated results section of the md&amp;a and note 1 to the consolidated financial statements.
   the ge capital exit plan - as the ge capital exit plan progresses, we will continue to incur interest on non-verticals borrowings, restructuring costs and ge and ge capital headquarters costs that are in excess of those allocated to the verticals. these costs are recorded within other continuing operations within capital.
   milestone aviation group - on january 30, 2015, we acquired milestone aviation group, a helicopter leasing business, for approximately $1.8 billion.
   dividends - ge capital paid $4.3 billion, $3.0 billion and $6.0 billion of dividends to ge in the years ended december 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.

   higher treasury operation expenses of $1.0 billion reflecting excess interest expense, including costs associated with the debt exchange completed in october 2015 and derivative activities that reduce or eliminate interest rate, currency or market risk between financial assets and liabilities. we expect to continue to have excess interest costs in 2016 as asset sales outpace our debt maturities. we may engage in liability management actions, such as buying back debt, based on market and economic conditions.
   the 2015 $0.8 billion impairment of a coal-fired power plant in the u.s. related to a decision in the fourth quarter to exit the investment over time.

other capital net earnings increased by $0.6 billion primarily as a result of higher tax benefits of $0.6 billion and higher treasury operation income of $0.3 billion, partially offset by higher corporate headquarters expenses of $0.2 billion.
ge corporate items and eliminations ge corporate items and eliminations is a caption used in the segment operation - summary of operating segment table to reconcile the aggregated results of our segments to the consolidated results of the company. as such, it includes corporate activities and the elimination of inter-segment activities. specifically, the ge corporate items and eliminations amounts related to revenues and earnings include the results of disposed businesses (such as nbcu llc, which we sold in 2013), certain amounts not included in ge industrial operating segment results because they are excluded from measurement of their operating performance for internal and external purposes and the elimination of inter-segment activities. in addition, the ge corporate items and eliminations amounts related to earnings include certain costs of our principal retirement plans, restructuring and other costs reported in corporate, and the unallocated portion of certain corporate costs (such as research and development spending and costs related to our global growth organization).

2015 - 2014 commentary revenues and other income increased $1.7 billion, primarily a result of:
   $1.0 billion of higher gains from disposed businesses, which included $0.2 billion of a break-up fee paid by electrolux ab due to the termination of the agreement to acquire the ge appliances business,
   $0.2 billion of lower eliminations and other, which was driven by $0.4 billion of lower inter-segment eliminations, partially offset by $0.2 billion lower licensing, asset management and other income.
operating costs decreased $1.1 billion, primarily as a result of:
   $1.0 billion of higher gains from disposed businesses, which included $0.2 billion of a break-up fee paid by electrolux ab due to termination of the agreement to acquire the ge appliances business,
   lower headquarter functional costs offset by higher investment in information technology (it) growth initiatives.
these decreases to operating costs were partially offset by $0.4 billion higher costs associated with our principal retirement plans including the effects of lower discount rates and updated mortality assumptions.
2014 - 2013 commentary revenues and other income decreased $2.5 billion, primarily a result of:
   $1.5 billion lower revenues and other income related to nbcu llc, which was disposed of in the first quarter of 2013,
   $0.4 billion of lower gains from disposed businesses, and
   $0.6 billion of higher eliminations and other, which was driven by $0.4 billion of higher inter-segment eliminations. also contributing to the decrease in revenues and other income was a $0.2 billion impairment related to an investment security in 2014 compared with a $0.1 billion impairment of an investment in a brazilian company in 2013.
operating costs increased $0.2 billion, primarily as a result of:
   $0.4 billion of lower gains from disposed businesses.
these increases to operating costs were partially offset by the following:
   $0.9 billion of lower costs of our principal retirement plans,
   $0.2 billion of lower restructuring and other charges. restructuring and other charges in 2014 included $0.2 billion of impairment related to an investment security at power, $0.1 billion of asset write-offs at a consolidated nuclear joint venture in which we hold a 51% interest at power and $0.1 billion curtailment loss on the principal retirement plans resulting from our plan to sell the appliances business, and
   $0.5 billion of lower eliminations and other, which was driven by $0.4 billion of lower corporate costs, which include research and development and functional spending in 2014. in 2013, eliminations and other costs included $0.1 billion impairment of an investment in a brazilian company.
costs and gains not included in segment results as discussed in the segment operations section within the md&a, certain amounts are not included in industrial operating segment results because they are excluded from measurement of their operating performance for internal and external purposes. these amounts are included in ge corporate items & eliminations and may include matters such as charges for restructuring; rationalization and other similar expenses; acquisition costs and related charges; technology and product development cost; certain gains and losses from acquisitions or dispositions; and litigation settlements or other charges, for which responsibility preceded the current management team. the amount of costs and gains not included in segment results follows.

discontinued operations discontinued operations primarily relate to our financial services businesses as a result of the ge capital exit plan and include our consumer business, most of our cll business, our real estate business, and our u.s. mortgage business (wmc). all of these operations were previously reported in the capital segment.
we have entered into transitional service agreements (tsa) with and provided certain indemnifications to buyers of ge capital's assets. under the tsas, ge capital provides various services for terms generally between 12 and 24 months and receives a level of cost reimbursement from the buyers.
indemnifications amount to $1.5 billion, for which we have recognized related liabilities of $0.1 billion at december 31, 2015. in addition, we provided $0.7 billion of credit support, the vast majority on behalf of certain cll customers aligned with signed disposal transactions scheduled to close in 2016, and recognized an insignificant liability at december 31, 2015.
as part of the ge capital exit plan, we entered into hedges (on an after-tax basis) of our net investment in businesses that we plan to dispose. these derivatives are treated as standalone hedges and the mark to market valuation changes on the derivatives are recorded in earnings of discontinued operations.
results of operations, financial position and cash flows for these businesses are separately reported as discontinued operations for all periods presented.

the 2015 loss from discontinued operations, net of taxes, primarily reflected the following:
   $7.9 billion after-tax loss at our cll business (including a $8.7 billion after-tax loss on disposals),
   $2.0 billion after-tax loss at our real estate business primarily loss on disposals, and
   $0.1 billion after-tax effect of incremental reserves related to retained representation and warranty obligations to repurchase previously sold loans on the 2007 sale of wmc.
   2015 losses were partially offset by $2.5 billion after-tax earnings at our consumer business, primarily $3.4 billion after-tax gain on the split-off of synchrony financial, $0.5 billion after-tax gain on other transactions closed, partially offset by $0.8 billion after-tax loss on disposals and $0.6 billion after-tax loss from operations.
the 2014 earnings from discontinued operations, net of taxes, primarily reflected the following:
   $3.2 billion of after-tax earnings from operations at our consumer business,
   $1.8 billion of after-tax earnings from operations at our cll business,
   $1.0 billion of after-tax earnings from operations at our real estate business, and
   $0.1 billion tax benefit related to the extinguishment of our loss-sharing arrangement for excess interest claims associated with the 2008 sale of ge money japan.
   2014 earnings were partially offset by a $0.2 billion after-tax loss on incremental reserves related to retained representation and warranty obligations to repurchase previously sold loans on the 2007 sale of wmc.
the 2013 earnings from discontinued operations, net of taxes, primarily reflected the following:
   $4.3 billion of after-tax earnings from operations at our consumer business,
   $1.7 billion of after-tax earnings from operations at our real estate business, and
   $1.5 billion of after-tax earnings from operations at our cll business.
   2013 earnings were partially offset by $1.6 billion after-tax effect of incremental reserves, primarily related to an agreement to extinguish our loss-sharing arrangement for excess interest claims associated with the 2008 sale of ge money japan,
   $0.2 billion after-tax effect of incremental reserves related to retained representation and warranty obligations to repurchase previously sold loans on the 2007 sale of wmc, and
   $0.2 billion after-tax loss on the disposal of consumer russia.
for additional information related to discontinued operations, see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements.
other consolidated information interest and other financial charges interest on borrowings and other financial charges amounted to $3.5 billion, $2.7 billion and $2.9 billion in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. substantially all of our borrowings are in financial services, where interest expense was $2.3 billion (including $0.1 billion in debt extinguishment cost), $1.6 billion and $2.0 billion in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. ge capital average borrowings declined from 2014 to 2015 and from 2013 to 2014. interest rates have been flat over the three-year period primarily attributable to a mix shift in funding sources, in addition to declining global benchmark interest rates. ge capital average borrowings were $217.5 billion, $267.6 billion and $297.3 billion in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. the ge capital average composite effective interest rate (including interest allocated to discontinued operations) was 2.6% in 2015, 2.6% in 2014 and 2.6% in 2013. in 2015, ge capital average assets continue to decrease in line with the ge capital exit plan. see the liquidity and borrowings section within the md&a for a discussion of liquidity, borrowings and interest rate risk management.
it is our policy to allocate capital interest expense that is either directly attributable or related to discontinued operations. the allocation is based on a market based leverage ratio, taking into consideration the underlying characteristics of the assets for the specific discontinued operations. interest expense that is associated with debt that is not assumed by the buyer or required to be repaid as a result of the disposal transaction is reflected in continuing operations after the disposal occurs.
postretirement benefit plans
benefit plans cost   discount rates (december 31)             expected rate of return
   postretirement benefit plans cost increased in 2015, primarily because of the effects of lower discount rates and new mortality assumptions, which were partially offset by lower loss amortization related to our principal pension plans and by changes to principal retiree benefit plans.
   in 2015, we amended our principal retiree benefit plans affecting post-65 retiree health and retiree life insurance for certain production participants. these plan amendments reduced our principal postretirement benefit obligations by approximately $3.3 billion.
   postretirement benefit plans cost decreased due to higher discount rates and lower loss amortization related to our principal pension plans, partially offset by a lower expected investment return on pension plan assets.
   we updated our mortality assumptions at december 31, 2014 based on tables issued by the society of actuaries to reflect longer life expectancies. the new mortality assumptions increased our principal postretirement benefit obligations by $4.6 billion at year-end 2014.
looking forward, our key assumptions affecting 2016 postretirement benefits costs are as follows:
   assumed long-term return on our principal pension plan assets of 7.5%.
we expect postretirement benefit plans cost to decrease by approximately $1.0 billion in 2016.
non-gaap operating pension cost*         1.7       1.5       1.8
our operating pension cost for our principal pension plans includes only those components that relate to benefits earned by active employees during the period (service cost, prior service cost amortization and curtailment loss). non-operating pension cost elements such as interest cost, expected return on plan assets and non-cash amortization of actuarial gains and losses are excluded from this measure. we expect operating pension cost will be about $1.5 billion in 2016.
funded status of plans the table below presents the funded status of our benefit plans. the funded status represents the fair value of plan assets less benefit obligations.
principal retiree benefit plans         (6.1)         (9.9)
   the ge pension plan deficit increased in 2015 primarily due to the growth in pension liabilities and plan amendments, partially offset by higher discount rates.
   the increase in the underfunding of our other pension plans was primarily attributable to the acquisition of alstom and liability growth, partially offset by higher discount rates, employer contributions and investment performance.
   the decrease in the principal retiree benefit plans deficit was primarily attributable to plan amendments.
we expect to contribute $0.9 billion to our other pension plans in 2016, as compared to $0.5 billion in 2015 and $0.7 billion in 2014. ge capital is a member of certain ge pension plans. as a result of the ge exit plan, ge capital will have additional funding obligations for these pension plans. these obligations do not relate to the verticals and are recognized as an expense in ge capital's other continuing operations when they become probable and estimable. in 2015, the additional funding obligations recognized by ge capital was $0.1 billion. this additional funding is recorded as a contra expense for ge as ge's future pension obligations will be paid by ge capital. on a consolidated basis, the additional required pension funding does not affect current period earnings but rather will be reflected as a reduction of the pension liability when paid.
we also expect to contribute $0.5 billion to our principal retiree benefit plans in 2016 similar to our actual contributions of $0.5 billion in both 2015 and 2014.
the funded status of our postretirement benefit plans and future effects on operating results depend on economic conditions and investment performance. for further information about our benefit plans and the effects of this activity on our financial statements see the critical accounting estimates section within the md&a and notes 12 and 27 to the consolidated financial statements.
income taxes ge pays the income taxes it owes in every country it does business.  while ge and ge capital file a consolidated u.s. federal income tax return, many factors impact our income tax expense and cash tax payments.  the most significant factor is that we conduct business in approximately 180 countries and more than half of our revenue is earned outside the u.s., often in countries with lower tax rates than in the u.s.  we reinvest most of our foreign earnings overseas to be able to fund our active non-u.s. business operations.  our tax liability is also affected by u.s. and foreign tax incentives designed to encourage certain investments, like research and development; and by acquisitions, dispositions and tax law changes.  finally, our tax returns are routinely audited, and settlements of issues raised in these audits sometimes affect our tax rates.
ge and ge capital file a consolidated u.s. federal income tax return. this enables ge and ge capital to use tax deductions and credits of one member of the group to reduce the tax that otherwise would have been payable by another member of the group. the ge capital effective tax rate reflects the benefit of these tax reductions in the consolidated return. ge makes cash payments to ge capital for tax reductions and ge capital pays for tax increases at the time ge's tax payments are due.
   the consolidated income tax rate for 2015 was greater than 35% due to charges associated with the ge capital exit plan.
   as discussed in note 14 to the consolidated financial statements, in 2015 in conjunction with the ge capital exit plan, we incurred tax expense of $6.3 billion related to expected repatriation of foreign earnings and write-off of deferred tax assets.
   the increase in the income tax expense is primarily due to the tax expense incurred as part of the ge capital exit plan.
   the consolidated tax provision includes $1.6 billion and $1.5 billion for ge (excluding ge capital) for 2014 and 2015, respectively.
   the decrease in the consolidated provision for income taxes was attributable to increased benefits from lower taxed global operations, excluding the benefit of audit resolutions.
   this decrease was partially offset by an increase in income taxed at rates above the average rate.
on january 2, 2013, the american taxpayer relief act of 2012 was enacted and the law extended several provisions, including a two-year extension of the u.s. tax provision deferring tax on active financial services income and certain u.s. business credits, retroactive to january 1, 2012. under accounting rules, a tax law change is taken into account in calculating the income tax provision in the period enacted. because the extension was enacted into law in 2013, tax expense in 2013 reflected retroactive extension of the previously expired provisions.
benefits from global operations absent the effects of the ge capital exit plan, our consolidated income tax rate is lower than the u.s. statutory rate primarily because of benefits from lower-taxed global operations, including the use of global funding structures. there is a benefit from global operations as non-u.s. income is subject to local country tax rates that are significantly below the 35% u.s. statutory rate. these non-u.s. earnings have been indefinitely reinvested outside the u.s. and are not subject to current u.s. income tax. most of these earnings have been reinvested in active non-u.s. business operations and we do not intend to repatriate these earnings to fund u.s. operations. the rate of tax on our indefinitely reinvested non-u.s. earnings is below the 35% u.s. statutory rate because we have significant business operations subject to tax in countries where the tax on that income is lower than the u.s. statutory rate and because ge funds certain non-u.s. operations through foreign companies that are subject to low foreign taxes.
a substantial portion of the benefit related to business operations subject to tax in countries where the tax on that income is lower than the u.s. statutory rate is derived from our gecas aircraft leasing operations located in ireland and from our power services manufacturing operations located in hungary. no other operation in any one country accounts for a material portion of the remaining balance of the benefit.
we expect our ability to benefit from non-u.s. income taxed at less than the u.s. rate to continue, subject to changes in u.s. or foreign law. in addition, since this benefit depends on management's intention to indefinitely reinvest amounts outside the u.s., our tax provision will increase to the extent we no longer indefinitely reinvest foreign earnings.

2015 - 2014 commentary our benefits from lower-taxed global operations decreased in 2015 because of the tax expense associated with the ge capital exit plan.
2014 - 2013 commentary our benefits from lower-taxed global operations increased in 2014 because of benefits from indefinitely reinvested earnings taxed at less than the u.s. rate and the non-repeat of foreign valuation allowance increases.
other information to the extent non-u.s. operating income increases, we would expect tax benefits to increase, subject to management's intention to indefinitely reinvest those earnings. included in 2015 is a tax expense of $6.1 billion related to the expected repatriation of foreign earnings and write-off of deferred tax assets in conjunction with the ge capital exit plan.
the tax benefit from non-u.s. income taxed at a local country rather than the u.s. statutory tax rate is reported in the caption "tax on global activities including exports" in the effective tax rate reconciliation in note 14 to the consolidated financial statements.
a more detailed analysis of differences between the u.s. federal statutory rate and the consolidated effective rate, as well as other information about our income tax provisions, is provided in the critical accounting estimates section within the md&a and note 14 to the consolidated financial statements. the nature of business activities and associated income taxes differ for ge and for ge capital; therefore, a separate analysis of each is presented in the paragraphs that follow.
ge effective tax rate (excluding ge capital earnings)
we believe that the ge effective tax rate and provision for income taxes are best analyzed in relation to ge earnings before income taxes excluding the ge capital net earnings from continuing operations, as ge tax expense does not include taxes on ge capital earnings. for further information on this calculation, see the supplemental information section within the md&a.
ge etr, excluding ge capital earnings*   ge provision (benefit) for income taxes
   the ge provision for income taxes decreased in 2015 because of increased benefits from lower taxed global operations ($0.2 billion), including benefits from integrating our existing services business with alstom's services business.
   the ge provision for income taxes also decreased due to increases in the benefit of audit resolutions ($0.2 billion) shown below and deductible stock losses ($0.2 billion).
   partially offsetting these decreases was an increase in income taxed at rates above the average tax rate ($0.5 billion).
   the ge provision for income taxes decreased in 2014 primarily because of increased benefits from lower taxed global operations ($0.8 billion).
   that decrease was partially offset by the decrease in the benefit of audit resolutions ($0.3 billion) shown below, an increase in income taxed at rates above the average tax rate ($0.3 billion), and the non-repeat of the 2013 benefit from the enactment of the extension of certain u.s. business credits ($0.1 billion), discussed above.
resolution of audit matters reduced the ge provision for income taxes by $0.3 billion, $0.1 billion and $0.4 billion in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. the effects of such resolutions are included in the following captions in note 14 to the consolidated financial statements.

ge capital effective tax rate
ge capital etr    ge capital provision (benefit) for income taxes
   the increase in the income tax expense from a benefit of $0.9 billion for 2014 to an expense of $5.0 billion for 2015 is primarily due to the tax expense, discussed in note 14 to the consolidated financial statements, related to the ge capital exit plan.
   the increase in tax benefit of $0.5 billion from 2013 to 2014 was primarily due to increased benefits from lower tax global operations ($0.2 billion), non-repeat of an expense for irs audit resolutions ($0.2 billion) and increased state and local tax benefits ($0.1 billion).
geographic data our global activities span all geographic regions and primarily encompass manufacturing for local and export markets, import and sale of products produced in other regions, leasing of aircraft, sourcing for our plants domiciled in other global regions and provision of financial services within these regional economies. thus, when countries or regions experience currency and/or economic stress, we often have increased exposure to certain risks, but also often have new opportunities that include, among other things, expansion of industrial activities through purchases of companies or assets at reduced prices and lower u.s. debt financing costs.
financial results of our non-u.s. activities reported in u.s. dollars are affected by currency exchange. we use a number of techniques to manage the effects of currency exchange, including selective borrowings in local currencies and selective hedging of significant cross-currency transactions. such principal currencies are the euro, the pound sterling, the brazilian real and the chinese renminbi.
revenues revenues are classified according to the region to which products and services are sold. for purposes of this analysis, the u.s. is presented separately from the remainder of the americas.
non-u.s. revenues as a % of consolidated revenues         55%              56%              56%
non-u.s. revenues the decrease in non-u.s. revenues in 2015 was primarily due to decreases in growth markets of 11% in canada and 29% in australia & new zealand (anz), partially offset by an increase of 2% in middle east, north africa and turkey (menat) and 1% in china.
the increase in 2014 was primarily due to increases in growth markets of 14% in menat, 28% in sub-sahara, and 7% in latin america, partially offset by a decrease of 15% in anz.
the effects of currency fluctuations on reported results were as follows:
   decreased revenues by $0.6 billion in 2014, primarily driven by the brazilian real ($0.2 billion), canadian dollar ($0.1 billion) and japanese yen ($0.1 billion), partially offset by the british pound ($0.1).
   decreased revenues by $0.4 billion in 2013, primarily driven by the japanese yen ($0.3 billion) and brazilian real ($0.2 billion), partially offset by the euro ($0.2 billion).
the effects of foreign currency fluctuations decreased earnings in 2015 by $0.7 billion, primarily driven by the euro ($0.6 billion) and brazilian real ($0.1 billion). the effects of foreign currency fluctuations on earnings were minimal in 2014.
the increase in total assets of non-u.s. operations on a continuing basis reflected an increase primarily in europe driven by the alstom acquisition, partially offset by the strengthening of the u.s. dollar against most major currencies.
statement of financial position because ge and ge capital share certain significant elements of their statements of financial position, the following discussion addresses significant captions in the consolidated statement. within the following discussions, however, we distinguish between ge and ge capital activities in order to permit meaningful analysis of each individual consolidating statement.
major changes in our financial position during 2015
   cash and equivalents increased $0.5 billion. ge cash and equivalents decreased $5.5 billion due to cash flows from operating activities of $16.4 billion, more than offset by $10.4 billion used to acquire businesses (primarily alstom) and $12.1 billion cash returned to investors in the form of dividends of $9.3 billion and buyback of treasury stock of $2.8 billion (cash basis). ge capital cash and equivalents increased $6.0 billion primarily driven by $79.6 billion in proceeds from business dispositions, partially offset by $59.3 billion net repayment of debt and $4.6 billion in payments of dividends to shareowners. see the statement of cash flows section for additional information.
   goodwill increased $12.3 billion, primarily as a result of the alstom and milestone acquisitions, partially offset by currency exchange effects of the stronger u.s. dollar and disposals.
   all other assets increased $12.6 billion, primarily due to purchases of time deposits at ge capital of $10.4 billion.
   assets of discontinued operations decreased $202.6 billion, primarily due to the disposition of consumer businesses of $113.8 billion (including the synchrony financial split-off), cll businesses of $56.1 billion and real estate of $33.0 billion. see note 2 for additional information.
   other ge current liabilities increased $9.3 billion, primarily driven by the alstom acquisition of $5.6 billion and taxes payable of $2.7 billion.
   borrowings decreased $63.1 billion, primarily due to net repayments on ge capital borrowings of $55.3 billion, along with an $8.9 billion reduction in the balances driven by the strengthening of the u.s. dollar against major currencies, partially offset by a net increase in borrowings by ge of $2.0 billion.
   liabilities of discontinued operations decreased $81.7 billion, primarily driven by the disposition of consumer businesses of $69.1 billion (including the synchrony financial split-off), cll businesses of $11.6 billion and real estate of $1.7 billion. see note 2 for additional information.
   retained earnings decreased $15.3 billion, due to common stock dividends of $9.1 billion in addition to a net loss of $6.1 billion.
   common stock held in treasury increased $20.9 billion, primarily due to the synchrony financial share exchange of $20.4 billion and buyback of treasury stock of $3.3 billion (book basis). this was partially offset by treasury stock dispositions of $2.8 billion, primarily stock option exercises of $1.8 billion.
   noncontrolling interests decreased $6.8 billion, primarily due to the ge capital preferred share exchange of $4.9 billion and the synchrony financial split-off of $2.8 billion, partially offset by noncontrolling interests related to the alstom acquisition of $0.7 billion. the impact of the preferred share exchange is also the primary driver for the increase in other capital of $4.7 billion. see note 15 for additional information.
financial resources and liquidity liquidity and borrowings we maintain a strong focus on liquidity. at both ge and ge capital we manage our liquidity to help provide access to sufficient funding to meet our business needs and financial obligations throughout business cycles.
our liquidity and borrowing plans for ge and ge capital are established within the context of our annual financial and strategic planning processes. at ge, our liquidity and funding plans take into account the liquidity necessary to fund our operating commitments, which include primarily purchase obligations for inventory and equipment, payroll and general expenses (including pension funding). we also take into account our capital allocation and growth objectives, including paying dividends, repurchasing shares, investing in research and development and acquiring industrial businesses. at ge, we rely primarily on cash generated through our operating activities, any dividend payments from ge capital, and also have historically maintained a commercial paper program that we regularly use to fund operations in the u.s., principally within the quarters.
ge capital has historically relied on the unsecured term debt markets, the global commercial paper markets, deposits, secured funding, retail funding products, bank borrowings and securitizations to fund its balance sheet. subsequent to april 10, 2015 and with the execution of the ge capital exit plan, we do not plan to issue any incremental ge capital senior unsecured term debt for four years. furthermore we have reduced our commercial paper from $25 billion to $5 billion as of december 31, 2015 and with our executed and current disposition plans we have substantially reduced our reliance on deposits and securitization. today, we mainly rely on excess cash positions, cash generated through dispositions, and the cash flow from our verticals business to fund our debt maturities and our operating and interest expense costs. ge capital's liquidity position is targeted to meet its obligations under both normal and stressed conditions. we expect to maintain an elevated liquidity position as we generate cash from asset sales, returning to more normalized levels in 2019. during this period we expect to have excess interest costs as asset sales outpace our debt maturities. while we maintain elevated liquidity levels, we may engage in liability management actions, such as buying back debt, based on market and economic conditions in order to reduce our excess interest costs. in 2015, we repurchased $1 billion of long-term unsecured debt. in addition, we repurchased $0.8 billion of debt for which we had the right to call.
our 2016 ge capital funding plan anticipates repayment of principal on outstanding short-term borrowings, including the current portion of long-term debt ($42.6 billion at december 31, 2015), principally through dispositions, asset sales and cash on hand. long-term maturities and early redemptions were $41.3 billion in 2015.
we maintain a detailed liquidity policy for ge capital that requires ge capital to maintain a contingency funding plan. the liquidity policy defines ge capital's liquidity risk tolerance under different stress scenarios based on its liquidity sources and also establishes procedures to escalate potential issues. we actively monitor ge capital's access to funding markets and its liquidity profile through tracking external indicators and testing various stress scenarios. the contingency funding plan provides a framework for handling market disruptions and establishes escalation procedures in the event that such events or circumstances arise. ge capital will continue to evaluate the need to modify the existing contingency funding plan due to the ge capital exit plan.
as part of the ge capital exit plan, on september 21, 2015 ge capital commenced private offers to exchange up to $30 billion of certain outstanding debt for new notes with maturities of six months, five years, ten years or twenty years. on october 19, 2015, given the high level of participation, the offering was increased by $6 billion with the aggregate principal amount of $36 billion (representing $31 billion of outstanding principal and $5 billion of premium) of outstanding notes being tendered for exchange and settled on october 26, 2015. the new notes that were issued at closing are composed of $15.3 billion of 0.964% six month notes due april 2016, £0.8 billion of 1.363% six month notes due april 2016, $6.1 billion of 2.342% notes due 2020, $2.0 billion of 3.373% notes due 2025 and $11.5 billion of 4.418% notes due 2035. of the $16.2 billion exchanged into six month notes, $1.3 billion had been in short-term borrowings. ge capital will continue to evaluate the opportunity to repurchase debt while maintaining our liquidity at the levels communicated as part of the ge capital exit plan. the new notes have been fully, irrevocably and unconditionally guaranteed by ge.
on december 2, 2015, $87.7 billion of senior unsecured notes and $4.9 billion of commercial paper was assumed by ge upon its merger with ge capital. see note 10 to the consolidated financial statements.
on may 28, 2015, ge issued €3,150 million senior unsecured debt, composed of €650 million of floating rate notes due 2020, €1,250 million of 1.250% notes due 2023 and €1,250 million of 1.875% notes due 2027. on october 9, 2015, $2.0 billion of long-term debt issued by ge matured.
liquidity sources in addition to ge cash of $10.4 billion at december 31, 2015, ge capital maintained liquidity sources of $90.9 billion that consisted of cash and equivalents of $60.1 billion, high-quality investments of $10.4 billion presented in other assets and cash and equivalents of $20.4 billion classified as discontinued operations. additionally, we have $45.6 billion of committed unused credit lines.
ge capital(b)                  60.1             non-u.s.(c)      50.1
(a)   at december 31, 2015, $2.8 billion of ge cash and equivalents was held in countries with currency controls that may restrict the transfer of funds to the u.s. or limit our ability to transfer funds to the u.s. without incurring substantial costs. these funds are available to fund operations and growth in these countries and we do not currently anticipate a need to transfer these funds to the u.s.
(b)   at december 31, 2015, ge capital cash and equivalents of about $0.7 billion were primarily in insurance entities and were subject to regulatory restrictions.
(c)   of this amount at december 31, 2015, $3.5 billion is held outside of the u.s. and is available to fund operations and other growth of non-u.s. subsidiaries; it is also available to fund our needs in the u.s. on a short-term basis through short-term loans, without being subject to u.s. tax. under the internal revenue code, these loans are permitted to be outstanding for 30 days or less and the total of all such loans is required to be outstanding for less than 60 days during the year. if we were to repatriate this cash, we would be subject to additional u.s. income taxes and foreign withholding taxes.
(b)   total committed unused credit lines were extended to us by 48 financial institutions but can be drawn on and lent to ge capital.
in conjunction with the ge capital exit plan, we are currently evaluating the amount of credit lines we require in the future.
funding plan we reduced our capital eni, excluding liquidity*, to $82 billion at december 31, 2015.
during the first quarter of 2015, ge capital completed issuances of $8.1 billion of senior unsecured debt (excluding securitizations described below) with maturities up to 10 years.
(in billions)                                                                       ge             ge capital average commercial paper borrowings during the fourth quarter of 2015               $13.8          $9.2
maximum commercial paper borrowings outstanding during the fourth quarter of 2015   16.8           12.7
ge capital commercial paper maturities have historically been funded principally through new commercial paper issuances and at ge are substantially repaid before quarter-end using indefinitely reinvested overseas cash, which as discussed above, is available for use in the u.s. on a short-term basis without being subject to u.s. tax. as of december 31, 2015, ge capital reduced the outstanding commercial paper to $5 billion, consistent with the announced ge capital exit plan.
we securitize financial assets as an alternative source of funding. during the first twelve months of 2015, we completed $2.1 billion of non-recourse issuances and $3.4 billion of non-recourse borrowings matured. at december 31, 2015, consolidated non-recourse securitization borrowings were $3.1 billion.
we have eight deposit-taking banks outside of the u.s., which are classified as discontinued operations, and one deposit-taking bank in the u.s., ge capital bank, an industrial bank (ib), which is also classified as discontinued operations. the ib currently issues certificates of deposit (cds) in maturity terms up to 10 years.
exchange rate and interest rate risks exchange rate and interest rate risks are managed with a variety of techniques, including match funding and selective use of derivatives. we use derivatives to mitigate or eliminate certain financial and market risks because we conduct business in diverse markets around the world and local funding is not always efficient. in addition, we use derivatives to adjust the debt we are issuing to match the fixed or floating nature of the assets we are originating. we apply strict policies to manage each of these risks, including prohibitions on speculative activities. following is an analysis of the potential effects of changes in interest rates and currency exchange rates using so-called "shock" tests that seek to model the effects of shifts in rates. such tests are inherently limited based on the assumptions used (described further below) and should not be viewed as a forecast; actual effects would depend on many variables, including market factors and the composition of the company's assets and liabilities at that time.
   it is our policy to minimize exposure to interest rate changes. we fund our financial investments using debt or a combination of debt and hedging instruments so that the interest rates of our borrowings match the expected interest rate profile on our assets. to test the effectiveness of our hedging actions, we assumed that, on january 1, 2016, interest rates decreased by 100 basis points across the yield curve (a "parallel shift" in that curve) and further assumed that the decrease remained in place for the next 12 months. based on the year-end 2015 portfolio and holding all other assumptions constant, we estimated that our consolidated net earnings for the next 12 months, starting in january 2016, would decline by less than $0.3 billion as a result of this parallel shift in the yield curve.
   it is our policy to minimize currency exposures and to conduct operations either within functional currencies or using the protection of hedge strategies. we analyzed year-end 2015 consolidated currency exposures, including derivatives designated and effective as hedges, to identify assets and liabilities denominated in other than their relevant functional currencies. for such assets and liabilities, we then evaluated the effects of a 10% shift in exchange rates between those currencies and the u.s. dollar, holding all other assumptions constant. this analysis indicated that our 2016 consolidated net earnings would decline by less than $0.2 billion as a result of such a shift in exchange rates. this analysis excludes any translation impact from changes in exchange rates on our financial results.
debt and derivative instruments, guarantees and covenants credit ratings as of december 31, 2015, ge's and ge capital's long-term unsecured debt ratings from standard and poor's ratings service (s&p) were aa+ and the short-term funding rating from s&p were a-1+. the rating outlook for ge was downgraded from stable to negative on october 7, 2015, while the rating outlook for ge capital remains stable. on april 10, 2015, moody's investors service (moody's) downgraded the senior unsecured debt rating for ge to a1 from aa3 following ge's april 10 announcement of the ge capital exit plan. ge's p-1 short-term rating was affirmed. moody's affirmed ge capital's a1/p-1 ratings. the rating outlook for ge and ge capital were stable. we are disclosing these ratings to enhance understanding of our sources of liquidity and the effects of our ratings on our costs of funds. although we currently do not expect a downgrade in the credit ratings, our ratings may be subject to a revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating organization, and each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating.
principal debt and derivative conditions certain of our derivative instruments can be terminated if specified credit ratings are not maintained and certain debt and derivatives agreements of other consolidated entities have provisions that are affected by these credit ratings.
fair values of our derivatives can change significantly from period to period based on, among other factors, market movements and changes in our positions. we manage counterparty credit risk (the risk that counterparties will default and not make payments to us according to the terms of our standard master agreements) on an individual counterparty basis. where we have agreed to netting of derivative exposures with a counterparty, we offset our exposures with that counterparty and apply the value of collateral posted to us to determine the net exposure. we actively monitor these net exposures against defined limits and take appropriate actions in response, including requiring additional collateral.
swap, forward and option contracts are executed under standard master agreements that typically contain mutual downgrade provisions that provide the ability of the counterparty to require termination if the long-term credit ratings of the applicable ge entity were to fall below a-/a3 or other ratings levels agreed upon with the counterparty. in certain of these master agreements, the counterparty also has the ability to require termination if the short-term ratings of the applicable ge entity were to fall below a-1/p-1. the net derivative liability after consideration of netting arrangements, outstanding interest payments and collateral posted by us under these master agreements was estimated to be $0.7 billion at december 31, 2015. see notes 20 and 27 to the consolidated financial statements.
for further information about our risk exposures, our use of derivatives, and the effects of this activity on our financial statements see notes 20 and 27 to the consolidated financial statements.
income maintenance agreement and ge guarantee of certain ge capital debt ge provides implicit and explicit support to ge capital through commitments, capital contributions and operating support. as part of the ge capital exit plan, on april 10, 2015, ge and ge capital entered into an amendment to their existing financial support agreement. under this amendment (the amendment), the company has provided a full and unconditional guarantee (the guarantee) of the payment of principal and interest on all tradable senior and subordinated outstanding long-term debt securities and all commercial paper issued or guaranteed by ge capital identified in the amendment. the guarantee replaced the requirement that the company make certain income maintenance payments to ge capital in certain circumstances. ge capital's u.s. public indentures were concurrently amended to provide the full and unconditional guarantee by the company set forth in the guarantee. at december 31, 2015, the balance of this debt that ge assumed was $85.1 billion, and the guarantee applied to approximately $85.8 billion of ge capital debt.
statement of cash flows - overview from 2013 through 2015
consolidated cash flows we evaluate our cash flow performance by reviewing our industrial (non-ge capital) businesses and ge capital businesses separately. cash from operating activities (cfoa) is the principal source of cash generation for our industrial businesses. the industrial businesses also have liquidity available via the public capital markets.
operating cash flows            investing cash flows            financing cash flows
with respect to ge cfoa, we believe that it is useful to supplement our ge statement of cash flows and to examine in a broader context the business activities that provide and require cash.
the most significant source of cash in ge cfoa is customer-related activities, the largest of which is collecting cash resulting from product or services sales. see the intercompany transactions and eliminations section for information related to transactions between ge and ge capital. the most significant operating use of cash is to pay our suppliers, employees, tax authorities and others for a wide range of material and services. dividends from ge capital represent the distribution of a portion of ge capital retained earnings, and are distinct from cash from continuing operations within the ge capital businesses.
2015-2014 commentary ge cash from operating activities increased $1.2 billion primarily due to the following:
   a decrease of operating cash collections of $0.4 billion to $109.3 billion in 2015, primarily due to lower ge segment revenues from sales of goods and services.
   a decrease of operating cash payments of $0.3 billion to $97.2 billion in 2015, primarily driven by decreased inventory spend.
   further, ge capital paid dividends totaling $4.3 billion and $3.0 billion to ge in 2015 and 2014, respectively.
   higher business acquisition activity of $8.3 billion is primarily driven by the 2015 acquisition of alstom of $10.1 billion. this is partially offset by the 2014 acquisitions of certain thermo fisher scientific inc. life-science businesses for $1.1 billion, cameron's reciprocating compression division for $0.6 billion and api healthcare (api) for $0.3 billion.
   this is partially offset by $1.1 billion higher proceeds from principal business dispositions and $0.3 billion higher proceeds from dispositions of property, plant and equipment.
   the 2015 repayment of $2.0 billion of ge unsecured notes. this is partially offset by the 2015 issuance of unsecured notes of $3.4 billion compared with $3.0 billion in 2014.
2014-2013 commentary ge cash from operating activities increased $0.9 billion primarily due to the following:
   an increase of operating cash collections of $4.9 billion to $109.7 billion in 2014. this increase is consistent with comparable ge segment revenue increases from sales of goods and services and higher collections on current receivables. these increases were partially offset by a decrease in progress collections.
   this increase is partially offset by an increase of operating cash payments of $1.0 billion to $97.5 billion in 2014 consistent with cost and expense increases, which was partially offset by the non-recurrence of payments made in 2013, including nbcu llc deal-related tax payments, and payouts under our long-term incentive plan.
   further, ge capital paid dividends totaling $3.0 billion and $6.0 billion to ge in 2014 and 2013, respectively.
   2013 proceeds of $16.7 billion from the sale of our remaining 49% common equity interest in nbcu llc to comcast corporation.
   this was partially offset by lower business acquisition activity of $5.9 billion primarily driven by the 2014 acquisitions of certain thermo fisher scientific inc. life-science businesses for $1.1 billion, cameron's reciprocating compression division for $0.6 billion and api healthcare (api) for $0.3 billion compared with the 2013 acquisitions of avio for $4.4 billion and lufkin for $3.3 billion.
   a decrease in net repurchases of ge shares for treasury in accordance with our share repurchase program of $8.1 billion.
   the 2013 repayment of $5.0 billion of ge unsecured notes compared with the issuance of $3.0 billion of unsecured notes in 2014.
   these decreases were partially offset by an increase in the dividends paid to shareowners of $1.0 billion.
ge capital cash flows
operating cash flows            investing cash flows            financing cash flows
2015-2014 commentary ge capital cash from operating activities decreased $4.7 billion primarily due to the following:
   a decrease in net cash collateral activity with counterparties on derivative contracts of $2.7 billion.
   a decrease in accounts payable of $0.4 billion in addition to a decrease in cash generated from earnings and other activity.
ge capital cash from investing activities increased $49.1 billion primarily due to the following:
   in 2015, we closed the sale of certain of our cll, real estate and consumer businesses for proceeds of $35.2 billion, $27.7 billion and $16.7 billion, respectively.
   this increase was partially offset by the investment in high quality interest bearing deposits that mature in april 2016 of $10.4 billion.
   lower aircraft sales deposits of $2.2 billion.
   the net cash payment of $1.7 billion for the 2015 acquisition of milestone aviation group.
   lower activity in other assets-investments of $1.2 billion driven by net activity of our equity-method investments.
ge capital cash used for financing activities increased $27.7 billion primarily due to the following:
   higher net repayments of borrowings of $25.7 billion driven primarily by an increase in short-term and long-term debt maturities.
2014-2013 commentary ge capital cash from operating activities increased $1.0 billion primarily due to the following:
   an increase in net cash collateral activity with counterparties on derivative contracts of $3.0 billion.
   these increases were partially offset by a net decrease in tax activity of $3.9 billion driven by net tax payments in 2014 compared with net tax refunds in 2013.
ge capital cash from investing activities decreased $15.7 billion primarily due to the following:
   a net decrease in financing receivables activity of $3.2 billion driven by net originations of financing receivables in 2014 of $0.2 billion, compared with net collections (which includes sales) of financing receivables of $3.0 billion in 2013.
   a net decrease in investment securities activity of $3.4 billion driven by net sales of $0.7 billion in 2014, compared with net sales of $4.1 billion in 2013.
   lower activity in other assets-investments of $0.5 billion driven by net activity of our equity-method investments.
ge capital cash used for financing activities increased $7.0 billion primarily due to the following:
   higher net repayments of borrowings, consisting primarily of lower issuances, of $9.2 billion.
   lower dividends paid to ge totaling $3.0 billion and $6.0 billion, including special dividends of $1.0 billion and $4.1 billion in 2014 and 2013, respectively.
intercompany transactions and eliminations effects of transactions between related companies are made on an arms-length basis, are eliminated and consist primarily of ge capital dividends to ge; ge customer receivables sold to ge capital; ge capital services for trade receivables management and material procurement; buildings and equipment leased between ge and ge capital; information technology (it) and other services sold to ge capital by ge; aircraft engines manufactured by ge that are installed on aircraft purchased by ge capital from third-party producers for lease to others; expenses related to parent-subsidiary pension plans, and various investments, loans and allocations of ge corporate overhead costs.
ge sells customer receivables to ge capital in part to fund the growth of our industrial businesses. these transactions can result in cash generation or cash use. during any given period, ge receives cash from the sale of receivables to ge capital. it also foregoes collection of cash on receivables sold. the incremental amount of cash received from sales of receivables in excess of the cash ge would have otherwise collected had those receivables not been sold, represents the cash generated or used in the period relating to this activity. the incremental cash generated in ge cfoa from selling these receivables to ge capital increased ge's cfoa by $1.6 billion, $2.2 billion and $0.1 billion in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.
see note 23 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information about the eliminations of intercompany transactions between ge and ge capital.
contractual obligations as defined by reporting regulations, our contractual obligations for future payments as of december 31, 2015, follow.
operating lease obligations (note 26)                           4.2           0.8                  1.3                  1.0                   1.1
contractual obligations of discontinued operations(e)          46.5          46.5                    -                    -                     -
(a)   included all take-or-pay arrangements, capital expenditures, contractual commitments to purchase equipment that will be leased to others, contractual commitments related to factoring agreements, software acquisition/license commitments, contractual minimum programming commitments and any contractually required cash payments for acquisitions.
(b)   excluded funding commitments entered into in the ordinary course of business. for further information on these commitments and other guarantees, see note 20 and 22 to the consolidated financial statements.
(d)   included an estimate of future expected funding requirements related to our postretirement benefit plans and included liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits. because their future cash outflows are uncertain, the following non-current liabilities are excluded from the table above: derivatives, deferred revenue and other sundry items. for further information on certain of these items, see notes 14, 20 and 27 to the consolidated financial statements.
exposures venezuela the results of our venezuelan businesses have been reported under highly inflationary accounting since the beginning of 2010, at which time the functional currency of our venezuelan entities was changed from the bolivar to the u.s. dollar.
our activities related to venezuela generated revenues of less than one percent of consolidated revenues, consisting of both exports to and operations within the country. the majority of these revenues are denominated in u.s. dollars and euro but we also transact in bolivars for certain businesses.
for our operations in venezuela, determining the appropriate exchange rate for remeasurement of bolivar-denominated net monetary assets into u.s. dollars continues to be subject to uncertainty. as of december 31, 2015 the venezuelan government operated three different exchange mechanisms: the government-operated cencoex (the official exchange mechanism), the government-operated auction based sicad mechanism and an open market marginal currency system (simadi). the simadi mechanism is intended to operate with fewer restrictions and its exchange rate on december 31, 2015 was approximately 198 bolivars per u.s. dollar compared to sicad at 13.5 bolivars per u.s. dollar.
at the end of each period, we remeasure the net monetary assets of our venezuelan businesses using the rate we expect to settle them at, including through the payment of dividends. the industries in which these businesses operate were not selected for participation in any sicad auctions during 2015. in light of continued uncertainty regarding availability of exchange mechanisms and decreasing liquidity in those mechanisms, we completed an extensive review of each of our business activities within venezuela during the fourth quarter of 2015. based on that review, we decided to reduce certain business activities in venezuela and to begin accessing the simadi market to obtain u.s. dollars, to the extent possible, for our residual oil & gas and power operations. our appliances business in venezuela, which is conducted through an equity method investment, similarly concluded that the simadi exchange mechanism provides the most appropriate rate for measuring its net monetary assets. we also concluded, based on our review, consolidating our remaining venezuelan operations remains appropriate.
use of the simadi rate to remeasure our venezuelan net monetary assets at december 31, 2015 resulted in exchange rate losses of $83 million. restructuring and impairment charges of $12 million also were recorded during the fourth quarter of 2015 as a result of the review discussed above. net monetary assets subject to remeasurement at the simadi rate were approximately $5 million at december 31, 2015, including approximately $3 million within our appliances equity method investment. in addition to our bolivar-denominated net monetary assets, we also have non-bolivar credit exposures of approximately $292 million at december 31, 2015 and recoverable amounts of non-monetary assets in venezuela of approximately $89 million at december 31, 2015, which consists principally of inventory and property, plant and equipment.
oil & gas industry the sharp decline experienced in oil prices and the prospect of a continuation of prevailing oil prices could have mixed implications for the industries and countries in which we compete. in general, lower oil prices are expected to stimulate growth in oil importing countries while causing negative economic effects in many energy-exporting countries. in this environment, our oil & gas business continues to experience declines in orders, some project commencement delays and pricing pressures. in response to this uncertain industry outlook, we continue to execute cost actions with an increased focus on execution and productivity. we expect that ongoing low oil prices will provide some benefit to our businesses through lower direct material and other variable costs as well as through the expected stimulus-effect on growth in the u.s. and in other economies that rely on energy imports, including europe, japan and india.
critical accounting estimates accounting estimates and assumptions discussed in this section are those that we consider to be the most critical to an understanding of our financial statements because they involve significant judgments and uncertainties. many of these estimates include determining fair value. all of these estimates reflect our best judgment about current, and for some estimates future, economic and market conditions and their potential effects based on information available as of the date of these financial statements. if these conditions change from those expected, it is reasonably possible that the judgments and estimates described below could change, which may result in future impairments of investment securities, goodwill, intangibles and long-lived assets, incremental losses on financing receivables, increases in reserves for contingencies, establishment of valuation allowances on deferred tax assets and increased tax liabilities, among other effects. also see note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, which discusses our most significant accounting policies.
revenue recognition on long-term product services agreements revenue recognition on long-term product services agreements requires estimates of profits over the multiple-year terms of such agreements, considering factors such as the frequency and extent of future monitoring, maintenance and overhaul events; the amount of personnel, spare parts and other resources required to perform the services; and future billing rate, cost changes and customers' utilization of assets. we routinely review estimates under product services agreements and regularly revise them to adjust for changes in outlook.
we also regularly assess customer credit risk inherent in the carrying amounts of receivables and contract costs and estimated earnings, including the risk that contractual penalties may not be sufficient to offset our accumulated investment in the event of customer termination. we gain insight into future utilization and cost trends, as well as credit risk, through our knowledge of the installed base of equipment and the close interaction with our customers that comes with supplying critical services and parts over extended periods. revisions may affect a product services agreement's total estimated profitability resulting in an adjustment of earnings; such adjustments increased earnings by $1.4 billion, $1.0 billion and $0.3 billion in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. we provide for probable losses when they become evident.
further information is provided in notes 1 and 9 to the consolidated financial statements.
asset impairment asset impairment assessment involves various estimates and assumptions as follows:
investments we regularly review investment securities for impairment using both quantitative and qualitative criteria. for debt securities, if we do not intend to sell the security and it is not more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery of our amortized cost, we evaluate other qualitative criteria to determine whether a credit loss exists, such as the financial health of and specific prospects for the issuer, including whether the issuer is in compliance with the terms and covenants of the security. quantitative criteria include determining whether there has been an adverse change in expected future cash flows. for equity securities, our criteria include the length of time and magnitude of the amount that each security is in an unrealized loss position. our other-than-temporary impairment reviews involve our finance, risk and asset management functions as well as the portfolio management and research capabilities of our internal and third-party asset managers. see note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, which discusses the determination of fair value of investment securities.
further information about actual and potential impairment losses is provided in notes 1 and 3 to the consolidated financial statements.
long-lived assets we review long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the related carrying amounts may not be recoverable. determining whether an impairment has occurred typically requires various estimates and assumptions, including determining which undiscounted cash flows are directly related to the potentially impaired asset, the useful life over which cash flows will occur, their amount, and the asset's residual value, if any. in turn, measurement of an impairment loss requires a determination of fair value, which is based on the best information available. we derive the required undiscounted cash flow estimates from our historical experience and our internal business plans. to determine fair value, we use quoted market prices when available, our internal cash flow estimates discounted at an appropriate discount rate and independent appraisals, as appropriate.
our operating lease portfolio of commercial aircraft is a significant concentration of assets in capital, and is particularly subject to market fluctuations. therefore, we test recoverability of each aircraft in our operating lease portfolio at least annually. additionally, we perform quarterly evaluations in circumstances such as when aircraft are re-leased, current lease terms have changed or a specific lessee's credit standing changes. we consider market conditions, such as global demand for commercial aircraft. estimates of future rentals and residual values are based on historical experience and information received routinely from independent appraisers. estimated cash flows from future leases are reduced for expected downtime between leases and for estimated costs required to prepare aircraft to be redeployed. fair value used to measure impairment is based on management's best estimates which are benchmarked against third-party appraiser current market values for aircraft of similar type and age.
further information on impairment losses and our exposure to the commercial aviation industry is provided in notes 7 and 22 to the consolidated financial statements.
goodwill and other identified intangible assets we test goodwill for impairment annually in the third quarter of each year using data as of july 1 of that year. the impairment test consists of two steps: in step one, the carrying value of the reporting unit is compared with its fair value; in step two, which is applied when the carrying value is more than its fair value, the amount of goodwill impairment, if any, is derived by deducting the fair value of the reporting unit's assets and liabilities from the fair value of its equity, and comparing that amount with the carrying amount of goodwill. we determined fair values for each of the reporting units using the market approach, when available and appropriate, or the income approach, or a combination of both. we assess the valuation methodology based upon the relevance and availability of the data at the time we perform the valuation. if multiple valuation methodologies are used, the results are weighted appropriately.
valuations using the market approach are derived from metrics of publicly traded companies or historically completed transactions of comparable businesses. the selection of comparable businesses is based on the markets in which the reporting units operate giving consideration to risk profiles, size, geography, and diversity of products and services. a market approach is limited to reporting units for which there are publicly traded companies that have the characteristics similar to our businesses.
under the income approach, fair value is determined based on the present value of estimated future cash flows, discounted at an appropriate risk-adjusted rate. we use our internal forecasts to estimate future cash flows and include an estimate of long-term future growth rates based on our most recent views of the long-term outlook for each business. actual results may differ from those assumed in our forecasts. we derive our discount rates using a capital asset pricing model and analyzing published rates for industries relevant to our reporting units to estimate the cost of equity financing. we use discount rates that are commensurate with the risks and uncertainty inherent in the respective businesses and in our internally developed forecasts. discount rates used in our reporting unit valuations ranged from 10.0% to 15.5%.
estimating the fair value of reporting units requires the use of estimates and significant judgments that are based on a number of factors including actual operating results. it is reasonably possible that the judgments and estimates described above could change in future periods.
during the third quarter of 2015, we performed our annual impairment test of goodwill for all of our reporting units. based on the results of our step one testing, the fair values of each of the ge reporting units exceeded their carrying values; therefore, the second step of the impairment test was not required to be performed for any of our reporting units and no goodwill impairment was recognized.
we review identified intangible assets with defined useful lives and subject to amortization for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the related carrying amounts may not be recoverable. determining whether an impairment loss occurred requires comparing the carrying amount to the sum of undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. we test intangible assets with indefinite lives annually for impairment using a fair value method such as discounted cash flows. for our insurance activities remaining in continuing operations, we periodically test for impairment our deferred acquisition costs and present value of future profits.
further information is provided in notes 1 and 8 to the consolidated financial statements.
businesses and assets held for sale businesses held for sale represent components that meet the accounting requirements to be classified as held for sale and are presented as single asset and liability amounts in our financial statements with a valuation allowance, if necessary, to recognize the net carrying amount at the lower of cost or fair value, less cost to sell. financing receivables that no longer qualify to be presented as held for investment must be classified as held for sale and recognized in our financial statements at the lower of cost or fair value, less cost to sell, with that amount representing a new cost basis at the date of transfer.
the determination of fair value for businesses and portfolios of financing receivables involves significant judgments and assumptions. development of estimates of fair values in this circumstance is complex and is dependent upon, among other factors, the nature of the potential sales transaction (for example, asset sale versus sale of legal entity), composition of assets and/or businesses in the disposal group, the comparability of the disposal group to market transactions, negotiations with third party purchasers, etc. such factors bear directly on the range of potential fair values and the selection of the best estimates. key assumptions were developed based on market observable data and, in the absence of such data, internal information that is consistent with what market participants would use in a hypothetical transaction.
we review all businesses and assets held for sale each reporting period to determine whether the existing carrying amounts are fully recoverable in comparison to estimated fair values.
pension assumptions pension assumptions are significant inputs to the actuarial models that measure pension benefit obligations and related effects on operations. two assumptions - discount rate and expected return on assets - are important elements of plan expense and asset/liability measurement. we evaluate these critical assumptions at least annually on a plan and country-specific basis. we periodically evaluate other assumptions involving demographic factors such as retirement age, mortality and turnover, and update them to reflect our experience and expectations for the future. actual results in any given year will often differ from actuarial assumptions because of economic and other factors.
projected benefit obligations are measured as the present value of expected payments. we discount those cash payments using the weighted average of market-observed yields for high-quality fixed-income securities with maturities that correspond to the payment of benefits. lower discount rates increase present values and subsequent-year pension expense; higher discount rates decrease present values and subsequent-year pension expense.
our discount rates for principal pension plans at december 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 were 4.38%, 4.02% and 4.85%, respectively, reflecting market interest rates.
to determine the expected long-term rate of return on pension plan assets, we consider current and target asset allocations, as well as historical and expected returns on various categories of plan assets. in developing future long-term return expectations for our principal benefit plans' assets, we formulate views on the future economic environment, both in the u.s. and abroad. we evaluate general market trends and historical relationships among a number of key variables that impact asset class returns such as expected earnings growth, inflation, valuations, yields and spreads, using both internal and external sources. we also take into account expected volatility by asset class and diversification across classes to determine expected overall portfolio results given current and target allocations. assets in our principal pension plans earned 0.6% in 2015, and had average annual returns of 6.4%, 5.0%, and 8.5% per year in the 5-, 10- and 25-year periods ended december 31, 2015, respectively. the average historical 10- and 25- year returns were significantly affected by investment losses in 2008. based on our analysis of future expectations of asset performance, past return results, and our current and target asset allocations, we have assumed a 7.5% long-term expected return on those assets for cost recognition in 2016 compared to 7.5% in 2015 and 2014 and 8.0% in 2013.
changes in key assumptions for our principal pension plans would have the following effects.
   discount rate - a 25 basis point increase in discount rate would decrease pension cost in the following year by $0.2 billion and would decrease the pension benefit obligation at year-end by about $2.2 billion.
further information on our pension plans is provided in the other consolidated information - postretirement benefit plans section within the md&a and in note 12 and 27 to the consolidated financial statements.
income taxes our annual tax rate is based on our income, statutory tax rates and tax planning opportunities available to us in the various jurisdictions in which we operate. tax laws are complex and subject to different interpretations by the taxpayer and respective governmental taxing authorities. significant judgment is required in determining our tax expense and in evaluating our tax positions, including evaluating uncertainties. we review our tax positions quarterly and adjust the balances as new information becomes available. our income tax rate is significantly affected by the tax rate on our global operations. in addition to local country tax laws and regulations, this rate depends on the extent earnings are indefinitely reinvested outside the united states. indefinite reinvestment is determined by management's judgment about and intentions concerning the future operations of the company. at december 31, 2015 and 2014, approximately $104 billion and $119 billion of earnings, respectively, have been indefinitely reinvested outside the united states. most of these earnings have been reinvested in active non-u.s. business operations, and we do not intend to repatriate these earnings to fund u.s. operations. because of the availability of u.s. foreign tax credits, it is not practicable to determine the u.s. federal income tax liability that would be payable if such earnings were not reinvested indefinitely.
deferred income tax assets represent amounts available to reduce income taxes payable on taxable income in future years. such assets arise because of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, as well as from net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. we evaluate the recoverability of these future tax deductions and credits by assessing the adequacy of future expected taxable income from all sources, including reversal of taxable temporary differences, forecasted operating earnings and available tax planning strategies. these sources of income rely heavily on estimates. we use our historical experience and our short- and long-range business forecasts to provide insight. further, our global and diversified business portfolio gives us the opportunity to employ various prudent and feasible tax planning strategies to facilitate the recoverability of future deductions. amounts recorded for deferred tax assets related to non-u.s. net operating losses, net of valuation allowances, were $5.1 billion and $5.5 billion at december 31, 2015 and 2014, including $0.8 billion and $1.7 billion at december 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, of deferred tax assets, net of valuation allowances, associated with losses reported in discontinued operations, primarily related to our real estate and consumer businesses and our loss on the sale of ge money japan. such year-end 2015 amounts are expected to be fully recoverable within the applicable statutory expiration periods. to the extent we do not consider it more likely than not that a deferred tax asset will be recovered, a valuation allowance is established.
further information on income taxes is provided in the other consolidated information - income taxes section within the md&a and in note 14 to the consolidated financial statements.
derivatives and hedging we use derivatives to manage a variety of risks, including risks related to interest rates, foreign exchange and commodity prices. accounting for derivatives as hedges requires that, at inception and over the term of the arrangement, the hedged item and related derivative meet the requirements for hedge accounting. the rules and interpretations related to derivatives accounting are complex. failure to apply this complex guidance correctly will result in all changes in the fair value of the derivative being reported in earnings, without regard to the offsetting changes in the fair value of the hedged item.
in evaluating whether a particular relationship qualifies for hedge accounting, we test effectiveness at inception and each reporting period thereafter by determining whether changes in the fair value of the derivative offset, within a specified range, changes in the fair value of the hedged item. if fair value changes fail this test, we discontinue applying hedge accounting to that relationship prospectively. fair values of both the derivative instrument and the hedged item are calculated using internal valuation models incorporating market-based assumptions, subject to third-party confirmation, as applicable.
further information about our use of derivatives is provided in notes 1, 9, 20 and 27 to the consolidated financial statements.
fair value measurements assets and liabilities measured at fair value every reporting period include investments in debt and equity securities and derivatives. other assets and liabilities are subject to fair value measurements only in certain circumstances, including purchase accounting applied to assets and liabilities acquired in a business combination, impaired loans that have been reduced based on the fair value of the underlying collateral, cost and equity method investments and long-lived assets that are written down to fair value when they are impaired. upon closing an acquisition, we estimate the fair values of assets and liabilities acquired and integrate the acquisition as soon as practicable. the size, scope and complexity of an acquisition will affect the time it takes to obtain the necessary information to record the acquired assets and liabilities at fair value. it may take up to one year to finalize the initial fair value estimates used in the preliminary purchase accounting. accordingly, it is reasonably likely that our initial estimates will be subsequently revised, which could affect carrying amounts of goodwill, intangibles and potentially other assets and liabilities in our financial statements. assets that are written down to fair value when impaired are not subsequently adjusted to fair value unless further impairment occurs.
a fair value measurement is determined as the price we would receive to sell an asset or pay to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. in the absence of active markets for the identical assets or liabilities, such measurements involve developing assumptions based on market observable data and, in the absence of such data, internal information that is consistent with what market participants would use in a hypothetical transaction that occurs at the measurement date. the determination of fair value often involves significant judgments about assumptions such as determining an appropriate discount rate that factors in both risk and liquidity premiums, identifying the similarities and differences in market transactions, weighting those differences accordingly and then making the appropriate adjustments to those market transactions to reflect the risks specific to our asset being valued.
further information on fair value measurements and related matters is provided in notes 1, 8, 19, 20 and 27 to the consolidated financial statements.
other loss contingencies other loss contingencies are uncertain and unresolved matters that arise in the ordinary course of business and result from events or actions by others that have the potential to result in a future loss. such contingencies include, but are not limited to environmental obligations, litigation, regulatory proceedings, product quality and losses resulting from other events and developments.
when a loss is considered probable and reasonably estimable, we record a liability in the amount of our best estimate for the ultimate loss. when there appears to be a range of possible costs with equal likelihood, liabilities are based on the low-end of such range. however, the likelihood of a loss with respect to a particular contingency is often difficult to predict and determining a meaningful estimate of the loss or a range of loss may not be practicable based on the information available and the potential effect of future events and decisions by third parties that will determine the ultimate resolution of the contingency. moreover, it is not uncommon for such matters to be resolved over many years, during which time relevant developments and new information must be continuously evaluated to determine both the likelihood of potential loss and whether it is possible to reasonably estimate a range of possible loss. when a loss is probable but a reasonable estimate cannot be made, disclosure is provided.
disclosure also is provided when it is reasonably possible that a loss will be incurred or when it is reasonably possible that the amount of a loss will exceed the recorded provision. we regularly review all contingencies to determine whether the likelihood of loss has changed and to assess whether a reasonable estimate of the loss or range of loss can be made. as discussed above, development of a meaningful estimate of loss or a range of potential loss is complex when the outcome is directly dependent on negotiations with or decisions by third parties, such as regulatory agencies, the court system and other interested parties. such factors bear directly on whether it is possible to reasonably estimate a range of potential loss and boundaries of high and low estimates.
further information is provided in notes 2, 13 and 22 to the consolidated financial statements.
other items new accounting standards in may 2014, the financial accounting standards board (fasb) issued accounting standards update (asu) 2014-09, revenue from contracts with customers, which requires an entity to recognize the amount of revenue to which it expects to be entitled for the transfer of promised goods or services to customers. the asu will replace most existing revenue recognition guidance in gaap when it becomes effective. in july 2015, the fasb approved a one-year deferral of this standard, with a revised effective date for fiscal years beginning after december 15, 2017. early adoption is permitted, although not prior to fiscal years beginning after december 15, 2016. the standard permits the use of either the retrospective or modified retrospective (cumulative effect) transition method. we are evaluating the effect that asu 2014-09 will have on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. we have not yet selected a transition method and continue to evaluate the effect of the standard on our ongoing financial reporting.
in february 2015, the fasb issued asu 2015-02, amendments to the consolidation analysis. the asu amends the consolidation guidance for vies and general partners' investments in limited partnerships and modifies the evaluation of whether limited partnerships and similar legal entities are vies or voting interest entities. upon adoption of the amendment on january 1, 2016, we will deconsolidate certain entities where we no longer meet the definition of primary beneficiary under the revised guidance. the effect of deconsolidation on total assets and liabilities, net of our investment in these entities, is expected to be immaterial. we do not expect to consolidate any incremental entities as a result of adoption. as a result of the modified evaluation of whether limited partnerships and similar legal entities are vies or voting interest entities, we will have incremental disclosure of unconsolidated vies.
in september 2015, the fasb issued asu 2015-16, simplifying the accounting for measurement-period adjustments. the asu eliminates the requirement for an acquirer in a business combination to account for measurement-period adjustments retrospectively. the asu is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after december 15, 2015, with early adoption permitted. the effect that the asu will have on our consolidated financial statements will be dependent upon any measurement-period adjustments identified in future periods.
environmental matters our operations, like operations of other companies engaged in similar businesses, involve the use, disposal and cleanup of substances regulated under environmental protection laws. we are involved in a number of remediation actions to clean up hazardous wastes as required by federal and state laws. such statutes require that responsible parties fund remediation actions regardless of fault, legality of original disposal or ownership of a disposal site. expenditures for site remediation actions amounted to approximately $0.3 billion in 2015 and approximately $0.4 billion in each of the years 2014 and 2013. we presently expect that such remediation actions will require average annual expenditures of about $0.3 billion in 2016 and $0.2 billion in 2017.
in 2006, we entered into a consent decree with the environmental protection agency (epa) to dredge pcb-containing sediment from the upper hudson river. the consent decree provided that the dredging would be performed in two phases. phase 1 was completed in may through november of 2009. following phase 1, the epa conducted a peer review of the project, made modifications and ge agreed to perform phase 2. we increased our reserve by $0.8 billion in the fourth quarter of 2010 to account for the probable and estimable costs of completing phase 2. between 2012 and 2015, ge completed phase 2 and the epa confirms that all dredging has been performed in accordance with the aforementioned consent decree. as of december 31, 2015, the company retains sufficient reserves to address remaining operations and management obligations required for all post-dredging work.
as previously reported, in 2000, ge and the epa entered into a consent decree relating to pcb cleanup of the housatonic river in massachusetts. in 2012, the epa issued a status report describing potential conceptual approaches to a 10-mile stretch of the river downstream from a previously remediated area. in september 2015, the epa released an intended final decision for the so called "rest of river". this is not the epa's final decision, rather, the consent decree provides for discussions and a detailed dispute resolution process between ge and the epa, after which the epa will issue its final decision. as of december 31, 2015, and based on its assessment of current facts and circumstances, ge believes that it has recorded adequate reserves to cover future obligations associated with an expected final remedy.

supplemental information financial measures that supplement u.s. generally accepted accounting principles measures (non-gaap financial measures)
we sometimes use information derived from consolidated financial information but not presented in our financial statements prepared in accordance with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles (gaap). certain of these data are considered "non-gaap financial measures" under u.s. securities and exchange commission rules. specifically, we have referred, in various sections of this report, to:
   industrial segment organic revenue growth
   oil &amp; gas organic revenue and operating profit growth
   operating and non-operating pension costs (income)
   adjusted corporate costs (operating)
   ge pre-tax earnings from continuing operations, excluding ge capital earnings from continuing operations and the corresponding effective tax rates, and the reconciliation of the u.s. federal statutory income tax rate to ge effective tax rate, excluding ge capital earnings
   operating earnings, operating eps and industrial operating earnings
   industrial operating + verticals earnings and eps
   industrial operating profit and operating margin (excluding alstom)
   industrial segment operating profit and operating margin (excluding alstom)
   average ge shareowners' equity, excluding effects of discontinued operations
   average ge capital shareowners' equity, excluding effects of discontinued operations
   industrial return on total capital (industrial rotc)
   industrial cash flows from operating activities (industrial cfoa)
   ratio of adjusted debt to equity at ge capital, net of liquidity
   capital ending net investment (eni), excluding liquidity
   ge capital tier 1 common ratio estimate
the reasons we use these non-gaap financial measures and the reconciliations to their most directly comparable gaap financial measures follow.

organic revenue growth measures revenue excluding the effects of acquisitions, business dispositions and currency exchange rates. we believe that this measure provides management and investors with a more complete understanding of underlying operating results and trends of established, ongoing operations by excluding the effect of acquisitions, dispositions and currency exchange, which activities are subject to volatility and can obscure underlying trends. we also believe that presenting organic revenue growth separately for our industrial businesses provides management and investors with useful information about the trends of our industrial businesses and enables a more direct comparison to other non-financial businesses and companies. management recognizes that the term "organic revenue growth" may be interpreted differently by other companies and under different circumstances. although this may have an effect on comparability of absolute percentage growth from company to company, we believe that these measures are useful in assessing trends of the respective businesses or companies and may therefore be a useful tool in assessing period-to-period performance trends.

organic revenue and operating profit growth measure revenue and profit excluding the effects of acquisitions, business dispositions and currency exchange rates. we believe that these measures provide management and investors with a more complete understanding of underlying operating results and trends of established, ongoing operations by excluding the effect of acquisitions, dispositions and currency exchange, which activities are subject to volatility and can obscure underlying trends. management recognizes that the terms "organic revenue growth" and "organic operating profit growth" may be interpreted differently by other companies and under different circumstances. although this may have an effect on comparability of absolute percentage growth from company to company, we believe that these measures are useful in assessing trends of the oil & gas business and may therefore be a useful tool in assessing period-to-period performance trends.

we have provided the operating and non-operating components of cost for our principal pension plans. operating pension cost comprise the service cost of benefits earned, prior service cost amortization and curtailment loss for our principal pension plans. non-operating pension cost comprise the expected return on plan assets, interest cost on benefit obligations and net actuarial loss amortization for our principal pension plans. we believe that the operating components of pension cost better reflects the ongoing service-related cost of providing pension benefits to our employees. we believe that the operating and non-operating components of cost for our principal pension plans, considered along with the corresponding gaap measure, provide management and investors with additional information for comparison of our pension plan cost and operating results with the pension plan cost and operating results of other companies.

operating corporate costs exclude non-service-related pension costs of our principal pension plans, which comprise interest costs, expected return on plan assets and amortization of actuarial gains/losses.  service cost, prior service cost and curtailment loss components of our principal pension plans are included in operating corporate costs.  we believe that these components of pension cost better reflect the ongoing service-related costs of providing pension benefits to our employees.  accordingly, we believe that our measure of operating corporate costs provides management and investors with a useful measure of the operational costs incurred outside of our businesses.  we believe that this measure, considered along with the corresponding gaap measure, provides management and investors with additional information for comparison of our operating corporate costs to the operating corporate costs of other companies.
we also believe that adjusting operating corporate costs to exclude the effects of items that are not closely associated with ongoing corporate operations, such as earnings of previously divested businesses, gains and losses on disposed and held for sale businesses, restructuring and other charges, and a settlement provides management and investors with a meaningful measure that increases the period-to-period comparability of our ongoing corporate costs.

we believe that the ge effective tax rate is best analyzed in relation to ge earnings before income taxes excluding the ge capital net earnings from continuing operations, as ge tax expense does not include taxes on ge capital earnings. management believes that in addition to the consolidated and ge capital tax rates shown in note 14 to the consolidated financial statements, this supplemental measure provides investors with useful information as it presents the ge effective tax rate that can be used in comparing the ge results to other non-financial services businesses.

operating earnings excludes non-service-related pension costs of our principal pension plans comprising interest cost, expected return on plan assets and amortization of actuarial gains/losses. the service cost, prior service cost and curtailment loss components of our principal pension plans are included in operating earnings. we believe that these components of pension cost better reflect the ongoing service-related costs of providing pension benefits to our employees. as such, we believe that our measure of operating earnings provides management and investors with a useful measure of the operational results of our business. other components of gaap pension cost are mainly driven by capital allocation decisions and market performance, and we manage these separately from the operational performance of our businesses. neither gaap nor operating pension costs are necessarily indicative of the current or future cash flow requirements related to our pension plan. we also believe that this measure, considered along with the corresponding gaap measure, provides management and investors with additional information for comparison of our operating results to the operating results of other companies. we believe that presenting operating earnings separately for our industrial businesses also provides management and investors with useful information about the relative size of our industrial and financial services businesses in relation to the total company.

our industrial rotc calculation excludes earnings (losses) of discontinued operations from the numerator because gaap requires us to display those earnings (losses) in the statement of earnings. those earnings (losses) from discontinued operations include an allocation of interest expense either directly attributable or related to discontinued operations. net investment in discontinued operations is calculated as assets of discontinued operations less liabilities of discontinued operations, including an allocation of ge capital debt. our calculation of average ge shareowners' equity may not be directly comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. we believe that it is a clearer way to measure the ongoing trend in return on total capital for the continuing operations of our businesses given the extent that discontinued operations have affected our reported results. we believe that this results in a more relevant measure for management and investors to evaluate performance of our continuing operations, on a consistent basis, and to evaluate and compare the performance of our continuing operations with the ongoing operations of other businesses and companies.

our industrial rotc calculation excludes earnings (losses) of discontinued operations from the numerator. we believe that this is a clearer way to measure the ongoing trend in return on industrial capital for the continuing operations of the business to the extent that discontinued operations have affected our reported results. our industrial shareowners' equity used in the denominator is adjusted for debt, redeemable noncontrolling interests, noncontrolling interests and the estimated value of assets held by the ge parent to support ge capital. we believe that these adjustments provide a more meaningful denominator in measuring the return on our industrial businesses. industrial rotc was 16.9% in 2015 versus 14.0% in 2014 and 14.3% in 2013. in 2015, a 19% increase in the adjusted industrial return was combined with a 1% decrease in the adjusted industrial capital. this decrease in capital was principally driven by share buybacks and foreign currency translation exposure due to the strengthening u.s dollar. our calculation of the return on industrial capital may not be directly comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. we believe that the adjustments described above result in a more relevant measure for management and investors to evaluate performance of our industrial continuing operations, on a consistent basis, and to evaluate and compare the performance of our industrial continuing operations with the continuing operations of other businesses and companies.
industrial cash flows from operating activities (industrial cfoa)
cash from ge's operating activities, as reported                     $16,354                       $15,171                       $14,255
less dividends from ge capital                                         4,300                         3,000                         5,985
cash from ge's operating activities, excluding dividends from ge capital (industrial cfoa)                                    $12,054                       $12,171                        $8,270
we refer to cash generated by our industrial businesses as "industrial cfoa," which we define as ge's cash from continuing operating activities less the amount of dividends received by ge from ge capital. this includes the effects of intercompany transactions, including ge customer receivables sold to ge capital; ge capital services for trade receivables management and material procurement; buildings and equipment (including automobiles) leased between ge and ge capital; information technology (it) and other services sold to ge capital by ge; aircraft engines manufactured by ge that are installed on aircraft purchased by ge capital from third-party producers for lease to others; and various investments, loans and allocations of ge corporate overhead costs. we believe that investors may find it useful to compare ge's operating cash flows without the effect of ge capital dividends, since these dividends are not representative of the operating cash flows of our industrial businesses and can vary from period-to-period based upon the results of the financial services businesses. management recognizes that these measures may not be comparable to cash flow results of companies that contain both industrial and financial services businesses, but believes that this comparison is aided by the provision of additional information about the amounts of dividends paid by our financial services business and the separate presentation in our financial statements of the financial services (ge capital) cash flows. we believe that our measures of industrial cfoa provide management and investors with useful measures to compare the capacity of our industrial operations to generate operating cash flows with the operating cash flows of other non-financial businesses and companies and as such provide useful measures to supplement the reported gaap cfoa measure.
cash from ge's operating activities (continuing operations)                            $16,354            $15,171            $14,255
plus ge dispositions of property, plant and equipment                                      939                615                381
plus ge proceeds from principal business dispositions                                    1,725                602              1,316
we define free cash flow as ge's cash from operating activities (continuing operations) less ge additions to property, plant and equipment and plus ge dispositions of property, plant and equipment, which are included in cash flows from investing activities. we believe that free cash flow is a useful financial metric to assess our ability to pursue opportunities to enhance our growth. we also believe that presenting free cash flow separately for our industrial businesses provides management and investors with useful information about the trends of our industrial businesses and enables a more direct comparison to other non-financial businesses and companies. we also believe that presenting free cash flow plus proceeds from business dispositions provides investors with useful information about the company's actual performance against performance targets. management recognizes that the term free cash flow may be interpreted differently by other companies and under different circumstances. although this may have an effect on comparability of absolute percentage growth from company to company, we believe that these measures are useful in assessing trends of the respective businesses or companies and may therefore be a useful tool in assessing period-to-period performance trends.
ratio of adjusted debt to equity at ge capital, net of liquidity

(a)   liquidity includes cash and equivalents and $10.4 billion of high quality interest bearing deposits at december 31, 2015.
we have provided the ge capital ratio of debt to equity on a basis that reflects the use of liquidity as a reduction of debt. for purposes of this ratio, we have also adjusted cash and debt balances to include amounts classified as assets and liabilities of businesses held for sale and discontinued operations. we believe that this is a useful comparison to a gaap-based ratio of debt to equity because liquidity balances may be used to reduce debt. the usefulness of this supplemental measure may be limited, however, as the total amount of liquidity at any point in time may be different than the amount that could practically be applied to reduce outstanding debt. despite this potential limitation, we believe that this measure, considered along with the corresponding gaap measure, provides investors with additional information that may be more comparable to other financial institutions and businesses.

(b)   liquidity includes cash and equivalents and $10.4 billion of high quality interest bearing deposits at december 31, 2015.
we use eni to measure the size of our capital segment. we believe that this measure is a useful indicator of the capital (debt or equity) required to fund a business as it adjusts for non-interest bearing current liabilities generated in the normal course of business that do not require a capital outlay. we also believe that by excluding liquidity, we provide a meaningful measure of assets requiring capital to fund our capital segment as a substantial amount of liquidity resulted from debt issuances to pre-fund future debt maturities and will not be used to fund additional assets. liquidity consists of cash and equivalents and certain high quality interest bearing deposits. as a general matter, investments included in liquidity are expected to be highly liquid, giving us the ability to readily convert them to cash. providing this measure will help investors measure how we are performing against our previously communicated goal to reduce the size of our financial services business.
ge capital tier 1 common ratio estimate(a)
adjustments:
ge capital tier 1 common                           36.4              58.0
estimated risk-weighted assets(c)                 251.1             445.9
ge capital tier 1 common ratio estimate           14.5%             13.0%
(c)   based on basel 3 risk-weighted assets estimates.
the ge capital tier 1 common ratio estimate is the ratio of tier 1 common equity to total risk-weighted assets as calculated based on our interpretation of the standardized u.s. basel 3 capital rules on a transitional basis, which is subject to review and consultation with our regulators. as such, the methodology of calculating this ratio may be refined over time as we discuss its interpretation and application with our regulators. as of december 31, 2015, we are not required by our regulators to disclose this capital ratio, and therefore this capital ratio is considered a non-gaap financial measure. we believe that this estimated capital ratio is a useful measure to investors because it is widely used by analysts and regulators to assess the capital position of financial services companies.

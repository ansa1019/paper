item 7.   managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (md&amp;a)
executive overview business introduction we are a global services company with four reportable operating segments: u.s. card services (uscs), international card services (ics), global commercial services (gcs) and global network & merchant services (gnms). refer to business for a discussion of changes to our reportable operating segments, effective in the first quarter of 2016.
we provide our customers with access to products, insights and experiences that enrich lives and build business success. our principal products and services are charge and credit payment card products and travel-related services offered to consumers and businesses around the world. business travel-related services are offered through a non-consolidated joint venture, american express global business travel (gbt jv). prior to july 1, 2014, these business travel operations were wholly owned.
we compete in the global payments industry with charge, credit and debit card networks, issuers and acquirers, as well as evolving and growing alternative payment providers. as the payments industry continues to evolve, we face increasing competition from non-traditional players that leverage new technologies and customers existing accounts and relationships to create payment or other fee-based solutions.
our products and services are sold globally to diverse customer groups, including consumers, small businesses, mid-sized companies and large corporations. these products and services are sold through various channels, including direct mail, online applications, in-house and third-party sales forces and direct response advertising.
the following types of revenue are generated from our various products and services:
   discount revenue, our largest revenue source, which represents fees generally charged to merchants when card members use their cards to purchase goods and services at merchants on our network;
   travel commissions and fees, which are earned by charging a transaction or management fee to both customers and suppliers for travel-related transactions (business travel commissions and fees included through june 30, 2014);
   other commissions and fees, which are earned on foreign exchange conversions, card-related fees, such as late fees and assessments, loyalty coalition-related fees and other service fees;
                                                          other revenue, which represents revenues arising from contracts with partners of our global network services (gns) business (including commissions and signing fees), insurance premiums earned from card member travel and other insurance programs, prepaid card-related revenues, revenues related to the gbt jv transition services agreement, earnings from equity method investments
financial highlights for 2015, we reported net income of $5.2 billion and diluted earnings per share of $5.05. this compared to $5.9 billion of net income and $5.56 diluted earnings per share for 2014, and $5.4 billion of net income and $4.88 diluted earnings per share for 2013.
   a $419 million ($335 million after-tax) charge in the fourth quarter, related to enterprise growth (eg), that was driven primarily by the impairment of goodwill and technology, plus some restructuring costs.
   a $719 million ($453 million after-tax) gain on the sale of our investment in concur technologies (concur) in the fourth quarter;
   a $626 million ($409 million after-tax) gain as a result of the business travel joint venture transaction in the second quarter;
   $420 million ($277 million after-tax) of net charges for costs related to reengineering initiatives, including $313 million ($206 million after-tax) and $133 million ($90 million after-tax) of restructuring charges in the fourth and second quarter, respectively; and
   a $109 million ($68 million after-tax) charge related to the renewal of our partnership with delta air lines (delta) in the fourth quarter.
in addition, effective december 1, 2015, we transferred the card member loans and receivables related to our cobrand partnerships with costco wholesale corporation (costco) in the united states and jetblue airways corporation (jetblue) (the hfs portfolios) to card member loans and receivables held for sale (hfs) on the consolidated balance sheets. refer to note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.
non-gaap measures we prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america (gaap). however, certain information included within this report constitutes non-gaap financial measures. our calculations of non-gaap financial measures may differ from the calculations of similarly titled measures by other companies.
business environment our performance in 2015 reflected both the strength of our business and the headwinds we have been managing throughout the year. results for the year benefited from healthy loan growth, strong card acquisitions, excellent credit performance, disciplined operating expense control and the benefits of our strong capital position. our results were also challenged by several factors. first, the cumulative impact from the initial increased costs associated with early renewals of certain of our cobrand relationships and the end of our relationship with costco in canada negatively impacted our results. second, the u.s. dollar continued to strengthen as the year progressed. third, our decision to increase spending on growth initiatives for the year, consistent with the elevated levels of 2014, further pressured our 2015 earnings. fourth, the economic, regulatory, and competitive environments all became even more challenging as the year progressed.
the combination of these factors resulted in billings and revenue growth rates that were fairly steady throughout the year. billings did grow in 2015, although growth rates decelerated modestly during the second half of the year. international billed business continued to be strong versus the prior year after excluding canada (due to the termination of our relationship with costco canada last year) and adjusting for foreign currency exchange rates. in the united states, we saw softening in billings on the costco cobrand card, where volumes dropped versus the prior year. lower gas prices also continued to be a drag on billings. gcs billed business growth continued to slow due, in part, to lower airline volumes and a generally cautious corporate spending environment. our billings growth rates during the second half of 2016 will be impacted by the end of our relationship with costco in the united states, which is expected to occur around mid-year.
for the full year, discount revenue was down slightly versus the prior year driven in part by a decline in our discount rate due primarily to the continued rollout of optblue, and we anticipate that the discount rate will further decline by a greater amount during 2016, due to the continued expansion of optblue, a greater impact from international regulatory changes, and continued competitive pressures.
growth in net interest income remained strong during the year, driven by loan growth. card member loans held for investment were down in 2015 on a reported basis due to the transfer of the costco and jetblue loan portfolios to card member loans and receivables hfs, effective december 1, 2015. excluding the hfs portfolios from the prior year, worldwide loans increased. we expect to see strong growth in loans held for investment in 2016, and continue to believe there are opportunities to increase our share of lending without significantly changing our overall risk profile. our credit provision was down versus the prior year, as lending write-off rates remained at lower levels. we expect continued growth in loans will contribute to an increase in provisions; we also expect to see some upward pressure on our write-off rates, due primarily to the seasoning of loans related to new card members.
our capital position allowed us to return over $5 billion to our shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases, representing approximately 105 percent of total capital generated during the year, reflecting our ongoing commitment to using our capital strength to create value for our shareholders.
as mentioned above, we are now reporting the costco portfolio as hfs. we expect the sale to close around mid-year 2016 and that our merchant acceptance agreement will extend through the transaction close. the ultimate gain on sale will be determined based on the assets actually sold, but we currently estimate a gain of approximately $1 billion. we have not yet signed a definitive agreement and given that we are still several months away from the close, and the card member borrowing and paydown trends are difficult to predict in this type of transition, the final gain could differ from our estimate. we expect the portfolio sale gain will be partially used to fund spending on growth initiatives throughout 2016, resulting in some unevenness in our quarterly performance. as of december 31, 2015, costco cobrand accounts were responsible for approximately 19 percent of our worldwide card member loans held for investment and hfs (combined) and approximately 10 percent of our total cards-in-force. costco cobrand accounts generated approximately 8 percent of our worldwide billed business for the year ended december 31, 2015. approximately 70 percent of the spending on these accounts occurred outside costco warehouses. in addition, 1 percent of our worldwide billed business for the year ended december 31, 2015, came from spending on other (non-costco cobrand) american express cards at costco warehouses.
in an effort to accelerate and expand our cost control efforts to right size our cost base with the evolving business environment, we have launched, in the first quarter of 2016, cost initiatives that are designed to remove $1 billion from our overall cost base, which includes total operating expenses plus marketing and promotion costs, by the end of 2017. we plan to take action throughout 2016 to drive benefits in 2017 and beyond, which we expect will result in restructuring charges in 2016.
see legal, regulatory and compliance risk in risk factors for information on the potential impacts of an adverse decision in the department of justice (doj) case and related merchant litigations on our business. for discussion of certain legislative and regulatory changes that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition, see card-issuing business and deposit programs  regulation under u.s. card services, international card services  regulation, global commercial services  regulation, global network & merchant services  regulation and supervision and regulation in business.
consolidated results of operations as a result of the gbt jv transaction, we deconsolidated the global business travel net assets, effective june 30, 2014, resulting in a lack of comparability between the periods presented.
as mentioned previously, effective december 1, 2015, we transferred the card member loans and receivables related to the hfs portfolios (included in the uscs segment), to card member loans and receivables hfs on the consolidated balance sheets. the primary impacts beyond the hfs classification on the consolidated balance sheets are to provisions for losses and credit metrics, which no longer reflect amounts related to these loans and receivables, as credit costs are reported in other expenses through a valuation allowance adjustment. other, non-credit related metrics (i.e., billed business, cards-in-force, net interest yield), continue to reflect amounts related to the hfs portfolios. refer to note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.
the relative strengthening of the u.s. dollar over the periods of comparison has had an impact on our results of operations. where meaningful in describing our performance, foreign currency-adjusted amounts, which exclude the impact of changes in the foreign exchange (fx) rates, have been provided.

(a)                                      earnings per common share  diluted was reduced by the impact of (i) earnings allocated to participating share awards and other items of $38 million,
$46 million and $47 million for the years ended december 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively, and (ii) dividends on preferred shares of $62 million for the year ended december 31, 2015, and nil for both the years ended december 31, 2014 and 2013.
(c)                                            return on average tangible common equity (rotce), a non-gaap measure, is computed in the same manner as roe except the computation of average tangible common equity, a non-gaap measure, excludes from one-year average total shareholders equity, one-year average goodwill and other intangibles of $3.8 billion, $3.9 billion and $4.1 billion as of december 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively, and one-year average preferred shares of $1.6 billion, $0.7 billion and nil as of december 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively. we believe rotce is a useful measure of the profitability of our business.

total revenues net of interest expense            $32,818            $34,188            $32,870   $(1,370        )               (4   )%       $1,318                    4   %
total revenues net of interest expense discount revenue remained relatively flat in 2015 compared to 2014, and increased $798 million or 4 percent in 2014 compared to 2013, driven by 2 percent and 7 percent growth in billed business, respectively, offset by a decline in the average discount rate, faster growth in gns billings than in overall company billings, increases in contra-discount revenues, such as cash rebate rewards and higher payments during 2015 related to cobrand partnership agreements. u.s. billed business increased 5 percent, and non-u.s. billed business increased 8 percent on an fx-adjusted basis in 2015 compared to 2014, due to increases in average spending per proprietary basic card and basic cards-in-force.1
the average discount rate was 2.46 percent, 2.48 percent and 2.51 percent for 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. the decrease in the average discount rate in 2015 compared to 2014 was driven, in part, by growth of the optblue program to expand card acceptance by u.s. small merchants, changes in industry mix and competition, partially offset by the decline in costco merchant volume in canada (which was at a lower discount rate than the average) due to the expiration of our merchant agreement. the average discount rate will likely decline by a greater amount during 2016 due to the continued expansion of optblue, a greater impact from international regulatory changes and continued competitive pressures. overall, changes in the mix of spending by location and industry, merchant incentives and concessions, volume related pricing discounts, strategic investments, certain pricing initiatives, competition, pricing regulation (including regulation of competitors interchange rates) and other factors will likely result in continued erosion of our discount rate over time. see tables 5 and 6 for more details on billed business performance and the average discount rate.
net card fees remained relatively flat in 2015 compared to 2014 and increased $81 million or 3 percent in 2014 compared to 2013, while fx-adjusted net card fees increased 5 percent in both periods.1 the increases in both years on an fx-adjusted basis were primarily driven by higher average proprietary cards-in-force. the current year increase also reflects a benefit from certain pricing initiatives.
travel commissions and fees decreased $769 million or 69 percent in 2015 compared to 2014 and $795 million or 42 percent in 2014 compared to 2013. the decreases in both years were primarily due to the business travel joint venture transaction, resulting in a lack of comparability between periods.
other revenues decreased $956 million or 32 percent in 2015 compared to 2014 and increased $715 million or 31 percent in 2014 compared to 2013. the decrease in the current year was primarily driven by prior-year gains related to the sales of investment securities in concur, and the sales of investment securities in industrial and commercial bank of china. the increase in the prior year was primarily driven by the gains on the sales of our investment securities in concur, revenues earned related to the gbt jv transition services agreement, and higher loyalty edge revenues, partially offset by the loss of revenue from the publishing business, which was sold in the fourth quarter of 2013.
interest income increased $366 million or 5 percent in 2015 compared to 2014, and $174 million or 2 percent in 2014 compared to 2013. the increase in both years primarily reflects higher average card member loans, partially offset by decreases in interest and dividends on investment securities, driven by lower average investment securities.
interest expense decreased $84 million or 5 percent in 2015 compared to 2014, and $251 million or 13 percent in 2014 compared to 2013. the decrease in both years was primarily driven by a lower cost of funds on debt and customer deposits, partially offset by increases in average customer deposit balances.
1                                                           the foreign currency adjusted information assumes a constant exchange rate between the periods being compared for purposes of currency translation into u.s. dollars (e.g., assumes the foreign exchange rates used to determine results for the current year apply to the corresponding year period against which such results are being compared). certain amounts included in the calculations of foreign currency-adjusted revenues and expenses, which constitute non-gaap measures, are subject to management allocations. we believe the presentation of information on a foreign currency adjusted basis is helpful to investors by making it easier to compare our performance in one period to that of another period without the variability caused by fluctuations in currency exchange rates.

provisions for losses charge card provision for losses decreased $55 million or 7 percent in 2015 compared to 2014, and increased $144 million or 22 percent in 2014 compared to 2013. the decrease in the current year primarily reflects a reserve release versus a reserve build in 2014, partially offset by higher write-offs. the increase in the prior year was primarily due to a slower reserve rate improvement in 2014 versus 2013, higher corporate card write-offs and the effects of changes in other loss reserve assumptions resulting in a reserve build versus a reserve release in 2013.
card member loans provision for losses increased $52 million or 5 percent in 2015 compared to 2014, and $23 million or 2 percent in 2014 compared to 2013. the increase in the current year primarily reflects a reserve build versus a reserve release in 2014. the reserve build in the current year was due to a small increase in delinquency rates combined with an increase in loan balances, partially offset by lower write-offs and the impact related to transferring the hfs portfolios to card member loans and receivables hfs, as related credit costs are reported in other expenses through a valuation allowance adjustment beginning in december 2015. the increase in the prior year was driven by higher average card member loans, a slower improvement in the reserve rate and the effects of changes in other loss reserve assumptions resulting in a lower reserve release compared to 2013, partially offset by the benefit of lower net write-offs due to improved credit performance.
other provision for losses decreased $53 million or 46 percent in 2015 compared to 2014 and increased $45 million or 65 percent in 2014 compared to 2013. the decrease in the current year and increase in the prior year were due, in part, to a merchant-related charge in the fourth quarter of 2014.

(a)   effective december 1, 2015, other, net includes the valuation allowance adjustment associated with the hfs portfolios.
expenses marketing and promotion expenses decreased $107 million or 3 percent (although they increased 1 percent on an fx-adjusted basis) in 2015 compared to 2014 and increased $277 million or 9 percent in 2014 compared to 2013.2 both periods reflect elevated levels of spending on growth initiatives.
card member rewards expenses increased $65 million or 1 percent in 2015 compared to 2014, and $474 million or 7 percent in 2014 compared to 2013. the current year increase was primarily driven by higher cobrand rewards expense of $199 million, driven by rate impacts as a result of cobrand partnership renewal costs, partially offset by a decrease in membership rewards expense of $134 million. the latter was primarily driven by slower growth in the ultimate redemption rate (urr) and a decline in the weighted average cost (wac) per point assumption, including
2   refer to footnote 1 on page 55 for details regarding foreign currency adjusted information.
the impact of the $109 million charge in the fourth quarter of 2014 related to the delta partnership renewal, partially offset by increased expenses related to new points earned, driven by higher spending volumes.
the prior year increase was primarily due to higher membership rewards expense of $263 million, driven by a $266 million increase related to new points earned, in line with higher spending volumes, and a higher wac per point assumption, including the impact of the previously mentioned charge related to the delta partnership renewal; these increases were offset by slower average growth in the urr. cobrand rewards expense increased $211 million in 2014 compared to 2013, primarily driven by higher spending volumes.
card member services and other expenses increased $196 million or 24 percent in 2015 compared to 2014 and increased $55 million or 7 percent in 2014 compared to 2013. the increase in the current year was primarily due to higher costs related to certain previously renewed cobrand partnership agreements. the increase in the prior year was primarily driven by increased engagement levels and use of certain card member benefits, as well as american express-branded airport lounges opened in 2014.
salaries and employee benefits expenses decreased $1.1 billion or 18 percent in 2015 compared to 2014, and $96 million or 2 percent in 2014 compared to 2013. the decrease in both years was primarily due to the business travel joint venture transaction (resulting in a lack of comparability between periods). the decrease in the current year was also driven by restructuring charges in the second and fourth quarters of 2014 and lower compensation costs in 2015 as a result of those initiatives. in 2014, compared to 2013, those restructuring charges partially offset the impact of the business travel joint venture transaction.
other expenses increased $704 million or 12 percent in 2015 compared to 2014 and decreased $707 million or 10 percent in 2014 compared to 2013. the increase in the current year reflects the net gain from the 2014 business travel joint venture transaction, partially offset by the eg charge discussed previously. refer to note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for further details on the charge. the decrease in the prior year was primarily driven by the gain from the business travel joint venture transaction (resulting in a lack of comparability between periods), and a charge in 2013 related to the rejected merchant litigation settlement. see legal proceedings for further information on this merchant litigation.
income taxes the effective tax rate was 35.0 percent in 2015 compared to 34.5 percent in 2014 and 32.1 percent in 2013. the tax rates for 2015, 2014, and 2013 include benefits of $33 million, expenses of $40 million and benefits of $150 million, respectively, related to the resolution of certain prior years items. the tax rate for 2015 also includes the impact of the nondeductible portion of the goodwill impairment charge in eg. the tax rates for all periods reflect the level of pretax income in relation to recurring permanent tax benefits and geographic mix of business.

card billed business: (billions)
(a)                                                 in the three months ended march 31, 2015, we changed the classification related to certain payments to partners, reducing both discount revenue and marketing and promotion expense. the misclassification in prior periods has been revised to conform to the current period presentation. accordingly, the average discount rate for prior periods was also revised, resulting in a reduction of between zero and one basis point in any period from what was originally reported.
(b)                                               average basic card member spending and average fee per card are computed from proprietary card activities only. average fee per card is computed based on net card fees, including the amortization of deferred direct acquisition costs divided by average worldwide proprietary cards-in-force. the average fee per card, adjusted, which is a non-gaap measure, is computed in the same manner, but excludes amortization of deferred direct acquisition costs. the amount of amortization excluded was $283 million, $306 million and $262 million for the years ended december 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. we present the average fee per card, adjusted, because we believe this metric presents a useful indicator of card fee pricing across a range of our proprietary card products.

(f)                                              we present a net write-off rate based on principal losses only (i.e., excluding interest and/or fees) to be consistent with industry convention. in addition, because we consider uncollectible interest and/or fees in our reserves for credit losses, a net write-off rate including principal, interest and/or fees is also presented. the twelve months ended december 31, 2015 reflect the impact of a change in the timing of charge-offs for card member receivables and loans in certain modification programs from 180 days past due to 120 days past due.
(a)                                             adjusted net interest income, adjusted average loans, and net interest yield on card member loans are non-gaap measures. refer to glossary of selected terminology for definitions of these terms. we believe adjusted net interest income and adjusted average loans are useful to investors because they are components of net interest yield on card member loans, which provides a measure of profitability of our card member loan portfolio.
(b)   for purposes of the calculation of net interest yield on card member loans, average loans continues to include the hfs loan portfolios.
business segment results we consider a combination of factors when evaluating the composition of our reportable operating segments, including the results reviewed by the chief operating decision maker, economic characteristics, products and services offered, classes of customers, product distribution channels, geographic considerations (primarily united states versus outside the united states) and regulatory considerations. refer to note 25 of the consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of the products and services by segment.
in light of the organizational changes discussed under business, our financial disclosures will reflect segment changes starting in the first quarter of 2016. this overview discusses the operating segments used for financial reporting in 2015.
results of the business segments generally treat each segment as a stand-alone business. the management reporting process that derives these results allocates revenue and expense using various methodologies as described below.
total revenues net of interest expense we allocate discount revenue and certain other revenues among segments using a transfer pricing methodology. within the uscs, ics and gcs segments, discount revenue generally reflects the issuer component of the overall discount revenue generated by each segments card members; within the gnms segment, discount revenue generally reflects the network and acquirer component of the overall discount revenue. net card fees and travel commissions and fees are directly attributable to the segment in which they are reported.
interest and fees on loans and certain investment income is directly attributable to the segment in which it is reported. interest expense represents an allocated funding cost based on a combination of segment funding requirements and internal funding rates.
expenses marketing and promotion expenses are included in each segment based on actual expenses incurred, with the exception of brand advertising, which is primarily reflected in the gnms and uscs segments. rewards and card member services expenses are included in each segment based on actual expenses incurred within each segment.
salaries and employee benefits and other operating expenses reflect expenses such as professional services, occupancy and equipment and communications incurred directly within each segment. in addition, expenses related to support services, such as technology costs, are allocated to each segment primarily based on support service activities directly attributable to the segment. other overhead expenses, such as staff group support functions, are allocated from corporate & other to the other segments based on a mix of each segments direct consumption of services and relative level of pretax income.
capital each business segment is allocated capital based on established business model operating requirements, risk measures and regulatory capital requirements. the business model operating requirements reflect the capital needed to support operations and specific balance sheet items. the risk measures reflect considerations for credit, market and operational risk.
income taxes an income tax provision (benefit) is allocated to each business segment based on the effective tax rates applicable to the various businesses that comprise the segment.

uscs offers a wide range of card products and services to consumers and small businesses in the united states, provides travel services to card members and other consumers, and operates a coalition loyalty business.
total revenues net of interest expense non-interest revenues increased $552 million or 4 percent in 2015 compared to 2014, driven by 6 percent growth in billed business, partially offset by a decline in the average discount rate and increases in contra-discount revenues, such as cash rebate rewards from new card member acquisition offers and payments under previously renewed cobrand partnership agreements. the increase in billed business was primarily driven by 6 percent higher cards-in-force and a 1 percent increase in average spending per proprietary basic card.
net interest income increased $481 million or 8 percent in 2015 compared to 2014, due to higher interest income resulting from higher average card member loans, partially offset by higher interest expense.
total revenues net of interest expense increased $919 million or 5 percent in 2014 compared to 2013, primarily driven by higher discount revenue, as a result of 8 percent growth in billed business, partially offset by a decrease in the average discount rate and higher cash rebate rewards. the increase also reflected higher net interest income, primarily driven by higher average card member loans and lower funding costs.
provisions for losses overall, provisions for losses increased $57 million or 4 percent in 2015 compared to 2014. charge card provision for losses decreased $31 million or 7 percent, primarily due to a reserve release in 2015 versus a reserve build in 2014, partially offset by higher write-off rates. card member loans provision for losses increased $88 million or 9 percent, driven by a higher reserve build in the current year, versus a reserve release in 2014, due to a small increase in delinquency rates combined with an increase in loan balances, partially offset by lower net write-offs and the impact related to transferring the hfs portfolios to card member loans and receivables hfs, as credit costs related to the hfs portfolios are reported in other expenses through a valuation allowance adjustment beginning in december 2015.
provisions for losses increased $146 million in 2014 compared to 2013, primarily due to higher average card member loans, a slower reserve rate improvement and a lower reserve release in 2014, partially offset by the benefit of lower net write-offs for card member loans.
refer to table 10 for the charge card and lending write-off rates for 2015, 2014 and 2013.
expenses marketing, promotion, rewards, card member services and other expenses increased $579 million or 8 percent in 2015 compared to 2014, driven in part by a $233 million or 5 percent increase in card member rewards expense. the increase in rewards costs was driven by higher cobrand rewards expenses of $252 million, partially offset by a decrease in membership rewards expense of $19 million. the increase in cobrand rewards expense was driven by higher spending volumes and rate increases, which were due in part to the previously renewed cobrand partnership agreements. the decrease in membership rewards expense was primarily driven by slower growth in the urr and a decline in the wac per point assumption, including the impact of a $96 million charge in the fourth quarter of 2014 related to the delta partnership renewal, partially offset by higher spending volumes. card member services and other expenses increased $207 million or 42 percent in 2015 compared to 2014, primarily driven by higher costs related to renewed cobrand partnership agreements. marketing and promotion increased $139 million or 9 percent in 2015 compared to 2014, reflecting elevated levels of spending on growth initiatives.
salaries and employee benefits and other operating expenses increased $92 million or 2 percent in 2015, compared to 2014, primarily driven by higher spending on growth initiatives and the december 2015 valuation allowance adjustment related to the hfs portfolios mentioned previously, partially offset by lower fraud losses in the current year and a change in the estimated value of certain investments in our community reinvestment act (cra) portfolio in the prior year.
total expenses increased $667 million in 2014 compared to 2013, primarily driven by higher marketing and promotion expenses, higher cobrand rewards expenses related to higher spending volumes and an increase in membership rewards expense, which was due to higher new points earned and a higher wac per point assumption, including the impact of the previously mentioned charge related to the delta partnership renewal. the increase also reflected higher salaries and employee benefits and other expenses, driven by an increase in card-related fraud losses, a change in the estimated value of certain investments in our cra portfolio and higher restructuring charges in 2014.

calculation of net interest yield on card member loans:
(a)   as of september 30, 2015, and prospectively, certain intercompany balances have been reclassified between operating segments, as a result of systems enhancements.
(b)                                                return on average segment capital is calculated by dividing (i) one-year period segment income ($3.4 billion for 2015 and $3.2 billion for both 2014 and
2013), by (ii) one-year average segment capital ($10.5 billion, $9.8 billion and $9.0 billion for 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively). return on average tangible segment capital, a non-gaap measure, is computed in the same manner as return on average segment capital except the computation excludes from average segment capital average goodwill and other intangibles of $395 million, $319 million and $334 million as of december 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. we believe return on average tangible segment capital is a useful measure of the profitability of our business.

ics offers a wide range of card products and services to consumers and small businesses outside the united states, provides travel services to card members and other consumers, and operates a coalition loyalty business in various countries.
total revenues net of interest expense non-interest revenues decreased $416 million or 9 percent in 2015 compared to 2014, and fx-adjusted non-interest revenues increased 5 percent, primarily driven by net foreign exchange fees and spread revenue on cross-border card member spending, higher net card fees and revenue from our loyalty partner business.3 billed business decreased 10 percent in 2015 compared to 2014, while fx-adjusted billed business increased 3 percent, primarily due to higher average card member spending per card, partially offset by lower cards-in-force in canada driven by the termination of our relationship with costco in that country.3 refer to tables 5 and 6 for additional information on billed business by region.
interest income decreased $146 million or 13 percent (and remained flat on an fx-adjusted basis), in 2015 compared to 2014, primarily driven by lower average loans as a result of the termination of our relationship with costco in canada, offset by a higher net interest yield. 3
interest expense decreased $88 million or 27 percent in 2015 compared to 2014, primarily driven by lower funding costs, as a result of lower average loans.
total revenues net of interest expense increased $91 million or 2 percent in 2014 compared to 2013, primarily driven by higher loyalty partner-related fees, higher discount revenue and an increase in net card fees.
provisions for losses provisions for losses decreased $41 million or 11 percent (4 percent increase on an fx-adjusted basis) in 2015, compared to 2014, and decreased $18 million or 5 percent (1 percent on an fx-adjusted basis) in 2014 compared to 2013.3 refer to table 12 for card member receivables and loans write-off rates for 2015, 2014 and 2013.
expenses marketing, promotion, rewards, card member services and other expenses decreased $217 million or 10 percent in 2015 compared to 2014, but increased 3 percent on an fx-adjusted basis, reflecting elevated levels of spending on growth initiatives, primarily in marketing.3

salaries and employee benefits and other operating expenses decreased $275 million or 11 percent in 2015 compared to 2014, primarily due to restructuring charges in 2014.
total expenses increased $303 million or 7 percent in 2014 compared to 2013, primarily driven by higher marketing and promotion expenses, higher loyalty partner expenses and higher restructuring charges in 2014.
income taxes the effective tax rate in all periods reflects the recurring permanent tax benefit related to the segments ongoing funding activities outside the united states, in relation to the levels of pretax income. the benefit is allocated to ics under our internal tax allocation process. the effective tax rates for 2015 and 2013 also include the allocated share of tax benefits related to the resolution of certain prior-years items. in addition, the effective tax rate in each of the periods reflects the impact of recurring permanent tax benefits on varying levels of pretax income.

gcs offers global corporate payment services to large and mid-sized companies. our business travel operations, which had been included in gcs, were deconsolidated effective june 30, 2014 in connection with the formation of the gbt jv, discussed previously. therefore, there is a lack of comparability against periods prior to the deconsolidation. our proportional share of the gbt jv net income or loss is reported within other revenues.
total revenues net of interest expense non-interest revenues decreased $1.7 billion or 32 percent in 2015 compared to 2014. the decrease was primarily due to the gain on the sale of our investment in concur in 2014 and the impact of the business travel joint venture transaction (resulting in a lack of comparability between periods). billed business decreased 2 percent in 2015 compared to 2014 and increased 2 percent on an fx-adjusted basis.4 billed business volume increased 2 percent within the united states and decreased 10 percent outside the united states. fx-adjusted billed business outside the united states increased 3 percent.4
total revenues net of interest expense increased $95 million or 2 percent in 2014 compared to 2013, primarily due to the gain on the sale of our investment in concur in 2014 and higher discount revenue from an increased level of card member spending, partially offset by the impact of the business travel joint venture transaction (resulting in a lack of comparability between periods).
provisions for losses provisions for losses decreased $32 million or 18 percent in 2015 compared to 2014, primarily driven by a lower charge card provision, resulting from a lower reserve build due to lower average card member receivables and lower net write-offs.
provisions for losses increased $51 million or 40 percent in 2014 compared to 2013, primarily driven by higher average card member receivables resulting in higher net write-offs. refer to table 14 for the charge card net loss ratio as a percentage of charge volume.
4   refer to footnote 1 on page 55 for details regarding foreign currency adjusted information.
expenses marketing, promotion, rewards, card member services and other expenses decreased $50 million or 7 percent in 2015 compared to 2014, primarily driven by lower card member rewards due to lower spending volumes and a $13 million charge related to the delta partnership renewal in the fourth quarter of 2014.
salaries and employee benefits and other operating expenses decreased $189 million or 11 percent in 2015 compared to 2014, primarily due to the impact of the business travel joint venture transaction (resulting in a lack of comparability between periods), partially offset by elevated level of spending on growth initiatives in 2015.
total expenses decreased $1.1 billion or 32 percent in 2014 compared to 2013, primarily due to the impact of the business travel joint venture transaction (resulting in a lack of comparability between periods), including the gain associated with the transaction in the second quarter of 2014, partially offset by transaction-related costs and restructuring charges.
income taxes the effective tax rate for 2015 reflects the impact of certain nondeductible foreign losses. the effective tax rate for 2013 reflects the reversal of a valuation allowance related to deferred tax assets associated with certain of our non-u.s. business travel operations, as well as the allocated share of tax benefits related to the resolution of certain prior-years tax items.

gnms operates a global payments network that processes and settles proprietary and non-proprietary card transactions. gnms acquires merchants; leverages our global closed-loop network to offer multi-channel marketing programs and capabilities, services and reporting and analytical data to our merchants around the world; and provides financing products for qualified merchants. it also enters into partnership agreements with third-party card issuers and acquirers to license the american express brand and broaden the card member and merchant base for our network worldwide.
total revenues net of interest expense non-interest revenues decreased $190 million or 4 percent in 2015 compared to 2014. fx-adjusted non-interest revenues increased 2 percent, primarily due to higher royalties from our gns bank partners and an increase in discount revenue driven by 2 percent growth in global worldwide card billed business.5
net interest income decreased $29 million or 9 percent in 2015 compared to 2014, due to a reduction in the interest expense credit, which was partially offset by higher interest income on our merchant financing loans. the interest expense credit relates to internal transfer pricing and funding rates, which resulted in a net benefit for gnms due to its merchant payables.
total revenues net of interest expense increased $234 million or 4 percent in 2014 compared to 2013, primarily due to higher merchant-related revenues as a result of global worldwide card billed business growth of 7 percent, and an increase in net interest income.
provisions for losses provisions for losses decreased $39 million or 42 percent in 2015 compared to 2014, and increased $26 million or 39 percent in 2014 compared to 2013. the change in both periods reflected a merchant-related charge in the fourth quarter of 2014.
expenses marketing, promotion, rewards, card member services and other expenses decreased $121 million or 15 percent in 2015 compared to 2014, primarily driven by the reinvestment of a significant portion of the gain from the business travel joint venture transaction in growth initiatives in the prior year.
salaries and employee benefits and other operating expenses decreased $214 million or 10 percent in 2015 compared to 2014, primarily driven by a litigation reserve release in the third quarter of 2015, associated with the rejected 2013 merchant litigation settlement, and a prior-year restructuring charge.
5   refer to footnote 1 on page 55 for details regarding foreign currency adjusted information.
total expenses increased $57 million or 2 percent in 2014 compared to 2013, primarily driven by the reinvestment of a significant portion of the gain from the business travel joint venture transaction in growth initiatives, partially offset by a charge in 2013 to reserve for the previously mentioned merchant litigation settlement.

(b)                                                return on average segment capital is calculated by dividing (i) one-year period segment income ($1.8 billion, $1.7 billion and $1.6 billion for 2015, 2014
and 2013, respectively) by (ii) one-year average segment capital ($2.3 billion, $2.0 billion and $2.1 billion for 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively). return on average tangible segment capital, a non-gaap measure, is computed in the same manner as return on average segment capital except the computation excludes from average segment capital average goodwill and other intangibles of $206 million, $189 million and $195 million as of december 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. we believe return on average tangible segment capital is a useful measure of the profitability of our business.
corporate & other corporate functions and certain other businesses, including eg and other operations, are included in corporate & other.
corporate & other net expense increased to $1.1 billion in 2015, compared to $929 million and $900 million in 2014 and 2013, respectively. the increase in net expense was driven by eg charges in the third and fourth quarter of 2015 of $91 million and $419 million, respectively. the third quarter charge of $91 million related to previously capitalized software development costs, while the fourth quarter charge of $419 million reflected a write-down in goodwill ($219 million) and technology and other ($165 million), plus restructuring charges ($35 million). these 2015 charges were partially offset by higher restructuring costs in 2014. refer to note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for further details on the fourth quarter eg impairment charges.
results for all periods disclosed also include net interest expense related to maintaining the liquidity pool discussed in consolidated capital resources and liquidity  liquidity management, as well as interest expense related to other corporate indebtedness.
consolidated capital resources and liquidity our balance sheet management objectives are to maintain:
   a solid and flexible equity capital profile;
   a broad, deep and diverse set of funding sources to finance our assets and meet operating requirements; and
              liquidity programs that enable us to continuously meet expected future financing obligations and business requirements for at least a 12-month period, even in the event we are unable to continue to raise new funds under our traditional funding programs during a substantial weakening in economic conditions.
capital strategy our objective is to retain sufficient levels of capital generated through earnings and other sources to maintain a solid equity capital base and to provide flexibility to support future business growth. we believe capital allocated to growing businesses with a return on risk-adjusted equity in excess of our costs will generate shareholder value.
the level and composition of our consolidated capital position are determined through our internal capital adequacy assessment process, which takes into account our business activities, as well as marketplace conditions and requirements or expectations of credit rating agencies, regulators and shareholders, among others. our consolidated capital position is also influenced by subsidiary capital requirements. as a bank holding company, we are also subject to regulatory requirements administered by the u.s. federal banking agencies. the federal reserve has established specific capital adequacy guidelines that involve quantitative measures of assets, liabilities and certain off-balance sheet items.
we report our capital ratios using the basel iii capital definitions, inclusive of transition provisions, and the basel iii standardized approach for calculating risk-weighted assets (see section on transitional basel iii). the basel iii standards will be fully phased-in by january 1, 2019 (see section on fully phased-in basel iii).
we also report capital adequacy standards on a parallel basis to regulators under basel requirements for advanced approaches institutions. the parallel period will continue until we receive regulatory approval to exit parallel reporting, at which point we will begin publicly disclosing regulatory risk-based capital ratios using both the standardized and advanced approaches, and will be required to use the lower of the regulatory risk-based capital ratios based on the standardized or advanced approaches to determine whether we are in compliance with minimum capital requirements.
the following table presents our regulatory risk-based capital ratios and leverage ratios and those of our significant bank subsidiaries, as well as additional ratios widely utilized in the marketplace, as of december 31, 2015.

2015, less preferred shares of $1.6 billion and goodwill and other intangibles of $3.5 billion, by risk-weighted assets of $135.2 billion. we believe presenting the ratio of tangible common equity to risk-weighted assets is a useful measure of evaluating the strength of our capital position. tangible common equity to risk-weighted assets ratio is widely used in the marketplace, although it may be calculated differently by different companies.

million. the $750 million of subordinated debentures have been fully transitioned out of capital as of january 1, 2016.
we seek to maintain capital levels and ratios in excess of the minimum regulatory requirements and finance such capital in a cost efficient manner; failure to maintain minimum capital levels could affect our status as a financial holding company and cause the respective regulatory agencies to take actions that could limit our business operations.
our primary source of equity capital has been the generation of net income. historically, capital generated through net income and other sources, such as the exercise of stock options by employees, has exceeded the annual growth in our capital requirements. to the extent capital has exceeded business, regulatory and rating agency requirements, we have historically returned excess capital to shareholders through our regular common share dividend and share repurchase program.
we maintain certain flexibility to shift capital across our businesses as appropriate. for example, we may infuse additional capital into subsidiaries to maintain capital at targeted levels in consideration of debt ratings and regulatory requirements. these infused amounts can affect the capital profile and liquidity levels at the american express parent company level. we do not currently intend or foresee a need to shift capital from non-u.s. subsidiaries with permanently reinvested earnings to a u.s. parent company.
the following are definitions for our regulatory risk-based capital ratios and leverage ratio, which are calculated as per standard regulatory guidance:
risk-weighted assets  assets are weighted for risk according to a formula used by the federal reserve to conform to capital adequacy guidelines. on- and off-balance sheet items are weighted for risk, with off-balance sheet items converted to balance sheet equivalents, using risk conversion factors, before being allocated a risk-adjusted weight. the off-balance sheet items comprise a minimal part of the overall calculation. risk-weighted assets under basel iii as of december 31, 2015 were $135.2 billion.
common equity tier 1 risk-based capital ratio  the common equity tier 1 risk-based capital ratio is calculated as common equity tier 1 capital, divided by risk-weighted assets. common equity tier 1 is the sum of common shareholders equity, adjusted for ineligible goodwill and intangible assets, certain deferred tax assets, as well as certain other comprehensive income items as follows: net unrealized gains/losses on securities and derivatives, and net unrealized pension and other postretirement benefit losses, all net of tax and subject to transition provisions. common equity tier 1 capital as of december 31, 2015 was $16.7 billion.
tier 1 risk-based capital ratio  the tier 1 capital ratio is calculated as tier 1 capital divided by risk-weighted assets. tier 1 capital is the sum of common equity tier 1 capital, our perpetual preferred stock and third-party non-controlling interests in consolidated subsidiaries adjusted for capital to be held by insurance subsidiaries and deferred tax assets from net operating losses not deducted from common equity tier 1 capital. tier 1 capital as of december 31, 2015 was $18.3 billion.
total risk-based capital ratio  the total risk-based capital ratio is calculated as the sum of tier 1 capital and tier 2 capital, divided by risk-weighted assets. tier 2 capital is the sum of the allowance for receivable and loan losses (limited to 1.25 percent of risk-weighted assets) a portion of the unrealized gains on equity securities, $600 million of subordinated notes issued in the fourth quarter of 2014 and $750 million of subordinated debentures adjusted for capital to be held by insurance subsidiaries. the $750 million of subordinated debentures do not meet the requirements of tier 2 capital under basel iii, and are being transitioned out of capital (the total amount included in tier 2 capital as of december 31, 2015 was $187 million). hence, the total amount of subordinated debt included in tier 2 capital as of december 31, 2015 was $787 million. tier 2 capital as of december 31, 2015 was $2.3 billion. the $750 million of subordinated debentures have been fully transitioned out of capital as of january 1, 2016. see fully phased-in basel iii section.
tier 1 leverage ratio  the tier 1 leverage ratio is calculated by dividing tier 1 capital by our average total consolidated assets for the most recent quarter. average total consolidated assets as of december 31, 2015 were $156.4 billion.
the following is a definition for tangible common equity to risk-weighted assets ratio, which is widely used in the marketplace, although it may be calculated differently by different companies:
common equity and tangible common equity to risk-weighted assets ratios  common equity equals our shareholders equity of $20.7 billion as of december 31, 2015, less preferred shares of $1.6 billion. tangible common equity, a non-gaap measure, equals common equity less goodwill and other intangibles of $3.5 billion as of december 31, 2015. we believe presenting the ratio of tangible common equity to risk-weighted assets is a useful measure of evaluating the strength of our capital position.
fully phased-in basel iii basel iii, when fully phased-in, will require bank holding companies and their bank subsidiaries to maintain more capital than prior requirements, with a greater emphasis on common equity. the following table presents our estimates for our regulatory risk-based capital ratios and leverage ratios had basel iii been fully phased-in as of december 31, 2015. these ratios are calculated using the standardized approach for determining risk-weighted assets. as noted previously, we are currently taking steps toward basel iii advanced approaches implementation in the united states. we believe the presentation of these ratios is helpful to investors by showing the impact of future regulatory capital standards on our capital and leverage ratios.

capital under fully phased-in basel iii rules, as applicable, divided by risk-weighted assets under fully phased-in basel iii rules. refer to table 20 for a reconciliation of common equity tier 1 and tier 1 capital under fully phased-in basel iii rules to common equity tier 1 and tier 1 capital under transitional basel iii rules.
(b)   the fully phased-in basel iii tier 1 and supplementary leverage ratios, non-gaap measures, are calculated by dividing fully phased-in basel iii tier 1 capital by our average total assets and fully phased-in total leverage exposure for supplementary leverage ratio purposes under fully phased-in basel iii, respectively.
(c)                                  estimated fully phased-in basel iii risk-weighted assets, a non-gaap measure, reflect our basel iii risk-weighted assets, with all transition provisions fully phased in. this includes incremental risk weighting applied to deferred tax assets and significant investments in unconsolidated financial institutions, as well as exposures to past due accounts, equities and sovereigns.
(d)              estimated fully phased-in basel iii leverage exposure, a non-gaap measure, reflects average total consolidated assets with adjustments for tier 1 capital deductions on a fully phased-in basis, off-balance sheet derivatives, undrawn conditionally and unconditionally cancellable commitments and other off-balance sheet liabilities.
the basel capital standards establish minimum requirements for the tier 1 risk-based capital ratios that are 1.5 percent higher than the minimum requirements for common equity tier 1 risk-based capital ratios. this difference between tier 1 capital, which includes common equity and qualifying preferred securities and common equity tier 1 is also present in the minimum capital requirements within comprehensive capital analysis and review (ccar). we issued $750 million of preferred shares in the fourth quarter of 2014 and $850 million in the first quarter of 2015. the preferred shares issuances help to finance a portion of the tier 1 capital requirements in excess of common equity requirements.
our $750 million of subordinated debentures, which prior to 2014, were fully included in tier 2 capital (but not in tier 1 capital), do not meet the requirements of tier 2 capital under basel iii. the phase-out of the subordinated debentures from tier 2 capital began in the first quarter of 2014 and will be fully phased out on january 1, 2016, which affects our total risk-based capital ratio. at our option, the subordinated debentures are redeemable for cash on or after september 1, 2016 at 100 percent of the principal amount plus any accrued but unpaid interest. we currently intend to exercise this redemption option, subject to business and market conditions. as previously mentioned, we issued $600 million of subordinated notes in the fourth quarter of 2014, which qualifies as tier 2 capital under basel rules. our total risk-based capital ratio is expected to remain well in excess of the required minimum.
the following table presents a comparison of our common equity tier 1 and tier 1 risk-based capital under transitional basel iii rules to our estimated common equity tier 1 and tier 1 risk-based capital under fully phased-in basel iii rules as of december 31, 2015.
risk-based capital under transitional basel iii                                                           $16.7            $18.3
adjustments related to:
estimated common equity tier 1 (cet1) and tier 1 risk-based capital under fully phased-in basel iii       $15.9            $17.5
fully phased-in basel iii risk-weighted assets  the fully phased-in basel iii risk-weighted assets reflect our basel iii risk-weighted assets, with all transition provisions fully phased in. this includes incremental risk weighting applied to deferred tax assets and significant investments in unconsolidated financial institutions, as well as exposures to past due accounts, equities and sovereigns. the fully phased-in basel iii risk-weighted assets as of december 31, 2015 were estimated to be $135.0 billion.
fully phased-in basel iii tier 1 leverage ratio  the fully phased-in basel iii tier 1 leverage ratio is calculated by dividing fully phased-in basel iii tier 1 capital by our average total consolidated assets.
basel iii supplementary leverage ratio  the supplementary leverage ratio under fully phased-in basel iii rules is calculated by dividing fully phased-in basel iii tier 1 capital by our total assets for supplementary leverage capital purposes under basel iii. total assets for supplementary leverage capital purposes reflect total consolidated assets with adjustments for tier 1 capital deductions, off-balance sheet derivatives, undrawn unconditionally cancellable commitments and other off-balance sheet liabilities. total assets for supplementary leverage capital purposes as of december 31, 2015 were estimated to be $186.1 billion.
share repurchases and dividends we return capital to common shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. the share repurchases reduce common shares outstanding and more than offset the issuance of new shares as part of employee compensation plans.
during the year ended december 31, 2015, we returned $5.6 billion to our shareholders in the form of common stock dividends ($1.1 billion) and share repurchases ($4.5 billion). we repurchased 58.8 million common shares at an average price of $76.70 in 2015. these dividend and share repurchase amounts represent approximately 105 percent of total capital generated during the year. the amount of capital we generated in 2015 significantly exceeded the capital required to finance organic business growth and acquisitions. the proposed sales of the hfs loan portfolios are expected to, all else remaining constant, increase our capital ratios due to the reduction in risk-weighted assets. this additional capital flexibility may be used to support growth in loans, potential acquisitions, distributions to shareholders, or a combination thereof. beginning in 2016, participating ccar firms are now required to submit their capital plans and stress testing results to the federal reserve on or before april 5 of each year instead of on or before january 5 of each year as previously required. the federal reserve is expected to publish the decisions for all the bank holding companies participating in ccar 2016, including the reasons for any objection to capital plans, by june 30, 2016.
in addition, during the year ended december 31, 2015, we had $750 million of non-cumulative perpetual preferred shares (the series b preferred shares) and $850 million of non-cumulative perpetual preferred shares (the series c preferred shares) outstanding. dividends declared and paid on series b and series c preferred shares during 2015 were $40 million and $22 million, respectively. for additional information on our preferred shares refer to note 17 common and preferred shares and note 22 earnings per common share (eps); preferred shares of the consolidated financial statements.
funding strategy our principal funding objective is to maintain broad and well-diversified funding sources to allow us to meet our maturing obligations, cost-effectively finance current and future asset growth in our global businesses as well as to maintain a strong liquidity profile. the diversity of funding sources by type of instrument, by maturity and by investor base, among other factors, provides additional insulation from the impact of disruptions in any one type of instrument, maturity or investor. the mix of our funding in any period will seek to achieve cost efficiency consistent with both maintaining diversified sources and achieving our liquidity objectives. our funding strategy and activities are integrated into our asset-liability management activities. we have in place a funding policy covering american express company and all of our subsidiaries.
our proprietary card businesses are the primary asset-generating businesses, with significant assets in both domestic and international card member receivable and lending activities. our financing needs are in large part a consequence of our proprietary card-issuing businesses and the maintenance of a liquidity position to support all of our business activities, such as merchant payments. we generally pay merchants for card transactions prior to reimbursement by card members and therefore fund the merchant payments during the period card member loans and receivables are outstanding. we also have additional financing needs associated with general corporate purposes, including acquisition activities.
funding programs and activities we meet our funding needs through a variety of sources, including direct and third-party distributed deposits and debt instruments, such as senior unsecured debentures, asset securitizations, borrowings through secured borrowing facilities and long-term committed bank borrowing facilities in certain non-u.s. regions.
we had the following consolidated debt and customer deposits outstanding as of december 31:
table 21: summary of consolidated debt and customer deposits
customer deposits                           55.0            44.2

management does not currently expect to make any significant changes to our funding programs in order to satisfy basel iiis liquidity coverage ratio (lcr) standard based upon our current understanding of the requirements, which may be subject to change as we receive additional clarification and implementation guidance from regulators relating to the requirements and as the interpretation of requirements evolves over time.
our funding plan for the full year 2016 includes, among other sources, approximately $3 billion to $7 billion of unsecured term debt issuance and up to $3 billion of secured term debt issuance. our funding plans are subject to various risks and uncertainties, such as future business growth, the impact of global economic, political and other events on market capacity, demand for securities offered by us, regulatory changes, ability to securitize and sell receivables, and the performance of receivables previously sold in securitization transactions. many of these risks and uncertainties are beyond our control.
our equity capital and funding strategies are designed, among other things, to maintain appropriate and stable unsecured debt ratings from the major credit rating agencies: moodys investor services (moodys), standard & poors (s&p), fitch ratings (fitch) and dominion bond rating services (dbrs). such ratings help support our access to cost-effective unsecured funding as part of our overall funding strategy. our asset-backed securitization (abs) activities are rated separately.

downgrades in the ratings of our unsecured debt or asset securitization program securities could result in higher funding costs, as well as higher fees related to borrowings under our unused lines of credit. declines in credit ratings could also reduce our borrowing capacity in the unsecured debt and asset securitization capital markets. we believe our funding mix, including the proportion of u.s. retail deposits insured by the federal deposit insurance corporation (fdic), should reduce the impact that credit rating downgrades would have on our funding capacity and costs.
short-term funding programs short-term borrowings, such as commercial paper, are defined as any debt with an original maturity of 12 months or less, as well as interest-bearing overdrafts with banks. our short-term funding programs are used primarily to meet working capital needs, such as managing seasonal variations in receivables balances. the amount of short-term borrowings issued in the future will depend on our funding strategy, our needs and market conditions.
we had the following short-term borrowings outstanding as of december 31:
refer to note 9 to the consolidated financial statements for further description of these borrowings.
deposit programs we offer deposits within our american express centurion bank (centurion bank) and american express bank, fsb (american express bank) subsidiaries (together, the banks). these funds are currently insured up to $250,000 per account holder through the fdic. our ability to obtain deposit funding and offer competitive interest rates is dependent on the banks capital levels. we, through the american express bank, have a direct retail deposit program, personal savings from american express, to supplement our distribution of deposit products sourced through third-party distribution channels. the direct retail program makes fdic-insured certificates of deposit (cds) and high-yield savings account products available directly to consumers.
we held the following deposits as of december 31:

long-term debt programs during 2015, we and our subsidiaries issued unsecured debt and asset-backed securities with maturities ranging from 2 to 5 years. these amounts included approximately $6.6 billion of unsecured debt and $1.0 billion of aaa-rated securitization certificates and notes. during the year, we retained approximately $0.1 billion of subordinated securities, as the pricing for these securities were not attractive compared to our other sources of financing available.
fixed rate senior notes (weighted-average coupon of 2.26%)                             $4.9
american express credit account master trust: (a)
(a)   issuances from the american express credit account master trust (the lending trust) do not include $0.1 billion of subordinated securities retained by us during the year.
asset securitization programs we periodically securitize card member receivables and loans arising from our card business, as the securitization market provides us with cost-effective funding. securitization of card member receivables and loans is accomplished through the transfer of those assets to a trust, which in turn issues securities collateralized by the transferred assets to third-party investors. the proceeds from issuance are distributed to us, through our wholly owned subsidiaries, as consideration for the transferred assets.
under the respective terms of the securitization trust agreements, the occurrence of certain triggering events associated with the performance of the assets of each trust could result in payment of trust expenses, establishment of reserve funds, or in a worst-case scenario, early amortization of investor securities. during the twelve months ended december 31, 2015, no such triggering events occurred.
liquidity management we incur liquidity risk that arises in the course of offering our products and services. our liquidity objective is to maintain access to a diverse set of on- and off-balance sheet liquidity sources. we seek to maintain liquidity sources, even in the event we are unable to raise new funds under our regular funding programs during a substantial weakening in economic conditions, in amounts sufficient to meet our expected future financial obligations and our businesses requirements for liquidity for a period of at least twelve months. our liquidity risk policy sets out our objectives and approach to managing liquidity risk.
the liquidity risks that we are exposed to could arise from a wide variety of scenarios. our liquidity management strategy thus includes a number of elements, including, but not limited to:
   maintaining diversified funding sources (refer to the funding strategy section for more details);
   maintaining unencumbered liquid assets and off-balance sheet liquidity sources;
   projecting cash inflows and outflows under a variety of economic and market scenarios;
   establishing clear objectives for liquidity risk management, including compliance with regulatory requirements;
   incorporating liquidity risk management as appropriate into our capital adequacy framework.
we seek to maintain access to a diverse set of on-balance sheet and off-balance sheet liquidity sources, including cash and other liquid assets, committed bank credit facilities and abs conduit facilities. through our u.s. bank subsidiaries, we also hold collateral eligible for use at the federal reserves discount window.
the amount and type of liquidity resources we maintain can vary over time, based upon the results of stress scenarios required under the dodd-frank wall street reform and consumer protection act (dodd-frank) and other regulatory measures of liquidity, such as the liquidity coverage ratio (lcr), as well as additional stress scenarios required under our liquidity risk policy. these stress scenarios possess distinct characteristics, varying by cash flow assumptions, time horizon and qualifying liquidity sources, among other factors. scenarios under our liquidity risk policy include market-wide, firm-specific and combined liquidity stresses. the lcr rule prescribes cash flow assumptions over a 30-day period and establishes qualifying criteria for high-quality liquid assets. we consider other factors in determining the amount and type of liquidity we maintain, such as economic and financial market conditions, seasonality in business operations, growth in our businesses, potential acquisitions or dispositions, the cost and availability of alternative liquidity sources and credit rating agency guidelines and requirements.
the investment income we receive on liquidity resources, such as cash, is less than the interest expense on the sources of funding for these balances. the net interest costs on these amounts have been substantial. the level of future net interest costs depends on the amount of liquidity resources we maintain and the difference between our cost of funding these amounts and their investment yields.
securitized borrowing capacity as of december 31, 2015, we maintained our committed, revolving, secured borrowing facility, with a maturity date of july 15, 2018, that gives us the right to sell up to $3.0 billion face amount of eligible aaa notes from the american express issuance trust ii (the charge trust together with the lending trust, the trusts). we also maintained our committed, revolving, secured borrowing facility, with a maturity date of september 15, 2017, that gives us the right to sell up to $2.0 billion face amount of eligible aaa certificates from the lending trust. both facilities are used in the ordinary course of business to fund seasonal working capital needs, as well as to further enhance our contingent funding resources. as of december 31, 2015, $1.0 billion was drawn on the charge trust facility and $0.1 billion was drawn on the lending trust facility, both of which were subsequently repaid on january 15, 2016.
federal reserve discount window as insured depository institutions, the banks may borrow from the federal reserve bank of san francisco, subject to the amount of qualifying collateral that they may pledge. the federal reserve has indicated that both credit and charge card receivables are a form of qualifying collateral for secured borrowings made through the discount window. whether specific assets will be considered qualifying collateral and the amount that may be borrowed against the collateral remain at the discretion of the federal reserve.
we had approximately $50.9 billion as of december 31, 2015 in u.s. credit card loans and charge card receivables that could be sold over time through our securitization trusts or pledged in return for secured borrowings, to provide further liquidity, subject in each case to applicable market conditions and eligibility criteria.
committed bank credit facilities in addition to the secured borrowing facilities described earlier in this section, we maintained a committed syndicated bank credit facility as of december 31, 2015 of $3.0 billion, which expires on december 9, 2018. the availability of this credit line is subject to our compliance with certain financial covenants, principally the maintenance by american express credit corporation (credco) of a certain ratio of combined earnings and fixed charges to fixed charges. as of december 31, 2015, we were in compliance with each of our covenants. as of december 31, 2015, no amounts were drawn on the committed credit facility. the capacity of the facility mainly served to further enhance our contingent funding resources.
our committed bank credit facility does not contain a material adverse change clause, which might otherwise preclude borrowing under the credit facility, nor is it dependent on our credit rating.
cash flows the following table summarizes our cash flow activity, followed by a discussion of the major drivers impacting operating, investing and financing cash flows.
operating activities                                                             $11.0               $11.0                $8.5
effect of foreign currency exchange rates on cash and cash equivalents            (0.3   )            (0.2   )            (0.2   )
cash flows from operating activities our cash flows from operating activities primarily include net income adjusted for (i) non-cash items included in net income and (ii) changes in the balances of operating assets and liabilities, which can vary significantly in the normal course of business due to the amount and timing of payments.
for december 31, 2015 and 2014, net cash provided by operating activities remained consistent at $11.0 billion in both periods, driven by net income of $5.2 billion and $5.9 billion, respectively, adjusted for non-cash items including certain changes in provisions for losses, depreciation and amortization, deferred taxes, and stock-based compensation.
cash flows from investing activities our cash flows from investing activities primarily include changes in card member receivables and loans, including card member loans and receivables hfs, as well as changes in our available for sale investment securities portfolio.
for the year ended december 31, 2015 and 2014, net cash used in investing activities was $8.2 billion and $8.0 billion, respectively. both periods primarily reflect an increase in card member receivables and loans, including the hfs portfolios. in 2014, that increase was partially offset by the cash proceeds from the sale of our investment in concur.
cash flows from financing activities our cash flows from financing activities primarily include issuing and repaying debt, changes in customer deposits, issuing and repurchasing our common shares, and paying dividends.
for the year ended december 31, 2015, net cash used in financing activities was $2.0 billion. for the year ended december 31, 2014, net cash provided by financing activities was $11 million. the variance was primarily driven by an increase in debt repayments in the current year versus the prior year, partially offset by a greater increase in customer deposits in the current year versus the prior year.
off-balance sheet arrangements and contractual obligations we have identified both on- and off-balance sheet transactions, arrangements, obligations and other relationships that may have a material current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity and capital resources.
contractual obligations the table below identifies transactions that represent our contractually committed future obligations. purchase obligations include our agreements to purchase goods and services that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction.

(a)   the table above excludes approximately $0.9 billion of tax liabilities related to the uncertainty in income taxes as inherent complexities and the number of tax years currently open for examination in multiple jurisdictions do not permit reasonable estimates of payments, if any, to be made over a range of years.
(b)   estimated interest payments were calculated using the effective interest rate in place as of december 31, 2015, and includes the effect of existing interest rate swaps. actual cash flows may differ from estimated payments.
(c)                                                  as of december 31, 2015, there were no minimum required contributions, and no contributions are currently planned, for the u.s. american express retirement plan. for the u.s. american express retirement restoration plan and non-u.s. defined benefit pension and postretirement benefit plans, contributions in 2016 are anticipated to be approximately $44 million, and this amount has been included within other long-term liabilities. remaining obligations under defined benefit pension and postretirement benefit plans aggregating $726 million have not been included in the table above as the timing of such obligations is not determinable. additionally, other long-term liabilities do not include $6.7 billion of membership rewards liabilities, which are not considered long-term liabilities as card members in good standing can redeem points immediately, without restrictions, and because the timing of point redemption is not determinable.
(d)   the purchase obligation amounts represent either the early termination fees or non-cancelable minimum contractual obligations, as applicable, by period under contracts that were in effect as of december 31, 2015.
(e)   represents obligations to make payments under contractual agreements with certain cobrand partners. we expect to fully satisfy these obligations over the remaining term of these agreements as part of the ongoing operations of our business.
in addition to the contractual obligations noted in table 27, we have off-balance sheet arrangements that include guarantees, indemnifications and certain other off-balance sheet arrangements.
guarantees our principal guarantees are associated with card member services to enhance the value of owning an american express card. as of december 31, 2015, we had guarantees totaling approximately $48 billion related to card member protection plans, as well as other guarantees and indemnifications provided in the ordinary course of business. refer to note 16 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion regarding our guarantees.
certain other off-balance sheet arrangements as of december 31, 2015, we had approximately $297 billion of unused credit available to card members as part of established lending product agreements. total unused credit available to card members does not represent potential future cash requirements, as a significant portion of this unused credit will likely not be drawn. our charge card products generally have no pre-set limit, and therefore are not reflected in unused credit available to card members.
to mitigate counterparty credit risk related to derivatives, we accepted non-cash collateral in the form of security interests in u.s. treasury securities from its derivatives counterparties with a fair value of nil and $91 million as of december 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, none of which was sold or repledged.
refer to notes 7 and 13 to the consolidated financial statements for discussion regarding our other off-balance sheet arrangements.
risk management governance we use our comprehensive enterprise-wide risk management (erm) program to identify, aggregate, monitor, and manage risks. the program also defines our risk appetite, governance, culture and capabilities. the implementation and execution of the erm program is headed by our chief risk officer.
risk management is overseen by our board of directors through three board committees: the risk committee, the audit and compliance committee, and the compensation and benefits committee. each committee consists entirely of independent directors and provides regular reports to the full board regarding matters reviewed at their committee. the committees meet regularly in private sessions with our chief risk officer, the chief compliance & ethics officer, the general auditor and other senior management with regard to our risk management processes, controls, talent and capabilities. the board monitors the tone at the top, our risk culture, and oversees emerging and strategic risks.
the risk committee of our board of directors provides oversight on risk policies, risk appetite and our performance against goals. the risk committee approves our erm policy along with its sub-policies governing individual credit risk, institutional credit risk, market risk, liquidity risk, operational risk, reputational risk and asset/liability risk, as well as policies governing the launch of new products and services, third-party management, and resolution planning. the erm policy defines our risk appetite as well as governance over risk taking and oversight processes. risk appetite defines the authorized risk limits to control exposures well within our risk capacity even under stressed forward-looking scenarios. in addition, it establishes principles for risk taking in the aggregate and for each risk type, and is supported by a comprehensive system for monitoring limits, escalation triggers and assessing control programs.
the risk committee reviews and concurs in the appointment, replacement, performance and compensation of our chief risk officer and receives regular updates from the chief risk officer on key risks, transactions and exposures.
the risk committee reviews our credit risk profile as well as credit risk performance, trends and risk management capabilities.
the risk committee also reviews enterprise-wide operational risk trends, events and capabilities, with an emphasis on compliance, fraud, legal, process or control failures, information security, and privacy, as well as trends in market, funding, liquidity and reputational risks. the risk committee also provides oversight of our compliance with basel capital and liquidity standards and its internal capital adequacy assessment process, including its ccar submissions; and resolution planning.
the audit and compliance committee of our board of directors approves our compliance policies and risk tolerance, and reinforces the importance of our compliance risk management. in addition, the audit and compliance committee reviews the effectiveness of our corporate-wide compliance risk management program. more broadly, this committee is responsible for assisting the board in its oversight responsibilities relating to the integrity of our financial statements and financial reporting process, internal and external auditing, including the qualifications and independence of the independent registered public accounting firm and the performance of our internal audit services function, and the integrity of our systems of internal accounting and financial controls.
the audit and compliance committee provides oversight of our internal audit group. the audit and compliance committee reviews and concurs in the appointment, replacement, performance and compensation of our general auditor and approves internal audits annual audit plan, charter, policies and budget. the audit and compliance committee also receives regular updates on the audit plans status and results including significant reports issued by internal audit and the status of our corrective actions.
the compensation and benefits committee of our board of directors works with the chief risk officer to ensure our overall compensation programs, as well as those covering our business units and risk-taking employees, appropriately balance risk with business incentives and how business performance is achieved without taking imprudent or excessive risk. our chief risk officer is actively involved in setting goals, including for our business units. our chief risk officer also reviews the current and forward-looking risk profiles of each business unit, and provides input into performance evaluation. the chief risk officer meets with the compensation and benefits committee and attests whether performance goals and results have been achieved without taking imprudent risks. the compensation and benefits committee uses a risk-balanced incentive compensation framework to decide on our bonus pools and the compensation of senior executives.
there are several internal management committees, including the enterprise-wide risk management committee (ermc), chaired by our chief risk officer. the ermc is the highest-level management committee to oversee all firm-wide risks. it maintains the enterprise-wide risk appetite framework and monitors compliance with limits and escalations defined in it. the ermc oversees implementation of risk policies companywide with approval by the appropriate board committee. the ermc reviews key risk exposures, trends and concentrations, significant compliance matters, economic capital and basel capital trends, and provides guidance on the steps to monitor, control and report major risks. the ermc is responsible for risk governance, risk oversight and risk appetite for all risks, which include individual credit risk, institutional credit risk, operational risk, compliance risk, reputational risk, market risk, asset liability management (alm) risk, liquidity risk, model risk, and strategic and business risk.
as defined in the erm policy, we follow the three lines of defense approach to risk management. the first line of defense comprises functions and management committees directly initiating risk taking. business unit presidents, our chief credit officer, chief operational risk officer, chief market risk officer and functional risk officer are part of the first line of defense.
the second line comprises independent functions overseeing risk taking activities of the first line. the global risk oversight officer and market risk oversight officer, the chief compliance & ethics officer, the corporate comptroller and certain control groups, both at the enterprise level and within regulated entities, are part of the second line of defense. the global risk oversight team oversees the policies, strategies, frameworks, models, processes and capabilities deployed by the first line teams and provides challenges and independent assessments on how the first line of defense is managing risks.
our internal audit group constitutes the third line of defense, and provides independent assessments and effective challenge of the first and second lines of defense.
in addition, the asset liability committee, chaired by our chief financial officer, is responsible for managing market, liquidity, asset/liability risk and capital.
credit risk management process credit risk is defined as loss due to obligor or counterparty default or changes in the credit quality of a security. our credit risks are divided into two broad categories: individual and institutional. each has distinct risk management capabilities, strategies, and tools. business units that create individual or institutional credit risk exposures of significant importance are supported by dedicated risk management teams, each led by a chief credit officer. to preserve independence, chief credit officers for all business units report to our chief credit officer.
individual credit risk individual credit risk arises principally from consumer and small business charge cards, credit cards, lines of credit, and loans. these portfolios consist of millions of customers across multiple geographies, industries and levels of net worth. we benefit from the high-quality profile of our customers, which is driven by our brand, premium customer servicing, product features and risk management capabilities, which span underwriting, customer management and collections. externally, the risk in these portfolios is correlated to broad economic trends, such as unemployment rates and gross domestic product (gdp) growth, which can affect customer liquidity.
the business unit leaders and their chief credit officers take the lead in managing the individual credit risk process. these chief credit officers are guided by the individual credit risk committee, which is responsible for implementation and enforcement of the individual credit risk management policy. this policy is further supported by subordinate policies and operating manuals covering decision logic and processes of credit extension, including prospecting, new account approvals, point-of-sale authorizations, credit line management and collections. the subordinate risk policies and operating manuals are designed to ensure consistent application of risk management principles and standardized reporting of asset quality and loss recognition.
individual credit risk management is supported by sophisticated proprietary scoring and decision-making models that use the most up-to-date information on prospects and customers, such as spending and payment history and data feeds from credit bureaus. additional data, such as commercial variables, are integrated to further mitigate small business risk. we have developed data-driven economic decision logic for customer interactions to better serve our customers.
institutional credit risk institutional credit risk arises principally within our global corporate payments, global merchant services, gns, prepaid services, and foreign exchange services businesses, as well as investment and liquidity management activities. unlike individual credit risk, institutional credit risk is characterized by a lower loss frequency but higher severity. it is affected both by general economic conditions and by client-specific events. the absence of large losses in any given year or over several years is not necessarily representative of the level of risk of institutional portfolios, given the infrequency of loss events in such portfolios.
similar to individual credit risk, business units taking institutional credit risks are supported by chief credit officers. these officers are guided by the institutional risk management committee (irmc), which is responsible for implementation and enforcement of the institutional credit risk management policy and for providing guidance to the credit officers of each business unit with substantial institutional credit risk exposures. the committee, along with the business unit chief credit officers, makes investment decisions in core risk capabilities, ensures proper implementation of the underwriting standards and contractual rights of risk mitigation, monitors risk exposures, and determines risk mitigation actions. the irmc formally reviews large institutional risk exposures to ensure compliance with ermc guidelines and procedures and escalates them to the ermc as appropriate. at the same time, the irmc provides guidance to the business unit risk management teams to optimize risk-adjusted returns on capital. a centralized risk rating unit and a specialized airline risk group provide risk assessment of our institutional obligors.
exposure to the airline industry we have multiple important cobrand, rewards, merchant acceptance and corporate payments arrangements with airlines. the erm program evaluates the risks posed by our airline partners and the overall airline strategy companywide through comprehensive business analysis of global airlines. our largest airline partner is delta, and this relationship includes exclusive cobrand credit card partnerships and other arrangements including membership rewards redemption, merchant acceptance, travel and corporate payments. see risk factors.
sovereign debt exposure as part of our ongoing risk management process, we monitor our financial exposure to both sovereign and non-sovereign customers and counterparties, and measure and manage concentrations of risk by geographic regions, as well as by economic sectors and industries. a primary focus area for monitoring is credit deterioration due to weaknesses in economic and fiscal profiles. we evaluate countries based on the market assessment of the riskiness of their sovereign debt and our assessment of our economic and financial outlook and closely monitor those deemed high risk. as of december 31, 2015, we considered our gross credit exposures to government entities, financial institutions and corporations in those countries deemed high risk to be individually and collectively not material.
operational risk management process we define operational risk as the risk of not achieving business objectives due to inadequate or failed processes, people, or information systems, or the external environment, including failures to comply with laws and regulations. operational risk is inherent in all business activities and can impact an organization through direct or indirect financial loss, brand damage, customer dissatisfaction, or legal and regulatory penalties.
to appropriately measure and manage operational risk, we have implemented a comprehensive operational risk framework that is defined in the operational risk management policy approved by the risk committee. the operational risk management committee (ormc) coordinates with all control groups on effective risk assessments and controls and oversees the preventive, responsive and mitigation efforts by lead operational risk officers in the business units and staff groups. to preserve independence, the lead operational risk officers for all business units report to our chief operational risk officer, who in turn reports directly to our chief risk officer.
we use the operational risk framework to identify, measure, monitor and report inherent and emerging operational risks. this framework, supervised by the ormc, consists of (a) operational risk event capture, (b) a project office to coordinate issue management and control enhancements, (c) key risk indicators such as customer complaints or pre-implementation test metrics, and (d) process and entity-level risk assessments.
the framework requires the assessment of operational risk events to determine root causes, impact to customers and/or us, and resolution plan accountability to correct any defect, remediate customers, and enhance controls and testing to mitigate future issues. our impact is assessed from an operational, financial, brand, regulatory compliance and legal perspective.
information security, privacy, and data governance we have implemented an information security framework and operating model that is designed to protect information and information systems from unauthorized access, use, disclosure, disruption, modification or destruction.
chaired by the chief information security officer, our information security risk management committee, a sub-committee of the ormc, provides oversight and governance for our information security risk management program. in addition, the committee is responsible for establishing cyber risk tolerances and in managing cyber crisis preparedness. the information security oversight team provides challenges and independent assessment of the information security program.
we assess our cyber risk across four categories of threat actors that we currently believe pose the greatest risk, namely cyber criminals, nation state sponsored groups, determined insiders and hacktivists or social objectors. our information security framework and operating model uses an approach that looks at different phases of security to prepare, prevent, detect, respond and recover from cyber-security attacks.
our privacy framework and operating model follow a similar structure. co-chaired by the u.s. chief privacy officer and the international chief privacy officer, our privacy risk management committee, a sub-committee of the ormc, provides oversight and governance for our privacy program. the committee is responsible for the governance over the collection, notice, use, sharing, transfer, confidentiality and retention of personal data.
our enterprise data governance framework and policy defines governance and data standards for data used in regulatory reporting, risk management as well as other critical systems including big data capabilities.
compliance risk management process we define compliance risk as the risk of legal or reputational harm, fines, monetary penalties and payment of damages or other forms of sanction as a result of non-compliance with applicable laws, regulations, rules or standards of conduct.
we view our ability to effectively mitigate compliance risk as an important aspect of our business model. our global compliance and ethics organization is responsible for establishing and maintaining our corporate-wide compliance risk management program. pursuant to this program, we seek to manage and mitigate compliance risk by assessing, controlling, monitoring, measuring and reporting the regulatory risks to which we are exposed.
we have a comprehensive anti-money laundering program that monitors and reports suspicious activity to the appropriate government authorities. as part of that program, the global risk oversight team provides independent risk assessment of the models and rules used by the anti-money laundering team. in addition, the internal audit group reviews the processes for practices consistent with regulatory guidance.
reputational risk management process we define reputational risk as the risk that negative publicity regarding our products, services, business practices, management, clients and partners, whether perceived or real, could cause a decline in the customer base, costly litigation, or revenue reductions.
we view protecting our reputation as core to our vision of becoming the worlds most respected service brand and fundamental to our long-term success.
our business leaders are responsible for ensuring that reputational risk implications of transactions, business activities and management practices are appropriately considered and relevant subject matter experts are engaged as needed. the ermc and its sub-committees are responsible for reviewing decisions where reputational risk may exist and ensuring that reputational risk considerations are properly reflected.
market risk management process market risk is the risk to earnings or asset and liability values resulting from movements in market prices. our market risk exposures include:
   interest rate risk due to changes in the relationship between interest rates on our assets (such as loans, receivables and investment securities)
   foreign exchange risk related to earnings, funding, transactions and investments in currencies other than the u.s. dollar.
our asset-liability management (alm) and market risk policies establish the framework that guides and governs market risk management, including quantitative limits and escalation triggers. these policies are approved by the risk committee of the board of directors.
market risk is managed by the market risk committee. the market risk oversight officer provides an independent risk assessment and oversight over the policies and exposures for market risk and alm activities, as well as ensuring compliance with the volcker rule and other regulatory requirements. market risk management is also guided and governed by policies covering the use of derivative financial instruments, funding, liquidity and investments.
our interest rate exposure can vary over time as a result of, among other things, the proportion of our total funding provided by variable-and fixed-rate debt and deposits compared to our card member loans and receivables. interest rate swaps are used from time to time to effectively convert debt issuances to (or from) variable-rate, from (or to) fixed-rate. we do not engage in derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. refer to note 14 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our derivative financial instruments.
we analyze a variety of interest rate scenarios to inform us of the potential impacts from interest rate changes on earnings and the value of assets, liabilities and the economic value of equity. as of december 31, 2015, the detrimental effect on our annual net interest income of a hypothetical, immediate 100 basis point increase in interest rates would be approximately $216 million. to calculate this effect, the projected net interest income over a 12-month time horizon is measured, considering forecasted business growth and future interest rates. the change in projected net interest income from a 100 basis point increase in rates is measured by increasing our forecast of future interest rates by 100 basis points. the timing and loan balances associated with the sales of the hfs loan portfolios are key assumptions in projecting business growth this year. the hfs loan portfolio sales, if and when completed, are expected to reduce our exposure to rising interest rates, all else remaining constant.
we are also subject to market risk from changes in the relationship between the benchmark prime rate that determines the yield on our variable-rate lending receivables and the benchmark libor rate that determines the effective interest cost on a significant portion of our outstanding debt. differences in the rate of change of these two indices, commonly referred to as basis risk, would impact our variable-rate u.s. lending net interest margins because we borrow at rates based on libor but lend to our customers based on the prime rate. the detrimental effect on our net interest income of a hypothetical 10 basis point decrease in the spread between prime and one-month libor over the next 12 months is estimated to be $35 million. we currently have approximately $40 billion of prime-based, variable-rate u.s. lending receivables and $35 billion of libor-indexed debt, including asset securitizations. the hfs loan portfolios sales are expected to reduce our basis risk exposure, all else remaining constant.
foreign exchange exposures arise in four principal ways: 1) card member spending in currencies that are not the billing currency, 2) cross-currency transactions and balances from our funding activities, 3) cross-currency investing activities, such as in the equity of foreign subsidiaries, and 4) revenues generated and expenses incurred in foreign currencies, which impact earnings.
these foreign exchange risks are managed primarily by entering into foreign exchange spot transactions or hedged with foreign exchange forward contracts when the hedge costs are economically justified and in notional amounts designed to offset pre-tax impacts from currency movements in the period in which they occur. as of december 31, 2015 and 2014, foreign currency derivative instruments with total notional amounts of approximately $26 billion and $30 billion were outstanding, respectively.
with respect to card member spending and cross-currency transactions, including related foreign exchange forward contracts outstanding, a hypothetical 10 percent strengthening of the u.s. dollar would result in an immaterial impact to projected earnings as of december 31, 2015. with respect to translation exposure of foreign subsidiary equity balances, including related foreign exchange forward contracts outstanding, a hypothetical 10 percent strengthening of the u.s. dollar would result in an immaterial reduction in other comprehensive income and equity as of december 31, 2015. with respect to earnings denominated in foreign currencies, the adverse impact on pretax income of a hypothetical 10 percent strengthening of the u.s. dollar related to anticipated overseas operating results for the next 12 months would be approximately $179 million as of december 31, 2015.
the actual impact of interest rate and foreign exchange rate changes will depend on, among other factors, the timing of rate changes, the extent to which different rates do not move in the same direction or in the same direction to the same degree, changes in the cost, volume and mix of our hedging activities and changes in the volume and mix of our businesses.
funding & liquidity risk management process liquidity risk is defined as our inability to meet our ongoing financial and business obligations as they become due at a reasonable cost.
our board-approved liquidity risk policy establishes the framework that guides and governs liquidity risk management.
liquidity risk is managed by the funding and liquidity committee. in addition, the market risk oversight officer provides independent oversight of liquidity risk management. we manage liquidity risk by maintaining access to a diverse set of cash, readily-marketable securities and contingent sources of liquidity, such that we can continuously meet our business requirements and expected future financing obligations for at least a 12-month period, even in the event we are unable to raise new funds under our regular funding programs during a substantial weakening in economic conditions. we consider the trade-offs between maintaining too much liquidity, which can be costly and limit financial flexibility, and having inadequate liquidity, which may result in financial distress during a liquidity event.
liquidity risk is managed at an aggregate consolidated level as well as at certain subsidiaries in order to ensure that sufficient and accessible liquidity resources are maintained. the funding and liquidity committee reviews forecasts of our aggregate and subsidiary cash positions and financing requirements, approves funding plans designed to satisfy those requirements under normal and stressed conditions, establishes guidelines to identify the amount of liquidity resources required and monitors positions and determines any actions to be taken.
model risk management process we define model risk as the risk of adverse consequences, such as financial loss, poor business and strategic decision making, or damage to our reputation, from decisions based on incorrect or misused model outputs and reports.
we manage model risk through a comprehensive model governance framework, including policies and procedures for model development, independent model validation and change management capabilities that seek to minimize erroneous model methodology, outputs and misuse. we also assess model performance on an ongoing basis.
strategic and business risk management process strategic and business risk is the risk related to our inability to achieve our business objectives due to poor strategic decisions, including decisions related to mergers, acquisitions, and divestitures, poor implementation of strategic decisions or declining demand for our products and services.
strategic decisions are reviewed and approved by business leaders and various committees and must be aligned with company policies. we seek to manage strategic and business risks through risk controls embedded in these processes as well as overall risk management oversight over business goals. existing product performance is reviewed periodically by committees and business leaders. mergers, acquisitions and divestitures can only be approved following deal committee due diligence, a comprehensive risk assessment by operational, market, credit and oversight leaders and approval by either the chief risk officer or appropriate risk committees. all new products and material changes in business processes are reviewed and approved by the new products committee and appropriate credit or risk committees.
critical accounting estimates refer to note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for a summary of our significant accounting policies. certain of our accounting policies requiring significant management assumptions and judgments are as follows:
reserves for card member losses reserves for card member losses represent our best estimate of the probable losses inherent in our outstanding portfolio of card member receivables and loans, as of the balance sheet date. as of december 31, 2015, this estimate does not reflect card member loans and receivables hfs. refer to note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.
in estimating these losses, we use statistical and analytical models that analyze portfolio performance and reflect our judgment regarding the quantitative components of the reserve. the models take into account several factors, including delinquency-based loss migration rates, loss emergence periods and average losses over an appropriate historical period, as well as expected future recoveries. we also consider whether to adjust the quantitative reserve for certain external and internal qualitative factors that may increase or decrease the reserves for losses on card member receivables and loans.
the process of estimating these reserves requires a high degree of judgment. to the extent historical credit experience, updated for any external and internal qualitative factors such as environmental trends, is not indicative of future performance, actual losses could differ significantly from our judgments and expectations, resulting in either higher or lower future provisions for card member losses in any quarter.
as of december 31, 2015, a 10 percent increase in our estimate of losses inherent in the outstanding portfolio of card member receivables and loans evaluated collectively for impairment, would increase reserves for losses with a corresponding change to provisions for losses by approximately $149 million. this sensitivity analysis is provided as a hypothetical scenario to assess the sensitivity of the provisions for losses. it does not represent our expectations for losses in the future, nor does it include how other portfolio factors such as delinquency-based loss migration rates or recoveries, or the amount of outstanding balances, may impact the level of reserves for losses and the corresponding impact on the provisions for losses.
liability for membership rewards expense the membership rewards program is our largest card-based rewards program. card members can earn points for purchases charged on their enrolled card products. certain types of purchases allow card members to also earn bonus points. membership rewards points are redeemable for a broad variety of rewards including travel, entertainment, retail certificates and merchandise. points typically do not expire, and there is no limit on the number of points a card member may earn.
we record a membership rewards liability that represents the estimated cost of points earned that are expected to be redeemed by card members in the future. the membership rewards liability is impacted over time by enrollment levels, attrition, the volume of points earned and redeemed, and the associated redemption costs. we estimate the membership rewards liability by determining the urr and the wac per point, which are applied to the points of current enrollees.
the urr assumption is used to estimate the number of points earned by current enrollees that will ultimately be redeemed in future periods. we use statistical and actuarial models to estimate the urr of points earned to date by current card members based on redemption trends, card product type, enrollment tenure, card spend levels and credit attributes. the wac per point assumption is used to estimate future redemption costs and is primarily based on redemption choices made by card members, reward offerings by partners, and membership rewards program changes. the wac per point is derived from the previous 12 months of redemptions and is adjusted as appropriate for certain changes in redemption costs that are not representative of future cost expectations.
we periodically evaluate our liability estimation process and assumptions based on developments in redemption patterns, cost per point redeemed, partner contract changes and other factors. the process of estimating the membership rewards liability includes a high degree of judgment. actual redemptions and associated redemption costs could differ significantly from our judgment, resulting in either higher or lower membership rewards expense.
changes in the membership rewards urr and wac per point have the effect of either increasing or decreasing the liability through the current period marketing, promotion, rewards and card member services expense by an amount estimated to cover the cost of all points previously earned but not yet redeemed by current enrollees as of the end of the reporting period. as of december 31, 2015, an increase in the estimated urr of current enrollees of 100 basis points would increase the membership rewards liability and corresponding rewards expense by approximately $341 million. similarly, an increase in the wac per point of 1 basis point would increase the membership rewards liability and corresponding rewards expense by approximately $85 million.
fair value measurement we hold investment securities and derivative instruments that are carried at fair value on the consolidated balance sheets. management makes assumptions and judgments when estimating the fair values of these financial instruments.
in accordance with fair value measurement and disclosure guidance, the objective of a fair value measurement is to determine the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date based on the principal or, in the absence of a principal, most advantageous market for the specific asset or liability. the disclosure guidance establishes a three-level hierarchy of inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value. the fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to the measurement of fair value based on unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (level 1), followed by the measurement of fair value based on pricing models with significant observable inputs (level 2), with the lowest priority given to the measurement of fair value based on pricing models with significant unobservable inputs (level 3). we did not have any level 3 financial instruments measured on a recurring basis during the year ended december 31, 2015.
investment securities our investment securities are mostly composed of fixed-income securities issued by states and municipalities, as well as the u.s. government and agencies.
the fair market values for our investment securities, including investments comprising defined benefit pension plan assets, are obtained primarily from pricing services we engage and for each security, we receive one price from that pricing service. the fair values provided by the pricing services are estimated using pricing models, where the inputs to those models are based on observable market inputs or recent trades of similar securities. the pricing services did not apply any adjustments to the pricing models used as of december 31, 2015 and 2014. in addition, we did not apply any adjustments to prices received from the pricing services. we reaffirm our understanding of the valuation techniques used by our pricing services at least annually. in addition, we corroborate the prices provided by our pricing services for reasonableness by comparing the prices from the respective pricing services to valuations obtained from different pricing sources as well as comparing prices to the sale prices received from sold securities at least quarterly.
in the measurement of fair value for our investment securities, even though the underlying inputs used in the pricing models are directly observable from active markets or recent trades of similar securities in inactive markets, the pricing models do entail a certain amount of subjectivity, and therefore differing judgments in the underlying inputs, or how they are modeled, could result in a different estimate of fair value.
other-than-temporary impairment of investment securities realized losses are recognized when management determines that a decline in the fair value of investment securities is other-than-temporary. such determination requires judgment regarding the amount and timing of recovery. we review and evaluate our investment securities at least quarterly, and more often as market conditions may require, to identify investment securities that have indications of other-than-temporary impairments. we consider several factors when evaluating debt securities for other-than-temporary impairment, including the determination of the extent to which a decline in the fair value of a security is due to increased default risk for the specific issuer, or market interest rate risk. with respect to market interest rate risk, we assess whether we have the intent to sell the investment securities and whether we are more likely than not to be required to sell the investment securities before recovery of any unrealized losses.
in determining whether any of our investment securities are other-than-temporarily impaired, a change in facts and circumstances could lead to a change in management judgment about our view on collectability and credit quality of the issuer, or the impact of market interest rates on the investment securities. any such changes could result in us recognizing an other-than-temporary impairment loss through earnings.
derivative instruments our primary derivative instruments are interest rate swaps and foreign currency forward agreements.
the fair value of our derivative instruments is estimated by using either a third-party valuation service that uses proprietary pricing models, or by internal pricing models, where the inputs to those models are readily observable from actively quoted markets. we reaffirm our understanding of the valuation techniques used by a third-party valuation service at least annually.
to mitigate credit risk arising from our derivative instruments, counterparties are required to be pre-approved and rated as investment grade. in addition, we manage certain counterparty credit risks by exchanging cash and non-cash collateral under executed credit support agreements. the non-cash collateral does not reduce the derivative balance included in other assets on the consolidated balance sheets, but effectively reduces risk exposure as it is available in the event of counterparty default. based on the assessment of credit risk of our derivative counterparties, we do not have derivative positions that warrant credit valuation adjustments.
in the measurement of fair value for our derivative instruments, although the underlying inputs used in the pricing models are readily observable from actively quoted markets, the pricing models do entail a certain amount of subjectivity, and therefore differing judgments in the underlying inputs, or how they are modeled, could result in a different estimate of fair value.
goodwill recoverability goodwill represents the excess of acquisition cost of an acquired business over the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed. goodwill is not amortized but is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level annually or when events or circumstances arise, such as adverse changes in the business climate, that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying value. our approach and methodology for conducting our goodwill impairment testing is fundamentally based on the measurement of fair value for our reporting units, which inherently entails the use of significant judgment.
for valuation, we use a combination of the income approach (discounted cash flows) and market approach (market multiples) in estimating the fair value of our reporting units.
when preparing discounted cash flow models under the income approach, we estimate future cash flows using the reporting units internal multi-year forecast, and a terminal value calculated using a growth rate that we believe is appropriate in light of current and expected future economic conditions. to discount these cash flows we use our expected cost of equity, determined using a capital asset pricing model. when using the market method under the market approach, we apply comparable publicly traded companies multiples (e.g., earnings, revenues) to our reporting units actual results. the judgment in estimating forecasted cash flows, discount rates and market comparables is significant, and imprecision could materially affect the fair value of our reporting units.
refer to note 2 of the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the eg goodwill impairment in 2015.
we could be exposed to an increased risk of further goodwill impairment if future operating results or macroeconomic conditions differ significantly from managements current assumptions.
income taxes we are subject to the income tax laws of the united states, its states and municipalities and those of the foreign jurisdictions in which we operate. these tax laws are complex, and the manner in which they apply to the taxpayers facts is sometimes open to interpretation. in establishing a provision for income tax expense, we must make judgments about the application of inherently complex tax laws.
unrecognized tax benefits we establish a liability for unrecognized tax benefits, which are the differences between a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return and the benefit recognized in the financial statements.
in establishing a liability for an unrecognized tax benefit, assumptions may be made in determining whether, and the extent to which, a tax position should be sustained. a tax position is recognized only when it is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by the relevant taxing authority, based on its technical merits. the amount of tax benefit recognized is the largest benefit that we believe is more likely than not to be realized on ultimate settlement. as new information becomes available, we evaluate our tax positions and adjust our unrecognized tax benefits, as appropriate.
tax benefits ultimately realized can differ from amounts previously recognized due to uncertainties, with any such differences generally impacting the provision for income tax.
deferred tax asset realization deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using the enacted tax rates expected to be in effect for the years in which the differences are expected to reverse.
since deferred taxes measure the future tax effects of items recognized in the consolidated financial statements, certain estimates and assumptions are required to determine whether it is more likely than not that all or some portion of the benefit of a deferred tax asset will not be realized. in making this assessment, we analyze and estimate the impact of future taxable income, reversing temporary differences and available tax planning strategies. these assessments are performed quarterly, taking into account any new information.
changes in facts or circumstances can lead to changes in the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets due to uncertainties.
other matters recently issued accounting standards refer to the recently issued accounting standards section of note 1 to the consolidated financial statements.
glossary of selected terminology adjusted average loans  represents average card member loans on a gross basis, including gross loans classified as held for sale (i.e., not adjusted for any valuation allowance), and excluding the impact of certain non-traditional card member loans and other fees.
adjusted net interest income  represents net interest income attributable to our card member loans and loans hfs, including interest that is deemed uncollectible; excludes the impact of interest expense and interest income not attributable to our card member loans.
asset securitizations  asset securitization involves the transfer and sale of receivables or loans to a special-purpose entity created for the securitization activity, typically a trust. the trust, in turn, issues securities, commonly referred to as asset-backed securities that are secured by the transferred receivables or loans. the trust uses the proceeds from the sale of such securities to pay the purchase price for the underlying receivables or loans. the receivables and loans of our charge trust and lending trust being securitized are reported as assets, and the securities issued by the trusts are reported as liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets.
average discount rate  this calculation is generally designed to reflect pricing at merchants accepting general-purpose american express cards. it represents the percentage of billed business (generated from both proprietary and gns card member spending) retained by us from merchants we acquire, or for merchants acquired by a third party on our behalf, net of amounts retained by such third party.
basic cards-in-force  proprietary basic consumer cards-in-force includes basic cards issued to the primary account owner, (i.e., not including additional supplemental cards issued on accounts). proprietary basic small business and corporate cards-in-force includes both basic and supplemental cards issued. non-proprietary basic cards-in-force includes cards that are issued and outstanding under network partnership agreements, except for supplemental cards and retail cobrand card member accounts which have had no out-of-store spending activity during the prior 12-month period.
billed business  includes activities (including cash advances) related to proprietary cards, cards issued under network partnership agreements (non-proprietary billed business), corporate payment services and certain insurance fees charged on proprietary cards. in-store spending activity within retail cobrand portfolios in gns, from which we earn no revenue, is not included in non-proprietary billed business. card billed business is included in the united states or outside the united states based on where the issuer is located.
capital ratios  represents the minimum standards established by the regulatory agencies as a measure to determine whether the regulated entity has sufficient capital to absorb on- and off-balance sheet losses beyond current loss accrual estimates. refer to the capital strategy section under consolidated capital resources and liquidity for further related definitions under transitional basel iii and fully phased-in basel iii.
card member  the individual holder of an issued american express-branded charge, credit and certain prepaid cards.
card member loans and receivables hfs  beginning as of december 1, 2015, represents card member loans and receivables related to our cobrand partnerships with costco in the united states and jetblue.
charge cards  represents cards that generally carry no pre-set spending limits and are primarily designed as a method of payment and not as a means of financing purchases. charge card members generally must pay the full amount billed each month. no finance charges are assessed on charge cards. each charge card transaction is authorized based on its likely economics reflecting a card members most recent credit information and spend patterns. some charge card accounts have an additional lending-on-charge feature that allows revolving certain balances.
credit cards  represents cards that have a range of revolving payment terms, grace periods, and rate and fee structures.
interest expense  includes interest incurred primarily to fund card member receivables and loans, general corporate purposes and liquidity needs, and is recognized as incurred. interest expense is divided principally into two categories: (i) deposits, which primarily relates to interest expense on deposits taken from customers and institutions, and (ii) debt, which primarily relates to interest expense on our long-term financing and short-term borrowings, (e.g., commercial paper, federal funds purchased, bank overdrafts and other short-term borrowings), as well as the realized impact of derivatives hedging interest rate risk on our long-term debt.
interest on loans  assessed using the average daily balance method for card member loans and loans hfs. unless the loan is classified as non-accrual, interest is recognized based upon the principal amount outstanding in accordance with the terms of the applicable account agreement until the outstanding balance is paid or written off.
interest and dividends on investment securities  primarily relates to our performing fixed-income securities. interest income is recognized as earned using the effective interest method, which adjusts the yield for security premiums and discounts, fees and other payments, so a constant rate of return is recognized on the outstanding balance of the related investment security throughout its term. amounts are recognized until securities are in default or when it is likely that future interest payments will not be made as scheduled.
interest income on deposits with banks and other  recognized as earned, and primarily relates to the placement of cash in excess of near-term funding requirements in interest-bearing time deposits, overnight sweep accounts, and other interest-bearing demand and call accounts.
liquidity coverage ratio  represents the proposed minimum standards being established by the regulatory agencies as a measure to determine whether the regulated entity has sufficient liquidity to meet liquidity needs in periods of financial and economic stress.
merchant acquisition  represents our process of entering into agreements with merchants to accept american express-branded cards.
net card fees  represents the card membership fees earned during the period. these fees are recognized as revenue over the covered card membership period (typically one year), net of the provision for projected refunds for card membership cancellation and deferred acquisition costs.
net interest yield on card member loans  net interest yield on card member loans is computed by dividing adjusted net interest income by adjusted average loans, computed on an annualized basis. the calculation of net interest yield on card member loans includes interest that is deemed uncollectible. reserves and net write-offs related to uncollectible interest are recorded through provisions for losses, which are not included in the net interest yield calculation.
net loss ratio  represents the ratio of gcs charge card write-offs, consisting of principal (resulting from authorized transactions) and fee components, less recoveries, on card member receivables expressed as a percentage of gross amounts billed to corporate card members.
net write-off rate  principal only  represents the amount of card member loans or uscs and ics card member receivables written off, consisting of principal (resulting from authorized transactions), less recoveries, as a percentage of the average loan balance or uscs and ics average receivables balance during the period.
net write-off rate  principal, interest and fees  includes, in the calculation of the net write-off rate, amounts for interest and fees in addition to principal for card member loans, and fees in addition to principal for uscs and ics card member receivables.
operating expenses  represents salaries and employee benefits, professional services, occupancy and equipment, communications and other expenses.
return on average segment capital  calculated by dividing one-year period segment income by one-year average segment capital.
return on average tangible segment capital  computed in the same manner as the return on average segment capital, except the computation of average tangible segment capital excludes from average segment capital, average goodwill and other intangibles.
segment capital  represents the capital allocated to a segment based upon specific business operational needs, risk measures, and regulatory capital requirements.
total cards-in-force  represents the number of cards that are issued and outstanding. non-proprietary cards-in-force includes all cards that are issued and outstanding under network partnership agreements, except for retail cobrand card member accounts which have no out-of-store spending activity during the prior 12-month period.
travel sales  represents the total dollar amount of travel transaction volume for airline, hotel, car rental, and other travel arrangements made for consumers and small businesses. we earn revenue on these transactions by charging a transaction or management fee.

                                                       our ability to grow in the future, which will depend in part on the following: an acceleration of billed business and revenue growth, which could be impacted by, among other things, weakening economic conditions in the u.s. or internationally, a decline in consumer confidence impacting the willingness and ability of card members to sustain spending, a further decline in gas prices, a further strengthening of the u.s. dollar, a greater erosion of the average discount rate than expected and lower spending on new cards acquired than estimated; our success in addressing competitive pressures and implementing strategies and business initiatives, including growing profitable spending through proprietary, cobrand and network products, increasing penetration among corporate, middle market and small business clients, expanding our international footprint, growing loyalty coalitions and increasing merchant acceptance; the timing and impact of any potential sale of the costco u.s. card member loan portfolio; realizing incremental economics associated with the costco u.s. contract extension, which could be impacted by, among other things, card member behavior, including the desire of costco u.s. card members to continue to use their costco u.s. cobrand cards and the availability to those card members of other payment forms; the impact of any potential restructuring charges or other contingencies, including, but not limited to, litigation-related expenses, impairments, the imposition of fines or civil money penalties, an increase in card member reimbursements and changes in reserves; credit performance remaining in line with current expectations; continued growth of card member loans held for investment; the ability to continue to realize benefits from restructuring actions and operating leverage at levels consistent with current expectations; the amount we spend on growth initiatives; changes in interest rates beyond current expectations; the impact of regulation and litigation, which could affect the profitability of our business activities, limit our ability to pursue business opportunities, require changes to business practices or alter our relationships with partners, merchants and card members; our tax rate remaining in line with current expectations, which could be impacted by, among other things, our geographic mix of income being weighted more to higher tax jurisdictions than expected and unfavorable tax audits and other unanticipated tax items; the impact of accounting changes and reclassifications; and our ability to continue executing the share repurchase program;
                                                         our ability to reduce our overall cost base by $1 billion by the end of 2017, which will depend in part on the timing and financial impact of future reengineering plans (including whether we will recognize restructuring charges in future periods), which could be impacted by factors such as our inability to mitigate the operational and other risks posed by potential staff reductions, our inability to develop and implement technology resources to realize cost savings, underestimating hiring needs related to some of the job positions being eliminated and other employee needs not currently anticipated, lower than expected attrition rates and higher than expected redeployment rates; our ability to reduce annual operating expenses, which could be impacted by, among other things, the factors identified below; and our ability to optimize and lower marketing and promotion expenses, which could be impacted by higher advertising and mailing costs, competitive pressures that may require additional expenditures or limit our ability to reduce costs, contractual obligations with business partners, the availability of opportunities to invest at a higher level due to favorable business results and changes in macroeconomic conditions;
                                                        the ability to reduce annual operating expenses, which could be impacted by increases in significant categories of operating expenses, such as consulting or professional fees, including as a result of increased litigation, compliance or regulatory-related costs, technology costs or fraud costs; our ability to develop, implement and achieve substantial benefits from reengineering plans;
higher than expected employee levels; the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on costs; the payment of civil money penalties, disgorgement, restitution, non-income tax assessments and litigation-related settlements; impairments of goodwill or other assets; managements decision to increase or decrease spending in such areas as technology, business and product development and sales forces depending on overall business performance; greater than expected inflation or merit increases; our ability to balance expense control and investments in the business; the impact of accounting changes and reclassifications; and the level of acquisition activity and related expenses;
                          our lending write-off rates increasing more quickly than current expectations and provision expense being higher than current expectations, which will depend in part on changes in the level of loan balances, delinquency rates of card members, unemployment rates, the volume of bankruptcies and recoveries of previously written-off loans;
                                                       our ability to execute against our lending strategy and grow card member loans held for investment, including by targeting new lending prospects and deepening relationships with current customers, which may be affected by increasing competition, brand perceptions and reputation, our ability to manage risk in a growing card member loan portfolio, and the behavior of card members and their actual spending and borrowing patterns, which in turn may be driven by our ability to issue new and enhanced card products, offer attractive services and rewards programs, attract new card members, reduce card member attrition and capture a greater share of existing card members spending and borrowing;
                                                       uncertainties associated with the timing and impact of any potential sale of the costco u.s. card member loan portfolio and the extension of the merchant acceptance agreement, such as the negotiation and execution of definitive documentation, operational issues related to the transfer of card member loans and accounts, the parties ability to satisfy the closing conditions and the amount of any gain we recognize as a result of a sale, which could be impacted by the credit quality and performance of the portfolio, the amount of any volume decline experienced by the cobrand portfolio and the timing of the potential sale as the gain will be determined by the amount of the aggregate outstanding loans transferred at closing;
                                                   the erosion of the average discount rate by a greater amount than anticipated during 2016 and beyond, including as a result of changes in the mix of spending by location and industry, merchant incentives and concessions, volume-related pricing discounts, strategic investments, certain pricing initiatives, competition, pricing regulation (including regulation of competitors interchange rates) and other factors;
                                                     the possibility that we will not fully execute on our plans for optblue to significantly increase merchant coverage, which will depend in part on the success of optblue merchant acquirers in signing merchants to accept american express, which could be impacted by the pricing set by the merchant acquirers, the value proposition offered to small merchants and the efforts of optblue merchant acquirers to sign merchants for american express acceptance, as well as the willingness of card members to use american express cards at small merchants and of those merchants to accept american express cards;
                     uncertainty relating to the ultimate outcome of the antitrust lawsuit filed against us by the u.s. department of justice and certain state attorneys general, including the success or failure of our appeal and the impact on existing private merchant cases and potentially additional litigation and/or arbitrations;
                                                       changes affecting our ability or desire to return capital to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases, including the opportunity for incremental capital returns related to the costco u.s. portfolio sale, which will depend on factors such as approval of our capital plans by our primary regulators, the amount we spend on acquisitions and results of operations and capital needs in any given period;
                                                          our funding plan for the full year 2016 being implemented in a manner inconsistent with current expectations, which will depend on various factors such as future business growth, the impact of global economic, political and other events on market capacity, demand for securities we offer, regulatory changes, ability to securitize and sell receivables and the performance of receivables previously sold in securitization transactions;
                                                           our ability to drive growth by developing and marketing value propositions that appeal to card members and new customers and by offering attractive services and rewards programs, which will depend in part on ongoing investment in product innovation, marketing and promotion and acquisition efforts, including through digital channels; our ability to update our systems and platforms to support new products, services and benefits; competition; and brand perceptions and reputation;
                            changes in global economic and business conditions, including consumer and business spending, the availability and cost of credit, unemployment and political conditions, all of which may significantly affect spending on american express cards, delinquency rates, loan balances and other aspects of our business and results of operations;

                                                   legal and regulatory developments wherever we do business, including legislative and regulatory changes in the united states, such as the actions of the cfpb and dodd-franks stricter regulation of large, interconnected financial institutions, which could make fundamental changes to many of our business practices or materially affect our capital or liquidity requirements, results of operations, or ability to pay dividends or repurchase our stock; actions and potential future actions by the fdic and credit rating agencies applicable to securitization trusts, which could impact our abs program; or potential changes to the taxation of our businesses, the allowance of deductions for significant expenses, or the incidence of consumption taxes on our transactions, products and services;
       changes in the substantial and increasing worldwide competition in the payments industry, including competitive pressure that may impact the prices we charge merchants that accept our cards, competition for cobrand partnerships and the success of marketing, promotion or rewards programs;
                                                          changes in the financial condition and creditworthiness of our business partners, such as bankruptcies, restructurings or consolidations, involving merchants that represent a significant portion of our business, such as the airline industry, or our partners in gns or financial institutions that we rely on for routine funding and liquidity, which could materially affect our financial condition or results of operations;
                                            our ability to maintain and expand our presence in the digital payments space, including online and mobile channels, which will depend on our success in evolving our business models and processes for the digital environment, building partnerships and executing programs with companies, and utilizing digital capabilities that can be leveraged for future growth; and
                                                        factors beyond our control such as foreign currency rates, fire, power loss, disruptions in telecommunications, severe weather conditions, natural disasters, health pandemics, terrorism, cyber attacks or fraud, which could significantly affect spending on american express cards, delinquency rates, loan balances and travel-related spending or disrupt our global network systems and ability to process transactions.

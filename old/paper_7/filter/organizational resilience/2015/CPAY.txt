general business fleetcor is a leading independent global provider of fuel cards, commercial payment and data solutions, stored value solutions, and workforce payment products and services to businesses, retailers, commercial fleets, major oil companies, petroleum marketers and government entities in countries throughout north america, south america, europe, australia and new zealand. our payment programs enable our customers to better manage and control their commercial payments, card programs, and employee spending and provide card-accepting merchants with a high volume customer base that can increase their sales and customer loyalty. we also provide a suite of fleet related and workforce payment solution products, including a mobile telematics service, fleet maintenance management and employee benefit and transportation related payments. in 2015, we processed approximately 1.9 billion transactions on our proprietary networks and third-party networks (which includes approximately 1.3 billion transactions related to our svs product, acquired with comdata). we believe that our size and scale, geographic reach, advanced technology and our expansive suite of products, services, brands and proprietary networks contribute to our leading industry position.
we provide our payment products and services in a variety of combinations to create customized payment solutions for our customers and partners. we collectively refer to our suite of product offerings as workforce productivity enhancement products for commercial businesses. we sell a range of customized fleet and lodging payment programs directly and indirectly to our customers through partners, such as major oil companies, leasing companies and petroleum marketers. we refer to these major oil companies, leasing companies, petroleum marketers, value-added resellers (vars) and other referral partners with whom we have strategic relationships as our partners. we provide our customers with various card products that typically function like a charge card to purchase fuel, lodging, food, toll, transportation and related products and services at participating locations.
we support our products with specialized issuing, processing and information services that enable us to manage card accounts, facilitate the routing, authorization, clearing and settlement of transactions, and provide value-added functionality and data, including customizable card-level controls and productivity analysis tools. in order to deliver our payment programs and services and process transactions, we own and operate proprietary closed-loop networks through which we electronically connect to merchants and capture, analyze and report customized information in north america and internationally. we also use third-party networks to deliver our payment programs and services in order to broaden our card acceptance and use. to support our payment products, we also provide a range of services, such as issuing and processing, as well as specialized information services that provide our customers with value-added functionality and data. our customers can use this data to track important business productivity metrics, combat fraud and employee misuse, streamline expense administration and lower overall workforce and fleet operating costs. depending on our customers and partners needs, we provide these services in a variety of outsourced solutions ranging from a comprehensive end-to-end solution (encompassing issuing, processing and network services) to limited back office processing services.
fleetcors predecessor company was organized in the united states in 1986. in 2000, our current chief executive officer joined us and we changed our name to fleetcor technologies, inc. since 2000, we have grown significantly
through a combination of organic initiatives, product and service innovation and over 65 acquisitions of businesses and commercial account portfolios. our corporate headquarters are located in norcross, georgia. as of december 31, 2015, we employed approximately 5,330 employees, approximately 2,660 of whom are located in the united states.
executive overview we operate in two segments, which we refer to as our north america and international segments. see results of operations for additional segment information.
our revenue is reported net of the wholesale cost for underlying products and services. in this report, we refer to this net revenue as revenue. for the years ended december 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, our north america and international segments generated the following revenue:
(dollars in millions)        revenues,                      % of             revenues,                      % of             revenues,                      % of net                     total                   net                     total                   net                     total revenues, net                                   revenues, net                                   revenues, net north america                 $1,232.0                      72.3   %            $668.3                      55.7   %            $460.7                      51.5   %
sources of revenue transactions. in both of our segments, we derive revenue from transactions. as illustrated in the diagram below, a transaction is defined as a purchase by a customer. our customers include holders of our card products and those of our partners, for whom we manage card programs, members of our proprietary networks who are provided access to our products and services and commercial businesses to whom we provide workforce payment productivity solutions. revenue from transactions is derived from our merchant and network relationships, as well as our customers and partners. through our merchant and network relationships we primarily offer fuel cards, corporate cards, virtual cards, purchasing cards, t&e cards, gift cards, stored value payroll cards, vehicle maintenance, food, fuel, toll and transportation cards and vouchers or lodging services to our customers.
the following diagram illustrates a typical card transaction flow, but may also be applied to our vehicle maintenance, lodging and food, fuel, toll and transportation card and voucher products, substituting transactions for gallons. this representative model may not include all of our businesses.
from our customers and partners, we derive revenue from a variety of program fees, including transaction fees, card fees, network fees and charges, which can be fixed fees, cost plus a mark-up or based on a percentage discount from retail prices. our programs include other fees and charges associated with late payments and based on customer credit risk.
from our merchant and network relationships, we derive revenue mostly from the difference between the price charged to a customer for a transaction and the price paid to the merchant or network for the same transaction, as well as network fees and charges in certain businesses. as illustrated in the table below, the price paid to a merchant or network may be calculated as (i) the merchants wholesale cost of the product plus a markup; (ii) the transaction purchase price less a percentage discount; or (iii) the transaction purchase price less a fixed fee per unit.
the following table presents an illustrative revenue model for transactions with the merchant, which is primarily applicable to fuel based product transactions, but may also be applied to our vehicle maintenance, lodging and food, fuel, toll and transportation card and voucher products, substituting transactions for gallons. this representative model may not include all of our businesses.
(unit of one gallon)
set forth below are our sources of revenue for the years ended december 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, expressed as a percentage of consolidated revenues:
revenue from customers and partners                                 64.8   %            54.9   %            53.6   %
revenue from merchants and networks                                 35.2   %            45.1   %            46.4   %
revenue directly influenced by the absolute price of fuel1          15.1   %            17.0   %            19.6   %
1   although we cannot precisely calculate the absolute impact of fuel price spreads and the absolute price of fuel on our consolidated revenues, we believe these percentages approximate their relative impacts.
revenue per transaction. set forth below is revenue per transaction information for the years ended december 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013:
2   transactions in 2015 and 2014 include appropriately 1.3 billion and 270 million transactions, respectively, related to our svs product, which is part of the comdata business acquired in november 2014. svs, stored value solutions, is our global provider of gift card and stored value solutions. the svs product has lower revenue per transaction.
3           adjusted revenues is a non-gaap financial measure defined as revenues, net less merchant commissions. we believe this measure is a more effective way to evaluate our revenue performance. we use adjusted revenues as a basis to evaluate our revenues, net of the commissions that are paid to merchants to participate in our card programs. adjusted revenues is a supplemental non-gaap financial measure of operating performance. see the heading entitled
managements use of non-gaap financial measures.
revenue per transaction is derived from the various revenue types as discussed above and can vary based on geography, the relevant merchant relationship, the payment product utilized and the types of products or services purchased, the mix of which would be influenced by our acquisitions, organic growth in our business, and the overall macroeconomic environment, including fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. revenue per transaction per customer changes as the level of services we provide to a customer increases or decreases, as macroeconomic factors change and as adjustments are made to merchant and customer rates. see results of operations for further discussion of transaction volumes and revenue per transaction.
from 2014 to 2015, total transactions increased from 652.4 million to 1.9 billion, an increase of 1.2 billion or 183.8%. we experienced an increase in transactions in our north america segment primarily due to our acquisition of comdata in november 2014, of which 1.3 billion and 270 million transactions are attributable to svs for 2015 and 2014, respectively, as well as from organic growth in our u.s. businesses. transaction volumes in our international segment decreased slightly by 4.5% primarily due to market softness in some of our international businesses.
from 2013 to 2014, total transactions increased from 327.5 million to 652.4 million, an increase of 324.9 million or 99.2%. we experienced an increase in transactions in our north america and international segments primarily due to organic growth in certain payment programs, the impact of the acquisitions completed in 2014 and the full year impact of acquisitions completed in 2013. in 2014, transaction volume was primarily affected by the inclusion of approximately 270 million transactions related to our svs product, which is part of the comdata business acquired in november 2014.
sources of expenses we incur expenses in the following categories:
   merchant commissionsin certain of our card programs, we incur merchant commissions expense when we reimburse merchants with whom we have direct, contractual relationships for specific
transactions where a customer purchases products or services from the merchant. in the card programs where it is paid, merchant commissions equal the difference between the price paid by us to the merchant and the merchants wholesale cost of the underlying products or services.
   processingour processing expense consists of expenses related to processing transactions, servicing our customers and merchants, bad debt expense and cost of goods sold related to our hardware sales in certain businesses.
   sellingour selling expenses consist primarily of wages, benefits, sales commissions (other than merchant commissions) and related expenses for our sales, marketing and account management personnel and activities.
             general and administrativeour general and administrative expenses include compensation and related expenses (including stock-based compensation) for our executive, finance and accounting, information technology, human resources, legal and other administrative personnel. also included are facilities expenses, third-party professional services fees, travel and entertainment expenses, and other corporate-level expenses.
                         depreciation and amortizationour depreciation expenses include depreciation of property and equipment, consisting of computer hardware and software (including proprietary software development amortization expense), card-reading equipment, furniture, fixtures, vehicles and buildings and leasehold improvements related to office space. our amortization expenses include amortization of intangible assets related to customer and vendor relationships, trade names and trademarks and non-compete agreements. we are amortizing intangible assets related to business acquisitions and certain private label contracts associated with the purchase of accounts receivable.
   other operating, netour other operating, net includes other operating expenses and income items unusual to the period and presented separately.
   equity method investment lossour equity method investment loss relates to our minority interest in masternaut group holdings limited (masternaut), a provider of telematics solutions to commercial fleets in europe, which we account for using the equity method.
   other expense (income), netother expense (income), net includes foreign currency transaction gains or losses, proceeds/costs from the sale of assets and other miscellaneous operating costs and revenue.
   interest expense, netinterest expense, net includes interest income on our cash balances and interest expense on our outstanding debt and on our securitization facility. we have historically invested our cash primarily in short-term money market funds.
   loss on early extinguishment of debtloss on early extinguishment of debt relates to our write-off of debt issuance costs associated with the refinancing of our existing credit facility and entry into our new credit agreement, along with our recent acquisition of comdata.
   provision for income taxesthe provision for income taxes consists primarily of corporate income taxes related to profits resulting from the sale of our products and services in the united states and internationally. our worldwide effective tax rate is lower than the u.s. statutory rate of 35%, due primarily to lower rates in foreign jurisdictions and foreign-sourced non-taxable income.
we use adjusted revenues as a basis to evaluate our revenues, net of the commissions that are paid to merchants that participate in certain of our card programs. the commissions paid to merchants can vary when market spreads fluctuate in much the same way as revenues are impacted when market spreads fluctuate. thus, we believe this is a more effective way to evaluate our revenue performance on a consistent basis. we use adjusted net income and adjusted net income per diluted share to eliminate the effect of items that we do not consider indicative of our core operating performance on a consistent basis. adjusted revenues, adjusted net income and adjusted net income per diluted share are supplemental non-gaap financial measures of operating performance. see the heading entitled managements use of non-gaap financial measures.
factors and trends impacting our business we believe that the following factors and trends are important in understanding our financial performance:
                          fuel pricesour fleet customers use our products and services primarily in connection with the purchase of fuel. accordingly, our revenue is affected by fuel prices, which are subject to significant volatility. a change in retail fuel prices could cause a decrease or increase in our revenue from several sources, including fees paid to us based on a percentage of each customers total purchase. changes in the absolute price of fuel may also impact unpaid account balances and the late fees and charges based on these amounts. see sources of revenue above for further information related to the absolute price of fuel.
                          fuel-price spread volatilitya portion of our revenue involves transactions where we derive revenue from fuel-price spreads, which is the difference between the price charged to a fleet customer for a transaction and the price paid to the merchant for the same transaction. in these transactions, the price paid to the merchant is based on the wholesale cost of fuel. the merchants wholesale cost of fuel is dependent on several factors including, among others, the factors described above affecting fuel prices. the fuel price that we charge to our customer is dependent on several factors including, among others, the fuel price paid to the merchant, posted retail fuel prices and competitive fuel prices. we experience fuel-price spread contraction when the merchants wholesale cost of fuel increases at a faster rate than the fuel price we charge to our customers, or the fuel price we charge to our customers decreases at a faster rate than the merchants wholesale cost of fuel. see sources of revenue above for further information related to fuel-price spreads.
                          acquisitionssince 2002, we have completed over 65 acquisitions of companies and commercial account portfolios. acquisitions have been an important part of our growth strategy, and it is our intention to continue to seek opportunities to increase our customer base and diversify our service offering through further strategic acquisitions. the impact of acquisitions has, and may continue to have, a significant impact on our results of operations and may make it difficult to compare our results between periods.
   interest ratesour results of operations are affected by interest rates. we are exposed to market risk changes in interest rates on our cash investments and debt.
   global economic conditionsour results of operations are materially affected by conditions in the economy generally, both in north america and internationally. factors affected by the economy include our transaction volumes and the credit risk of our customers. these factors affected our businesses in both our north america and international segments.
                        foreign currency changesour results of operations are significantly impacted by changes in foreign currency rates; namely, by movements of the australian dollar, brazilian real, british pound, canadian dollar, czech koruna, euro, mexican peso, new zealand dollar and russian ruble, relative to the u.s. dollar. approximately 72%, 56% and 51% of our revenue in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively, was derived in u.s. dollars and was not affected by foreign currency exchange rates. see results of operations for information related to foreign currency impact on our total revenue, net.
   expenses over the long term, we expect that our general and administrative expense will decrease as a percentage of revenue as our revenue increases. to support our expected revenue growth, we plan to continue to incur additional sales and marketing expense by investing in our direct marketing, third-party agents, internet marketing, telemarketing and field sales force.
acquisitions and investments during 2015, we completed acquisitions of shell portfolios related to our fuel card business in europe, as well as a small acquisition internationally, with an aggregate purchase price of $45.7 million, made additional investments of $8.4 million related to our equity method investment at masternaut and deferred payments of $3.4 million related to acquisitions occurring in prior years.
during 2014, we completed acquisitions with an aggregate purchase price of $3.67 billion, net of cash acquired of $165.8 million.
   in april 2014, we completed an equity method investment in masternaut, europes largest provider of telematics solutions to commercial fleets, included in equity method investment in our consolidated balance sheets. we own 44% of the outstanding equity of masternaut.
   in july 2014, we also acquired pacpride, a u.s. fuel card business, and in august 2014, we acquired a fuel card portfolio from shell in germany (shell germany). the purpose of these acquisitions was to strengthen our presence in the u.s. marketplace and establish our presence in the german fuel card market, respectively.
                         in november 2014, we acquired comdata inc. (comdata) for $3.4 billion. comdata is a leading business-to-business provider of innovative electronic payment solutions. as an issuer and a processor, comdata provides fleet, virtual card and gift card solutions to over 20,000 customers. comdata has approximately 1,300 employees and enables over $54 billion in payments annually. this acquisition complemented the companys current fuel card business in the u.s. and added a new product with the virtual payments business. fleetcor financed the acquisition with approximately $2.4 billion of debt and the issuance of 7,625,380 shares of fleetcor common stock, including amounts applied at the closing to the repayment of comdatas debt.
the results of operations of the shell germany business are included within our international segment, from the date of acquisition. the results of operations from pacpride and comdata are included within our north america segment, from the date of acquisition.
during 2013, we completed acquisitions with an aggregate purchase price of $839.3 million, net of cash acquired of $35.6 million, including deferred payments of $36.8 million and the estimated fair value of contingent consideration payments of $83.1 million. in 2014, we recorded adjustments to the estimated fair value of contingent consideration for 2013 acquisitions of $28.1 million, based on actual results of the business, which
included the impact of an unfavorable tax judgment against vb during the fourth quarter of 2014. in february 2015, the company paid $39.8 million of contingent consideration. the most significant acquisitions are described below.
                         in march 2013, we acquired certain fuel card assets from ge capital australias custom fleet leasing business. the consideration for the transaction was paid using the companys existing cash and credit facilities. ge capitals fleet card is a multi-branded fuel card product with wide acceptance in fuel outlets and automotive service and repair centers across australia. through this transaction, the company acquired the fleet card product, brand, acceptance network contracts, supplier contracts, and approximately one-third of the customer relationships with regards to fuel cards (together, fleet card). the remaining customer relationships will be retained by custom fleet, and are comprised of companies which have commercial relationships with custom fleet beyond fueling, such as fleet management and leasing. the purpose of this acquisition was to establish our presence in the australian marketplace.
                      in april 2013, we acquired all of the outstanding stock of cardlink. the consideration for the transaction was paid using the companys existing cash and credit facilities. cardlink provides a proprietary fuel card program with acceptance at retail fueling stations across new zealand. cardlink markets its fuel cards directly to mostly small-to-midsized businesses, and provides processing and outsourcing services to oil companies and other partners. with this transaction, the company entered into a $12.0 million new zealand dollar ($9.4 million) revolving line of credit, which will be used to fund the working capital needs of the cardlink business. the purpose of this acquisition was to enter the australia and new zealand regions and followed our recent purchase of ge capitals fleet card business in australia.
                    in august 2013, we acquired all of the outstanding stock of vb, a provider of transportation cards and vouchers in brazil. the consideration for the transaction was paid using the companys existing cash and credit facilities. vb is a provider of transportation cards in brazil where employers are required by legislation to provide certain employees with prepaid public transportation cards to subsidize their commuting expenses. vb also markets food cards. the purpose of this acquisition was to strengthen our presence in the brazilian marketplace.
                      in october 2013, we acquired all of the outstanding stock of epyx, a provider to the fleet maintenance, service and repair marketplace in the uk. epyx provides an internet based system and a network of vehicle repair service garages to fleet operators in the uk. the epyx service helps its customers better manage their vehicle maintenance, service, and repair needs. the consideration for the transaction was paid using existing cash and credit facilities.
this acquisition extended our offerings beyond fleet fueling, to fleet maintenance services in the uk marketplace.
   in october 2013, we acquired db, a provider of payment solutions for independent truckers in brazil. the consideration for the transaction was paid using existing cash and credit facilities. with this acquisition, we strengthened our presence in the brazilian marketplace.
                       in october 2013, we acquired nextraq, a u.s. based provider of telematics solutions to small and medium-sized businesses. nextraq provides fleet operators with an internet based system that enhances workforce productivity through real time vehicle tracking, route optimization, job dispatch, and fuel usage monitoring. the consideration for the transaction was paid using existing cash and credit facilities. with this acquisition, we have a cross marketing opportunity due to the similarity of the commercial fleet customer base.
the results of operations of the fleet card, cardlink, vb, epyx and db businesses are included within our international segment, from the date of acquisition. the results from nextraq are included within our north america segment, from the date of acquisition.

1   transactions in 2015 and 2014 include approximately 1.3 billion and 270 million transactions, respectively, related to our svs product, which is part of the comdata business acquired in november 2014. revenue per transaction for the svs product is lower than that generated by our other products.
nm = not meaningful the sum of the columns or rows may not equal the totals or differences due to rounding.
revenues and revenue per transaction our consolidated revenue increased from $1,199.4 million in 2014 to $1,702.9 million in 2015, an increase of $503.5 million, or 42.0%. the increase in our consolidated revenue was primarily due to the following:
   the impact of acquisitions completed in 2014, which contributed approximately $528 million in additional revenue in 2015 over the comparable period in 2014.
   organic growth in certain of our payment programs driven primarily by increases in both volume and revenue per transaction.
    included within organic growth, is the impact of the macroeconomic environment. although we cannot precisely measure the impact of the macroeconomic environment, in total we believe it had a negative impact on our consolidated revenue for 2015 over the comparable period in 2014. the macroeconomic environment was primarily impacted by lower fuel prices and foreign exchange rates, partially offset by higher fuel spread margins.
we use adjusted revenues as a basis to evaluate our revenues, net of the commissions that are paid to merchants that participate in certain of our card programs. the commissions paid to merchants can vary when market spreads fluctuate in much the same way as revenues are impacted when market spreads fluctuate. thus, we believe this is a more effective way to evaluate our revenue performance on a consistent basis. although we cannot precisely measure the impact of the macroeconomic environment, in total we believe it negatively impacted our consolidated adjusted revenues for 2015 over the comparable period in 2014 by approximately $179 million. changes in foreign exchange rates had an unfavorable impact on consolidated adjusted revenues of approximately $90 million, due to unfavorable fluctuations in rates in all geographies, in 2015 over 2014. in addition, we believe the impact of lower fuel prices, partially offset by higher fuel spread margins, had an additional unfavorable impact on consolidated adjusted revenues of approximately $89 million.
consolidated revenue per transaction decreased from $1.84 in 2014 to $0.92 in 2015, a decrease of $0.92 per transaction or 50.0%. excluding the impact of the svs business, which had approximately 1.3 billion and 270 million transactions in 2015 and 2014, respectively, at a lower revenue per transaction, revenue per transaction for 2015 decreased 10.2 % to $2.78 from $3.10 over the comparable period in 2014. revenue per transaction can vary based on the geography, the relevant merchant and customer relationship, the payment product utilized, and the types of products or services purchased. the revenue mix was influenced by our acquisitions, organic growth in the business, and fluctuations in the macroeconomic environment, primarily fuel prices and foreign exchange rates.
north america segment revenues and revenue per transaction north america revenue increased from $668.3 million in 2014 to $1,232.0 million in 2015, an increase of $563.6 million, or 84.3%. the increase in our north america revenue was primarily due to:
   the impact of acquisitions completed in 2014, which contributed approximately $528 million in additional revenue in 2015 over the comparable period in 2014.
   organic growth in certain of our payment programs driven primarily by increases in both volume and revenue per transaction.
   included within organic growth, is the impact of the macroeconomic environment. although we cannot precisely measure the impact of the macroeconomic environment, in total we believe it had a negative impact on our north america segment revenue for 2015 over the comparable period in 2014, primarily due to the impact of lower fuel prices in the u.s., partially offset by higher fuel spread margins.
north america segment revenue per transaction decreased from $1.45 in 2014 to $0.74 in 2015, a decrease of $0.71 or 49.2%. excluding the impact of the svs business, which had approximately 1.3 billion and 270 million transactions in 2015 and 2014, respectively, at a lower revenue per transaction, revenue per transaction in our north america segment in 2015 decreased 15.9% to $2.89 from $3.44 over the comparable period in 2014. revenue per transaction can vary based on the geography, the relevant merchant and customer relationship, the payment product utilized, and the types of products and services purchased. revenue per transaction decreased primarily due to the impact of lower fuel prices and fuel price spreads during 2015 versus the prior year.
international segment revenue international segment revenue decreased from $531.1 million in 2014 to $470.9 million in 2015, a decrease of $60.2 million, or 11.3%. the decrease in international segment revenue was due primarily to the following:
              the impact of the macroeconomic environment, which is included within organic growth. although we cannot precisely measure the impact of the macroeconomic environment, in total we believe it had a negative impact on our international segment revenue for 2015 over the comparable period in 2014, primarily due to changes in foreign exchange rates and lower fuel prices internationally. unfavorable fluctuations in foreign exchange rates in all geographies had an unfavorable impact on revenues in 2015 over the comparable period in 2014.
as discussed, we use adjusted revenues as a basis to evaluate our revenues, net of the commissions that are paid to merchants that participate in certain of our card programs. changes in foreign exchange rates had an unfavorable impact on international adjusted revenues of approximately $90.1 million, due to unfavorable fluctuations in rates in all geographies, in 2015 over 2014.
   organic growth in certain of our payment programs driven primarily by increases in both volume and revenue per transaction.
international segment revenue per transaction decreased from $2.76 in 2014 to $2.56 in 2015, a decrease of $0.20 per transaction or 7.2%, due primarily to the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates across all of our geographies. this unfavorable impact was partially offset by organic revenue growth in several products.
consolidated operating expenses merchant commission. merchant commissions increased from $96.3 million in 2014 to $108.3 million in 2015, an increase of $12.0 million, or 12.5%. this increase was due primarily to the fluctuation of the margin between the wholesale cost and retail price of fuel, which impacted merchant commissions in certain card programs, as well as the impact of higher volume in certain revenue streams where merchant commission are paid, partially offset by decreases due to changes in foreign exchange rates.
processing. processing expenses increased from $173.3 million in 2014 to $331.1 million in 2015, an increase of $157.7 million, or 91.0%. our processing expenses primarily increased due to the impact of our acquisition of comdata completed in the fourth quarter of 2014, partially offset by decreases due to changes in foreign exchange rates.
selling. selling expenses increased from $75.5 million in 2014 to $109.1 million in 2015, an increase of $33.5 million, or 44.4%. the increase was primarily due to our acquisition of comdata completed in the fourth quarter of 2014, as well as additional sales and marketing spending in certain markets, partially offset by decreases due to changes in foreign exchange rates.
general and administrative. general and administrative expense increased from $206.0 million in 2014 to $297.7 million in 2015, an increase of $91.8 million, or 44.5%. the increase was primarily due to the impact of our acquisition of comdata completed in the fourth quarter of 2014 and incremental stock based compensation of $52.5 million, partially offset by decreases due to changes in foreign exchange rates.
depreciation and amortization. depreciation and amortization increased from $112.4 million in 2014 to $193.5 million in 2015, an increase of $81.1 million, or 72.2%. the increase was primarily due to our acquisition of comdata completed during the fourth quarter of 2014, which resulted in an increase of $91.3 million related to the amortization of acquired intangible assets for customer and vendor relationships, trade names and trademarks, non-compete agreements and software, as well as depreciation of acquired fixed assets, partially offset by decreases due to changes in foreign exchange rates.
other operating, net. other operating, net decreased from a $29.5 million favorable impact in 2014 to a $4.2 million favorable impact in 2015, a decrease of $25.3 million, or 85.8%. in 2015, the balance relates primarily to the net favorable impact of the additional reversals of various contingent liabilities for tax indemnifications related to our acquisitions of db and vb in brazil. included in other operating, net in 2014 is $28.1 million of favorable impact related to fair value adjustments recorded for contingent consideration arrangements for our acquisition of vb in brazil and $1.4 million from the reversal of other various contingent liabilities for tax indemnifications related to our acquisitions of db and vb in brazil.
equity method investment loss on april 28, 2014, we acquired a minority interest in masternaut, a provider of telematics solutions to commercial fleets in europe, which we account for as an equity method investment. the increase in equity method investment loss from $8.6 million in 2014 to $57.7 million in 2015 was primarily due to a non-cash impairment charge of $40 million recorded in the fourth quarter of 2015. we regularly evaluate our investments, which are not carried at fair value, for other than temporary impairment in accordance with u. s. gaap. during the fourth quarter, we determined that the performance improvement initiatives at masternaut will take longer to implement than we originally projected. as a result, we have recorded a $40 million non-cash impairment charge in our equity method investment.
interest expense, net interest expense increased from $28.9 million in 2014 to $71.3 million in 2015, an increase of $42.5 million, or 147.2%. the increase is due to an increase in borrowings in 2015 over 2014, primarily due to funding of the purchase price for our acquisition of comdata. the following table sets forth the average interest rates paid on borrowings under our credit facility, excluding the relevant unused credit facility fees.
loss on early extinguishment of debt loss on early extinguishment of debt in 2014 relates to our write-off of $15.8 million of debt issuance costs associated with the refinancing of our existing credit facility and entry into our new credit agreement, along with our acquisition of comdata.
provision for income taxes the provision for income taxes increased from $144.2 million in 2014 to $173.6 million in 2015, an increase of $29.3 million, or 20.3%. our effective tax rate increased from 28.1% in 2014 to 32.4% in 2015. we pay taxes in many different taxing jurisdictions, including the u.s., most u.s. states and many non-u.s. jurisdictions. the tax rates in certain non-u.s. taxing jurisdictions are lower than the u.s. tax rate. consequently, as our earnings fluctuate between taxing jurisdictions, our effective tax rate fluctuates. the increase in the effective tax rate was due primarily to the non-deductible impairment charge of $40 million related to our minority investment in masternaut, as well as the inclusion of the comdata business, which operates primarily in the u.s. with a higher overall tax rate. partially offsetting these negative impacts was the continued decrease in the u.k. statutory tax rates. these initiatives involved amending tax returns for several prior years and produced tax savings of approximately $7.9 million recorded in 2015. we expect that the impact of these planning initiatives will have a favorable impact on tax rates in future years. included in 2014, was one-time tax favorability due to entity reorganization in brazil, which allowed the reversal of deferred tax liability of $9.5 million, setup at the time of acquisition in 2013.
net income for the reasons discussed above, our net income decreased from $368.7 million in 2014 to $362.4 million in 2015, a decrease of $6.3 million, or 1.7%.
operating income and operating margin consolidated operating income operating income increased from $565.4 million in 2014 to $667.5 million in 2015, an increase of $102.1 million, or 18.1%. consolidated operating margin was 47.1% in 2014 and 39.2% in 2015. the increase in operating income was due primarily to the impact of our acquisition of comdata completed in november 2014. these increases were partially offset by the negative impact of the macroeconomic environment, primarily due to lower fuel prices in north america and unfavorable changes in foreign exchange rates, as previously discussed. changes in foreign exchange rates had an unfavorable impact on consolidated operating income of approximately $53 million due to unfavorable fluctuations in rates in all geographies. results were also negatively impacted by the increase in amortization and depreciation expense related to assets acquired in 2014 and increased stock based compensation expense during 2015. the decrease in operating margin was due primarily to the impact of increased operating expenses associated with comdata, including increased depreciation and amortization expense.
for the purpose of segment operating results, we calculate segment operating income by subtracting segment operating expenses from segment revenue. similarly, segment operating margin is calculated by dividing segment operating income by segment revenue.
north america segment operating income north america operating income increased from $287.3 million in 2014 to $442.0 million in 2015, an increase of $154.7 million, or 53.9%. north america operating margin was 43.0% in 2014 and 35.9% in 2015. the increase in operating income was due primarily to the impact of our acquisition of comdata in november 2014, as well as organic growth in the business. the decrease in operating margin was due primarily to the impact of increased operating expenses associated with comdata, including increased depreciation and amortization. in addition, we had increased stock based compensation expense, the majority of which is recorded in our north american segment. furthermore, operating results were also negatively impacted by the macroeconomic environment, primarily due to lower fuel prices, partially offset by higher fuel spread margins.
international segment operating income international operating income decreased from $278.1 million in 2014 to $225.5 million in 2015, a decrease of $52.7 million, or 18.9%. international operating margin was 52.4% in 2014 and 47.9% in 2015. the decrease in operating income was due primarily to the unfavorable impact of the macroeconomic environment, specifically unfavorable changes in foreign exchange rates, which we believe negatively impacted operating income by approximately $53 million, as well as the negative impact of fuel prices internationally. the negative impact of the environment was partially offset by the impact of organic growth in the business driven by increases in volume and revenue per transaction, in local currency. the impact of changes in fuel price spreads was negligible.

revenues and revenue per transaction our consolidated revenue increased from $895.2 million in 2013 to $1,199.4 million in 2014, an increase of $304.2 million, or 34.0%. the increase in our consolidated revenue was primarily due to the following:
   the full year impact of acquisitions completed in 2013 as well as acquisitions completed in 2014, which contributed approximately $183 million in revenue in 2014 over the comparable period in 2013.
   organic growth in certain of our payment programs driven primarily by increases in both volume and revenue per transaction.
                    included within organic growth, is the impact of the macroeconomic environment. although we cannot precisely measure the impact of the macroeconomic environment, in total we believe it had a positive impact on our consolidated revenue for 2014 over the comparable period in 2013. the macroeconomic environment was primarily impacted by higher fuel spread margins in 2014 over the comparable period in 2013, partially offset by the impact of lower fuel prices and foreign exchange rates. changes in foreign exchange rates had an unfavorable impact on revenues of $9.4 million, due primarily to unfavorable fluctuations in the brazilian real, british pound and russian ruble, in 2014 compared with 2013.
consolidated revenue per transaction decreased from $2.73 in 2013 to $1.84 in 2014, a decrease of $0.89 per transaction or 32.7%. consolidated revenue per transaction includes the impact of the svs product, which is part of our comdata business acquired in november 2014. the svs product had approximately 270 million transactions during 2014 at lower revenue per transaction. consolidated revenue per transaction for 2014, excluding the svs product, increased 13.3% to $3.10 from $2.73 in 2013. this increase is primarily a result of organic growth in certain of our payment programs and the full year impact in 2014 of acquisitions completed in 2013, as noted above, as well as acquisitions completed in 2014, some of which have higher revenue per transaction products in comparison to our other businesses. the increase also was due to the impact of the macroeconomic environment, specifically higher fuel spread margins in 2014 over 2013.
north america segment revenues and revenue per transaction north america revenue increased from $460.7 million in 2013 to $668.3 million in 2014, an increase of $207.6 million, or 45.1%. the increase in our north america revenue was primarily due to the following:
   the full period impact of acquisitions completed in 2013, as well as acquisitions completed in 2014, which contributed approximately $104 million in additional revenues in 2014 over the comparable period in 2013.
   organic growth in certain of our payment programs driven primarily by increases in both volume and revenue per transaction.
   included within organic growth, is the impact of the macroeconomic environment. although we cannot precisely measure the impact of the macroeconomic environment, in total we believe it had a positive impact on our north america segment revenue for 2014 over the comparable period in 2013, primarily due to the impact of higher fuel spread margins, partially offset by the impact of lower fuel prices in the u.s.
north america segment revenue per transaction decreased from $2.79 in 2013 to $1.45 in 2014, a decrease of $1.34 per transaction or 48.0%. north american revenue per transaction includes the impact of the svs product, which is part of our comdata business acquired in november 2014. the svs product had approximately 270 million transactions during 2014 at lower revenue per transaction. north american revenue per transaction for 2014, excluding the svs product, increased 23.1% to $3.44 from $2.79 in 2013. this increase is primarily a result of organic growth in certain of our payment programs and the full year impact in 2014 of acquisitions completed in 2013, as noted above, as well as acquisitions completed in 2014, some of which have higher revenue per transaction products in comparison to our other businesses. the increase is also due to the positive impact of the macroeconomic environment; specifically higher fuel spread margins in 2014 compared with 2013.
international segment revenue international segment revenue increased from $434.5 million in 2013 to $531.1 million in 2014, an increase of $96.6 million, or 22.2%. the increase in international segment revenue was due primarily to the following:
   the full period impact of acquisitions completed in 2013, as well as acquisitions completed in 2014, which contributed approximately $79 million in additional revenue in 2014 over the comparable period in 2013.
   organic growth in certain of our payment programs driven primarily by increases in both volume and revenue per transaction.
                  included within organic growth, is the impact of the macroeconomic environment. although we cannot precisely measure the impact of the macroeconomic environment, in total we believe it had a negative impact on our international segment revenue for 2014 over 2013, primarily due to changes in foreign exchange rate and lower fuel prices internationally. changes in foreign exchange rates had an unfavorable impact on revenues of $9.4 million, due primarily to unfavorable fluctuations in the brazilian real, british pound and russian ruble in 2014 over 2013. the impact of foreign exchange rates and lower fuel prices were partially offset by lower fuel spread margins in 2014 over 2013.
international segment revenue per transaction increased from $2.67 in 2013 to $2.76 in 2014, an increase of $0.09 per transaction or 3.2%. this increase in revenue per transaction, as well as the increase in transaction volume, is primarily due to the full period impact of acquisitions completed in 2013 and 2014, some of which have higher revenue per transaction products in comparison to our other businesses, as well as organic growth in certain of our payment programs. we experienced an increase in transactions in our international segment primarily due to organic growth in certain payment programs and the impact of the acquisitions completed in 2014 and the full year impact of acquisitions completed in 2013.
consolidated operating expenses merchant commission. merchant commissions increased from $68.2 million in 2013 to $96.3 million in 2014, an increase of $28.1 million, or 41.3%. this increase was due primarily to additional commissions paid due to higher fuel spread margins, as well as the impact of higher volume in revenue streams where merchant commissions are paid.
processing. processing expenses increased from $134.0 million in 2013 to $173.3 million in 2014, an increase of $39.3 million, or 29.3%. our processing expenses increased primarily due to acquisitions completed in 2013 and 2014 and organic growth in transaction volume, as well as incremental bad debt expense of approximately $3.0 million in our russia business due to the slowdown in their economy.
selling. selling expenses increased from $57.4 million in 2013 to $75.5 million in 2014, an increase of $18.2 million, or 31.7%. the increase was primarily due to acquisitions completed in 2013 and 2014, as well as additional sales and marketing spending in certain markets.
general and administrative. general and administrative expense increased from $142.3 million in 2013 to $206.0 million in 2014, an increase of $63.7 million, or 44.8%. our general and administrative expenses increased primarily due to the impact of acquisitions completed in 2013 and 2014, as well as approximately $22.6 million of incremental one-time deal related costs related to severance and legal fees, accounting, tax, and various advisory fees, as well as additional stock based compensation expense of $12.8 million.
depreciation and amortization. depreciation and amortization increased from $72.7 million in 2013 to $112.4 million in 2014, an increase of $39.6 million, or 54.5%. the increase in our depreciation and amortization expense is primarily due to acquisitions completed during 2013 and 2014, which resulted in an increase of $38.3 million related to the amortization of acquired intangible assets for customer and vendor relationships, trade names and trademarks, non-compete agreements and software and increased depreciation expense.
other operating, net. other operating, net of $29.5 million in 2014, represents the $28.1 million favorable impact of fair value adjustments recorded related to contingent consideration arrangements for our acquisition of vb in brazil and the net favorable impact of $1.4 million from the reversal of other various contingent liabilities for tax indemnifications related to our acquisitions of db and vb in brazil.
equity method investment loss on april 28, 2014, we acquired a minority interest in masternaut, a provider of telematics solutions to commercial fleets in europe, which we account for as an equity method investment. the loss at masternaut was driven primarily by amortization of intangible assets at this investment of approximately $8.0 million in 2014.
interest expense, net interest expense increased from $16.4 million in 2013 to $28.9 million in 2014, an increase of $12.4 million, or 75.3%. the increase in interest expense is due to an increase in borrowings in 2014 over 2013, primarily due to funding the purchase price for acquisitions as well as increased interest rates as a result of the uptick in our leverage ratio due to the additional borrowings to fund acquisitions. the following table sets forth the average interest rates paid on borrowings under our credit facility, excluding the relevant unused credit facility fees.
loss on early extinguishment of debt loss on early extinguishment of debt relates to our write-off of $15.8 million of debt issuance costs associated with the refinancing of our existing credit facility and entry into our new credit agreement, along with our recent acquisition of comdata.
provision for income taxes the provision for income taxes increased from $119.1 million in 2013 to $144.2 million in 2014, an increase of $25.2 million, or 21.1%. our effective tax rate decreased from 29.5% in 2013 to 28.1% in 2014. the effective tax rate in 2014 was favorably impacted by entity reorganization in brazil, which allowed the reversal of deferred tax liability of $9.5 million, setup at the time of acquisition in 2013.
we pay taxes in many different taxing jurisdictions, including the u.s., most u.s. states and many non-u.s. jurisdictions. the tax rates in certain non-u.s. taxing jurisdictions are lower than the u.s. tax rate. consequently, as our earnings fluctuate between taxing jurisdictions, our effective tax rate fluctuates. the lower tax rate in 2014 was also driven by a shift in the mix of earnings, largely due to acquisitions, to foreign jurisdictions with lower tax rates.
net income for the reasons discussed above, our net income increased from $284.5 million in 2013 to $368.7 million in 2014, an increase of $84.2 million, or 29.6%.
operating income and operating margin consolidated operating income operating income increased from $420.6 million in 2013 to $565.4 million in 2014, an increase of $144.8 million, or 34.4%. consolidated operating margin was 47.0% in 2013 and 47.1% in 2014. the increase in operating income is due primarily to the impact of acquisitions completed during 2013 and 2014, organic growth in the business driven by increases in volume and revenue per transactions. we believe the impact of the macroeconomic environment was positive to consolidated operating results in 2014 over 2013, primarily due to higher fuel spread margins. these positive drivers of consolidated results were partially offset by incremental stock based compensation expense, increased amortization expense related to acquired intangible assets, increased bad debt expense in our russian business and incremental one-time costs related to acquisitions of $22.6 million.
for the purpose of segment operating results, we calculate segment operating income by subtracting segment operating expenses from segment revenue. similarly, segment operating margin is calculated by dividing segment operating income by segment revenue.
north america segment operating income north america operating income increased from $220.5 million in 2013 to $287.3 million in 2014, an increase of $66.8 million, or 30.3%. north america operating margin was 47.9% in 2013 and 43.0% in 2014. the increase in operating income is due primarily to the impact of acquisitions completed in 2013 and 2014, as well as organic growth in the business driven by increases in volume and revenue per transaction. we believe that the impact of the macroeconomic environment was positive to north american operating results in 2014 over 2013, primarily
due to higher fuel spread margins. the decrease in operating margin is due primarily to the impact of increased stock based compensation expense, the majority of which is recorded in our north america segment, as well as incremental one-time deal related expenses of $26.6 million primarily incurred related to our acquisition of comdata during 2014.
international segment operating income international operating income increased from $200.1 million in 2013 to $278.1 million in 2014, an increase of $78.0 million, or 39.0%. international operating margin was 46.1% in 2013 and 52.4% in 2014. the increase in operating income and operating margin is due primarily to the impact of acquisitions completed in 2013 and 2014 and organic growth in the business driven by increases in volume and revenue per transaction. we believe that the impact of the macroeconomic environment was negative to international operating results in 2014 over 2013, due primarily to unfavorable fluctuations in the brazilian real, british pound and russian ruble. included in international operating income was the favorable impact of adjustments recorded related to contingent consideration arrangements for our acquisition of vb in brazil of $28.1 million, the net favorable impact from reversal of other various contingent liabilities for tax indemnifications related to our acquisitions of db and vb in brazil of approximately $1.4 million and incremental savings on deal fees over the comparable period in 2013 of $4.1 million. these favorable items contributed to the increase in operating margin from 2013 to 2014.
liquidity and capital resources our principal liquidity requirements are to service and repay our indebtedness, complete acquisitions of businesses and commercial account portfolios and meet working capital, tax and capital expenditure needs.
sources of liquidity at december 31, 2015, our unrestricted cash and cash equivalents balance totaled $447.2 million. our restricted cash balance at december 31, 2015 totaled $167.5 million. restricted cash primarily represents customer deposits in the czech republic and in our comdata business in the u.s., which we are restricted from using other than to repay customer deposits.
at december 31, 2015, cash and cash equivalents held in foreign subsidiaries where we have determined we are permanently reinvested is $258.7 million. all of the cash and cash equivalents held by our foreign subsidiaries, excluding restricted cash, are available for general corporate purposes. our current intent is to permanently reinvest these funds outside of the u.s. our current expectation for funds held in our foreign subsidiaries is to use the funds to finance foreign organic growth, to pay for potential future foreign acquisitions and to repay any foreign borrowings that may arise from time to time. we currently believe that funds generated from our u.s. operations, along with available borrowing capacity in the u.s. will be sufficient to fund our u.s. operations for the foreseeable future, and therefore do not foresee a need to repatriate cash held by our foreign subsidiaries in a taxable transaction to fund our u.s. operations. however, if at a future date or time these funds are needed for our operations in the u.s. or we otherwise believe it is in our best interests to repatriate all or a portion of such funds, we may be required to accrue and pay u.s. taxes to repatriate these funds. no assurances can be provided as to the amount or timing thereof, the tax consequences related thereto or the ultimate impact any such action may have on our results of operations or financial condition.
we utilize an accounts receivable securitization facility to finance a majority of our domestic fuel card receivables, to lower our cost of borrowing and more efficiently use capital. we generate and record accounts receivable when a customer makes a purchase from a merchant using one of our card products and generally pay merchants within seven days of receiving the merchant billing. as a result, we utilize the securitization facility as a source of liquidity to provide the cash flow required to fund merchant payments while we collect customer balances. these balances are primarily composed of charge balances, which are typically billed to the customer on a weekly, semimonthly or monthly basis, and are generally required to be paid within 14 days of billing. we
also consider the undrawn amounts under our securitization facility and credit facility as funds available for working capital purposes and acquisitions. at december 31, 2015, we had the ability to generate approximately $4 million of additional liquidity under our securitization facility. at december 31, 2015, we had approximately $875 million available under our credit facility.
based on our current forecasts and anticipated market conditions, we believe that our current cash balances, our available borrowing capacity and our ability to generate cash from operations, will be sufficient to fund our liquidity needs for at least the next twelve months. however, we regularly evaluate our cash requirements for current operations, commitments, capital requirements and acquisitions, and we may elect to raise additional funds for these purposes in the future, either through the issuance of debt or equity securities. we may not be able to obtain additional financing on terms favorable to us, if at all.
net cash provided by operating activities                       $754.6                     $608.3                   $375.7
operating activities. net cash provided by operating activities increased from $608.3 million in 2014 to $754.6 million in 2015, despite a slight decrease in net income. the increase is primarily due to changes in working capital and increases in certain non-cash expenses, including amortization of intangible assets of $73.6 million, stock-based compensation of $52.5 million and equity method investment loss of $49.1 million.
net cash provided by operating activities increased from $375.7 million in 2013 to $608.3 million in 2014. the increase is primarily due to changes in working capital, increases in amortization of acquired intangibles of $36.4 million, as well as additional net income during 2014 over 2013 of $84.2 million, partially offset by fair value adjustments for contingent consideration of $27.5 million.
financing activities. net cash provided by financing activities was $2,162.3 million in 2014 as compared to net cash used in financing activities of $648.1 million in 2015. the change is primarily due to increased net borrowings on our credit facility and our securitization facility in 2014 primarily due to funding the purchase price for comdata. additionally, we made payments on contingent consideration arrangements of $42 million in 2015 that were not made in 2014.
net cash provided by financing activities increased from $435.7 million in 2013 to $2,162.3 million in 2014. the increase in cash provided by financing activities is primarily due to increased net borrowings on our credit facility and securitization facility of $1,456.4 million and $275 million, respectively, in 2014 over 2013, primarily due to funding the purchase price for comdata.
capital spending summary our capital expenditures increased from $27.1 million in 2014 to $41.9 million 2015, an increase of $14.8 million, or 54.7%. the increase was primarily due to the impact of our acquisition of comdata in november 2014.
our capital expenditures increased from $20.8 million in 2013 to $27.1 million in 2014, an increase of $6.3 million, or 30.2%. the increase was primarily related to additional spending related to our businesses acquired in 2013 and 2014.
credit facility on october 24, 2014, fleetcor technologies operating company, llc, and certain of our domestic and foreign owned subsidiaries, as designated co-borrowers (the borrowers), entered into a new $3.355 billion credit agreement (the new credit agreement), with bank of america, n.a., as administrative agent, swing line lender and local currency issuer, and a syndicate of financial institutions (the lenders). the new credit agreement provides for senior secured credit facilities consisting of (a) a revolving a credit facility in the amount of $1.0 billion, with sublimits for letters of credit, swing line loans and multicurrency borrowings, (b) a revolving b facility in the amount of $35 million for loans in australian dollars or new zealand dollars, (c) a term loan a facility in the amount of $2.02 billion and (d) a term loan b facility in the amount $300 million. the new credit agreement also contains an accordion feature for borrowing an additional $500 million in term a or revolver a and term b. proceeds from the new credit facility may be used for working capital purposes, acquisitions, and other general corporate purposes. the proceeds of the new credit facility were used to paydown borrowings under the existing credit facility as discussed below. on november 14, 2014 in order to finance a portion of the comdata acquisition and to refinance our existing credit agreement, we made initial borrowings under the new credit agreement.
the new credit agreement replaced the existing credit agreement, which was a five-year, $900 million credit agreement (the existing credit agreement) with bank of america, n.a., as administrative agent, swing line lender and l/c issuer, and a syndicate of financial institutions (the lenders) entered into on june 22, 2011. on march 13, 2012, we entered into the first amendment to the existing credit agreement. the amendment added two u.k. entities as designated borrowers and added a $110 million foreign currency swing line subfacility under the existing revolver, which allows for alternate currency borrowing on the swing line. the amendment also permitted us to provide a cash deposit of up to $50 million in connection with one of our mastercard programs. on november 6, 2012, we entered into a second amendment to the credit agreement to increase our total borrowing capacity from $900 million to $1.4 billion, comprised of an increase to the term loan from $300 million to $550 million and an increase to the revolving line of credit from $600 million to $850 million. in addition, we increased the accordion feature from $150 million to $250 million. the interest rates on the amended credit agreement did not change. on march 20, 2013, we entered into a third amendment to the credit agreement to extend the term of the facility for an additional five years from the amendment date, with a new maturity date of march 20, 2018, separated the revolver into two tranches (a $815 million revolving a facility and a $35 million revolving b facility), added a designated borrower in australia and another in new zealand, with the ability to borrow in local currency and u.s. dollars under the revolving b facility and removed a cap to allow for additional investments in certain business relationships. the revolving line of credit contains a $20 million sublimit for letters of credit, a $20 million sublimit for swing line loans and sublimits for multicurrency borrowings in euros, sterling, japanese yen, australian dollars and new zealand dollars.
the obligations of the borrowers under the new credit agreement are secured by substantially all of the assets of the company and its domestic subsidiaries, pursuant to a security agreement and includes a pledge of (i) 100% of the issued and outstanding equity interests owned by us of each domestic subsidiary and (2) 66% of the voting shares of the first-tier foreign subsidiaries, but excluding real property, personal property located outside of the united states, accounts receivables and related assets subject to the securitization facility and certain investments required under money transmitter laws to be held free and clear of liens. at december 31, 2015, we
interest on amounts outstanding under the new credit agreement (other than the term loan b facility) accrues based on the british bankers association libor rate (the eurocurrency rate), plus a margin based on a leverage ratio, or our option, the base rate (defined as the rate equal to the highest of (a) the federal funds rate plus 0.50%, (b) the prime rate announced by bank of america, n.a., or (c) the eurocurrency rate plus 1.00%) plus a margin based on a leverage ratio. interest is payable quarterly in arrears. interest on the term loan b facility accrues based on the eurocurrency rate or the base rate, as described above, except that the applicable margin is fixed at 3% for eurocurency loans and at 2% for base rate loans. in addition, we have agreed to pay a quarterly commitment fee at a rate per annum ranging from 0.20% to 0.40% of the daily unused portion of the credit facility. at december 31, 2015, the interest rate on the term loan a facility was 1.92%, domestic revolving a facility was 1.83% and the term loan b facility was 3.75%. the rate on the unused credit facility was 0.30% for all facilities at december 31, 2015. there were no borrowings outstanding at december 31, 2015 on the foreign revolving a facility, the foreign revolving b facility, the u.s. or foreign swing line of credit.
the stated maturity dates for our term loan a, revolving loans, and letters of credit under the new credit agreement is november 14, 2019 and november 14, 2021 for our term loan b. the term loans are payable in quarterly installments and are due on the last business day of each march, june, september, and december with the final principal payment due on the respective maturity date. borrowings on the revolving line of credit are repayable at our option of one, two, three or nine months after borrowing, depending on the term of the borrowing on the facility. borrowings on the foreign swing line of credit are due no later than ten business days after such loan is made.
our new credit agreement contains a number of negative covenants restricting, among other things, limitations on liens (with exceptions for our securitization facility) and investments, incurrence or guarantees of indebtedness, mergers, acquisitions, dissolutions, liquidations and consolidations, dispositions, dividends and other restricted payments and prepayments of other indebtedness. in particular, we are not permitted to make any restricted payments (which includes any dividend or other distribution) except that the we may declare and make dividend payments or other distributions to our stockholders so long as (i) on a pro forma basis both before and after the distribution the consolidated leverage ratio is not greater than 3.00:1.00 and we are in compliance with the financial covenants and (ii) no default or event of default shall exist or result therefrom. the new credit agreement also contains customary events of default. the new credit agreement includes financial covenants where the company is required to maintain a consolidated leverage ratio to consolidated ebitda of less than (i) 4.25 to 1.0 as of the end of any fiscal quarter prior to december 31, 2015; (ii) 4.00 to 1.0 as of any fiscal quarter after december 31, 2015 but on or prior to december 31, 2016; (iii) 3.75 to 1.0 as of any fiscal quarter after december 31, 2016 but on or prior to june 30, 2018; 3.50 to 1.0 as of any fiscal quarter after june 30, 2018; and a consolidated interest coverage ratio of no more than 4.00 to 1.0.
during 2015, we made principal payments of $101 million on the term loan a, $2.5 million on the term loan b, $435 million on the domestic revolving a facility and $51.8 million on the foreign revolving a facility.
new zealand facility on april 29, 2013, we entered into a $12 million new zealand dollar ($9.4 million) facility with westpac bank in new zealand (new zealand facility). this facility was for purposes of funding the working capital needs of our cardlink business in new zealand. this facility was terminated on september 30, 2015.
parties thereto, which was amended and restated for the fifth time as of november 14, 2014. we refer to this arrangement as the securitization facility. the current purchase limit under the securitization facility is $950 million.
on november 14, 2014, in order to finance a portion of the comdata acquisition, the company and certain of its subsidiaries entered into a fifth amended and restated receivables purchase agreement (the new receivables purchase agreement), which amended and restated the fourth amended and restated receivables purchase agreement dated as of october 29, 2007 (as amended, the existing receivables purchase agreement), which was most recently amended on february 3, 2014, pursuant to the tenth amendment to the fourth amended and restated receivables purchase agreement. under the terms of the new receivables purchase agreement, the purchase limit was increased from $500 million to $1.2 billion, the term of the facility was extended to november 14, 2017, financial covenants and additional purchasers were added to the facility. on november 5, 2015, the first amendment to the fifth amended and restated receivables purchase agreement was entered into which allowed the company to enter into a new contract with bp and modified the eligible receivables definition and on december 1, 2015, the second amendment to the fifth amended and restated receivables purchase agreement was entered into which reduced the commitments from $1.2 billion to $950 million.
the existing receivables purchase agreement was amended for the seventh time on february 6, 2012 to add a new purchaser and extend the facility termination date, for the eighth time on february 4, 2013 to extend the facility termination date, for the ninth time on september 25, 2013 to change a committed purchaser, and for the tenth time on february 3, 2014 to extend the facility termination date, change pricing and to return to prorated funding by participating banks. there is a program fee equal to one month libor and the commercial paper rate of 0.43% plus 0.90% and 0.18% plus 0.90% as of december 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. the unused facility fee is payable at a rate of 0.40% per annum as of december 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.
under a related purchase and sale agreement, dated as of december 20, 2004, amended on july 7, 2008 and most recently amended on november 14, 2014 to include comdata as an originator, between fleetcor funding llc, as purchaser, and certain of our subsidiaries, as originators, the receivables generated by the originators are deemed to be sold to fleetcor funding llc immediately and without further action upon creation of such receivables. at the request of fleetcor funding llc, as seller, undivided percentage ownership interests in the receivables are ratably purchased by the purchasers in amounts not to exceed their respective commitments under the facility. collections on receivables are required to be made pursuant to a written credit and collection policy and may be reinvested in other receivables, may be held in trust for the purchasers, or may be distributed. fees are paid to each purchaser agent for the benefit of the purchasers and liquidity providers in the related purchaser group in accordance with the securitization facility and certain fee letter agreements.
the securitization facility provides for certain termination events, which includes nonpayment, upon the occurrence of which the administrator may declare the facility termination date to have occurred, may exercise certain enforcement rights with respect to the receivables, and may appoint a successor servicer, among other things.
we were in compliance with all financial and non-financial covenant requirements related to our securitization facility as of december 31, 2015.
other liabilities in connection with our acquisition of certain businesses, we owe final payments of $9.2 million, which are payable $7.5 million in the next twelve months and $1.7 million in periods beyond a year.
stock repurchase program on february 4, 2016, our board of directors approved a stock repurchase program under which we may begin purchasing up to $500 million of its common stock over the next 18 months. any stock repurchases may be made at times and in such amounts as we deem appropriate. the timing and amount of stock repurchase, if any, will
depend on a variety of factors including the stock price, market conditions, corporate and regulatory requirements, and any additional constraints related to material inside information we may possess. the repurchase is expected to be funded by available cash flow from the business and working capital.
critical accounting policies and estimates in applying the accounting policies that we use to prepare our consolidated financial statements, we necessarily make accounting estimates that affect our reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses. some of these estimates require us to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time we make the accounting estimates. we base these assumptions and the resulting estimates on historical information and other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, and we evaluate these assumptions and estimates on an ongoing basis. in many instances, however, we reasonably could have used different accounting estimates and, in other instances, changes in our accounting estimates could occur from period to period, with the result in each case being a material change in the financial statement presentation of our financial condition or results of operations. we refer to estimates of this type as critical accounting estimates. our significant accounting policies are summarized in the consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere in this report. the critical accounting estimates that we discuss below are those that we believe are most important to an understanding of our consolidated financial statements.
see footnote 2 to the consolidated financial statements, summary of significant accounting policies.
revenue recognition and presentation revenue is derived from our merchant and network relationships as well as from customers and partners. we recognize revenue on fees generated through services to commercial fleets, commercial businesses, major oil companies, petroleum marketers and leasing companies and record revenue net of the wholesale cost of the underlying products and services based on the following: (i) we are not the primary obligor in the arrangement and we are not responsible for fulfillment and the acceptability of the product; (ii) we have no inventory risk, do not bear the risk of product loss and do not make any changes to the product or have any involvement in the product specifications; (iii) we do not have significant latitude with respect to establishing the price for the product (predominantly fuel) and (iv) the amount we earn for our services is fixed, within a limited range.
through our merchant and network relationships we provide fuel, prepaid cards, vehicle maintenance, lodging, food, toll, and transportation related services to our customers. we derive revenue from our merchant and network relationships based on the difference between the price charged to a customer for a transaction and the price paid to the merchant or network for the same transaction. our net revenue consists of margin on sales and fees for technical support, processing, communications and reporting. the price paid to a merchant or network may be calculated as (i) the merchants wholesale cost of the product plus a markup; (ii) the transaction purchase price less a percentage discount; or (iii) the transaction purchase price less a fixed fee per unit. the difference between the price we pay to a merchant and the merchants wholesale cost for the underlying products and services is considered a merchant commission and is recognized as expense when the fuel purchase transaction is executed. we recognize revenue from merchant and network relationships when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, the services have been provided to the customer, the sales price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured. we have entered into agreements with major oil companies, petroleum marketers and leasing companies, among others, that specify that a transaction is deemed to be captured when we have validated that the transaction has no errors and have accepted and posted the data to our records.
we also derive revenue from customers and partners from a variety of program fees including transaction fees, card fees, network fees, report fees and other transaction-based fees which typically are calculated based on measures such as percentage of dollar volume processed, number of transactions processed, or some combination thereof. such services are provided through proprietary networks or through the use of third-party networks. transaction fees and other transaction-based fees generated from our proprietary networks and third-party
networks are recognized at the time the transaction is captured. card fees, network fees and program fees are recognized as we fulfill our contractual service obligations. in addition, we recognize revenue from late fees and finance charges, in jurisdictions where permitted under local regulations, primarily in the u.s. and canada. such fees are recognized net of a provision for estimated uncollectible amounts, at the time the fees and finance charges are assessed and services are provided. the company ceases billing and accruing for late fees and finance charges approximately 30-40 days after the customers balance becomes delinquent.
we also charge our customers transaction fees to load value onto prepaid fuel, food, toll and transportation vouchers and cards. we recognize fee revenue upon providing the activated fuel, food, toll and transportation vouchers and prepaid cards to the customer. revenue is recognized from the processing arrangements with merchants when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, the services have been provided, the sales price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured. revenue is recognized on lodging and transportation management services when the lodging stay or transportation service is completed. revenue is also derived from the sale of equipment in certain of our businesses, which is recognized at the time the device is sold and the risks and rewards of ownership have passed. this revenue is recognized gross of the cost of sales related to the equipment in revenues, net within the consolidated statements of income. the related cost of sales for the equipment is recorded within processing expenses. we have recorded $84.1 million of expenses related to sales of equipment within the processing expenses line of the consolidated statements of income in 2015.
our fiscal year ends on december 31. in certain of our u.k. businesses, we record the operating results using a 4-4-5 week accounting cycle with the fiscal year ending on the friday on or immediately preceding december 31. fiscal years 2015 and 2014 include 52 weeks for the businesses reporting using a 4-4-5 accounting cycle. fiscal year 2013 included 53 weeks for business reporting using a 4-4-5 accounting cycle.
we deliver both stored value cards and card-based services primarily in the form of gift cards. for multiple-deliverable customer contracts, stored value cards and card-based services are separated into two units of accounting. stored valued cards are generally recognized upon shipment to the customer. card-based services are recognized when the card services are rendered.
accounts receivable as described above under the heading securitization facility, we maintain a revolving trade accounts receivable securitization facility. the current purchase limit under the securitization facility is $950 million. accounts receivable collateralized within our securitization facility relate to trade receivables resulting from charge card activity. pursuant to the terms of the securitization facility, we transfer certain of our domestic receivables, on a evolving basis, to fleetcor funding llc (funding), a wholly-owned bankruptcy remote subsidiary (conduit). in turn, funding sells, without recourse, on a revolving basis, up to $950 million of undivided ownership interests in this pool of accounts receivable to a multi-seller, asset-backed commercial paper conduit. funding maintains a subordinated interest, in the form of over collateralization, in a portion of the receivables sold to the conduit. purchases by the conduit are financed with the sale of highly-rated commercial paper.
we utilize proceeds from the sale of our accounts receivable as an alternative to other forms of financing, effectively reducing our overall borrowing costs. we have agreed to continue servicing the sold receivables for the financial institutions at market rates, which approximates our cost of servicing. we retain a residual interest in the accounts receivable sold as a form of credit enhancement. the residual interests fair value approximates carrying value due to its short-term nature. funding determines the level of funding achieved by the sale of trade accounts receivable, subject to a maximum amount.
on november 14, 2014, in order to finance a portion of the comdata acquisition, the company and certain of its subsidiaries entered into a new receivables purchase agreement. under the terms of the new receivables purchase agreement, the purchase limit was increased from $500 million to $1.2 billion, and the term of the facility was extended to november 14, 2017. on november 5, 2015, the first amendment to the fifth amended
all foreign receivables are owned receivables and are not included in our receivable securitization program. at december 31, 2015 and 2014, there was $614 million and $675 million, respectively, of short-term debt outstanding under our securitization facility.
credit risk and reserve for losses on receivables we control credit risk by performing periodic credit evaluations of our customers. payments from customers are generally due within 14 days of billing. we routinely review our accounts receivable balances and make provisions for probable doubtful accounts based primarily on the aging of those balances. accounts receivable are deemed uncollectible once they age past 90 days and are deemed uncollectible from the customer. we provide an allowance for receivables aged less than 90 days that we expect will be uncollectible based on historical collections experience and would include accounts that have filed for bankruptcy. at december 31, 2015, approximately 98% of outstanding accounts receivable were current. accounts receivable deemed uncollectible are removed from accounts receivable and the allowance for doubtful accounts when internal collection efforts have been exhausted and accounts have been turned over to a third-party collection agency. recoveries from the third-party collection agency are not significant.
impairment of long-lived assets, intangibles and equity method investment we test our other long-lived assets for impairment in accordance with relevant authoritative guidance. we evaluate whether impairment indicators related to our property, plant and equipment and other long-lived assets are present. these impairment indicators may include a significant decrease in the market price of a long-lived asset or asset group, a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which a long-lived asset or asset group is being used or in its physical condition, or a current-period operating or cash flow loss combined with a history of operating or cash flow losses or a forecast that demonstrates continuing losses associated with the use of a long-lived asset or asset group. if impairment indicators are present, we estimate the future cash flows for the asset or group of assets. the sum of the undiscounted future cash flows attributable to the asset or group of assets is compared to their carrying amount. the cash flows are estimated utilizing various projections of revenues and expenses, working capital and proceeds from asset disposals on a basis consistent with managements intended actions. if the carrying amount exceeds the sum of the undiscounted future cash flows, we determine the assets fair value by discounting the future cash flows using a discount rate required for a similar investment of like risk and records an impairment charge as the difference between the fair value and the carrying value of the asset group. generally, we perform our testing of the asset group at the business-line level, as this is the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are available.
we complete an asset impairment test of goodwill at least annually or more frequently if facts or circumstances indicate that goodwill might be impaired. goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level, and the impairment test consists of two steps, as well as a qualitative assessment, as appropriate. as deemed appropriate, we have performed a qualitative assessment of certain of our reporting units. in this qualitative assessment we individually considered the following items for each reporting unit where we determined a qualitative analysis to be appropriate: the macroeconomic conditions, including any deterioration of general conditions, limitations on accessing capital, fluctuations in foreign exchange rates and other developments in equity and credit markets; industry and market conditions, including any deterioration in the environment where the reporting unit operates, increased competition, changes in the products/services and regulator and political developments; cost of doing business; overall financial performance, including any declining cash flows and performance in relation to planned revenues and earnings in past periods; other relevant reporting unit specific facts, such as changes in management or key personnel or pending litigation; events affecting the reporting unit, including changes in the
carrying value of net assets, likelihood of disposal and whether there were any other impairment considerations within the business; the overall performance of our share price in relation to the market and our peers; and a quantitative stress test of the previously completed step 1 test from the prior year, updated with current year results, weighted-average cost of capital rates and future projections.
we completed step 1 of the goodwill impairment testing for certain of our reporting units for which the qualitative assessment was not performed. in this first step the reporting units carrying amount, including goodwill is compared to its fair value which is measured based upon, among other factors, a discounted cash flow analysis as well as market multiples for comparable companies. if the carrying amount of the reporting unit is greater than its fair value, goodwill is considered impaired and step two must be performed. step two measures the impairment loss by comparing the implied fair value of reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill. the implied fair value of goodwill is determined by allocating the fair value of the reporting unit to all the assets and liabilities of that unit (including unrecognized intangibles) as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination. the excess of fair value over the amounts allocated to the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit is the implied fair value of goodwill. the excess of the carrying amount over the implied fair value is the impairment loss.
we estimate the fair value of our reporting units using a combination of the income approach and the market approach. the income approach utilizes a discounted cash flow model incorporating managements expectations for future revenue, operating expenses, earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, capital expenditures and an anticipated tax rate. we discount the related cash flow forecasts using an estimated weighted-average cost of capital for each reporting unit at the date of valuation. the market approach utilizes comparative market multiples in the valuation estimate. multiples are derived by relating the value of guideline companies, based on either the market price of publicly traded shares or the prices of companies being acquired in the marketplace, to various measures of their earnings and cash flow. such multiples are then applied to the historical and projected earnings and cash flow of the reporting unit in developing the valuation estimate.
preparation of forecasts and the selection of the discount rates involve significant judgments about expected future business performance and general market conditions. significant changes in forecasts, the discount rates selected or the weighting of the income and market approach could affect the estimated fair value of one or more of our reporting units and could result in a goodwill impairment charge in a future period.
based on the goodwill asset impairment analysis performed quantitatively and qualitatively on october 1, 2015, we determined that the fair value of each of our reporting units is in excess of the carrying value. no events or changes in circumstances have occurred since the date of our most recent annual impairment test that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount.
we also evaluate indefinite-lived intangible assets (primarily trademarks and trade names) for impairment annually. we also test for impairment if events and circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value of an indefinite-lived intangible asset is below its carrying amount. estimates critical to our evaluation of indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment include the discount rate, royalty rates used in our evaluation of trade names, projected average revenue growth and projected long-term growth rates in the determination of terminal values. an impairment charge is recorded if the carrying amount of an indefinite-lived intangible asset exceeds the estimated fair value on the measurement date.
we also regularly evaluate the carrying value of our equity method investment, which is not carried at fair value, for other-than-temporary impairment. we estimate the fair value of our equity method investment using a combination of the income approach and the market approach. the income approach utilizes a discounted cash flow model incorporating managements expectations for future revenue, operating expenses, earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, capital expenditures and an anticipated tax rate. we discount the related cash flow forecasts using an estimated weighted-average cost of capital for each reporting unit at the date of valuation. the market approach utilizes comparative market multiples in the valuation estimate. multiples are derived by relating the value of guideline companies, based on either the market price of publicly traded shares
or the prices of companies being acquired in the marketplace, to various measures of their earnings and cash flow. such multiples are then applied to the historical and projected earnings and cash flow of our equity method investment in developing the valuation estimate. during the fourth quarter of 2015, we determined that the performance improvement initiatives in our equity method investment in masternaut will take longer to implement than we originally projected. as a result, we have recorded a $40 million non-cash impairment charge in our equity method investment.
income taxes we account for income taxes under the asset and liability method. deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in the period that includes the enactment date.
the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which the associated temporary differences became deductible. on a quarterly basis, we evaluate whether it is more likely than not that our deferred tax assets will be realized in the future and conclude whether a valuation allowance must be established.
we do not provide deferred taxes for the undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries that are considered to be indefinitely reinvested outside of the united states in accordance with authoritative literature. we include any estimated interest and penalties on tax related matters in income tax expense.
we do not provide deferred taxes for the undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries that are considered to be indefinitely reinvested outside of the united states in accordance with relevant authoritative literature. if in the future these earnings are repatriated to the united states, or if we determine that the earnings will be remitted in the foreseeable future, additional tax provisions may be required.
current guidance clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an entitys financial statements and prescribes threshold and measurement attributes for financial statement disclosure of tax positions taken or expected to be taken on a tax return. under the relevant authoritative literature, the impact of an uncertain income tax position on the income tax return must be recognized at the largest amount that is more likely than not to be sustained upon audit by the relevant taxing authority. an uncertain income tax position will not be recognized if it has less than a 50 percent likelihood of being sustained.
business combinations we have accounted for business combinations under the acquisition method of accounting. the acquisition method requires that the acquired assets and liabilities including contingencies, be recorded at fair value determined on the acquisition date and changes thereafter reflected in income. for significant acquisitions, we obtain independent third party valuation studies for certain of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed to assist in determining fair value. goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed. the estimation of the fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed involves a number of estimates and assumptions that could differ materially from the actual amounts recorded. the results of the acquired businesses are included in our results of operations beginning from the completion date of the applicable transaction.
estimates of fair value are revised during an allocation period as necessary when, and if, information becomes available to further define and quantify the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed. the allocation period does not exceed one year from the date of the acquisition. to the extent additional information to refine the original allocation becomes available during the allocation period, the allocation of the purchase
price is adjusted. should information become available after the allocation period, those items are adjusted through operating results. the direct costs of the acquisition are recorded as operating expenses. certain acquisitions include contingent consideration related to the performance of the acquired operations following the acquisition. contingent consideration is recorded at estimated fair value at the date of the acquisition and is remeasured each reporting period, with any changes in fair value recorded in the consolidated statements of income. we estimate the fair value of the acquisition-related contingent consideration using various valuation approaches, as well as significant unobservable inputs, reflecting our assessment of the assumptions market participants would use to value these liabilities.
stock-based compensation we account for employee stock options and restricted stock in accordance with relevant authoritative literature. stock options are granted with an exercise price estimated to be equal to the fair market value on the date of grant as authorized by our board of directors. options granted have vesting provisions ranging from one to six years. stock option grants are subject to forfeiture if employment terminates prior to vesting. we have selected the black-scholes option pricing model for estimating the grant date fair value of stock option awards granted. we have considered the retirement and forfeiture provisions of the options and utilized our historical experience to estimate the expected life of the options. we base the risk-free interest rate on the yield of a zero coupon u.s. treasury security with a maturity equal to the expected life of the option from the date of the grant. stock-based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the value of the award and is recognized as expense over the requisite service period based on the number of years for which the requisite service is expected to be rendered.
awards of restricted stock and restricted stock units are independent of stock option grants and are subject to forfeiture if employment terminates prior to vesting. the vesting of shares granted is generally based on the passage of time, performance or market conditions, or a combination of these. shares vesting based on the passage of time have vesting provisions of one year. the fair value of restricted stock shares where the shares vest based on the passage of time or performance is based on the grant date fair value of our stock. the fair value of restricted stock shares based on market conditions is estimated using the monte carlo option pricing model. the risk-free interest rate and volatility assumptions used within the monte carlo option pricing model are calculated consistently with those applied in the black-scholes options pricing model utilized in determining the fair value of the stock option awards.
for performance-based restricted stock awards and performance based stock option awards, we must also make assumptions regarding the likelihood of achieving performance goals. if actual results differ significantly from these estimates, stock-based compensation expense and our results of operations could be materially affected.
adoption of new accounting standards discontinued operations reporting in april 2014, the fasb issued an asu 2014-08, discounted operations reporting that changes the requirements for reporting discontinued operations. this update will have the impact of reducing the frequency of disposals reported as discontinued operations, by requiring such a disposal to represent a strategic shift that has a major effect on an entitys operations and financial results. this update also expands the disclosures for discontinued operations, and requires new disclosures related to individually significant disposals that do not qualify as discontinued operations. we adopted this new guidance on january 1, 2015. the adoption of this asu did not have a material impact on the results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows, as we did not have discontinued operations.
stock-based payment awards with performance targets in june 2014, the fasb issued asu 2014-12, share-based payment awards with performance targets that are attainable after the requisite service period, for companies that grant their employees share-based
payments in which the terms of the award provide that a performance target that affects vesting could be achieved after the requisite service period. we adopted this new guidance on january 1, 2015. the adoption of this asu did not have a material impact on the results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows.
simplification of business combination measurement-period adjustments in september 2015, the fasb issued asu 2015-16, business combinations: simplifying the accounting for measurement-period adjustments, which requires that an acquirer recognize adjustments to provisional amounts that are identified during the measurement period in the reporting period in which the adjustment amounts are determined. prior to the issuance of the standard, entities were required to retrospectively apply adjustments made to provisional amounts recognized in a business combination. we adopted this new guidance during the third quarter of 2015. the adoption of this asu did not have a material impact on the results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows. furthermore, measurement period adjustments recorded in the year ended december 31, 2015 did not have a material impact on our consolidated statements of income.
pending adoption of recently issued accounting standards from time to time, new accounting pronouncements are issued by the fasb or other standards setting bodies that are adopted by us as of the specified effective date. unless otherwise discussed, our management believes that the impact of recently issued standards that are not yet effective will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements upon adoption.
going concern in august 2013, the fasb issued asu 2014-15 disclosure of uncertainties about an entitys ability to continue as a going concern, which requires entities to perform interim and annual assessments of the entitys ability to continue as a going concern within one year of the date of issuance of the entitys financial statements. this asu is effective for fiscal years ending after december 15, 2016 and interim periods thereafter, with early adoption permitted. our adoption of this asu is not expected to have a material impact on the results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows, as it is disclosure based.
revenue recognition in may 2014, the fasb issued asc 606, revenue from contracts with customers, which amends the guidance in former asc 605, revenue recognition. this amended guidance requires revenue to be recognized in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the company expects to be entitled for those goods and services when the performance obligation has been satisfied. this amended guidance also requires enhanced disclosures regarding the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and related cash flows arising from contracts with customers. in august 2015, the fasb issued asu 2015-14, revenue from contracts with customers: deferral of the effective date, which defers the effective date of the new revenue recognition standard by one year. this asu is effective for us for reporting periods beginning after december 15, 2017, but permits companies the option to adopt as of the original effective date. we anticipate selecting the modified retrospective method during transition and are currently evaluating the impact on our results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows.
simplification of guidance on debt issuance costs in april 2015, the fasb issued asu 2015-03, interestimputation of interest, which changes the presentation of debt issuance costs in financial statements as a direct deduction from the related debt liability rather than as an asset. this asu is effective for us for fiscal years ending after december 15, 2015 and interim periods. early adoption is permitted. in august 2015, the fasb issued asu 2015-15, interestimputation of interest: presentation and subsequent measurement of debt issuance costs associated with line-of-credit
arrangements, which is effective immediately. this asu states that entities may continue presenting unamortized debt issuance costs for line-of-credit arrangements as an asset. the adoption of this asu is not expected to have a material impact on the results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows.
simplification of balance sheet classification of deferred taxes in november 2015, the fasb issued asu 2015-17, balance sheet classification of deferred taxes, which requires entities to present deferred tax assets (dtas) and deferred tax liabilities (dtls) as noncurrent in a classified balance sheet. it thus simplifies the current guidance, which requires entities to separately present dtas and dtls as current or noncurrent in a classified balance sheet. netting of dtas and dtls by tax jurisdiction is still required under the new guidance. this asu is effective for the company for annual reporting periods beginning after december 15, 2016, and interim periods within those annual periods. the companys adoption of this asu is not expected to have a material impact on the results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows.
contractual obligations the table below summarizes the estimated dollar amounts of payments under contractual obligations identified below as of december 31, 2015 for the periods specified:
operating leases                                                 67.6          12.7                20.2                  11.4                  23.3
(a)                             deferred income tax liabilities as of december 31, 2015 were approximately $713.4 million. refer to note 11 to our audited consolidated financial statements. this amount is not included in the total contractual obligations table because we believe this presentation would not be meaningful. deferred income tax liabilities are calculated based on temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their respective book bases, which will result in taxable amounts in future years when the liabilities are settled at their reported financial statement amounts. the results of these calculations do not have a direct connection with the amount of cash taxes to be paid in any future periods. as a result, scheduling deferred income tax liabilities as payments due by period could be misleading, as this scheduling would not relate to liquidity needs.
(b)                 the long-term portion of contingent consideration agreements and deferred purchase price payments are included with other debt in the detail of our debt instruments disclosed in note 10 to our audited consolidated financial statements. to reconcile the amount of other debt as disclosed in the footnote to the contractual obligations table above, the long-term portion of deferred purchase price payments should be combined with
(c)                we draw upon and pay down on the revolver within our credit facility and our securitization facility borrowings outside of a normal schedule, as excess cash is available. for our variable rate debt, we have assumed the december 31, 2015 interest rates to calculate the estimated interest payments, for all years presented. this analysis also assumes that outstanding principal is held constant at the december 31, 2015 balances for our credit facility and securitization facility, except for mandatory pay downs on the term loans in accordance with the loan documents. we typically expect to settle such interest payments with cash flows from operating activities and/or other short-term borrowings.
managements use of non-gaap financial measures we have included in the discussion above certain financial measures that were not prepared in accordance with gaap. any analysis of non-gaap financial measures should be used only in conjunction with results presented in accordance with gaap. below, we define the non-gaap financial measures, provide a reconciliation of the non-gaap financial measure to the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with gaap, and discuss the reasons that we believe this information is useful to management and may be useful to investors.
we use adjusted revenues as a basis to evaluate our revenues, net of the commissions that are paid to merchants to participate in our card programs. the commissions paid to merchants can vary when market spreads fluctuate in much the same way as revenues are impacted when market spreads fluctuate. we believe that adjusted revenue is an appropriate supplemental measure of financial performance and may be useful to investors to understanding our revenue performance on a consistent basis. adjusted revenues are not intended to be a substitute for gaap financial measures and should not be used as such.
set forth below is a reconciliation of adjusted revenues to the most directly comparable gaap measure, revenues, net (in thousands):
adjusted net income and adjusted net income per diluted share we have defined the non-gaap measure adjusted net income as net income as reflected in our statement of income, adjusted to eliminate (a) non-cash stock-based compensation expense related to share-based compensation awards, (b) amortization of deferred financing costs, discounts and intangible assets, (c) amortization of the premium recognized on the purchase of receivables, (d) loss on the early extinguishment of debt, (e) our proportionate share of amortization of intangible assets at our equity method investment, (f) impairment of equity method investment, and (g) other non-cash adjustments.
we have defined the non-gaap measure adjusted net income per diluted share as the calculation previously noted divided by the weighted average diluted shares outstanding as reflected in our statement of income.
we use adjusted net income to eliminate the effect of items that we do not consider indicative of our core operating performance. we believe it is useful to exclude non-cash stock based compensation expense from adjusted net income because non-cash equity grants made at a certain price and point in time do not necessarily reflect how our business is performing at any particular time and stock based compensation expense is not a key measure of our core operating performance. we also believe that amortization expense can vary substantially from company to company and from period to period depending upon their financing and accounting methods, the fair value and average expected life of their acquired intangible assets, their capital structures and the method by which their assets were acquired. therefore, we have excluded amortization expense from adjusted net income. we believe that adjusted net income and adjusted net income per diluted share are appropriate supplemental measures of financial performance and may be useful to investors to understanding our operating performance on a consistent basis. adjusted net income and adjusted net income per diluted share are not intended to be a substitute for gaap financial measures and should not be used as such.
set forth below is a reconciliation of adjusted net income and adjusted net income per diluted share to the most directly comparable gaap measure, net income and net income per diluted share (in thousands, except per share amounts):
amortization of intangible assets                                               159,740                     86,149                     49,313

impairment of equity method investment                                           40,000                                                    
other non-cash adjustments                                                                                (28,869   )2                     
total pre-tax adjustments                                                       310,826                    124,730                     82,528

1   the effective tax rate used to calculate the income tax impact of pre-tax adjustments during 2014 excludes the impact of a $9.5 million discrete tax benefit, as well as other non-cash adjustments and their related income tax expense.
2   other non-cash adjustments are unusual items reflecting adjustments to purchase accounting entries for contingent consideration and tax indemnifications for our 2013 acquisitions of db and vb in brazil.
3   the effective tax rate utilized excludes the impact of a one-time tax benefit recognized during 2015 of approximately $0.8 million, as well as adjustments related to our equity method investment.

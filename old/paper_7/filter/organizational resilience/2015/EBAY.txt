on july 17, 2015, we completed the distribution of 100% of the outstanding common stock of paypal holdings, inc. ("paypal") to our stockholders (the "distribution"), pursuant to which paypal became an independent company. beginning in the third quarter of 2015, paypal's financial results for periods prior to the distribution have been reflected in our consolidated statement of income, retrospectively, as discontinued operations. additionally, the related assets and liabilities associated with the discontinued operations in the prior year consolidated balance sheet are classified as discontinued operations. pursuant to the terms of the separation and distribution agreement entered into between us and paypal on june 26, 2015, upon distribution, assets related to the paypal business were transferred to, and liabilities related to the paypal business were retained or assumed by, paypal.
during the second quarter of 2015, our board of directors ("board") approved a plan to sell the businesses underlying our former enterprise segment ("enterprise"). as a result, the enterprise financial results were reflected in our consolidated statement of income, retrospectively, as discontinued operations beginning in the second quarter of 2015. on july 16, 2015, we signed a definitive agreement to sell enterprise and on november 2, 2015, the sale closed. as a result, the related assets and liabilities associated with the discontinued operations in the prior year consolidated balance sheet are classified as discontinued operations.
in january 2015, at a regular meeting of our board, our board approved a plan to implement a strategic reduction of our existing global workforce. the reduction was completed in the first half of 2015 and is expected to generate annual savings of more than $150 million, primarily impacting sales and marketing and product development expenses. the savings in these line items are expected to be offset by additional expenses as we reinvest back into these areas of the business to drive additional growth.
we have incurred significant costs in connection with the distribution and sale of enterprise. these costs relate primarily to third-party advisory and consulting services, retention payments to certain employees, incremental stock-based compensation and other costs directly related to the distribution and the sale of enterprise. the majority of these costs are reflected in our consolidated statement of income as discontinued operations for all periods presented. the remaining costs reflected in continuing operations are classified within cost of net revenues, sales and marketing, product development or general and administrative in our consolidated statement of income as applicable.
impact of foreign currency exchange rates our commerce platforms operate globally, resulting in certain revenues that are denominated in foreign currencies, primarily the euro, british pound, korean won and australian dollar, subjecting us to foreign currency risk which may adversely impact our financial results. we calculate the year-over-year impact of foreign currency movements using prior period foreign currency rates applied to current year transactional currency amounts. the foreign exchange ("fx") neutral, or constant currency, net revenue amounts are non-gaap financial measures and are not in accordance with, or an alternative to, measures prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles ("gaap"). the information in this section should be read in connection with the information in "non-gaap measure of financial performance."
because we generated a majority of our net revenues internationally, including the years ended december 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, we are subject to the risks of doing business in foreign countries as discussed under "part i - item 1a - risk factors."

(1)   we define exchange rate effect as the year-over-year impact of foreign currency movements using prior period foreign currency rates applied to current year transactional currency amounts.
(2)   we define fx-neutral gross merchandise volume as gross merchandise volume minus the exchange rate effect. we define the non-gaap financial measures of fx-neutral net revenue as net revenue minus the exchange rate effect.
(3)   we define gross merchandise volume ("gmv") as the total value of all successfully closed transactions between users on our marketplace and stubhub platforms during the applicable period regardless of whether the buyer and seller actually consummated the transaction. we believe that gmv provides a useful measure of the overall volume of closed transactions that flow through our platforms in a given period, notwithstanding the inclusion in gmv of closed transactions that are not ultimately consummated.
(4)   during the first quarter of 2014, we revised our definition of gmv for certain transactions to align more closely with our operating metrics. 2013 amounts have been revised to conform to the current period reporting definition.
in 2015, foreign currency movements relative to the u.s. dollar positively impacted cost of net revenues by $80 million (inclusive of a positive impact of approximately $24 million from hedging activities). in 2014, foreign currency movements relative to the u.s. dollar had an immaterial impact on cost of net revenues.
in 2015, foreign currency movements relative to the u.s. dollar positively impacted operating expenses by $194 million (inclusive of a positive impact of approximately $47 million from hedging activities). in 2014, foreign currency movements relative to the u.s. dollar had an immaterial impact on operating expenses.
the effect of foreign currency exchange rate movements during 2015 was due to the strengthening of the u.s. dollar against other currencies, primarily the euro, the british pound, and the korean won.
results of operations summary of net revenues we generate two types of net revenues: net transaction revenues and marketing services and other revenues. net transaction revenues are derived principally from final value fees (which are fees payable on transactions closed on our marketplace and stubhub platforms), listing fees and other service fees. marketing services and other revenues consists of marketplace and classifieds revenue principally from the sale of advertisements, vehicles classifieds listing on marketplace platforms, revenue sharing arrangements, classifieds fees, marketing service fees and lead referral fees. to drive traffic to our platforms, we provide incentives to our users in the form of coupons and buyer and seller rewards. these incentives are generally treated as reductions in revenue.

net transaction revenues net transaction revenues decreased $152 million, or 2%, while gmv decreased 1%, in 2015 compared to 2014. net transaction revenue represented 79% of total net revenues in both 2015 in 2014. the decrease in net transaction revenues and gmv was driven primarily by a negative impact from foreign currency movements relative to the u.s. dollar. fx-neutral net transaction revenue and fx-neutral gmv increased 4% and 5% respectively, in 2015 compared to 2014. the fx-neutral gmv increase of 5% was driven by an increase in fx-neutral marketplace gmv, and to a lesser extent, stubhub gmv. the total transaction take rate was lower in 2015 compared to 2014 due to decrease in our marketplace transaction take rate, partially offset by an increase in our stubhub transaction take rate.
marketplace net transaction revenues decreased $248 million, or 4%, while marketplace gmv decreased 2%, in 2015 compared to 2014. the decrease in marketplace net transaction revenues and marketplace gmv was driven primarily by a negative impact from foreign currency movements relative to the u.s. dollar. fx-neutral marketplace net transaction revenue and fx-neutral marketplace gmv increased 3% and 5% respectively, in 2015 compared to 2014. the fx-neutral marketplace gmv increase of 5% was driven primarily by an increase in volume in local currencies on our marketplace platforms internationally and to a lesser extent, the u.s. the increase in fx-neutral marketplace net transaction revenue was less than the increase in fx-neutral marketplace gmv due to a lower marketplace transaction take rate. the marketplace transaction take rate was lower in 2015 compared to 2014 due to a shift in geographical and vertical mix, as well as an increase in our buyer and seller incentives, which are accounted for as a reduction of revenue.
stubhub net transaction revenues increased $96 million, or 15%, while stubhub gmv increased 13% in 2015 compared to 2014. the increase in stubhub net transaction revenues was driven primarily by an increase in stubhub gmv and an increase in stubhub transaction take rate. the stubhub gmv increase was driven primarily by an increase in volume of ticket sales related to sports and concerts. the increase in stubhub net transaction revenue was greater than the increase in stubhub gmv due to a higher stubhub transaction take rate. the stubhub transaction take rate was higher in 2015 compared to 2014 due primarily to a change in mix of events and sellers on the stubhub platforms.
net transaction revenues increased $427 million, or 7%, while gmv increased 8% in 2014 compared to 2013. net transaction revenue represented 79% of total net revenues in both 2014 and 2013. the gmv increase of 8% was driven primarily by an increase in marketplace gmv, and to a lesser extent, an increase in stubhub gmv. the total transaction take rate was lower in 2014 compared to 2013 due to a decrease in our marketplace transaction take rate and our stubhub transaction take rate.
marketplace net transaction revenues increased $451 million, or 8%, and marketplace gmv increased 9% in 2014 compared to 2013. the gmv increase of 9% was driven primarily by an increase in volume on our marketplace platforms internationally and to a lesser extent, the u.s. our marketplace net transaction revenue growth decelerated in the second half of 2014 caused by a reduction in traffic from lower organic traffic, such as google's search engine algorithm changes and the cyberattack that occurred in the second quarter of 2014. the marketplace transaction take rate was lower in 2014 compared to 2013 due primarily to an increase in our buyer and seller incentives, which are accounted for as a reduction of revenue.
stubhub net transaction revenues decreased $24 million, or 4%, while stubhub gmv increased 2% in 2014 compared to 2013. the decrease in stubhub net transaction revenues was driven primarily by a decrease in stubhub transaction take rate, offset by an increase in stubhub gmv. the stubhub transaction take rate was lower in 2014 compared to 2013 due to pricing changes on the stubhub platforms. the stubhub gmv increase was driven primarily by an increase in volume of ticket sales related to sports and theater.
net transaction revenues earned internationally totaled $3.8 billion, $4.0 billion and $3.7 billion in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively, representing 55%, 57% and 56% of total net transaction revenues in the respective periods. net transaction revenues earned internationally as a percentage of total net transaction revenue decreased in 2015 compared to 2014, primarily due to a negative impact from foreign currency movements relative to the u.s. dollar. net transaction revenues earned internationally as a percentage of total net transaction revenue increased in 2014 compared to 2013, primarily due to a greater increase in revenues earned internationally.
marketing services and other revenues marketing services and other revenues decreased $46 million, or 3%, in 2015 compared to 2014, and represented 21% of total net revenues in both periods. the decrease was driven primarily by a negative impact from foreign currency movements relative to the u.s. dollar. fx-neutral marketing services and other revenues increased 8% in 2015 compared to 2014. the fx-neutral marketing services and other revenues increase was driven by increased fx-neutral classifieds revenue, and to a lesser extent, increased fx-neutral revenue in our marketplace marketing services.
marketplace marketing services and other revenues decreased $25 million, or 2%, in 2015 compared to 2014. the decrease was driven primarily by a negative impact from foreign currency movements relative to the u.s. dollar. fx-neutral marketplace marketing services and other revenues increased by 4% in 2015 compared to 2014. the increase in fx-neutral marketplace marketing services and other revenues was primarily driven by increased fees earned for referral services offset by decreased revenue in local currencies from advertising display on our marketplace international platforms. the increase in fees earned for referral services consist primarily of fees for customers acquired and incentives for the usage of paypal products on certain marketplace platforms, which were not included in marketing services and other revenues prior to the distribution.
classifieds marketing services and other revenues decreased $13 million, or 2%, in 2015 compared to 2014. the decrease was driven primarily by a negative impact from foreign currency movements relative to the u.s. dollar. fx-neutral classifieds marketing services and other revenues increased by 15% in 2015 compared to 2014. the increase in fx-neutral classifieds marketing services and other revenues was driven primarily by increased revenue from our classifieds platforms in our developed markets of germany, canada and the uk.
marketing services and other revenues increased $106 million, or 6%, in 2014 compared to 2013, and represented 21% of total net revenues for both periods. the increase in marketing services and other revenues was driven primarily by increased classifieds revenue, and to a lesser extent, increased revenue in our marketplace marketing services.

sales and marketing sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of advertising costs and marketing programs (both online and offline), employee compensation, contractor costs, facilities costs and depreciation on equipment. online marketing expenses represent traffic acquisition costs in various channels such as paid search, affiliates marketing and display advertising. offline advertising includes primarily brand campaigns and buyer/seller communications.
sales and marketing expense decreased by $175 million, or 7%, in 2015 compared to 2014. the decrease in sales and marketing expense was due primarily to the positive impact from foreign currency movements relative to the u.s. dollar, a decrease in marketing program costs due in part to a shift in certain buyer and seller incentives (for which associated expenses are recorded as a reduction in revenue instead of sales and marketing expense) and employee-related savings from our global workforce reduction. sales and marketing expense as a percentage of net revenues were 26% and 28% in 2015 and 2014, respectively.
sales and marketing expense increased by $298 million, or 14%, in 2014 compared to 2013. the increase in sales and marketing expense was due primarily to an increase in marketing program costs (both online and offline programs), our brand campaign and higher employee-related expenses (including consultant costs). sales and marketing expense as a percentage of net revenues were 28% and 26% in 2014 and 2013, respectively.
product development product development expenses consist primarily of employee compensation, contractor costs, facilities costs and depreciation on equipment. product development expenses are net of required capitalization of major platforms and other product development efforts, including the development of our platform architecture, migration of certain platforms, and seller tools. our top technology priorities include structured data, multi-screen capabilities, improved seller tools and buyer experiences.
capitalized internal use and platform development costs were $136 million and $144 million in 2015 and 2014, respectively, and are primarily reflected as a cost of net revenues when amortized in future periods.
product development expenses decreased by $60 million, or 6%, in 2015 compared to 2014. the decrease was due primarily to the positive impact from foreign currency movements and hedging relative to the u.s. dollar. product development expenses as a net percentage of revenues were 11% in both 2015 and 2014.
product development expenses increased by $68 million, or 7%, in 2014 compared to 2013. the increase was due primarily to higher employee-related costs (including consultant costs) driven by increased investment in platforms and mobile. product development expenses as a net percentage of revenues were 11% in both 2014 and 2013.
general and administrative general and administrative expenses consist primarily of employee compensation, contractor costs, facilities costs, depreciation of equipment, employer payroll taxes on stock-based compensation, legal expenses, restructuring, insurance premiums and professional fees. our legal expenses, including those related to various ongoing legal proceedings, may fluctuate substantially from period to period.
general and administrative expenses increased $233 million, or 26%, in 2015 compared to 2014. the increase was due primarily to restructuring costs related to our global workforce reduction, costs related to the distribution (as discussed in overview above), expenses related to craigslist, inc. litigation proceedings and an increase in corporate costs due to a reduction in synergies that existed prior to the distribution. general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net revenues were 13% in 2015 and 10% in 2014.
general and administrative expenses increased $9 million, or 1%, in 2014 compared to 2013. the increase was due primarily to higher employee-related costs. general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net revenues were 10% in 2014 and 11% in 2013.
provision for transaction losses provision for transaction losses consists primarily of transaction loss expense associated with our customer protection programs, fraud and bad debt expense associated with our accounts receivable balance. we expect our provision for transaction losses to fluctuate depending on many factors, including changes to our customer protection programs and the impact of regulatory changes.
provision for transaction losses increased by $9 million, or 3%, in 2015 compared to 2014. this increase was driven primarily by higher customer protection program costs, partially offset by a decrease in bad debt expense. provision for transaction loss expense as a percentage of net revenues was 3% in both 2015 and 2014.
provision for transaction losses increased by $26 million, or 11%, in 2014 compared to 2013. this increase was driven primarily by an increase in transaction volume, partially offset by improvements in our fraud detection models. provision for transaction loss expense as a percentage of net revenues was 3% in both 2014 and 2013, respectively.
amortization of acquired intangible assets from time to time we have purchased, and we expect to continue to purchase, assets and businesses. these purchase transactions generally result in the creation of acquired intangible assets with finite lives and lead to a corresponding increase in our amortization expense in periods subsequent to acquisition. we amortize intangible assets over the period of estimated benefit, using the straight-line method and estimated useful lives ranging from one to six years. amortization of acquired intangible assets is also impacted by our sales of assets and businesses and timing of acquired intangible assets becoming fully amortized. see "note 5 - goodwill and intangible assets" to our consolidated financial statements included in this report.
amortization of acquired intangible assets decreased by $34 million, or 45%, in 2015 compared to 2014. the decrease was due to certain intangible assets becoming fully amortized during the year.
amortization of acquired intangible assets decreased by $61 million, or 45%, in 2014 compared to 2013. the decrease was due to certain intangible assets becoming fully amortized during the year.
interest and other, net interest and other, net consists primarily of interest earned on cash, cash equivalents and investments, as well as foreign exchange transaction gains and losses, our portion of operating results from investments accounted for under the equity method of accounting, investment gain/loss on acquisitions or disposals and interest expense, consisting of interest charges on any amounts borrowed and commitment fees on unborrowed amounts under our credit agreement and interest expense on our outstanding debt securities and commercial paper, if any.
interest and other, net, increased $170 million in 2015 compared to 2014. the increase in interest and other, net was due primarily to gains on sale of investments partially offset by an increase in interest expense due to the issuance of debt securities in july 2014 and a decrease in interest income due to a lower overall cash, short-term investments and long-term investments balances after the distribution.
interest and other, net, decreased $78 million in 2014 compared to 2013. the decrease in interest and other, net was due primarily to a gain on the sale of certain investments in september 2013.
our effective tax rate was 19% in 2015 compared to 134% in 2014. the decrease in our effective tax rate during 2015 compared to 2014 was due primarily to the recognition in 2014 of deferred tax liabilities of approximately $3.0 billion of u.s. income and applicable foreign withholding taxes on $9.0 billion of undistributed foreign earnings of certain of our foreign subsidiaries for 2013 and prior years. this was partially offset by the tax effect of gains on sale of certain investments in 2015.
our effective tax rate was 134% in 2014 compared to 20% in 2013. the increase in our effective tax rate during 2014 compared to 2013 was due primarily to the recognition of deferred tax liabilities related to undistributed foreign earnings of certain of our non-u.s. subsidiaries for 2013 and prior years discussed above, partially offset by the release of the valuation allowance on our capital loss carryover.
our relative pretax earnings and revenues attributable to the u.s. as compared to the rest of the world may differ over time. for the year ended december 31, 2015, our u.s. share of pretax income and net revenues was 16.5% and 42.2%, respectively. for the year ended december 31, 2014, our u.s. share of pretax income and net revenues was 20.3% and 40.1%, respectively. the difference in relative pretax income and net revenues attributable to the u.s., as compared to the rest of the world for both 2015 and 2014, was primarily related to larger stock-based compensation expense recorded in the u.s. for u.s. based employees, overhead related to our corporate operations which are primarily u.s. based and higher average margins earned by non-u.s. businesses.
our provision for income taxes differs from the provision computed by applying the u.s. federal statutory rate of 35% due primarily to lower tax rates associated with certain earnings from our operations in certain lower-tax jurisdictions outside the u.s. the impact on our provision for income taxes of foreign income being taxed at different rates than the u.s. federal statutory rate was a benefit of approximately $399 million in 2015, $432 million in 2014 and $403 million in 2013. we benefit from tax rulings concluded in several different jurisdictions, most significantly switzerland and luxembourg. these rulings provide for significantly lower rates of taxation on certain classes of income. the cash benefit of these reduced rates totaled approximately $319 million in 2015, $339 million in 2014 and $328 million in 2013. the foreign jurisdictions with lower tax rates that had the most significant impact on our provision for income taxes in the periods presented include switzerland and luxembourg. see "note 17 - income taxes" to the consolidated financial statements included in this report for more information on our tax rate reconciliation.
our provision for income taxes is volatile and, in general, is adversely impacted by earnings being lower than anticipated in countries that have lower tax rates and higher than anticipated in countries that have higher tax rates. our provision for income taxes does not include provisions for u.s. income taxes and foreign withholding taxes associated with $6 billion of undistributed earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries because we intend to reinvest those earnings indefinitely in our foreign subsidiaries. if these earnings were distributed into the u.s. in the form of dividends to ebay companies domiciled in the u.s.
or otherwise, or if the shares of the relevant foreign subsidiaries were sold or otherwise transferred, we would be subject to additional u.s. income taxes (subject to an adjustment for foreign tax credits) and foreign withholding taxes. further, as a result of certain of our ongoing employment and capital investment actions and commitments, our income in certain countries including switzerland and luxembourg, is subject to reduced tax rates. our failure to meet these commitments could adversely impact our provision for income taxes. additionally, please see the information in "item 1a: risk factors" under the caption "we may have exposure to greater than anticipated tax liabilities."
from time to time, we engage in certain intercompany transactions and legal entity restructurings. we consider many factors when evaluating these transactions, including the alignment of our corporate structure with our organizational objectives and the operational and tax efficiency of our corporate structure, as well as the long-term cash flows and cash needs of our different businesses. these transactions may impact our overall tax rate and/or result in additional cash tax payments. the impact in any period may be significant. these transactions may be complex and the impact of such transactions on future periods may be difficult to estimate.
we are regularly under examination by tax authorities both domestically and internationally. we believe that adequate amounts have been reserved for any adjustments that may ultimately result from these examinations, although we cannot assure you that this will be the case given the inherent uncertainties in these examinations. due to the ongoing tax examinations, we believe it is impractical to determine the amount and timing of these adjustments.
discontinued operations on july 17, 2015, we completed the distribution, pursuant to which paypal became an independent company. beginning in the third quarter of 2015, paypal's historical financial results for periods prior to the distribution have been reflected in our consolidated statement of income, retrospectively, as discontinued operations. additionally, the related assets and liabilities associated with the discontinued operations in the prior year consolidated balance sheet are classified as discontinued operations. pursuant to the terms of the separation and distribution agreement entered into between us and paypal on june 26, 2015, upon distribution, assets related to the paypal business were transferred to, and liabilities related to the paypal business were retained or assumed by, paypal. see "note 4 - discontinued operations" to our consolidated financial statements included in this report.
during the second quarter of 2015, our board approved a plan to sell enterprise. as a result, the enterprise financial results were reflected in our consolidated statement of income, retrospectively, as discontinued operations beginning in the second quarter of 2015. on july 16, 2015, we signed a definitive agreement to sell enterprise and on november 2, 2015, the sale closed. as a result, the related assets and liabilities associated with the discontinued operations in the prior year consolidated balance sheet are classified as discontinued operations. see "note 4 - discontinued operations" to our consolidated financial statements included in this report.
non-gaap measure of financial performance to supplement our consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, or gaap, we use fx-neutral net revenues, which are non-gaap financial measures. we define the fx-neutral net revenue as net revenue minus the exchange rate effect. we define exchange rate effect as the year-over-year impact of foreign currency movements using prior period foreign currency rates applied to current year transactional currency amounts.
these non-gaap measures are not in accordance with, or an alternative to, measures prepared in accordance with gaap and may be different from non-gaap measures used by other companies. in addition, these non-gaap measures are not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles. non-gaap measures have limitations in that they do not reflect all of the amounts associated with our results of operations as determined in accordance with gaap. these measures should only be used to evaluate our results of operations in conjunction with the corresponding gaap measures.
reconciliation of fx-neutral net revenues to the most directly comparable gaap measure can be found in the table under "impact of foreign currency exchange rates" included above. these non-gaap measures are provided to enhance investors' overall understanding of our current financial performance and its prospects for the future. specifically, we believe these non-gaap measures provide useful information to both management and investors by excluding the foreign currency exchange rate impact that may not be indicative of our core operating results and business outlook. in addition, because we have historically reported certain non-gaap results to investors, we believe that the inclusion of these non-gaap measures provide consistency in our financial reporting.
in addition to these corresponding gaap measures, management uses the foregoing non-gaap measures in reviewing our financial results.

continuing operating activities the net cash provided by continuing operating activities of $2.9 billion in 2015 was due primarily to net income of $1.7 billion with adjustments for loss from discontinued operations of $222 million, $687 million in depreciation and amortization,$379 million in stock-based compensation and $271 million in provision for transaction losses and a decrease of $195 million related to gain on sale of investments and $106 million in changes in assets and liabilities, net of acquisition effects.
the net cash provided by continuing operating activities of $3.2 billion in 2014 was due primarily to net income of $46 million with adjustments for income from discontinued operations of $911 million, $682 million in depreciation and amortization, $344 million in stock-based compensation, $262 million in provision for transaction losses, $2.7 billion in deferred income taxes and $148 million in changes in assets and liabilities, net of acquisition effects.

continuing investing activities the net cash used in continuing investing activities of $673 million in 2015 was due primarily to cash paid for purchases of investments of $6.7 billion, purchases of property and equipment of $668 million and net cash paid for acquisition of businesses of $24 million, partially offset by proceeds of $6.8 billion from the maturities and sales of investments.
the net cash used in continuing investing activities of $1.3 billion in 2014 was due primarily to cash paid for purchases of investments of $8.8 billion, purchases of property and equipment of $622 million and net cash paid for acquisition of businesses of $55 million partially offset by proceeds of $8.1 billion from the maturities and sales of investments.
the net cash used in continuing investing activities of $3.6 billion in 2013 was due primarily to net cash paid for purchases of investments of $6.9 billion, purchases of property and equipment of $678 million and net cash paid for acquisition of businesses of $138 million partially offset by proceeds of $3.6 billion from the maturities and sales of investments and $485 million from the repayment of note receivable and sale of related equity investments.
the largely offsetting effects of purchases of investments and maturities and sale of investments results from the management of our portfolio of short term and long term investments. as our immediate cash needs change, purchase and sale activity will fluctuate. in the year ended december 31, 2014, a portion of the proceeds from the issuance of senior notes were used to purchase investments in our short term and long term portfolios.
continuing financing activities the net cash used in continuing financing activities of $3.0 billion in 2015 was due primarily to cash outflows from $2.1 billion to repurchase common stock, $850 million payment of debt upon maturity and cash paid for tax withholdings in the amount of $245 million related to net share settlements of restricted stock units and awards. these cash outflows were partially offset by cash inflows of $221 million from the issuance of common stock in connection with the exercise of stock options and the effect of $74 million of excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation.
the net cash used in continuing financing activities of $1.0 billion in 2014 was due primarily to cash outflows of $4.7 billion to repurchase common stock and cash paid for tax withholdings in the amount of $252 million related to net share settlements of restricted stock units and awards. these cash outflows were partially offset by cash inflows from $3.5 billion from the issuance of senior notes, $300 million from the issuance of common stock in connection with the exercise of stock options and the effect of $75 million of excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation.
the net cash used in continuing financing activities of $1.4 billion in 2013 was due primarily to cash outflows of $1.3 billion in cash paid to repurchase our common stock, $400 million payment of debt upon maturity and $267 million in cash paid for tax withholdings related to net share settlements of restricted stock units. these cash outflows were partially offset by cash inflows of $437 million from the issuance of common stock in connection with the exercise of stock options, and $112 million in excess tax benefits from stock based compensation.
the negative effect of currency exchange rates on cash and cash equivalents during 2015 was due to the strengthening of the u.s. dollar against other currencies, primarily the euro. the negative effect of currency exchange rates on cash and cash equivalents during 2014 was due to the strengthening of the u.s. dollar against certain foreign currencies, primarily the euro and korean won. the positive effect of currency exchange rates on cash and cash equivalents during 2013 was due to the weakening of the u.s. dollar against certain foreign currencies, primarily the euro.
stock repurchases in january 2014, our board authorized a stock repurchase program that provided for the repurchase of up to an additional $5 billion of our common stock, with no expiration from the date of authorization. in january 2015, our board authorized an additional $2 billion stock repurchase program, with no expiration from the date of authorization. in june 2015, our board authorized an additional $1 billion stock repurchase program, with no expiration from the date of authorization. the stock repurchase programs are intended to programmatically offset the impact of dilution from our equity compensation programs and, subject to market conditions and other factors, to make opportunistic repurchases of our common stock to reduce outstanding share count. any share repurchases under our stock repurchase programs may be made through open market transactions, block trades, privately negotiated transactions (including accelerated share repurchase transactions) or other means at times and in such amounts as management deems appropriate and will be funded from our working capital or other financing alternatives.
during 2015, we repurchased approximately $2.1 billion of our common stock under our stock repurchase programs. as of december 31, 2015, a total of approximately $1.8 billion remained available for future repurchases of our common stock under our january 2015 and june 2015 repurchase programs and no amount remained available under our january 2014 repurchase program.
we expect, subject to market conditions and other uncertainties, to continue making opportunistic repurchases of our common stock. however, our stock repurchase programs may be limited or terminated at any time without prior notice. the timing and actual number of shares repurchased will depend on a variety of factors, including corporate and regulatory requirements, price and other market conditions and management's determination as to the appropriate use of our cash.
shelf registration statement and long-term debt at december 31, 2015, we had an effective shelf registration statement on file with the securities and exchange commission that allows us to issue various types of debt securities, as well as common stock, preferred stock, warrants, depositary shares representing fractional interest in shares of preferred stock, purchase contracts and units from time to time in one or more offerings. each issuance under the shelf registration statement will require the filing of a prospectus supplement identifying the amount and terms of the securities to be issued. the registration statement does not limit the amount of securities that may be issued thereunder. our ability to issue securities is subject to market conditions and other factors including, in the case of our debt securities, our credit ratings and compliance with the covenants in our credit agreement.
we previously issued senior notes in underwritten public offerings under prior registration statements. the senior notes that remained outstanding as of december 31, 2015 consisted of $450 million aggregate principal amount of floating rate notes due 2017, $1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of 1.35% fixed rate notes due 2017, $400 million aggregate principal amount of floating rate notes due 2019, $1.15 billion aggregate principal amount of 2.2% fixed rate notes due 2019, $500 million aggregate principal amount of 3.250% fixed rate notes due 2020, $1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of 2.60% fixed rate notes due 2022, $750 million aggregate principal amount of 2.875% fixed rate notes due 2021, $750 million aggregate principal amount of 3.45% fixed rate notes due 2024 and $750 million aggregate principal amount of 4.00% fixed rate notes due 2042. the net proceeds from the sale of these senior notes were used for general corporate purposes, including, among other things, the repayment of outstanding commercial paper borrowings.
during the year ended december 31, 2015, $250 million aggregate principal amount of 0.700% fixed rate notes due 2015 and $600 million aggregate principal amount of 1.625% fixed rate notes due 2015 matured and were repaid during the year.
to help achieve our interest rate risk management objectives, we previously entered into interest rate swap agreements that effectively converted $2.4 billion of the fixed rate notes to floating rate debt based on the london interbank offered rate (libor) plus a spread. these swaps were designated as fair value hedges against changes in the fair value of certain fixed rate senior notes resulting from changes in interest rates.
the indenture pursuant to which the senior notes were issued includes customary covenants that, among other things and subject to exceptions, limit our ability to incur, assume or guarantee debt secured by liens on specified assets or enter into sale and lease-back transactions with respect to specified properties, and also includes customary events of default.
commercial paper in connection with entering into the credit agreement described below, in november 2015, the company reduced the aggregate principal amount at maturity of commercial paper notes which may be outstanding under its commercial paper program at any time from $2.0 billion to $1.5 billion to correspond with the $1.5 billion of available borrowing capacity it maintains under the credit agreement for the repayment of commercial paper borrowings in the event it is unable to repay those borrowings from other sources when they become due. we have a $1.5 billion commercial paper program pursuant to which we may issue commercial paper notes with maturities of up to 397 days from the date of issue in an aggregate principal amount of up to $1.5 billion at any time outstanding. as of december 31, 2015, there were no commercial paper notes outstanding.
credit agreement in november 2015, we entered into a credit agreement that provides for an unsecured $2 billion five-year revolving credit facility. we may also, subject to the agreement of the applicable lenders, increase the commitments under the revolving credit facility by up to an aggregate amount of $1 billion. funds borrowed under the credit agreement may be used for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and other general corporate purposes. the credit agreement replaced our prior $3.0 billion unsecured revolving credit agreement, entered into in november 2011.
as of december 31, 2015, no borrowings were outstanding under our $2 billion credit agreement. however, as described above, we have an up to $1.5 billion commercial paper program and therefore maintain $1.5 billion of available borrowing capacity under our credit agreement in order to repay commercial paper borrowings in the event we are unable to repay those borrowings from other sources when they become due. as a result, at december 31, 2015, $500 million of borrowing capacity was available for other purposes permitted by the credit agreement.
loans under the credit agreement bear interest at either (i) the london interbank offered rate ("libor") plus a margin (based on our public debt credit ratings) ranging from 0.875 percent to 1.5 percent or (ii) a formula based on the agent bank's prime rate, the federal funds effective rate plus 0.5 percent or libor plus 1.0 percent, plus a margin (based on our public debt credit ratings) ranging from 0.0 percent to 0.5 percent. the credit agreement will terminate and all amounts owing thereunder will be due and payable on november 9, 2020, unless (a) the commitments are terminated earlier, either at our request or, if an event of default occurs, by the lenders (or automatically in the case of certain bankruptcy-related events of default), or (b) the maturity date is extended upon our request, subject to the agreement of the lenders. the credit agreement contains customary representations, warranties, affirmative and negative covenants, including financial covenants, events of default and indemnification provisions in favor of the banks. the negative covenants include restrictions regarding the incurrence of liens and subsidiary indebtedness, in each case, subject to certain exceptions. the financial covenants require us to meet a quarterly financial test with respect to a minimum consolidated interest coverage ratio and a maximum consolidated leverage ratio.
credit ratings our credit ratings were downgraded as a result of the distribution. as of january 1, 2014, our long-term debt and short-term funding were rated investment grade by standard and poor's financial services, llc (long-term rated a, short-term rated a-1, with a stable outlook), moody's investor service (long-term rated a2, short-term rated p-1, with a stable outlook), and fitch ratings, inc. (long-term rated a, short-term rated f-1, with a stable outlook). all of these credit rating agencies lowered their ratings in connection with the distribution, which occurred on july 17, 2015. since july 20, 2015, we have been rated investment grade by standard and poor's financial services, llc (long-term rated bbb+, short-term rated a-2, with a stable outlook), moody's investor service (long-term rated baa1, short-term rated p-2, with a stable outlook), and fitch ratings, inc. (long-term rated bbb, short-term rated f-2, with a stable outlook). we disclose these ratings to enhance the understanding of our sources of liquidity and the effects of these ratings on our costs of funds. our borrowing costs depend, in part, on our credit ratings and any further actions taken by these credit rating agencies to lower our credit ratings, as described above, will likely increase our borrowing costs.
commitments and contingencies we have certain fixed contractual obligations and commitments that include future estimated payments for general operating purposes. changes in our business needs, contractual cancellation provisions, fluctuating interest rates, and other factors may result in actual payments differing from the estimates. we cannot provide certainty regarding the timing and amounts of these payments. the following table summarizes our fixed contractual obligations and commitments:
the significant assumptions used in our determination of amounts presented in the above table are as follows:
•   debt amounts include the principal and interest amounts of the respective debt instruments. for additional details related to our debt, please see "note 11 - debt" to the consolidated financial statements included in this report. this table does not reflect any amounts payable under our $2 billion revolving credit facility or $1.5 billion commercial paper program, for which no borrowings were outstanding as of december 31, 2015.
•   lease amounts include minimum rental payments under our non-cancelable operating leases for office facilities, fulfillment centers, as well as computer and office equipment that we utilize under lease arrangements. the amounts presented are consistent with contractual terms and are not expected to differ significantly from actual results under our existing leases, unless a substantial change in our headcount needs requires us to expand our occupied space or exit an office facility early.
•   purchase obligation amounts include minimum purchase commitments for advertising, capital expenditures (computer equipment, software applications, engineering development services, construction contracts) and other goods and services entered into in the ordinary course of business.
as we are unable to reasonably predict the timing of settlement of liabilities related to unrecognized tax benefits, net, the table does not include $416 million of such non-current liabilities included in deferred and other tax liabilities recorded on our consolidated balance sheet as of december 31, 2015.
liquidity and capital resource requirements as of december 31, 2015 and december 31, 2014, we had assets classified as cash and cash equivalents, as well as short-term and long-term non-equity investments, in an aggregate amount of $8.5 billion and $12.4 billion, respectively. as of december 31, 2015, this amount included assets held in certain of our foreign operations totaling approximately $7.0 billion. of the $7.0 billion held by our non-u.s. subsidiaries, approximately $4.8 billion was available for use in the u.s. without incurring additional u.s. income taxes in excess of the amounts already accrued in our consolidated financial statements as of december 31, 2015. as of december 31, 2015, we had not repatriated any of these funds to the u.s. and, as a result, we have not yet paid u.s. tax on any portion of these funds. to the extent we repatriate this $4.8 billion of undistributed foreign earnings, we estimate, based on current tax rates, that it would increase our u.s. cash by approximately $3.2 billion, net of related tax paid. the remaining amount of non-u.s. cash and cash equivalents, as well as short-term and long-term non-equity investments, have been indefinitely reinvested and, therefore, no u.s. current or deferred taxes have been accrued as this amount is necessary to support our planned ongoing investments in our foreign operations. we believe our u.s. sources of cash and liquidity are sufficient to meet our business needs in the u.s., and we do not expect that we will need to repatriate the funds we have designated as indefinitely reinvested outside the u.s. under current tax laws, should our plans change and we were to choose to repatriate some or all of the funds we have designated as indefinitely reinvested, we will be required to pay u.s. income and applicable foreign withholding taxes on those amounts during the period when such repatriation occurs.
in connection with the distribution, we reviewed our capital allocation strategy to ensure that each of paypal and ebay would be well capitalized at distribution. as part of this strategy, we contributed approximately $3.8 billion of cash to paypal. this contribution consisted of approximately $1.8 billion of domestic sources and $2.0 billion of international sources.
we actively monitor all counterparties that hold our cash and cash equivalents and non-equity investments, focusing primarily on the safety of principal and secondarily on improving yield on these assets. we diversify our cash and cash equivalents and investments among various counterparties in order to reduce our exposure should any one of these counterparties fail or encounter difficulties. to date, we have not experienced any material loss or lack of access to our invested cash, cash equivalents or short-term investments; however, we can provide no assurances that access to our invested cash, cash equivalents or short-term investments will not be impacted by adverse conditions in the financial markets. at any point in time we have funds in our operating accounts and customer accounts that are deposited and invested with third party financial institutions.
we believe that our existing cash, cash equivalents and short-term and long-term investments, together with cash expected to be generated from operations, borrowings available under our credit agreement and commercial paper program, and our access to capital markets, will be sufficient to fund our operating activities, anticipated capital expenditures and stock repurchases for the foreseeable future.
off-balance sheet arrangements as of december 31, 2015, we had no off-balance sheet arrangements that have, or are reasonably likely to have, a current or future material effect on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.
we have a cash pooling arrangement with a financial institution for cash management purposes. this arrangement allows for cash withdrawals from the financial institution based upon our aggregate operating cash balances held within the same financial institution ("aggregate cash deposits"). this arrangement also allows us to withdraw amounts exceeding the aggregate cash deposits up to an agreed-upon limit. the net balance of the withdrawals and the aggregate cash deposits are used by the financial institution as a basis for calculating our net interest expense or income under the arrangement. as of december 31, 2015, we had a total of $2.4 billion in cash withdrawals offsetting our $2.4 billion in aggregate cash deposits held within the financial institution under the cash pooling arrangements.
indemnification provisions we entered into a separation and distribution agreement and various other agreements with paypal to govern the separation and relationship of the two companies going forward. these agreements provide for specific indemnity and liability obligations and could lead to disputes between us and paypal, which may be significant. in addition, the indemnity rights we have against paypal under the agreements may not be sufficient to protect us and our indemnity obligations to paypal may be significant.
in the ordinary course of business, we have included limited indemnification provisions in certain of our agreements with parties with which we have commercial relations, including our standard marketing, promotions and application-programming-interface license agreements. under these contracts, we generally indemnify, hold harmless and agree to reimburse the indemnified party for losses suffered or incurred by the indemnified party in connection with claims by a third party with respect to our domain names, trademarks, logos and other branding elements to the extent that such marks are applicable to our performance under the subject agreement. in certain cases, we have agreed to provide indemnification for intellectual property infringement. it is not possible to determine the maximum potential loss under these indemnification provisions due to our limited history of prior indemnification claims and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular provision. to date, losses recorded in our consolidated statement of income in connection with our indemnification provisions have not been significant, either individually or collectively.
critical accounting policies, judgments and estimates general the preparation of our consolidated financial statements and related notes requires us to make judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. we have based our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. our senior management has discussed the development, selection and disclosure of these estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors. actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
an accounting policy is considered to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made, and if different estimates that reasonably could have been used, or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely to occur periodically, could materially impact the consolidated financial statements. we believe the following critical accounting policies reflect the more significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. the following descriptions of critical accounting policies, judgments and estimates should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes and other disclosures included in this report.
revenue recognition we may enter into certain revenue transactions, primarily related to certain advertising contracts, that are considered multiple element arrangements (arrangements with more than one deliverable). we also may enter into arrangements to purchase goods and/or services from certain customers. as a result, significant interpretation and judgment is sometimes required to determine the appropriate accounting for these transactions including: (1) how the arrangement consideration should be allocated among potential multiple deliverables; (2) developing an estimate of the stand-alone selling price of each deliverable; (3) whether revenue should be reported gross (as ebay is acting as a principal), or net (as ebay is acting as an agent); (4) when we provide cash consideration to our customers, determining whether we are receiving an identifiable benefit that is separable from the customer's purchase of our products and/or services and for which we can reasonably estimate fair value; and (5) whether the arrangement would be characterized as revenue or reimbursement of costs incurred. changes in judgments with respect to these assumptions and estimates could impact the timing or amount of revenue recognition.
accounting for income taxes our annual tax rate is based on our income, statutory tax rates and tax planning opportunities available to us in the various jurisdictions in which we operate. tax laws are complex and subject to different interpretations by the taxpayer and respective government taxing authorities. significant judgment is required in determining our tax expense and in evaluating our tax positions, including evaluating uncertainties. we review our tax positions quarterly and adjust the balances as new information becomes available. our income tax rate is significantly affected by the tax rates that apply to our foreign earnings. in addition to local country tax laws and regulations, our income tax rate depends on the extent that our earnings are indefinitely reinvested outside the u.s. indefinite reinvestment is determined by management's judgment about and intentions concerning our future operations. at december 31, 2015, $6.0 billion of earnings had been indefinitely reinvested outside the u.s., primarily in active non-u.s. business operations. we do not intend to repatriate these earnings to fund u.s. operations and, accordingly, we do not provide for u.s. federal income and foreign withholding tax on these earnings.
deferred tax assets represent amounts available to reduce income taxes payable on taxable income in future years. such assets arise because of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, as well as
from net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. we evaluate the recoverability of these future tax deductions and credits by assessing the adequacy of future expected taxable income from all sources, including reversal of taxable temporary differences, forecasted operating earnings and available tax planning strategies. these sources of income rely heavily on estimates that are based on a number of factors, including our historical experience and short-range and long-range business forecasts. at december 31, 2015, we had a valuation allowance on certain loss carryforwards based on our assessment that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset will not be realized.
we recognize and measure uncertain tax positions in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the u.s., or gaap, pursuant to which we only recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such positions are then measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. we report a liability for unrecognized tax benefits resulting from uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. gaap further requires that a change in judgment related to the expected ultimate resolution of uncertain tax positions be recognized in earnings in the quarter in which such change occurs. we recognize interest and penalties, if any, related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense.
we file annual income tax returns in multiple taxing jurisdictions around the world. a number of years may elapse before an uncertain tax position is audited by the relevant tax authorities and finally resolved. while it is often difficult to predict the final outcome or the timing of resolution of any particular uncertain tax position, we believe that our reserves for income taxes reflect the most likely outcome. we adjust these reserves, as well as the related interest, where appropriate in light of changing facts and circumstances. settlement of any particular position could require the use of cash.
as a % of income before income taxes          19     %   134                 %                20     %
our future effective tax rates could be adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in countries where we have lower statutory rates and higher than anticipated in countries where we have higher statutory rates, by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets or liabilities, or by changes or interpretations in tax laws, regulations or accounting principles. in addition, we are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the internal revenue service, as well as various state and foreign tax authorities. we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes.
based on our results for the year ended december 31, 2015, a one-percentage point change in our provision for income taxes as a percentage of income before taxes would have resulted in an increase or decrease in the provision of approximately $24 million, resulting in an approximate $0.02 change in diluted earnings per share.
stock-based compensation we measure and recognize stock-based compensation expense based on the fair value measurement for all share-based payment awards made to our employees and directors, including employee stock options, employee stock purchases and restricted stock awards, over the service period for awards expected to vest. stock-based compensation expense recognized for 2015, 2014 and 2013 was $379 million, $344 million and $298 million, respectively. see "note 16 - stock-based and employee savings plans" to the consolidated financial statements included in this report.
we calculated the fair value of each restricted stock award based on our stock price on the date of grant. we calculated the fair value of each stock option award on the date of grant using the black-scholes option pricing model. the determination of fair value of stock option awards on the date of grant using an option-pricing model is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of additional variables described below. the use of a black-scholes model requires extensive actual employee exercise behavior data and a number of assumptions, including expected life, expected volatility, risk-free interest rate and dividend yield. as a result, future stock-based compensation expense may differ from our historical amounts. the weighted-average grant-date fair value of stock options granted during 2015, 2014 and 2013 was $6.84, $13.59 and $15.39 per share, respectively, using the black-scholes model with the following weighted-average assumptions:
risk-free interest rate    1.4   %        1.2    %       0.6    %
expected volatility         27   %         29    %        34    %
our computation of expected volatility for 2015, 2014 and 2013 was based on a combination of historical and market-based implied volatility from traded options on our stock. our computation of expected life was determined based on historical experience of similar awards, giving consideration to the contractual terms of the stock-based awards, vesting schedules and expectations of future employee behavior. the interest rate for periods within the contractual life of the award was based on the u.s. treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant. the estimation of awards that will ultimately vest requires judgment, and to the extent actual results or updated estimates differ from our current estimates, such amounts will be recorded as a cumulative adjustment in the period estimates are revised. we consider many factors when estimating forfeitures, including employee class and historical experience.
goodwill and intangible assets the purchase price of an acquired company is allocated between intangible assets and the net tangible assets of the acquired business with the residual of the purchase price recorded as goodwill. the determination of the value of the intangible assets acquired involves certain judgments and estimates. these judgments can include, but are not limited to, the cash flows that an asset is expected to generate in the future and the appropriate weighted average cost of capital.
at december 31, 2015, our goodwill totaled $4.5 billion and our identifiable intangible assets, net totaled $90 million. we assess the impairment of goodwill of our reporting units annually, or more often if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level by first performing a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value. if the reporting unit does not pass the qualitative assessment, then the reporting unit's carrying value is compared to its fair value. the fair values of the reporting units are estimated using market and discounted cash flow approaches. goodwill is considered impaired if the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value. the discounted cash flow approach uses expected future operating results. the market approach uses comparable company information to determine revenue and earnings multiples to value our reporting units. failure to achieve these expected results or market multiples may cause a future impairment of goodwill at the reporting unit. we conducted our annual impairment test of goodwill as of august 31, 2015 and 2014. additionally, we evaluated impairment based on the significant activities regarding the distribution and enterprise divestiture during the year. see "note 4 - discontinued operations" to the consolidated financial statements included in this report for further detail. as of december 31, 2015, we determined that no further impairment of the carrying value of goodwill for any reporting units was required. see "note 5 - goodwill and intangible assets" to the consolidated financial statements included in this report.
provision for transaction losses provision for transaction losses consists primarily of transaction loss expense associated with our customer protection programs, fraud and bad debt expense associated with our accounts receivable balance. we expect our provision for transaction losses to fluctuate depending on many factors, including changes to our customer protection programs and the impact of regulatory changes.
the following table illustrates the provision for transaction losses as a percentage of net revenues for 2015, 2014 and 2013:
provision for transaction losses as a % of net revenues         3.2     %   3.0                 %               2.9     %
determining appropriate allowances for these losses is an inherently uncertain process and is subject to numerous estimates and judgments, and ultimate losses may vary from the current estimates. we regularly update our allowance estimates as new facts become known and events occur that may impact the settlement or recovery of losses. the allowances are maintained at a level we deem appropriate to adequately provide for losses incurred at the balance sheet date. an aggregate 50 basis point deviation from our provision for transaction losses as a percentage of net revenues would have resulted in an increase or decrease in operating income of approximately $43 million in 2015, resulting in an approximate $0.02 change in diluted earnings per share.
legal contingencies in connection with certain pending litigation and other claims, we have estimated the range of probable loss, net of expected recoveries, and provided for such losses through charges to our consolidated statement of income. these estimates have been based on our assessment of the facts and circumstances at each balance sheet date and are subject to change based upon new information and future events.
from time to time, we are involved in disputes and regulatory inquiries that arise in the ordinary course of business. we are currently involved in legal proceedings, some of which are discussed in "item 1a: risk factors," "item 3: legal proceedings" and "note 13 - commitments and contingencies" to the consolidated financial statements included in this report. we believe that we have meritorious defenses to the claims against us, and we intend to defend ourselves vigorously. however, even if successful, our defense against certain actions will be costly and could require significant amounts of management's time and result in the diversion of significant operational resources. if the plaintiffs were to prevail on certain claims, we might be forced to pay significant damages and licensing fees, modify our business practices or even be prohibited from conducting a significant part of our business. any such results could materially harm our business and could result in a material adverse impact on the financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

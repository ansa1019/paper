management's strategic plans xcel energy strives to provide our investors an attractive total return and our customers with safe, clean and reliable energy services at a competitive price. this mission is enabled via four key strategic priorities:
•   improving utility performance;
•   driving operational excellence;
•   improving customer experience; and
•   investing for the future.
below is a discussion of these objectives.
improving utility performance xcel energy is made up of several utility operating companies. as part of the regulatory process, each state will generally establish an authorized roe. in many states, our utility operating companies earn less than the authorized roe due to numerous factors including the timing of implementation of new rates, timing of capital investments, a regulatory commission not allowing the recovery of certain costs, the time period used as a test year for rate cases, fluctuations in sales, the impact of weather, unanticipated cost increases, etc. the difference between the authorized return and what is actually earned is referred to as an roe gap. xcel energy is focused on reducing this gap over the next several years with specific goals as follows:
•   derive 75 percent of our revenue from regulated operations via multi-year regulatory plans by 2017.
we continue to pursue regulatory and legislative changes to streamline rate case proceedings and optimize recovery, while improving our alignment with state policies and keeping pace with evolving customer preferences.
driving operational excellence providing safe, reliable service to our customers has, and will continue to be, a fundamental priority. keeping our costs competitive is also essential in terms of customer affordability, business results and sustained company success over time. to more closely align o&m expense growth with projected sales growth, xcel energy is working to limit the increase in annual o&m expense to zero to two percent without compromising reliability or safety. we intend to accomplish this objective by continually improving our processes, leveraging technology, proactively managing risk and maintaining a workforce that is prepared to meet the needs of our business today and tomorrow.
improving customer experience the utility landscape is changing, and we must continue to thoughtfully anticipate and address the future needs of our stakeholders, including our customers, policymakers, employees and shareholders. adapting to this changing environment is critical to our long-term success. our customers expect to have choices, and we are committed to providing options and solutions that they want and value at a competitive price. our continued investments in clean energy is an example of this commitment to our customers. environmental stewardship remains foundational to xcel energy and is designed to meet customer and policy maker expectations while creating shareholder value. we will continue to offer and expand our production of renewable energy, including wind and solar alternatives, and further develop and promote dsm, conservation and renewable programs.
investing for the future sound investments today are necessary for tomorrow's success. our base capital expenditures are projected to be approximately $15.2 billion from 2016 through 2020. this capital forecast will grow rate base at a compounded average annual rate of approximately 3.7 percent, after reflecting the impact of the five year extension of bonus depreciation. our capital investment plan includes continuing investments in transmission, adding new generation, reducing emissions in our power plants, refreshing our infrastructure, improving reliability, replacing natural gas pipelines and increasing the levels of renewable energy on our system. in addition, xcel energy has potential incremental capital investments opportunities that could increase the base capital forecast by an additional $2.5 billion over the 2016-2020 timeframe. the potential incremental investment opportunities include renewables from the nsp system resource plan, renewables in colorado as part of the "our energy future" plan, distribution grid modernization, natural gas reserves in colorado and other investments. this would result in a total capital forecast of $17.7 billion for 2016-2020 and a rate base growth rate of 5.5 percent, after reflecting the impact of the five year extension of bonus depreciation.
xcel energy has a proven track record of making sound investments. we proactively made the decision to balance our generation portfolio and expand our alternative energy production. our customers, stakeholders and the environment are currently benefiting from these decisions and will continue to do so in the future.
providing an attractive total return successful execution of our strategic objectives should allow xcel energy to continue to deliver an attractive total return for our shareholders. through a combination of earnings growth and dividend yield, we plan to:
•   deliver long-term annual eps growth of four percent to six percent, based on ongoing 2015 eps of $2.10, which was the mid-point of xcel energy's 2015 ongoing guidance range;
•   deliver annual dividend increases of five percent to seven percent (prior objective was two to four percent annually);
•   target a dividend payout ratio of 60 to 70 percent of annual ongoing eps; and
we have successfully achieved our prior financial objectives, meeting or exceeding our earnings guidance range for eleven consecutive years and believe we are positioned to continue to deliver on our value proposition. our ongoing earnings have grown approximately 6.2 percent and our dividend has grown approximately 4.1 percent annually from 2005 through 2015. in addition, our current senior unsecured debt credit ratings for xcel energy and its utility subsidiaries are in the bbb+ to a range.
financial review the following discussion and analysis by management focuses on those factors that had a material effect on xcel energy's financial condition, results of operations and cash flows during the periods presented, or are expected to have a material impact in the future. it should be read in conjunction with the accompanying consolidated financial statements and the related notes to consolidated financial statements.
the only equity securities that are publicly traded are common shares of xcel energy inc. the diluted earnings and eps of each subsidiary as well as the roe of each subsidiary discussed below do not represent a direct legal interest in the assets and liabilities allocated to such subsidiary but rather represent a direct interest in our assets and liabilities as a whole. ongoing diluted eps and ongoing roe for xcel energy and by subsidiary are financial measures not recognized under gaap. ongoing diluted eps is calculated by dividing the net income or loss attributable to the controlling interest of each subsidiary, adjusted for certain nonrecurring items, by the weighted average fully diluted xcel energy inc. common shares outstanding for the period. ongoing roe is calculated by dividing the net income or loss attributable to the controlling interest of xcel energy or each subsidiary, adjusted for certain nonrecurring items, by each entity's average common stockholders' or stockholder's equity. we use these non-gaap financial measures to evaluate and provide details of earnings results. we believe these measurements are useful to investors to evaluate the actual and projected financial performance and contribution of our subsidiaries. these non-gaap financial measures should not be considered as alternatives to measures calculated and reported in accordance with gaap.
results of operations the following table summarizes the diluted eps for xcel energy:
equity earnings of unconsolidated subsidiaries          0.04              0.04              0.04
ongoing earnings exclude adjustments for certain items. for 2015, the adjustment to gaap earnings is related to the monticello nuclear facility lcm/epu project. for 2013, the adjustment is related to the sps ferc complaint case orders. see below for further discussion of the 2015 and 2013 adjustments and note 12 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the 2015 and 2013 adjustments.
xcel energy's management believes that ongoing earnings provide a meaningful comparison of earnings results and is representative of xcel energy's fundamental core earnings power. xcel energy's management uses ongoing earnings internally for financial planning and analysis, for reporting of results to the board of directors, in determining whether performance targets are met for performance-based compensation, and when communicating its earnings outlook to analysts and investors.
2015 adjustment to gaap earnings loss on monticello lcm/epu project - in march 2015, the mpuc approved full recovery, including a return, on $415 million of the project costs, inclusive of afudc, but only allow recovery of the remaining $333 million of costs with no return on this portion of the investment for 2015 and beyond. as a result of this decision, xcel energy recorded a pre-tax charge of approximately $129 million, or $79 million net of tax, in the first quarter of 2015. see note 12 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion.
2013 adjustment to gaap earnings sps ferc orders - as a result of orders issued in august 2013 by the ferc for a sps customer refund, a pre-tax charge of $36 million was recorded in 2013. of this amount, approximately $30 million ($26 million revenue reduction and $4 million of interest) was attributable to periods prior to 2013 and not representative of ongoing earnings. as such, gaap earnings include the total after tax amount of $24.4 million and ongoing earnings exclude $20.2 million. see note 12 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion.
xcel energy - overall, ongoing earnings increased $0.06 per share for 2015, which excludes an adjustment for a charge related to nsp-minnesota's monticello lcm/epu project. ongoing earnings increased primarily due to rate increases in various jurisdictions, non-fuel riders, a lower earnings test refund in colorado and a decline in operating and maintenance expenses. these positive factors were partially offset by the impact of negative weather as well as higher depreciation, property taxes, interest charges and lower afudc.
psco - psco's ongoing earnings increased $0.02 per share for 2015. higher revenue primarily due to the cacja rider (partially offset by an electric base rate decrease), as well as a natural gas rate increase (interim, subject to refund) effective in october 2015, lower estimated electric earnings test refunds and the positive impact of weather. these positive factors were partially offset by higher property taxes, depreciation, o&m expenses, interest charges and lower afudc.
nsp-minnesota - nsp-minnesota's ongoing earnings increased $0.05 per share for 2015. ongoing earnings were positively impacted by electric rate increases in minnesota, north dakota and south dakota, and lower o&m expenses. these positive factors were partially offset by unfavorable weather, sales decline, higher depreciation, increased interest charges, property taxes and lower afudc.
sps - sps' ongoing earnings decreased $0.01 per share for 2015. although texas electric rates rose as a result of the prior year rate case, this was reduced by the negative impact of the 2015 case. the net increase in electric rates was more than offset by additional depreciation, higher o&m expenses and lower afudc.
nsp-wisconsin - nsp-wisconsin's ongoing earnings increased $0.01 per share for 2015. higher electric revenues primarily driven by an electric rate increase and lower o&m expenses were partially offset by higher depreciation and lower natural gas margins.
xcel energy - overall, ongoing earnings increased $0.08 per share for 2014. ongoing earnings increased as a result of higher electric and natural gas margins due to rate increases in various jurisdictions, weather-normalized sales growth and lower interest charges. these positive factors were partially offset by the unfavorable impact of milder weather, as well as higher expected o&m expenses, property taxes and depreciation. 2013 gaap earnings include a $0.04 per share charge for a potential sps customer refund based on ferc orders issued in august 2013. this item was excluded from 2013 ongoing earnings.
psco - psco's ongoing earnings decreased $0.01 per share for 2014. higher natural gas and electric margins primarily due to rate increases, higher afudc, lower o&m expenses and weather-normalized sales growth were offset by higher property taxes, depreciation, accruals associated with the electric earnings test refund obligations and the unfavorable impact of weather.
nsp-minnesota - nsp-minnesota's ongoing earnings increased $0.01 per share for 2014. ongoing earnings were positively impacted by electric rate increases in minnesota (interim, subject to refund) and north dakota and weather-normalized sales growth. these items were partially offset by higher o&m expenses, the unfavorable impact of weather, lower afudc, increased property taxes and interest charges.
sps - sps' ongoing earnings increased $0.03 per share for 2014. electric rate increases in texas and new mexico and weather-normalized sales growth offset higher o&m and depreciation expenses.
nsp-wisconsin - nsp-wisconsin's ongoing earnings increased $0.02 per share for 2014. an electric rate increase led to higher electric margin, while weather-normalized sales growth positively impacted both electric and natural gas margins. these increases were partially offset by additional o&m expenses.
xcel energy inc. and other - xcel energy inc. and other includes financing costs at the holding company and other items. earnings improved by $0.03 per share for 2014, largely due to lower financing costs as a result of the refinancing of junior subordinated notes.

statement of income analysis the following discussion summarizes the items that affected the individual revenue and expense items reported in the consolidated statements of income.
estimated impact of temperature changes on regulated earnings - unusually hot summers or cold winters increase electric and natural gas sales, while mild weather reduces electric and natural gas sales. the estimated impact of weather on earnings is based on the number of customers, temperature variances and the amount of natural gas or electricity the average customer historically uses per degree of temperature. accordingly, deviations in weather from normal levels can affect xcel energy's financial performance.
degree-day or temperature-humidity index (thi) data is used to estimate amounts of energy required to maintain comfortable indoor temperature levels based on each day's average temperature and humidity. heating degree-days (hdd) is the measure of the variation in the weather based on the extent to which the average daily temperature falls below 65° fahrenheit. cooling degree-days (cdd) is the measure of the variation in the weather based on the extent to which the average daily temperature rises above 65° fahrenheit. each degree of temperature above 65° fahrenheit is counted as one cooling degree-day, and each degree of temperature below 65° fahrenheit is counted as one heating degree-day. in xcel energy's more humid service territories, a thi is used in place of cdd, which adds a humidity factor to cdd. hdd, cdd and thi are most likely to impact the usage of xcel energy's residential and commercial customers. industrial customers are less sensitive to weather.
normal weather conditions are defined as either the 20-year or 30-year average of actual historical weather conditions. the historical period of time used in the calculation of normal weather differs by jurisdiction, based on regulatory practice. to calculate the impact of weather on demand, a demand factor is applied to the weather impact on sales as defined above to derive the amount of demand associated with the weather impact.
weather - the following table summarizes the estimated impact of temperature variations on eps compared with sales under normal weather conditions:
firm natural gas   (0.018      )    0.019                (0.037      )    0.021                    (0.002        )
sales growth (decline) - the following tables summarize xcel energy and its utility subsidiaries' sales growth (decline) for actual and weather-normalized sales for the years ended dec. 31, compared with the previous year:
firm natural gas sales            (6.6   )        (16.6   )             n/a             (16.4   )           (10.5   )

(a)   extreme weather variations and additional factors such as windchill and cloud cover may not be reflected in weather-normalized and actual growth estimates.
weather-normalized electric 2015 growth (decline)
•   psco's residential growth was primarily the result of customer additions, partially offset by lower use per customer. commercial and industrial (c&amp;i) decline was primarily due to reduced sales to certain large manufacturing customers and/or those that support the fracking industry.
•   nsp-minnesota's residential decrease was due to lower use per customer, partially offset by an increase in customer additions. c&amp;i electric sales decreased as a result of lower use by large and small customers (e.g., services, retail trade, finance insurance and real estate industries), partially offset by higher use by certain large customers in the petroleum and food processing industries. the decline was partially reduced by an increase in the number of customers in both the small and large classes.
•   sps' residential growth reflects an increased number of customers. c&amp;i also had an increase in customers, primarily in the oil and gas exploration and production industries. however, this was partially offset by reduced activity per customer within these industries, as well as less irrigation by agricultural customers due to wet weather.
•   nsp-wisconsin's residential decline was primarily attributable to lower use per customer, partially offset by customer additions. c&amp;i electric sales growth was largely due to strong sales to large customers primarily in the oil and gas industries.
•   across natural gas service territories, lower natural gas sales reflect a decline in customer use.
weather-normalized sales for 2016 are projected to increase approximately 0.5 percent to 1.0 percent for retail electric customers and remain relatively flat for retail firm natural gas customers.

(a)   extreme weather variations and additional factors such as windchill and cloud cover may not be reflected in weather-normalized and actual growth estimates.
weather-normalized electric 2014 growth
•   nsp-wisconsin's electric sales growth was largely due to strong sales to large c&amp;i customers primarily in the oil, gas and sand mining industries.
•   sps' c&amp;i growth was driven by continued expansion from oil and gas exploration and production in the southeastern new mexico, permian basin area.
•   psco's electric sales growth was primarily due to customers in the food manufacturing, fracking and mining industries.
•   nsp-minnesota's electric sales growth was led by an increased number of customers for both residential and small c&amp;i, as well as higher use per customer in small c&amp;i.
weather-normalized natural gas 2014 growth
•   across our natural gas service territories, strong sales were experienced in 2014, which continued the trend that began in the last half of 2013.
electric revenues and margin electric revenues and fuel and purchased power expenses are largely impacted by the fluctuation in the price of natural gas, coal and uranium used in the generation of electricity, but as a result of the design of fuel recovery mechanisms to recover current expenses, these price fluctuations have minimal impact on electric margin. the following table details the electric revenues and margin:
(millions of dollars)               2015                2014                2013

(a)   the retail rate increases included final rates in texas, colorado (net of estimated earnings test refund obligations), new mexico, wisconsin and north dakota and interim rates in minnesota, which were subject to and net of estimated provision for refund.
(b)   as a result of two orders issued by the ferc in august 2013, a pretax charge of approximately $36 million ($32 million in electric revenues, of which $6 million relates to 2013 and $26 million relates to periods prior to 2013, and $4 million in interest charges) was recorded in 2013.
2014 comparison to 2013 - the increase in electric margin was primarily due to the various rate increases across all of the utility subsidiaries.
natural gas revenues and margin total natural gas expense tends to vary with changing sales requirements and the cost of natural gas purchases. however, due to the design of purchased natural gas cost recovery mechanisms to recover current expenses for sales to retail customers, fluctuations in the cost of natural gas have little effect on natural gas margin. the following table details natural gas revenues and margin:

•   nuclear cost increases are related to the amortization of prior outages and initiatives designed to improve the operational efficiencies of the plants; and
•   gain on sale of transmission assets relates to the 2013 gain associated with the sale of certain sps' transmission assets to sharyland.
conservation and dsm program expenses - conservation and dsm program expenses decreased $77.1 million, or 25.5 percent, for 2015 compared with 2014. the decrease was primarily attributable to lower electric and gas recovery rates at nsp-minnesota and psco. lower conservation and dsm program expenses are generally offset by lower revenues.
conservation and dsm program expenses increased $41.0 million, or 15.7 percent, for 2014 compared with 2013. the increase was primarily attributable to higher electric recovery rates at nsp-minnesota.
depreciation and amortization - depreciation and amortization increased $105.5 million, or 10.4 percent, for 2015 compared with 2014. the increase was primarily attributed to capital investments and lower amortization of the excess depreciation reserve in minnesota, partially offset by minnesota's amortization of the doe settlement.
depreciation and amortization increased $41.2 million, or 4.2 percent, for 2014 compared with 2013. the increase was primarily attributable to the pi steam generator replacement placed in service in december 2013 and normal system expansion, partially offset by additional accelerated amortization of the excess depreciation reserve associated with certain minnesota assets.
afudc, equity and debt - afudc decreased $46.0 million for 2015 compared with 2014. the decrease was primarily due to the implementation of the cacja rider, facilitating earlier and alternative recovery of construction costs.
afudc increased $1.3 million for 2014 compared with 2013. the increase was primarily due to construction related to the cacja and the expansion of transmission facilities, partially offset by the portion of the monticello lcm/epu placed in service in july 2013 and the pi steam generator replacement placed in service in december 2013.
interest charges - interest charges increased $28.7 million, or 5.1 percent, for 2015 compared with 2014. the increase was primarily due to higher long-term debt levels, partially offset by refinancings at lower interest rates.
interest charges decreased $8.6 million, or 1.5 percent, for 2014 compared with 2013. the decrease was primarily due to refinancings at lower interest rates, partially offset by higher long-term debt levels. in addition, interest charges in 2013 reflected $4 million of interest associated with the customer refund at sps based on a ferc order, interest on customer refunds in minnesota and the write off of $6.3 million of unamortized debt expense related to the junior subordinated notes called in may 2013.
income taxes - income tax expense increased $18.9 million for 2015 compared with 2014. the increase was primarily due to a higher tax benefit for a carryback claim in 2014 and decrease in permanent plant-related deductions (e.g., afudc-equity) in 2015. the etr was 35.5 percent for 2015 compared with 33.9 percent for 2014. see note 6 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion.
income tax expense increased $39.8 million for 2014 compared with 2013. the increase was primarily due to higher 2014 pretax earnings and recognition of additional r&e credits in 2013. these were partially offset by a 2014 tax benefit for prior year adjustments. the etr was 33.9 percent for 2014 compared with 33.8 percent for 2013. see note 6 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion.

factors affecting results of operations xcel energy's utility revenues depend on customer usage, which varies with weather conditions, general business conditions and the cost of energy services. various regulatory agencies approve the prices for electric and natural gas service within their respective jurisdictions and affect xcel energy's ability to recover its costs from customers. the historical and future trends of xcel energy's operating results have been, and are expected to be, affected by a number of factors, including those listed below.
general economic conditions economic conditions may have a material impact on xcel energy's operating results. while economic growth has been improving over the past year, management cannot predict whether this trend will be sustained going forward. other events impact overall economic conditions and management cannot predict the impact of fluctuating energy prices, terrorist activity, war or the threat of war. however, xcel energy could experience a material impact to its results of operations, future growth or ability to raise capital resulting from a sustained general slowdown in economic growth or a significant increase in interest rates.
fuel supply and costs xcel energy inc.'s operating utilities have varying dependence on coal, natural gas and uranium. changes in commodity prices are generally recovered through fuel recovery mechanisms and have very little impact on earnings. however, availability of supply, the potential implementation of a carbon tax or emissions-related generation restrictions and unanticipated changes in regulatory recovery mechanisms could impact our operations. see item 1 for further discussion of fuel supply and costs.
pension plan costs and assumptions xcel energy has significant net pension and postretirement benefit costs that are measured using actuarial valuations. inherent in these valuations are key assumptions including discount rates and expected return on plan assets. xcel energy evaluates these key assumptions at least annually by analyzing current market conditions, which include changes in interest rates and market returns. changes in the related net pension and postretirement benefits costs and funding requirements may occur in the future due to changes in assumptions. the payout of a significant percentage of pension plan liabilities in a single year due to high retirements or employees leaving the company would trigger settlement accounting and could require the company to recognize material incremental pension expense related to unrecognized plan losses in the year these liabilities are paid. for further discussion and a sensitivity analysis on these assumptions, see "employee benefits" under critical accounting policies and estimates.
regulation ferc and state regulation - the ferc and various state and local regulatory commissions regulate xcel energy inc.'s utility subsidiaries and transco subsidiaries. decisions by these regulators can significantly impact xcel energy's results of operations. xcel energy expects to periodically file for rate changes based on changing energy market and general economic conditions.
the electric and natural gas rates charged to customers of xcel energy inc.'s utility subsidiaries are approved by the ferc or the regulatory commissions in the states in which they operate. the rates are designed to recover plant investment, operating costs and an allowed return on investment. rates charged by xcel energy inc.'s transco subsidiaries and wgi are approved by the ferc. xcel energy requests changes in rates for utility services through filings with the governing commissions. changes in operating costs can affect xcel energy's financial results, depending on the timing of filing general rate cases and the implementation of final rates. in addition to changes in operating costs, other factors affecting rate filings are new investments, sales, conservation and dsm efforts, and the cost of capital. in addition, the regulatory commissions authorize the roe, capital structure and depreciation rates in rate proceedings.
wholesale energy market regulation - wholesale energy markets in the midwest and south central u.s. are operated by miso and spp, respectively, to centrally dispatch all regional electric generation and apply a regional transmission congestion management system. nsp-minnesota and nsp-wisconsin are members of miso and sps is a member of spp. nsp-minnesota, nsp-wisconsin and sps expect to recover energy charges through either base rates or various recovery mechanisms. see note 12 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion.
capital expenditure regulation - xcel energy inc.'s utility subsidiaries make substantial investments in plant additions to build and upgrade power plants, and expand and maintain the reliability of the energy transmission and distribution systems. in addition to filings for increases in base rates charged to customers to recover the costs associated with such investments, the cpuc, mpuc, sdpuc, ndpsc and puct in certain instances have approved proposals to recover, through a rate rider, costs to upgrade generation plants and lower emissions, increase transmission investment cost, and/or increase distribution investment cost, and increase purchased power capacity cost. these non-fuel rate riders are expected to provide cash flows to enable recovery of costs incurred on a more timely basis. for wholesale electric transmission and production services, xcel energy has, consistent with ferc policy, implemented formula rates for each of the utility subsidiaries that will provide annual rate changes as transmission or production investments increase in a manner similar to the retail rate riders. in november 2014, the ferc approved transmission formula rates for xetd and xest, which would apply to electric transmission assets the transcos may own. nsp-minnesota and nsp-wisconsin have no cost-based wholesale production customers and therefore have not implemented a production formula rate.
environmental matters environmental costs include accruals for nuclear plant decommissioning and payments for storage of spent nuclear fuel, disposal of hazardous materials and waste, remediation of contaminated sites, monitoring of discharges to the environment and compliance with laws and permits with respect to emissions. a trend of greater environmental awareness and increasingly stringent regulation may continue to cause higher operating expenses and capital expenditures for environmental compliance.
costs charged to operating expenses for nuclear decommissioning and spent nuclear fuel disposal expenses, environmental monitoring and disposal of hazardous materials and waste were approximately:
xcel energy estimates an average annual expense of approximately $338 million from 2016 through 2020 for similar costs. the precise timing and amount of environmental costs, including those for site remediation and disposal of hazardous materials, are unknown. additionally, the extent to which environmental costs will be included in and recovered through rates may fluctuate.
capital expenditures for environmental improvements at regulated facilities were approximately:
see item 7 - capital requirements for further discussion.
xcel energy's operations are subject to federal and state laws and regulations related to air emissions, water discharges and waste management from various sources. such laws and regulations impose monitoring and reporting requirements and may require xcel energy to obtain pre-approval for the construction or modification of projects that increase air emissions, water discharges or land disposal of wastes, obtain and comply with permits that contain emission, discharge and operational limitations, or install or operate pollution control equipment at facilities. xcel energy will likely be required to incur capital expenditures in the future to comply with these requirements for remediation of mgp and other legacy sites and various regulations for air emissions, water intake and discharge and waste disposal. actual expenditures could vary from the estimates presented. the scope and timing of these expenditures cannot be determined until any new or revised regulations become final or until more information is learned about the need for remediation at the legacy sites.
pollution control equipment can be required by federal and state regulations, such as those requiring mercury emission reductions, and by state or federal implementation plans, such as those to address visibility impairment, interstate air pollution impacts or attainment of naaqs. xcel energy has installed and is operating control equipment needed to comply with the requirements of the federal mercury and air toxic standards rule. most recently, the epa has adopted a federal visibility plan for texas which imposes so2 emission limitations that reflect installation of dry scrubbers on tolk units 1 and 2, with compliance required by early 2021.
see note 13 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of xcel energy's environmental contingencies.
inflation inflation at its current level is not expected to materially affect xcel energy's prices or returns to shareholders. however, potential future inflation could result from economic conditions or the economic and monetary policies of the u.s. government and the federal reserve. this could lead to future price increases for materials and services required to deliver electric and natural gas services to customers. these potential cost increases could in turn lead to increased prices to customers. if current low oil prices lead to sustained deflation, that could also reduce general economic activity although it may lead to lower electric and natural gas prices to customers.
critical accounting policies and estimates preparation of the consolidated financial statements and related disclosures in compliance with gaap requires the application of accounting rules and guidance, as well as the use of estimates. the application of these policies involves judgments regarding future events, including the likelihood of success of particular projects, legal and regulatory challenges and anticipated recovery of costs. these judgments could materially impact the consolidated financial statements and disclosures, based on varying assumptions. in addition, the financial and operating environment also may have a significant effect on the operation of the business and on the results reported. the following is a list of accounting policies and estimates that are most significant to the portrayal of xcel energy's financial condition and results, and require management's most difficult, subjective or complex judgments. each of these has a higher likelihood of resulting in materially different reported amounts under different conditions or using different assumptions. each critical accounting policy has been reviewed and discussed with the audit committee of xcel energy inc.'s board of directors on a quarterly basis.
regulatory accounting xcel energy inc. is a holding company with rate-regulated subsidiaries that are subject to the accounting for regulated operations, which provides that rate-regulated entities report assets and liabilities consistent with the recovery of those incurred costs in rates, if the competitive environment makes it probable that such rates will be charged and collected. xcel energy's rates are derived through the ratemaking process, which results in the recording of regulatory assets and liabilities based on the probability of future cash flows. regulatory assets generally represent incurred or accrued costs that have been deferred because future recovery from customers is probable. regulatory liabilities generally represent amounts that are expected to be refunded to customers in future rates or amounts collected in current rates for future costs. in other businesses or industries, regulatory assets and regulatory liabilities would generally be charged to net income or oci.
each reporting period xcel energy assesses the probability of future recoveries and obligations associated with regulatory assets and liabilities. factors such as the current regulatory environment, recently issued rate orders and historical precedents are considered. decisions made by regulatory agencies can directly impact the amount and timing of cost recovery as well as the rate of return on invested capital, and may materially impact xcel energy's results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.
as of dec. 31, 2015 and 2014, xcel energy has recorded regulatory assets of $3.2 billion and regulatory liabilities of $1.6 billion. each subsidiary is subject to regulation that varies from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. if future recovery of costs, in any such jurisdiction, ceases to be probable, xcel energy would be required to charge these assets to current net income or oci. in assessing the probability of recovery of recognized regulatory assets, xcel energy noted no current or anticipated proposals or changes in the regulatory environment that it expects will materially impact the probability of recovery of the assets. see note 15 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of regulatory assets and liabilities and note 12 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of rate matters.
income tax accruals judgment, uncertainty, and estimates are a significant aspect of the income tax accrual process that accounts for the effects of current and deferred income taxes. uncertainty associated with the application of tax statutes and regulations and the outcomes of tax audits and appeals require that judgment and estimates be made in the accrual process and in the calculation of the etr. changes in tax laws and rates may affect recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities and our etr in the future. there exists the potential for federal tax reform that may significantly change the tax rules applicable to xcel energy. at this time, due to the inherent uncertainty of future legislation, any potential resulting impact cannot be reasonably estimated.
etrs are highly impacted by assumptions. etr calculations are revised every quarter based on best available year-end tax assumptions (income levels, deductions, credits, etc.); adjusted in the following year after returns are filed, with the tax accrual estimates being trued-up to the actual amounts claimed on the tax returns; and further adjusted after examinations by taxing authorities have been completed.
in accordance with the interim period reporting guidance, income tax expense for the first three quarters in a year is based on the forecasted annual etr. the forecasted etr reflects a number of estimates including forecasted annual income, permanent tax adjustments and tax credits.
accounting for income taxes also requires that only tax benefits that meet the more likely than not recognition threshold can be recognized or continue to be recognized. the change in the unrecognized tax benefits needs to be reasonably estimated based on evaluation of the nature of uncertainty, the nature of event that could cause the change and an estimated range of reasonably possible changes. management will use prudent business judgment to derecognize appropriate amounts of tax benefits at any period end, and as new developments occur. unrecognized tax benefits can be recognized as issues are favorably resolved and loss exposures decline.
we may adjust our unrecognized tax benefits and interest accruals to the updated estimates as disputes with the irs and state tax authorities are resolved. these adjustments may increase or decrease earnings. see note 6 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion.
employee benefits xcel energy's pension costs are based on an actuarial calculation that includes a number of key assumptions, most notably the annual return level that pension and postretirement health care investment assets are expected to earn in the future and the interest rate used to discount future pension benefit payments to a present value obligation. in addition, the pension cost calculation uses an asset-smoothing methodology to reduce the volatility of varying investment performance over time. see note 9 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion on the rate of return and discount rate used in the calculation of pension costs and obligations.
pension costs are expected to decrease in 2016 and continue to decline in the following few years. funding requirements increased in 2016 and then be flat in the following years. while investment returns exceeded the assumed levels in 2014, investment returns were below the assumed levels in 2013 and 2015. the pension cost calculation uses a market-related valuation of pension assets. xcel energy uses a calculated value method to determine the market-related value of the plan assets. the market-related value is determined by adjusting the fair market value of assets at the beginning of the year to reflect the investment gains and losses (the difference between the actual investment return and the expected investment return on the market-related value) during each of the previous five years at the rate of 20 percent per year. as these differences between the actual investment returns and the expected investment returns are incorporated into the market-related value, the differences are recognized in pension cost over the expected average remaining years of service for active employees which was approximately 11 years in 2015.
based on current assumptions and the recognition of past investment gains and losses, xcel energy currently projects the pension costs recognized for financial reporting purposes will be $120.7 million in 2016 and $117.0 million in 2017, while the actual pension costs were $127.7 million in 2015 and $126.5 million in 2014. the expected decrease in 2016 costs is due primarily to the reduction in historic loss amortization amounts including the 2008 market loss and an increase in the discount rate, which were offset by current year asset losses and a lowering of the expected return on asset assumption.  further, future year costs are expected to decrease primarily as a result of reductions in loss amortizations and an increase in expected return on assets due to planned future contributions and expected return of current assets.
in 2014, the society of actuaries published a new mortality table and projection scale that increased the overall life expectancy of males and females. xcel energy has reviewed its own population through a credibility analysis and adopted the rp 2014 table, with modifications, based on our population and specific experience. further, at year-end 2015, xcel energy evaluated the updated projection table, mp 2015, and concluded that the methodology adopted at the end of 2014 is consistent with the new projection table and continues to be representative of xcel energy's population. therefore, no changes are required.
at dec. 31, 2015, xcel energy set the rate of return on assets used to measure pension costs at 6.87 percent, which is a 22 basis point decrease from dec. 31, 2014. the rate of return used to measure postretirement health care costs is 5.80 percent at dec. 31, 2015 and this is consistent with dec. 31, 2014. xcel energy's ongoing investment strategy is based on plan-specific investment recommendations that seek to minimize potential investment and interest rate risk as a plan's funded status increases over time. the investment recommendations result in a greater percentage of long-duration fixed income securities being allocated to specific plans having relatively higher funded status ratios and a greater percentage of growth assets being allocated to plans having relatively lower funded status ratios.
xcel energy set the discount rates used to value the dec. 31, 2015 pension and postretirement health care obligations at 4.66 percent and 4.65 percent, which represent a 55 basis point and 57 basis point increase from dec. 31, 2014, respectively. xcel energy uses a bond matching study as its primary basis for determining the discount rate used to value pension and postretirement health care obligations. the bond matching study utilizes a portfolio of high grade (aa or higher) bonds that matches the expected cash flows of xcel energy's benefit plans in amount and duration. the effective yield on this cash flow matched bond portfolio determines the discount rate for the individual plans. the bond matching study is validated for reasonableness against the citigroup pension liability discount curve and the citigroup above median curve. at dec. 31, 2015, these reference points supported the selected rate. in addition to these reference points, xcel energy also reviews general actuarial survey data to assess the reasonableness of the discount rate selected.
the following are the pension funding contributions across all four of xcel energy's pension plans, both voluntary and required, for 2013 through 2016:
for future years, we anticipate contributions will be made as necessary. these contributions are summarized in note 9 to the consolidated financial statements. future year amounts are estimates and may change based on actual market performance, changes in interest rates and any changes in governmental regulations. therefore, additional contributions could be required in the future.
if xcel energy were to use alternative assumptions at dec. 31, 2015, a one-percent change would result in the following impact on 2016 pension costs:
(millions of dollars)   +1%                         -1%
rate of return          $(20.5      )         $20.9
(a)   these costs include the effects of regulation.
effective jan. 1, 2016, the initial medical trend assumption decreased from 6.50 percent to 6.00 percent. the ultimate trend assumption remained at 4.5 percent. the period until the ultimate rate is reached is three years. xcel energy bases its medical trend assumption on the long-term cost inflation expected in the health care market, considering the levels projected and recommended by industry experts, as well as recent actual medical cost experienced by xcel energy's retiree medical plan.
•   xcel energy contributed $18.3 million, $17.1 million and $17.6 million during 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively, to the postretirement health care plans.
xcel energy recovers employee benefits costs in its regulated utility operations consistent with accounting guidance with the exception of the areas noted below.
•   colorado, texas, new mexico and ferc jurisdictions allow the recovery of other postretirement benefit costs only to the extent that recognized expense is matched by cash contributions to an irrevocable trust. xcel energy has consistently funded at a level to allow full recovery of costs in these jurisdictions.
•   psco and sps recognize pension expense in all regulatory jurisdictions based on expense consistent with accounting guidance. the texas and colorado electric retail jurisdictions, and commencing in 2016, the colorado gas retail jurisdiction, each record the difference between annual recognized pension expense and the annual amount of pension expense approved in their last respective general rate case as a deferral to a regulatory asset.
see note 9 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion.
nuclear decommissioning xcel energy recognizes liabilities for the expected cost of retiring tangible long-lived assets for which a legal obligation exists. these aros are recognized at fair value as incurred and are capitalized as part of the cost of the related long-lived assets. in the absence of quoted market prices, xcel energy estimates the fair value of its aros using present value techniques, in which it makes various assumptions including estimates of the amounts and timing of future cash flows associated with retirement activities, credit-adjusted risk free rates and cost escalation rates. when xcel energy revises any assumptions used to estimate aros, it adjusts the carrying amount of both the aro liability and the related long-lived asset. xcel energy accretes aro liabilities to reflect the passage of time using the interest method.
a significant portion of xcel energy's aros relates to the future decommissioning of nsp-minnesota's nuclear facilities. the total obligation for nuclear decommissioning is expected to be funded 100 percent by the external decommissioning trust fund. the difference between regulatory funding (including depreciation expense less returns from the external trust fund) and expense recognized under current accounting guidance is deferred as a regulatory asset. the amounts recorded for aros related to future nuclear decommissioning were $2.141 billion and $2.038 billion as of dec. 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. based on their significance, the following discussion relates specifically to the aros associated with nuclear decommissioning.
nsp-minnesota obtains periodic cost studies in order to estimate the cost and timing of planned nuclear decommissioning activities. these independent cost studies are based on relevant information available at the time performed. estimates of future cash flows for extended periods of time are by nature highly uncertain and may vary significantly from actual results. nsp-minnesota is required to file a nuclear decommissioning study every three years. in december 2014, nsp-minnesota submitted this filing to the mpuc, which covered all expenses over the decommissioning period of the nuclear plants, including decontamination and removal of radioactive material. the mpuc approved the study in october 2015.
•   timing - decommissioning cost estimates are impacted by each facility's retirement date and the expected timing of the actual decommissioning activities. currently, the estimated retirement dates coincide with each unit's operating license with the nrc (i.e., 2030 for monticello and 2033 and 2034 for pi's unit 1 and 2, respectively). the estimated timing of the decommissioning activities is based upon the decon method, which is required by the mpuc. by utilizing this method, which assumes prompt removal and dismantlement, these activities are expected to begin at the end of the license date and be completed for both facilities by 2091.
•   technology and regulation - there is limited experience with actual decommissioning of large nuclear facilities. changes in technology and experience as well as changes in regulations regarding nuclear decommissioning could cause cost estimates to change significantly. nsp-minnesota's 2014 nuclear decommissioning filing assumed current technology and regulations.
•   escalation rates - escalation rates represent projected cost increases over time due to both general inflation and increases in the cost of specific decommissioning activities. nsp-minnesota used an escalation rate of 4.36 percent in calculating the aros related to nuclear decommissioning for the remaining operational period through the radiological decommissioning period. an escalation rate of 3.36 percent was utilized for the period of operating costs related to interim dry cask storage of spent nuclear fuel and site restoration.
•   discount rates - changes in timing or estimated expected cash flows that result in upward revisions to the aro are calculated using the then-current credit-adjusted risk-free interest rate. the credit-adjusted risk-free rate in effect when the change occurs is used to discount the revised estimate of the incremental expected cash flows of the retirement activity. if the change in timing or estimated expected cash flows results in a downward revision of the aro, the undiscounted revised estimate of expected cash flows is discounted using the credit-adjusted risk-free rate in effect at the date of initial measurement and recognition of the original aro. discount rates ranging from approximately four and seven percent have been used to calculate the net present value of the expected future cash flows over time.
significant uncertainties exist in estimating the future cost of nuclear decommissioning including the method to be utilized, the ultimate costs to decommission, and the planned method of disposing spent fuel. if different cost estimates, life assumptions or cost escalation rates were utilized, the aros could change materially. however, changes in estimates should have minimal impact on results of operations as nsp-minnesota expects to continue to recover all costs in future rates.
xcel energy continually makes judgments and estimates related to these critical accounting policy areas, based on an evaluation of the varying assumptions and uncertainties for each area. the information and assumptions underlying many of these judgments and estimates will be affected by events beyond the control of xcel energy, or otherwise change over time. this may require adjustments to recorded results to better reflect the events and updated information that becomes available. the accompanying financial statements reflect management's best estimates and judgments of the impact of these factors as of dec. 31, 2015.
derivatives, risk management and market risk xcel energy inc. and its subsidiaries are exposed to a variety of market risks in the normal course of business. market risk is the potential loss that may occur as a result of adverse changes in the market or fair value of a particular instrument or commodity. all financial and commodity-related instruments, including derivatives, are subject to market risk. see note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of market risks associated with derivatives.
xcel energy is exposed to the impact of adverse changes in price for energy and energy-related products, which is partially mitigated by the use of commodity derivatives. in addition to ongoing monitoring and maintaining credit policies intended to minimize overall credit risk, when necessary, management takes steps to mitigate changes in credit and concentration risks associated with its derivatives and other contracts, including parental guarantees and requests of collateral. while xcel energy expects that the counterparties will perform under the contracts underlying its derivatives, the contracts expose xcel energy to some credit and non-performance risk.
though no material non-performance risk currently exists with the counterparties to xcel energy's commodity derivative contracts, distress in the financial markets may in the future impact that risk to the extent it impacts those counterparties. distress in the financial markets may also impact the fair value of the securities in the nuclear decommissioning fund and master pension trust, as well as xcel energy's ability to earn a return on short-term investments of excess cash.
commodity price risk - xcel energy inc.'s utility subsidiaries are exposed to commodity price risk in their electric and natural gas operations. commodity price risk is managed by entering into long- and short-term physical purchase and sales contracts for electric capacity, energy and energy-related products and for various fuels used in generation and distribution activities. commodity price risk is also managed through the use of financial derivative instruments. xcel energy's risk management policy allows it to manage commodity price risk within each rate-regulated operation to the extent such exposure exists.
wholesale and commodity trading risk - xcel energy inc.'s utility subsidiaries conduct various wholesale and commodity trading activities, including the purchase and sale of electric capacity, energy and energy-related instruments. xcel energy's risk management policy allows management to conduct these activities within guidelines and limitations as approved by its risk management committee, which is made up of management personnel not directly involved in the activities governed by this policy.

at dec. 31, 2015, a 10 percent increase in market prices for commodity trading contracts would increase pretax income by approximately $0.3 million, whereas a 10 percent decrease would decrease pretax income by approximately $0.3 million. at dec. 31, 2014, a 10 percent increase in market prices for commodity trading contracts would increase pretax income by approximately $0.9 million, whereas a 10 percent decrease would decrease pretax income by approximately $0.9 million.
xcel energy inc.'s utility subsidiaries' wholesale and commodity trading operations measure the outstanding risk exposure to price changes on transactions, contracts and obligations that have been entered into, but not closed, including transactions that are not recorded at fair value, using an industry standard methodology known as value at risk (var). var expresses the potential change in fair value on the outstanding transactions, contracts and obligations over a particular period of time under normal market conditions.

nuclear fuel supply - nsp-minnesota is scheduled to take delivery of approximately 46 percent of its 2016 and approximately 16 percent of its 2017 enriched nuclear material requirements from sources that could be impacted by events in ukraine and sanctions against russia. alternate potential sources are expected to provide the flexibility to manage nsp-minnesota's nuclear fuel supply to ensure that plant availability and reliability will not be negatively impacted in the near-term. long-term, through 2024, nsp-minnesota is scheduled to take delivery of approximately 35 percent of its average enriched nuclear material requirements from sources that could be impacted by events in ukraine and extended sanctions against russia. nsp-minnesota is closely following the progression of these events and will periodically assess if further actions are required to assure a secure supply of enriched nuclear material beyond 2016.
interest rate risk - xcel energy is subject to the risk of fluctuating interest rates in the normal course of business. xcel energy's risk management policy allows interest rate risk to be managed through the use of fixed rate debt, floating rate debt and interest rate derivatives such as swaps, caps, collars and put or call options.
at dec. 31, 2015 and 2014, a 100 basis point change in the benchmark rate on xcel energy's variable rate debt would impact annual pretax interest expense by approximately $8.5 million and $10.4 million, respectively. see note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of xcel energy inc. and its subsidiaries' interest rate derivatives.
nsp-minnesota also maintains a nuclear decommissioning fund, as required by the nrc. the nuclear decommissioning fund is subject to interest rate risk and equity price risk. at dec. 31, 2015, the fund was invested in a diversified portfolio of cash equivalents, debt securities, equity securities, and other investments. these investments may be used only for activities related to nuclear decommissioning. given the purpose and legal restrictions on the use of nuclear decommissioning fund assets, realized and unrealized gains on fund investments over the life of the fund are deferred as an offset of nsp-minnesota's regulatory asset for nuclear decommissioning costs. consequently, any realized and unrealized gains and losses on securities in the nuclear decommissioning fund, including any other-than-temporary impairments, are deferred as a component of the regulatory asset for nuclear decommissioning. since the accounting for nuclear decommissioning recognizes that costs are recovered through rates, fluctuations in equity prices or interest rates affecting the nuclear decommissioning fund do not have a direct impact on earnings.
credit risk - xcel energy inc. and its subsidiaries are also exposed to credit risk. credit risk relates to the risk of loss resulting from counterparties' nonperformance on their contractual obligations. xcel energy inc. and its subsidiaries maintain credit policies intended to minimize overall credit risk and actively monitor these policies to reflect changes and scope of operations.
at dec. 31, 2015, a 10 percent increase in commodity prices would have resulted in a decrease in credit exposure of $1.9 million, while a decrease in prices of 10 percent would have resulted in an increase in credit exposure of $6.1 million. at dec. 31, 2014, a 10 percent increase in commodity prices would have resulted in an increase in credit exposure of $12.2 million, while a decrease in prices of 10 percent would have resulted in an increase in credit exposure of $2.7 million.
xcel energy inc. and its subsidiaries conduct standard credit reviews for all counterparties. xcel energy employs additional credit risk control mechanisms when appropriate, such as letters of credit, parental guarantees, standardized master netting agreements and termination provisions that allow for offsetting of positive and negative exposures. credit exposure is monitored and, when necessary, the activity with a specific counterparty is limited until credit enhancement is provided. distress in the financial markets could increase xcel energy's credit risk.
fair value measurements xcel energy follows accounting and disclosure guidance on fair value measurements that contains a hierarchy for inputs used in measuring fair value and requires disclosure of the observability of the inputs used in these measurements. see note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the fair value hierarchy and the amounts of assets and liabilities measured at fair value that have been assigned to level 3.
commodity derivatives - xcel energy continuously monitors the creditworthiness of the counterparties to its commodity derivative contracts and assesses each counterparty's ability to perform on the transactions set forth in the contracts. given this assessment and the typically short duration of these contracts, the impact of discounting commodity derivative assets for counterparty credit risk was not material to the fair value of commodity derivative assets at dec. 31, 2015. adjustments to fair value for credit risk of commodity trading instruments are recorded in electric revenues. credit risk adjustments for other commodity derivative instruments are deferred as oci or regulatory assets and liabilities. the classification as a regulatory asset or liability is based on commission approved regulatory recovery mechanisms. xcel energy also assesses the impact of its own credit risk when determining the fair value of commodity derivative liabilities. the impact of discounting commodity derivative liabilities for credit risk was immaterial to the fair value of commodity derivative liabilities at dec. 31, 2015.
commodity derivative assets and liabilities assigned to level 3 typically consist of ftrs, as well as forwards and options that are long-term in nature. level 3 commodity derivative assets and liabilities represent 1.3 percent and 12.2 percent of gross assets and liabilities, respectively, measured at fair value at dec. 31, 2015.
determining the fair value of ftrs requires numerous management forecasts that vary in observability, including various forward commodity prices, retail and wholesale demand, generation and resulting transmission system congestion. given the limited observability of management's forecasts for several of these inputs, these instruments have been assigned a level 3. level 3 commodity derivatives assets and liabilities included $22.7 million and $4.6 million of estimated fair values, respectively, for ftrs held at dec. 31, 2015.
determining the fair value of certain commodity forwards and options can require management to make use of subjective price and volatility forecasts which extend to periods beyond those readily observable on active exchanges or quoted by brokers. when less observable forward price and volatility forecasts are significant to determining the value of commodity forwards and options, these instruments are assigned to level 3. there were no level 3 forwards or options held at dec. 31, 2015.
nuclear decommissioning fund - nuclear decommissioning fund assets assigned to level 3 consist of private equity investments and real estate investments. based on an evaluation of nsp-minnesota's ability to redeem private equity investments and real estate investment funds measured at net asset value, estimated fair values for these investments totaling $242.3 million in the nuclear decommissioning fund at dec. 31, 2015 (approximately 13.6 percent of total assets measured at fair value) are assigned to level 3. realized and unrealized gains and losses on nuclear decommissioning fund investments are deferred as a regulatory asset.

net cash provided by operating activities increased by $378 million for 2015 as compared to 2014. the increase was primarily due to rate increases in various jurisdictions, higher customer refunds in 2014 and income tax refunds received in 2015 compared to taxes paid in 2014, partially offset by refunds issued as part of a settlement agreement with golden spread and pnm in 2015.
net cash provided by operating activities increased by $64 million for 2014 as compared to 2013. additional net income, excluding amounts related to non-cash operating activities (e.g. depreciation and deferred tax expenses) and lower pension contributions in 2014 were offset by changes in working capital and other noncurrent assets and liabilities.

net cash used in investing activities increased by $506 million for 2015 as compared to 2014. the increase was primarily attributable to the acquisition of two wind projects in 2015, partially offset by higher insurance proceeds related to sherco unit 3 received in 2015.
net cash used in investing activities decreased by $96 million for 2014 as compared to 2013. the decrease was primarily attributable to higher capital expenditures in 2013 associated with several major construction projects including the monticello nuclear epu and the pi steam generator replacement. the change in capital expenditures was partially offset by the impact of higher insurance proceeds related to sherco unit 3 and proceeds received from the sale of certain transmission assets to sharyland in 2013.

net cash provided by financing activities increased by $160 million for 2015 as compared to 2014. the increase was primarily due to higher debt issuances, partially offset by repayments of short-term debt in 2015 compared to proceeds in 2014 and the impact of less common stock issuances in 2015.
net cash provided by financing activities decreased by $212 million for 2014 as compared to 2013. the decrease was primarily due to lower proceeds from long-term debt, less issuances of common stock and higher dividend payments, partially offset by higher proceeds from short-term debt and lower repayments of long-term debt.
see discussion of trends, commitments and uncertainties, and the potential future impact on cash flow and liquidity under capital sources.
capital requirements xcel energy expects to meet future financing requirements by periodically issuing short-term debt, long-term debt, common stock, hybrid and other securities to maintain desired capitalization ratios.

in addition, xcel energy has potential incremental capital investment opportunities that could increase the base capital forecast by $2.5 billion over the 2016-2020 timeframe. the potential incremental investment opportunities include renewables from the nsp system resource plan, renewables in colorado as part of the "our energy future" plan, distribution grid modernization, natural gas reserves in colorado and other investments. this would result in a total capital forecast of $17.7 billion for 2016-2020.
the capital expenditure programs of xcel energy are subject to continuing review and modification. actual utility capital expenditures may vary from the estimates due to changes in electric and natural gas projected load growth, regulatory decisions, legislative initiatives, reserve margin requirements, the availability of purchased power, alternative plans for meeting long-term energy needs, compliance with environmental requirements, rps and merger, acquisition and divestiture opportunities. the table above does not include potential expenditures of xcel energy's transcos.
xcel energy issues debt and equity securities to refinance retiring maturities, reduce short-term debt, fund capital programs, infuse equity in subsidiaries, fund asset acquisitions and for other general corporate purposes. xcel energy does not anticipate issuing any equity to fund its base capital investment program for 2016-2020. the current estimated financing plans of xcel energy inc. and its subsidiaries for the years 2016 through 2020 are shown in the table below.

(a)   includes interest payments over the terms of the debt. interest is calculated using the applicable interest rate at dec. 31, 2015, and outstanding principal for each investment with the terms ending at each instrument's maturity.
(b)   under some leases, xcel energy would have to sell or purchase the property that it leases if it chose to terminate before the scheduled lease expiration date. most of xcel energy's railcar, vehicle and equipment and aircraft leases have these terms. at dec. 31, 2015, the amount that xcel energy would have to pay if it chose to terminate these leases was approximately $61.0 million. in addition, at the end of the equipment lease terms, each lease must be extended, equipment purchased for the greater of the fair value or unamortized value of equipment sold to a third party with xcel energy making up any deficiency between the sales price and the unamortized value.
(c)   included in operating lease payments are $217.0 million, $418.7 million, $469.1 million and $2.1 billion, for the less than 1 year, 1-3 years, 3-5 years and after 5 years categories, respectively, pertaining to ppas that were accounted for as operating leases.
(d)   xcel energy inc. and its subsidiaries have contracts providing for the purchase and delivery of a significant portion of its current coal, nuclear fuel and natural gas requirements. additionally, the utility subsidiaries of xcel energy inc. have entered into agreements with utilities and other energy suppliers for purchased power to meet system load and energy requirements, replace generation from company-owned units under maintenance and during outages, and meet operating reserve obligations. certain contractual purchase obligations are adjusted on indices. the effects of price changes are mitigated through cost of energy adjustment mechanisms.
(e)   other long-term obligations relate primarily to amounts associated with technology agreements and approximate investments in energy impact fund lp, as well as uncertain tax positions.
(f)   xcel energy also has outstanding authority under o&amp;m contracts to purchase up to approximately $3.2 billion of goods and services through the year 2053, in addition to the amounts disclosed in this table.
(g)   in january 2016, contributions of $125.0 million were made across four of xcel energy's pension plans. obligations of this type are dependent on several factors, including management discretion, and therefore, they are not included in the table.
(h)   xcel energy expects to contribute approximately $12.3 million to the postretirement health care plans during 2016. obligations of this type are dependent on several factors, including management discretion, and therefore, they are not included in the table.
common stock dividends - future dividend levels will be dependent on xcel energy's results of operations, financial position, cash flows, reinvestment opportunities and other factors, and will be evaluated by the xcel energy inc. board of directors. xcel energy's financial objectives include: growing annual ongoing eps four percent to six percent, growing the annual dividend five percent to seven percent and targeting a dividend payout ratio of 60 percent to 70 percent of annual ongoing eps. on feb. 17, 2016, xcel energy announced a quarterly dividend of $0.34 per share, which represented an increase of 6.3 percent. xcel energy's dividend policy balances:
•   projected cash generation;
•   projected capital investment;
•   a reasonable rate of return on shareholder investment; and
•   the impact on xcel energy's capital structure and credit ratings.
in addition, there are certain statutory limitations that could affect dividend levels. federal law places certain limits on the ability of public utilities within a holding company system to declare dividends.
specifically, under the federal power act, a public utility may not pay dividends from any funds properly included in a capital account. the utility subsidiaries' dividends may be limited directly or indirectly by state regulatory commissions or bond indenture covenants. see note 4 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of restrictions on dividend payments.
regulation of derivatives - in july 2010, financial reform legislation was passed that provides for the regulation of derivative transactions amongst other provisions. provisions within the bill provide the cftc and the sec with expanded regulatory authority over derivative and swap transactions. the cftc ruled that swap dealing activity conducted by entities for the preceding 12 months under a notional limit, initially set at $8 billion, will fall under the general de minimis threshold and will not subject an entity to registering as a swap dealer. the de minimis threshold is scheduled to be reduced to $3 billion in 2017. xcel energy's current and projected swap activity is well below these de minimis thresholds. the bill also contains provisions that exempt certain derivatives end users from much of the clearing and margin requirements and xcel energy's board of directors has renewed the end-user exemption on an annual basis. xcel energy is currently meeting all reporting requirements and transaction restrictions.
pension fund - xcel energy's pension assets are invested in a diversified portfolio of domestic and international equity securities, short-term to long-duration fixed income and interest rate swap securities, and alternative investments, including private equity, real estate, hedge funds and commodity investments.

capital sources short-term funding sources - xcel energy uses a number of sources to fulfill short-term funding needs, including operating cash flow, notes payable, commercial paper and bank lines of credit. the amount and timing of short-term funding needs depend in large part on financing needs for construction expenditures, working capital and dividend payments.
short-term investments - xcel energy inc., nsp-minnesota, nsp-wisconsin, psco and sps maintain cash operating and short-term investment accounts. at dec. 31, 2015 and 2014, there was $3.3 million of cash held in these accounts.
commercial paper - xcel energy inc., nsp-minnesota, nsp-wisconsin, psco and sps each have individual commercial paper programs. the authorized levels for these commercial paper programs are:
weighted average interest rate at end of period                                    0.82
weighted average interest rate at end of period                                0.82                                 0.56                                 0.25
credit facilities - nsp-minnesota, nsp-wisconsin, psco, sps, and xcel energy inc. each have five-year credit agreements with a syndicate of banks. the total size of the credit facilities is $2.75 billion and each credit facility terminates in october 2019.

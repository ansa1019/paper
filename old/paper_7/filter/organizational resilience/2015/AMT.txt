item 7.   management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations that follow are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with gaap. the preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses and the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements. actual results may differ from these estimates and such differences could be material to the financial statements. this discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report and the accompanying notes, and the information set forth under the caption "critical accounting policies and estimates" below.
during the fourth quarter of 2015, as a result of recent investment activity, including signed acquisitions, we reviewed and changed our reportable segments to divide our international segment into regional segments. we now operate in five reportable segments: u.s. property, asia property, emea property, latin america property and services. in evaluating financial performance in each business segment, management uses, among other factors, segment gross margin and segment operating profit (see note 19 to our consolidated financial statements included herein).
executive overview we are one of the largest global reits and a leading independent owner, operator and developer of multitenant communications real estate. our primary business is the leasing of space on communications sites to wireless service providers, radio and television broadcast companies, wireless data providers, government agencies and municipalities and tenants in a number of other industries. in addition to the communications sites in our portfolio, we manage rooftop and tower sites for property owners under various contractual arrangements. we also hold property interests that we lease to communications service providers and third-party tower operators. we refer to this business as our property operations, which accounted for 98% of our total revenues for the year ended december 31, 2015 and includes our u.s. property segment, asia property segment, emea property segment and latin america property segment.
we also offer tower-related services, including site acquisition, zoning and permitting and structural analysis services, which primarily support our site leasing business, including the addition of new tenants and equipment on our sites.
the following table details the number of communications sites, excluding managed sites, we owned or operated as of december 31, 2015:
number ofowned towers       number ofoperated towers (1)                  number of owned das sites domestic:
(1)   approximately 97% of the operated towers are held pursuant to long-term capital leases, including those subject to purchase options.
on october 21, 2015, we signed a definitive agreement pursuant to which we expect to acquire a 51% controlling ownership interest in viom, a telecommunications infrastructure company that owns and operates over 42,000 wireless communications towers and 200 indoor das networks in india. upon closing, we expect to consolidate the full financial results for viom.
the majority of our tenant leases with wireless carriers have an initial non-cancellable term of at least ten years, with multiple renewal terms. accordingly, nearly all of the revenue generated by our property operations during the year ended december 31, 2015 was recurring revenue that we should continue to receive in future periods. based upon foreign currency exchange rates and the tenant leases in place as of december 31, 2015, we expect to generate over $30 billion of non-cancellable tenant lease revenue over future periods, absent the impact of straight-line lease accounting. most of our tenant leases have provisions that periodically increase the rent due under the lease, typically annually based on a fixed escalation (approximately 3% in the united states) or an inflationary index in our international markets, or a combination of both. in addition, certain of our tenant leases provide for additional revenue to cover costs, such as ground rent or power and fuel costs.
the revenues generated by our property operations may be affected by cancellations of existing tenant leases. as discussed above, most of our tenant leases with wireless carriers and broadcasters are multiyear contracts, which typically are non-cancellable; however, in some instances, a lease may be cancelled upon the payment of a termination fee.
revenue lost from either cancellations of leases at the end of their terms or rent negotiations historically has not had a material adverse effect on the revenues generated by our property operations. during the year ended december 31, 2015, loss of revenue from tenant lease cancellations or renegotiations represented less than 2% of our property operations revenues.
property operations revenue growth. due to our diversified communications site portfolio, our tenant lease rates vary considerably depending upon numerous factors, including, but not limited to, amount and type of tenant equipment on the tower, remaining tower capacity and tower location. we measure the remaining tower capacity by assessing several factors, including tower height, tower type, environmental conditions, existing equipment on the tower and zoning and permitting
regulations in effect in the jurisdiction where the tower is located. in many instances, tower capacity can be increased with relatively modest tower augmentation expenditures.
the primary factors affecting the revenue growth in our property segments are:
•   organic revenue from tenant leases attributable to sites that existed in our portfolio as of the beginning of the prior year period ("legacy sites");
•   contractual rent escalations on existing tenant leases, net of churn;
•   new revenue attributable to sites acquired or constructed since the beginning of the prior year period ("new sites").
we continue to believe that our site leasing revenue is likely to increase due to the growing use of wireless services and our ability to meet the corresponding incremental demand for our wireless real estate. by adding new tenants and new equipment for existing tenants on our sites, we are able to increase these sites' utilization and profitability. we believe the majority of our site leasing activity will continue to come from wireless service providers. our legacy site portfolio and our established tenant base provide us with new business opportunities, which have historically resulted in consistent and predictable organic revenue growth as wireless carriers seek to increase the coverage and capacity of their existing networks, while also deploying next generation wireless technologies. in addition, we intend to continue to supplement the organic growth on our legacy sites by selectively developing or acquiring new sites in our existing and new markets where we can achieve our risk-adjusted return on investment objectives. in a majority of our international markets, revenue also often includes the reimbursement of direct costs such as ground rent or power and fuel costs.
property operations organic revenue growth. consistent with our strategy to increase the utilization and return on investment of our legacy sites, our objective is to add new tenants and new equipment for existing tenants through collocation and lease amendments. our ability to lease additional space on our sites is primarily a function of the rate at which wireless carriers deploy capital to improve and expand their wireless networks. this rate, in turn, is influenced by the growth of wireless services, the penetration of advanced wireless devices, the financial performance of our tenants and their access to capital and general economic conditions.
based on industry research and projections, we expect that a number of key industry trends will result in incremental revenue opportunities for us:
•   in less advanced wireless markets where initial voice and data networks are still being deployed, we expect these deployments to drive demand for our tower space as carriers seek to expand their footprints and increase the scope and density of their networks. we have established operations in many of these markets at the early stages of wireless development, which we believe will enable us to meaningfully participate in these deployments.
•   subscribers' use of wireless data continues to grow rapidly given increasing smartphone and other advanced device penetration, the proliferation of bandwidth-intensive applications on these devices and the continuing evolution of the mobile ecosystem. we believe carriers will be compelled to deploy additional equipment on existing networks while also rolling out more advanced wireless networks to address coverage and capacity needs resulting from this increasing wireless data usage.
•   the deployment of advanced wireless technology across existing wireless networks will provide higher speed data services and further enable fixed broadband substitution. as a result, we expect our tenants to continue deploying additional equipment across their existing networks.
•   wireless service providers compete based on the quality of their existing wireless networks, which is driven by capacity and coverage. to maintain or improve their network performance as overall network usage increases, our tenants continue deploying additional equipment across their existing sites while also adding new cell sites. we anticipate increasing network densification over the next several years, as existing network infrastructure is anticipated to be insufficient to account for rapidly increasing levels of wireless data usage.
•   wireless service providers continue to acquire additional spectrum, and as a result are expected to add additional sites and equipment to their network as they seek to optimize their network configuration and utilize additional spectrum.
as part of our international expansion initiatives, we have targeted markets in various stages of network development to diversify our international exposure and position us to benefit from a number of different wireless technology deployments over
the long term. in addition, we have focused on building relationships with large multinational carriers such as airtel, telefónica s.a. and vodafone group plc. we believe that consistent carrier investments in their networks across our international markets position us to generate meaningful organic revenue growth going forward.
in emerging markets, such as ghana, india, nigeria and uganda, wireless networks tend to be significantly less advanced than those in the united states, and initial voice networks continue to be deployed in underdeveloped areas. a majority of consumers in these markets still utilize basic wireless services, predominantly on feature phones, while advanced device penetration remains low. in more developed urban locations within these markets, early-stage data network deployments are underway. carriers are focused on completing voice network build-outs while also investing in initial data networks as wireless data usage and smartphone penetration within their customer bases begin to accelerate.
in markets with rapidly evolving network technology, such as south africa and most of the countries in latin america where we do business, initial voice networks, for the most part, have already been built out, and carriers are focused on 3g network build outs, with select investments in 4g technology. consumers in these regions are increasingly adopting smartphones and other advanced devices, and as a result, the usage of bandwidth-intensive mobile applications is growing materially. recent spectrum auctions in these rapidly evolving markets have allowed incumbent carriers to accelerate their data network deployments and have also enabled new entrants to begin initial investments in data networks. smartphone penetration and wireless data usage in these markets are growing rapidly, which typically requires that carriers continue to invest in their networks in order to maintain and augment their quality of service.
finally, in markets with more mature network technology, such as germany, carriers are focused on deploying 4g data networks to account for rapidly increasing wireless data usage amongst their customer base. with higher smartphone and advanced device penetration and significantly higher per capita data usage, carrier investment in networks is focused on 4g coverage and capacity.
we believe that the network technology migration we have seen in the united states, which has led to significantly denser networks and meaningful new business commencements for us over a number of years, will ultimately be replicated in our less advanced international markets. as a result, we expect to be able to leverage our extensive international portfolio of approximately 60,190 communications sites and the relationships we have built with our carrier customers to drive sustainable, long-term growth.
we have holistic master lease agreements with certain of our tenants that provide for consistent, long-term revenue and a reduction in the likelihood of churn. our holistic master lease agreements build and augment strong strategic partnerships with our tenants and have significantly reduced collocation cycle times, thereby providing our tenants with the ability to rapidly and efficiently deploy equipment on our sites.
property operations new site revenue growth. during the year ended december 31, 2015, we grew our portfolio of communications real estate through the acquisition and construction of approximately 25,370 sites. in a majority of our asia, emea and latin america markets, the acquisition or construction of new sites resulted in increases in both tenant and pass-through revenues (such as ground rent or power and fuel costs) and expenses. we continue to evaluate opportunities to acquire communications real estate portfolios, both domestically and internationally, to determine whether they meet our risk-adjusted hurdle rates and whether we believe we can effectively integrate them into our existing portfolio.
property operations expenses. direct operating expenses incurred by our property segments include direct site level expenses and consist primarily of ground rent and power and fuel costs, some or all of which may be passed through to our tenants, as well as property taxes, repairs and maintenance. these segment direct operating expenses exclude all segment and corporate selling, general, administrative and development expenses, which are aggregated into one line item entitled selling, general, administrative and development expense in our consolidated statements of operations. in general, our property segments' selling, general, administrative and development expenses do not significantly increase as a result of adding incremental tenants to our legacy sites and typically increase only modestly year-over-year. as a result, leasing additional space to new tenants on our legacy sites provides significant incremental cash flow. we may, however, incur additional segment
selling, general, administrative and development expenses as we increase our presence in our existing markets or expand into new markets. our profit margin growth is therefore positively impacted by the addition of new tenants to our legacy sites and can be temporarily diluted by our development activities.
services segment revenue growth. as we continue to focus on growing our property operations, we anticipate that our services revenue will continue to represent a small percentage of our total revenues.
non-gaap financial measures included in our analysis of our results of operations are discussions regarding earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization and accretion, as adjusted ("adjusted ebitda"), funds from operations, as defined by the national association of real estate investment trusts ("nareit ffo") and adjusted funds from operations ("affo").
we define adjusted ebitda as net income before income (loss) on equity method investments; income tax benefit (provision); other income (expense); gain (loss) on retirement of long-term obligations; interest expense; interest income; other operating income (expense); depreciation, amortization and accretion; and stock-based compensation expense.
nareit ffo is defined as net income before gains or losses from the sale or disposal of real estate, real estate related impairment charges, real estate related depreciation, amortization and accretion and dividends on preferred stock, and including adjustments for (i) unconsolidated affiliates and (ii) noncontrolling interest.
we define affo as nareit ffo before (i) straight-line revenue and expense; (ii) stock-based compensation expense; (iii) the non-cash portion of our tax provision; (iv) non-real estate related depreciation, amortization and accretion; (v) amortization of deferred financing costs, capitalized interest, debt discounts and premiums and long-term deferred interest charges; (vi) other income (expense); (vii) gain (loss) on retirement of long-term obligations; (viii) other operating income (expense); and adjustments for (ix) unconsolidated affiliates and (x) noncontrolling interest, less cash payments related to capital improvements and cash payments related to corporate capital expenditures.
we present affo for the year ended december 31, 2015 before the one-time cash charge incurred in connection with a tax election, pursuant to which one of our subsidiaries no longer operates as a separate reit, as it is nonrecurring and we do not believe it is an indication of our operating performance.
adjusted ebitda, nareit ffo and affo are not intended to replace net income or any other performance measures determined in accordance with gaap. neither nareit ffo nor affo represent cash flows from operating activities in accordance with gaap and, therefore, these measures should not be considered indicative of cash flows from operating activities as a measure of liquidity or of funds available to fund our cash needs, including our ability to make cash distributions. rather, adjusted ebitda, nareit ffo and affo are presented as we believe each is a useful indicator of our current operating performance. we believe that these metrics are useful to an investor in evaluating our operating performance because (1) each is a key measure used by our management team for purposes of decision making and for evaluating the performance of our operating segments; (2) adjusted ebitda is a component of the calculation used by our lenders to determine compliance with certain debt covenants; (3) adjusted ebitda is widely used in the tower industry to measure operating performance as depreciation, amortization and accretion may vary significantly among companies depending upon accounting methods and useful lives, particularly where acquisitions and non-operating factors are involved; (4) each provides investors with a meaningful measure for evaluating our period-to-period operating performance by eliminating items that are not operational in nature; and (5) each provides investors with a measure for comparing our results of operations to those of other companies.
our measurement of adjusted ebitda, nareit ffo and affo may not, however, be fully comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. reconciliations of adjusted ebitda, nareit ffo and affo to net income, the most directly comparable gaap measure, have been included below.

the increases in interest expense for the years ended december 31, 2015 and 2014 were primarily attributable to an increase of $1.9 billion and $3.9 billion, respectively, in our average debt outstanding, partially offset by a decrease in our annualized weighted average cost of borrowing from 4.06% to 3.67% and 4.40% to 4.06%, respectively. the weighted average contractual interest rate was 3.45% at december 31, 2015.

during the year ended december 31, 2014, we paid prepayment consideration primarily in connection with the prepayment of certain assumed debt, which was partially offset by the write-off of unamortized premium associated with the fair value adjustments of assumed debt. in addition, we recorded a loss of $1.4 million as a result of settling a previously existing interest rate swap agreement in colombia.

income tax provision year ended december 31,       % change 2015 vs 2014        % change 2014 vs 2013
the effective tax rate ("etr") on income from continuing operations for the years ended december 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 differs from the federal statutory rate primarily due to our qualification for taxation as a reit as well as adjustments for foreign items. as a reit, we may deduct earnings distributed to stockholders against the income generated by our reit operations. in addition, we are able to offset certain income by utilizing our nols, subject to specified limitations.
effective july 25, 2015, we filed a tax election, pursuant to which mipt no longer operates as a separate reit for federal and state income tax purposes. in connection with this and related elections, we incurred a one-time cash tax charge of $93.0 million and a one-time deferred income tax benefit of $5.8 million in the year ended december 31, 2015. we also recorded a charge of $13.1 million resulting from a change in income tax law in ghana.
the etr for the years ended december 31, 2014 and 2013 included an expense of $2.6 million and $21.5 million, respectively, resulting from the restructuring of certain of our domestic trss.

the decrease in net income was primarily due to increases in depreciation, amortization and accretion expense, income tax provision, loss on retirement of long-term obligations, other expenses, other sg&a and interest expense, which were partially offset by an increase in our operating profit.
the increase in adjusted ebitda was primarily attributable to the increase in our gross margin and was partially offset by an increase in sg&a of $41.1 million, excluding the impact of stock-based compensation expense.

affo growth for the year ended december 31, 2015 was primarily attributable to the increase in our operating profit and was partially offset by increases in dividends on preferred stock, corporate sg&a and a net increase in capital improvement and corporate capital expenditures.
affo growth for the year ended december 31, 2014 was primarily attributable to the increase in our operating profit and a decrease in capital improvement and corporate capital expenditures, partially offset by increases in cash paid for interest and taxes and dividends on preferred stock.
liquidity and capital resources overview during the year ended december 31, 2015, we increased our financial flexibility and our ability to grow our business while maintaining our long-term financial policies. our significant 2015 financing transactions included:
•   the issuance of 13,750,000 depositary shares, each representing a 1/10th interest in a share of the series b preferred stock, and 25,850,000 shares of common stock. we used the aggregate net proceeds of $3.78 billion to fund a portion of the verizon transaction.

•   the receipt of incremental commitments under the 2013 credit facility and our senior unsecured credit facility entered into in january 2012, as amended and restated in september 2014 (the "2014 credit facility"), giving us the ability to borrow up to $2.75 billion under the 2013 credit facility and $2.0 billion under the 2014 credit facility.
•   the repayment of the secured tower revenue notes, global tower series 2011-1, class c, secured tower revenue notes, global tower series 2011-2, class c and class f and secured tower revenue notes, global tower series 2013-1, class c and class f (collectively, the "gtp ap notes") with proceeds from the 2015 securitization.
as a holding company, our cash flows are derived primarily from the operations of, and distributions from, our operating subsidiaries or funds raised through borrowings under our credit facilities and debt or equity offerings.
the following table summarizes our liquidity as of december 31, 2015 (in thousands):
available under the 2013 credit facility          $1,525,000
available under the 2014 credit facility              20,000

total available under credit facilities, net       1,534,376
subsequent to december 31, 2015, we repaid the $1.2 billion outstanding under the 2013 credit facility using proceeds from the issuance of $750.0 million aggregate principal amount of the 3.300% senior unsecured notes due 2021 (the "3.300% notes") and $500.0 million aggregate principal amount of the 4.400% senior unsecured notes due 2026 (the "4.400% notes") and cash on hand. as a result, our liquidity increased by $1.2 billion.
summary cash flow information is set forth below for the years ended december 31, (in thousands):
operating activities                                                                       $2,183,052              $2,134,589              $1,599,047

we use our cash flows to fund our operations and investments in our business, including tower maintenance and improvements, communications site construction and managed network installations and tower and land acquisitions. additionally, we use our cash flows to make distributions, including distributions of our reit taxable income to maintain our qualification for taxation as a reit under the code. we may also repay or repurchase our existing indebtedness from time to time. we typically fund our international expansion efforts primarily through a combination of cash on hand, intercompany debt and equity contributions.
as of december 31, 2015, we had total outstanding indebtedness of $17.2 billion, with a current portion of $50.2 million. during the year ended december 31, 2015, we generated sufficient cash flow from operations to fund our capital expenditures and debt service obligations, as well as our required distributions. we believe the cash generated by operating activities during the year ending december 31, 2016, together with our borrowing capacity under our credit facilities, will be sufficient to fund our required distributions, capital expenditures, debt service obligations (interest and principal repayments) and signed acquisitions. as of december 31, 2015, we had $223.5 million of cash and cash equivalents held by our foreign subsidiaries, of which $68.1 million was held by our joint ventures. while certain subsidiaries may pay us interest or principal on intercompany debt, it has not been our practice to repatriate earnings from our foreign subsidiaries primarily due to our ongoing expansion efforts and related capital needs. however, in the event that we do repatriate any funds, we may be required to accrue and pay taxes.
cash flows from operating activities adjusted ebitda growth of $416.6 million was offset by higher working capital as well as higher cash taxes and interest costs, resulting in a $48.5 million increase in cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december 31, 2015. the primary factors that impacted cash provided by operating activities as compared to the year ended december 31, 2014, include:
•   an increase of approximately $87.8 million in cash paid for taxes, driven primarily by the mipt one-time cash tax charge of $93.0 million;
•   a decrease in capital contributions, tenant settlements and other prepayments of approximately $99.0 million;
•   an increase of approximately $29.9 million in cash paid for interest;
•   a decrease of approximately $34.9 million in termination and decommissioning fees;
•   a decrease of approximately $49.0 million in customer receipts due to timing; and
•   a decrease due to the non-recurrence of a 2014 value added tax refund of approximately $60.3 million.
for the year ended december 31, 2014, cash provided by operating activities increased $535.5 million as compared to the year ended december 31, 2013. this increase was primarily due to an increase in the operating profit of our property segments, cash provided by working capital and a decrease in restricted cash, partially offset by increases in cash paid for interest and taxes. working capital was positively impacted by the receipt of capital contributions from tenants and a value added tax refund, partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable.

the 2015 notes may be prepaid in whole or in part at any time, provided such payment is accompanied by the applicable prepayment consideration. if prepayment occurs within 12 months of the anticipated repayment date with respect to the series 2015-1 notes, or 18 months of the anticipated repayment date with respect to the series 2015-2 notes, no prepayment consideration is due. if the series 2015-1 notes or the series 2015-2 notes have not been repaid in full on the applicable anticipated repayment date, additional interest will accrue on the unpaid principal balance of the applicable series of the 2015 notes and such series will begin to amortize on a monthly basis from excess cash flow.
the 2015 notes are secured by (i) mortgages, deeds of trust and deeds to secure debt on substantially all of the 2015 secured sites and their operating cash flows, (ii) a security interest in substantially all of the personal property and fixtures of the gtp entities, including gtp acquisition partners' equity interests in its subsidiaries and (iii) the rights of the gtp entities under a management agreement. american tower holding sub ii, llc, whose only material assets are its equity interests in gtp acquisition partners, has guaranteed repayment of the 2015 notes and pledged its equity interests in gtp acquisition partners as security for such payment obligations.
the 2015 indenture includes covenants and other restrictions customary for notes issued in rated securitizations. among other things, the gtp entities are prohibited from incurring other indebtedness for borrowed money or further encumbering their assets. the organizational documents of the gtp entities contain provisions consistent with rating agency securitization criteria for special purpose entities, including the requirement that they maintain independent directors. the 2015 indenture also contains certain covenants that require gtp acquisition partners to provide the trustee with regular financial reports and operating budgets, promptly notify the trustee of events of default and material breaches under the indenture and other agreements related to the 2015 secured sites and allow the trustee reasonable access to the 2015 secured sites, including the right to conduct site investigations. further, under the 2015 indenture, gtp acquisition partners is required to maintain reserve accounts, including for amounts received or due from tenants related to future periods, property taxes, insurance, ground rents, certain expenses and debt service.

each of the applicable supplemental indentures for the 2.800% notes, the 4.000% notes, the 3.300% notes and the 4.400% notes contains certain covenants that restrict our ability to merge, consolidate or sell assets and our (together with our subsidiaries') ability to incur liens. these covenants are subject to a number of exceptions, including that we, and our subsidiaries, may incur certain liens on assets, mortgages or other liens securing indebtedness, if the aggregate amount of such liens does not exceed 3.5x adjusted ebitda, as defined in the applicable supplemental indenture.
bank facilities in february 2015, we entered into amendment agreements with respect to the (i) term loan, (ii) 2013 credit facility and (iii) 2014 credit facility. after giving effect to these amendments, our permitted ratio of total debt to adjusted ebitda (as defined in the loan agreements for each of the facilities) is (i) 7.00 to 1.00 for the quarter ended december 31, 2015 and (ii) 6.00 to 1.00 thereafter. in addition, we increased the maximum incremental term loan
commitments (as defined in the agreement governing the term loan) to $1.0 billion and increased the maximum revolving loan commitments, after giving effect to any incremental commitments (each as defined in the loan agreements for each of the revolving credit facilities) to $3.5 billion and $2.5 billion under the 2013 credit facility and the 2014 credit facility, respectively.
effective october 28, 2015, we entered into additional amendment agreements to the term loan, the 2013 credit facility and the 2014 credit facility, which, among other things, (i) extended the maturity dates to january 29, 2021, june 28, 2019 and january 29, 2021, respectively, and (ii) increased the threshold for certain defaults with respect to judgments, attachments or acceleration of indebtedness from $250.0 million to $300.0 million. all of the other material terms of the term loan, the 2013 credit facility and the 2014 credit facility remain in full force and effect.
term loan. effective february 20, 2015, we borrowed an additional $500.0 million under the term loan. as a result, we have $2.0 billion outstanding under the term loan.
2013 credit facility. on february 20, 2015, we received incremental commitments of $750.0 million and, as a result, have the ability to borrow up to $2.75 billion under the 2013 credit facility, which includes a $1.0 billion sublimit for multicurrency borrowings, a $200.0 million sublimit for letters of credit and a $50.0 million sublimit for swingline loans.
during the year ended december 31, 2015, we borrowed an aggregate of $4.0 billion and repaid an aggregate of $2.7 billion of revolving indebtedness under the 2013 credit facility. we primarily used the borrowings to (i) fund a portion of the verizon transaction, (ii) fund the airtel acquisition, (iii) fund the tim acquisition and (iv) repay other indebtedness. we currently have $3.2 million of undrawn letters of credit and maintain the ability to draw down and repay amounts under the 2013 credit facility in the ordinary course.
2014 credit facility. on february 20, 2015, we received incremental commitments of $500.0 million and, as a result, have the ability to borrow up to $2.0 billion under the 2014 credit facility, which includes a $200.0 million sublimit for letters of credit and a $50.0 million sublimit for swingline loans.
during the year ended december 31, 2015, we borrowed an aggregate of $2.1 billion and repaid an aggregate of $1.3 billion of revolving indebtedness under the 2014 credit facility. we primarily used the borrowings to fund a portion of the verizon transaction. we currently have $7.4 million of undrawn letters of credit and maintain the ability to draw down and repay amounts under the 2014 credit facility in the ordinary course.
the term loan, the 2013 credit facility and the 2014 credit facility do not require amortization of principal and may be paid prior to maturity in whole or in part at our option without penalty or premium. we have the option of choosing either a defined base rate or the london interbank offered rate ("libor") as the applicable base rate for borrowings under the term loan, the 2013 credit facility and the 2014 credit facility. the interest rates range between 1.000% to 2.000% above libor for libor based borrowings or up to 1.000% above the defined base rate for base rate borrowings, in each case based upon our debt ratings. the margin over libor for each of the term loan, the 2013 credit facility and the 2014 credit facility is 1.250%.
the 2013 credit facility and the 2014 credit facility are subject to two optional renewal periods. a quarterly commitment fee on the undrawn portion of the 2013 credit facility and the 2014 credit facility is required, ranging from 0.100% to 0.400% per annum, based upon our debt ratings, and is currently 0.150%.
the loan agreements for each of the term loan, the 2013 credit facility and the 2014 credit facility contain certain reporting, information, financial and operating covenants and other restrictions (including limitations on additional debt, guaranties, sales of assets and liens) with which we must comply. failure to comply with the financial and operating covenants of the loan agreements could not only prevent us from being able to borrow additional funds under the revolving credit facilities, but may constitute a default, which could result in, among other things, the amounts outstanding, including all accrued interest and unpaid fees, becoming immediately due and payable.
redemption of senior notes. on february 11, 2015, we redeemed all of the outstanding 4.625% notes at a price equal to 100.5898% of the principal amount, plus accrued interest up to, but excluding, february 11, 2015, for an aggregate redemption price of $613.6 million, including $10.0 million in accrued and unpaid interest. on april 29, 2015, we redeemed all of the outstanding 7.000% notes at a price equal to 114.0629% of the principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest up to, but excluding, april 29, 2015, for an aggregate redemption price of $571.7 million, including $1.4 million in accrued and unpaid interest. these redemptions were funded with borrowings under our
existing credit facilities and cash on hand. upon completion of these redemptions, none of the 4.625% notes or the 7.000% notes remained outstanding.
stock repurchase program. in march 2011, our board of directors approved a $1.5 billion stock repurchase program, pursuant to which we are authorized to purchase up to an additional $1.1 billion of our common stock. since september 2013, we have temporarily suspended repurchases under the program.
sales of equity securities. we receive proceeds from sales of our equity securities pursuant to our employee stock purchase plan (the "espp") and upon exercise of stock options granted under our equity incentive plans. for the year ended december 31, 2015, we received an aggregate of $50.7 million in proceeds upon exercises of stock options and from the espp.
distributions. as a reit, we must annually distribute to our stockholders an amount equal to at least 90% of our reit taxable income (determined before the deduction for distributed earnings and excluding any net capital gain). generally, we have distributed, and expect to continue to distribute all or substantially all of our reit taxable income after taking into consideration our utilization of nols.
the amount, timing and frequency of future distributions will be at the sole discretion of our board of directors and will be dependent upon various factors, a number of which may be beyond our control, including our financial condition and operating cash flows, the amount required to maintain our qualification for taxation as a reit and reduce any income and excise taxes that we otherwise would be required to pay, limitations on distributions in our existing and future debt and preferred equity instruments, our ability to utilize nols to offset our distribution requirements, limitations on our ability to fund distributions using cash generated through our trss and other factors that our board of directors may deem relevant.
we have two series of preferred stock outstanding, the series a preferred stock, with a dividend rate of 5.25%, and the series b preferred stock, with a dividend rate of 5.50%. dividends are payable quarterly in arrears, subject to declaration by our board of directors. during the year ended december 31, 2015, we paid an aggregate of:
•   $5.25 per share, or $31.6 million, to series a preferred stockholders of record, including the fourth quarter dividend of $1.3125 per share, or $7.9 million, and
•   $38.6528 per share, or $53.1 million, to series b preferred stockholders of record, including the fourth quarter dividend of $13.75 per share, or $18.9 million.
in addition, on february 16, 2016, we paid dividends of $1.3125 per share, or $7.9 million, to series a preferred stockholders of record at the close of business on february 1, 2016 and $13.75 per share, or $18.9 million, to series b preferred stockholders of record at the close of business on february 1, 2016.
during the year ended december 31, 2015, we declared an aggregate of $766.4 million in regular cash distributions payable to our common stockholders, which included our fourth quarter distribution of $0.49 per share ($207.7 million) payable on january 13, 2016 to common stockholders of record at the close of business on december 16, 2015.
we accrue distributions on unvested restricted stock units, which are payable upon vesting. as of december 31, 2015, the amount accrued for distributions payable related to unvested restricted stock units was $5.1 million. during the year ended december 31, 2015, we paid $1.3 million of distributions upon the vesting of restricted stock units.
for more details on the cash distributions paid to our common and preferred stockholders during the year ended december 31, 2015, see note 14 to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report.
contractual obligations. the following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of december 31, 2015 (in thousands):
indian working capital facility (12)   8,752                             -                       -                       -                       -                               -                 8,752
long-term obligations, excluding capital leases                  37,522                            188,224                 1,528,870               2,875,826               1,964,385              10,478,667            17,073,494
capital lease payments (including interest)                      20,697                            17,711                  16,876                  15,423                  11,753                    173,398               255,858
total debt service obligations                                   642,383                           783,326                 2,070,423               3,347,983               2,354,232              11,334,185            20,532,532
operating lease payments (13)                                    721,596                           709,377                 690,184                 669,562                 643,124                 6,416,213             9,850,056
(5)   assumed by us in connection with the acquisition of mipt.
(7)   publicly issued debentures assumed in connection with our acquisition of br towers and denominated in brl. the br towers debentures amortize through october 15, 2023.
(13)   includes payments under non-cancellable initial terms, as well as payments for certain renewal periods at our option, which we expect to renew because failure to renew could result in a loss of the applicable communications sites and related revenues from tenant leases.
(14)   primarily represents our asset retirement obligations and excludes certain other non-current liabilities included in our consolidated balance sheet, primarily our straight-line rent liability for which cash payments are included in operating lease payments and unearned revenue that is not payable in cash.
(15)   excludes $14.7 million of liabilities for unrecognized tax positions and $16.7 million of accrued income tax related interest and penalties included in our consolidated balance sheet as we are uncertain as to when and if the amounts may be settled. settlement of such amounts could require the use of cash flows generated from operations. we expect the unrecognized tax benefits to change over the next 12 months if certain tax matters ultimately settle with the applicable taxing jurisdiction during this timeframe. however, based on the status of these items and the amount of uncertainty associated with the outcome and timing of audit settlements, we are currently unable to estimate the impact of the amount of such changes, if any, to previously recorded uncertain tax positions.
off-balance sheet arrangements. we have no material off-balance sheet arrangements as defined in item 303(a)(4)(ii) of sec regulation s-k.
factors affecting sources of liquidity our liquidity is dependent on our ability to generate cash flow from operating activities, borrow funds under our credit facilities and maintain compliance with the contractual agreements governing our indebtedness. we believe that the debt agreements discussed below represent our material debt agreements that contain covenants, our compliance with which would be material to an investor's understanding of our financial results and the impact of those results on our liquidity.
internally generated funds. because the majority of our tenant leases are multi-year contracts, a significant majority of the revenues generated by our property operations as of the end of 2015 is recurring revenue that we should continue to receive in future periods. accordingly, a key factor affecting our ability to generate cash flow from operating activities is to maintain this recurring revenue and to convert it into operating profit by minimizing operating costs and fully achieving our operating efficiencies. in addition, our ability to increase cash flow from operating activities is dependent upon the demand for our communications sites and our related services and our ability to increase the utilization of our existing communications sites.
restrictions under loan agreements relating to our credit facilities. the loan agreements for the 2014 credit facility, the 2013 credit facility and the term loan contain certain financial and operating covenants and other restrictions applicable to us and our subsidiaries that are not designated as unrestricted subsidiaries on a consolidated basis. these include limitations on additional debt, distributions and dividends, guaranties, sales of assets and liens. the loan agreements also contain covenants that establish three financial tests with which we and our restricted subsidiaries must comply related to total leverage and senior secured leverage, as set forth in the table below. in the event that our debt ratings fall below investment grade, we must maintain an interest coverage ratio of adjusted ebitda to interest expense (each as defined in the applicable loan agreement) of at least 2.50:1.00. as of december 31, 2015, we were in compliance with each of these covenants.
ratio (1)                                            additional debt capacity under covenants (2)                             capacity for adjusted ebitda decrease under covenants (3)
(1)    each component of the ratio as defined in the applicable loan agreement.
(2)    assumes no change to adjusted ebitda.
(3)    assumes no change to our existing debt levels.
(4)   the required ratio is ≤ 7.00:1.00 for the quarter ended december 31, 2015 and ≤ 6.00:1.00 thereafter. if the required ratio as of december 31, 2015 had been ≤6.00: 1.00, our additional debt capacity would have been $2.1 billion and our capacity for adjusted ebitda decrease would have been $0.3 billion.
(5)    effectively, however, the capacity under this ratio would be limited to the capacity under the consolidated total leverage ratio.
the loan agreements for our credit facilities also contain reporting and information covenants that require us to provide financial and operating information within certain time periods. if we are unable to provide the required information on a timely basis, we would be in breach of these covenants.
failure to comply with the financial maintenance tests and certain other covenants of the loan agreements for our credit facilities could not only prevent us from being able to borrow additional funds under these credit facilities, but may constitute a default under these credit facilities, which could result in, among other things, the amounts outstanding, including all accrued interest and unpaid fees, becoming immediately due and payable. if this were to occur, we may not have sufficient cash on hand to repay such indebtedness. the key factors affecting our ability to comply with the debt covenants described above are our financial performance relative to the financial maintenance tests defined in the loan agreements for these credit facilities and our ability to fund our debt service obligations. based upon our current expectations, we believe our operating results during the next 12 months will be sufficient to comply with these covenants.
restrictions under agreements relating to the 2015 securitization and the 2013 securitization. the 2015 indenture and the loan agreement related to the 2013 securitization include certain financial ratios and operating covenants and other restrictions customary for transactions subject to rated securitizations. among other things, american tower asset sub, llc and american tower asset sub ii, llc (together, the "amt asset subs") and gtp acquisition partners are prohibited from incurring other indebtedness for borrowed money or further encumbering their assets subject to customary carve-outs for ordinary course trade payables and permitted encumbrances (as defined in the applicable agreement).
under the terms of the agreements, amounts due will be paid from the cash flows generated by the assets securing the 2015 notes or the assets securing the nonrecourse loan that secures the secured tower revenue securities, series 2013-1a and series 2013-2a issued in the 2013 securitization (the "loan"), as applicable, which must be deposited into certain reserve accounts, and thereafter distributed, solely pursuant to the terms of the applicable agreement. on a monthly basis, after payment of all required amounts under the applicable agreement, subject to the conditions described in the table below, the excess cash flows generated from the operation of such assets are released to gtp acquisition partners or the amt asset subs, as applicable, which can then be distributed to, and used by, us. as of december 31, 2015, $111.3 million held in such reserve accounts was classified as restricted cash.
certain information with respect to each of the 2015 securitization and the 2013 securitization is set forth below ($ in millions). the debt service coverage ratio ("dscr") is generally calculated as the ratio of the net cash flow (as defined in the applicable agreement) to the amount of interest, servicing fees and trustee fees required to be paid over the succeeding 12 months on the principal amount of the 2015 notes or the loan, as applicable, that will be outstanding on the payment date following such date of determination.

(3)   an amortization period commences if the dscr is equal to or below 1.15x (the "minimum dscr") at the end of any calendar quarter and continues to exist until the dscr exceeds the minimum dscr for two consecutive calendar quarters.
(4)   no amortization period is triggered if the outstanding principal amount of a series has not been repaid in full on the applicable anticipated repayment date. however, in such event, additional interest will accrue on the unpaid principal balance of the applicable series, and such series will begin to amortize on a monthly basis from excess cash flow.
a failure to meet the noted dscr tests could prevent gtp acquisition partners or the amt asset subs from distributing excess cash flow to us, which could affect our ability to fund our capital expenditures, including tower construction and acquisitions, meet reit distribution requirements and make preferred stock dividend payments. during an "amortization period" all excess cash flow and any amounts then in the reserve accounts because the dscr was equal to or below the cash trap dscr would be applied to pay principal of the 2015 notes or the loan, as applicable, on each monthly payment date, and so would not be available for distribution to us. further, additional interest will begin to accrue with respect to any series of the 2015 notes or subclass of loan from and after the anticipated repayment date at a per annum rate determined in accordance with the applicable agreement. with respect to the 2015 notes, upon occurrence and during an event of default, the applicable trustee may, in its discretion or at direction of holders of more than 50% of the aggregate outstanding principal of any series of the 2015 notes, declare such series of 2015 notes immediately due and payable, in which case any excess cash flow would need to be used to pay holders of such notes. furthermore, if gtp acquisition partners or the amt asset subs were to default on a series of the 2015 notes or the loan, the applicable trustee may seek to foreclose upon or otherwise convert the ownership of all or any portion of the 3,609 2015 secured sites or the 5,186 2013 secured towers, respectively, in which case we could lose such sites and the revenue associated with those assets.
as discussed above, we use our available liquidity and seek new sources of liquidity to repay or repurchase our outstanding indebtedness. in addition, in order to fund capital expenditures, future growth and expansion initiatives and satisfy our distribution requirements, we may need to raise additional capital through financing activities. if we determine that it is desirable or necessary to raise additional capital, we may be unable to do so, or such additional financing may be prohibitively expensive or restricted by the terms of our outstanding indebtedness. if we are unable to raise capital when our needs arise, we may not be able to fund capital expenditures, future growth and expansion initiatives, satisfy our reit distribution requirements, pay preferred stock dividends or refinance our existing indebtedness.
in addition, our liquidity depends on our ability to generate cash flow from operating activities. as set forth under item 1a of this annual report under the caption "risk factors," we derive a substantial portion of our revenues from a small number of tenants and, consequently, a failure by a significant tenant to perform its contractual obligations to us could adversely affect our cash flow and liquidity.
critical accounting policies and estimates management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with gaap. the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, as well as related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. we evaluate our policies and estimates on an ongoing basis. management bases its estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
we have reviewed our policies and estimates to determine our critical accounting policies for the year ended december 31, 2015. we have identified the following policies as critical to an understanding of our results of operations and financial condition. this is not a comprehensive list of our accounting policies. see note 1 to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report for a summary of our significant accounting policies. in many cases, the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by gaap, with no need for management's judgment in its application. there are also areas in which management's judgment in selecting any available alternative would not produce a materially different result.
•   impairment of assets-assets subject to depreciation and amortization: we review long-lived assets for impairment at least annually or whenever events, changes in circumstances or other indicators or evidence indicate that the carrying amount of our assets may not be recoverable.
we review our tower portfolio and network location intangible assets for indicators of impairment at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows, typically at an individual tower basis. possible indicators include a tower not having current tenant leases or having expenses in excess of revenues. a cash flow modeling approach is utilized to assess recoverability and incorporates, among other items, the tower location, the tower location demographics, the timing of additions of new tenants, lease rates and estimated length of tenancy and ongoing cash requirements.
we review our customer-related intangible assets on a customer by customer basis for indicators of impairment, such as high levels of turnover or attrition, non-renewal of a significant number of contracts, or the cancellation or termination of a relationship. we assess recoverability by determining whether the carrying amount of the customer-related intangible assets will be recovered through projected undiscounted cash flows.
if the sum of the estimated undiscounted future cash flows of our long-lived assets is less than the carrying amount of the assets, an impairment loss may be recognized. an impairment loss would be based on the fair value of the asset, which is based on an estimate of discounted future cash flows to be provided from the asset. we record any related impairment charge in the period in which we identify such impairment.
•   impairment of assets-goodwill: we review goodwill for impairment at least annually (as of december 31) or whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable.
goodwill is recorded in the applicable segment and assessed for impairment at the reporting unit level. we utilize the two step impairment test when testing goodwill for impairment and we employ a discounted cash flow analysis. the key assumptions utilized in the discounted cash flow analysis include current operating performance, terminal sales growth rate, management's expectations of future operating results and cash requirements, the current weighted average cost of capital and an expected tax rate. under the first step of this test, we compare the fair value of the reporting unit, as calculated under an income approach using future discounted cash flows, to the carrying amount of the applicable reporting unit. if the carrying amount exceeds the fair value, we conduct the second step of this test, in which the implied fair value of the applicable reporting unit's goodwill is compared to the carrying amount of that goodwill. if the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value, an impairment loss would be recognized for the amount of the excess.
during the year ended december 31, 2015, no potential impairment was identified under the first step of the test. the fair value of each of our reporting units was in excess of its carrying amount by a substantial margin.
•   asset retirement obligations: when required, we recognize the fair value of obligations to remove our tower assets and remediate the leased land upon which certain of our tower assets are located. generally, the associated retirement costs are capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the related tower assets and depreciated over their estimated useful lives and the liability is accreted through the obligation's estimated settlement date.
we updated our assumptions used in estimating our aggregate asset retirement obligation, which resulted in a net increase in the estimated obligation of $6.2 million during the year ended december 31, 2015. the change in 2015 primarily resulted from changes in timing of certain settlement date and cost assumptions. fair value estimates of liabilities for asset retirement obligations generally involve discounting of estimated future cash flows. periodic accretion of such liabilities due to the passage of time is included in depreciation, amortization and accretion expense in the consolidated statements of operations. the significant assumptions used in estimating our aggregate asset retirement obligation are: timing of tower removals; cost of tower removals; timing and number of land lease renewals; expected inflation rates; and credit-adjusted risk-free interest rates that approximate our incremental borrowing rate. while we feel the assumptions are appropriate, there can be no assurances that actual costs and the probability of incurring obligations will not differ from these estimates. we will continue to review these assumptions periodically and we may need to adjust them as necessary.
•   acquisitions: for those acquisitions that meet the definition of a business combination, we apply the acquisition method of accounting where assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recorded at fair value at the date of each acquisition, and the results of operations are included with those of the company from the dates of the respective acquisitions. any excess of the purchase price paid over the amounts recognized for assets acquired and liabilities assumed is recorded as goodwill. we continue to evaluate acquisitions for a period not to exceed one year after the applicable acquisition date of each transaction to determine whether any additional adjustments are needed to the allocation of the purchase price paid for the assets acquired and liabilities assumed. the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed is typically determined by using either estimates of replacement costs or discounted cash flow valuation methods. when determining the fair value of tangible assets acquired, we must estimate the cost to
replace the asset with a new asset taking into consideration such factors as age, condition and the economic useful life of the asset. when determining the fair value of intangible assets acquired, we must estimate the applicable discount rate and the timing and amount of future customer cash flows, including rate and terms of renewal and attrition.
•   revenue recognition: our revenue from leasing arrangements, including fixed escalation clauses present in non-cancellable lease arrangements, is reported on a straight-line basis over the term of the respective leases when collectibility is reasonably assured. escalation clauses tied to the consumer price index or other inflation-based indices, and other incentives present in lease agreements with our tenants are excluded from the straight-line calculation. total property straight-line revenues for the years ended december 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 approximated $155.0 million, $123.7 million and $147.7 million, respectively. amounts billed upfront in connection with the execution of lease agreements are initially deferred and reflected in unearned revenue in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and recognized as revenue over the terms of the applicable leases. amounts billed or received for services prior to being earned are deferred and reflected in unearned revenue in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets until the criteria for recognition have been met.
we derive the largest portion of our revenues, corresponding trade receivables and the related deferred rent asset from a small number of tenants in the telecommunications industry, and 63% of our revenues are derived from four tenants in the industry. in addition, we have concentrations of credit risk in certain geographic areas. we mitigate the concentrations of credit risk with respect to notes and trade receivables by actively monitoring the credit worthiness of our borrowers and tenants. in recognizing customer revenue we assess the collectibility of both the amounts billed and the portion recognized on a straight-line basis. this assessment takes tenant credit risk and business and industry conditions into consideration to ultimately determine the collectibility of the amounts billed. to the extent the amounts, based on management's estimates, may not be collectible, recognition is deferred until such point as the uncertainty is resolved. any amounts that were previously recognized as revenue and subsequently determined to be uncollectible are charged to bad debt expense. accounts receivable are reported net of allowances for doubtful accounts related to estimated losses resulting from a tenant's inability to make required payments and allowances for amounts invoiced whose collectibility is not reasonably assured.
•   rent expense: many of the leases underlying our tower sites have fixed rent escalations, which provide for periodic increases in the amount of ground rent payable over time. in addition, certain of our tenant leases require us to exercise available renewal options pursuant to the underlying ground lease if the tenant exercises its renewal option. we calculate straight-line ground rent expense for these leases based on the fixed non-cancellable term of the underlying ground lease plus all periods, if any, for which failure to renew the lease imposes an economic penalty to us such that renewal appears to be reasonably assured.
•   stock-based compensation: the fair value of a stock option is determined using a black-scholes option-pricing model that takes into account a number of assumptions at the accounting measurement date including the stock price, the exercise price, the expected life of the option, the volatility of the underlying stock, the expected distributions, and the risk-free interest rate over the expected life of the option. these assumptions are highly subjective and could significantly impact the value of the option and the compensation expense. in addition, the amount we record as stock-based compensation expense is required to include an estimate of the awards that will not fully vest and be forfeited. the fair value of both time-based and performance-based restricted stock units is based on the fair value of our common stock on the grant date. we recognize stock-based compensation in either selling, general, administrative and development expense, costs of operations or as part of the costs associated with the construction of our tower assets.
•   income taxes: accounting for income taxes requires us to estimate the timing and impact of amounts recorded in our financial statements that may be recognized differently for tax purposes. to the extent that the timing of amounts recognized for financial reporting purposes differs from the timing of recognition for tax reporting purposes, deferred tax assets or liabilities are required to be recorded. deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured based on the rate at which we expect these items to be reflected in our tax returns, which may differ from the current rate. we do not expect to pay federal taxes on our reit taxable income.
we periodically review our deferred tax assets, and we record a valuation allowance if, based on the available evidence, it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. management assesses the available positive and negative evidence to estimate if sufficient future taxable income will be generated to use the existing deferred tax assets. valuation allowances would be reversed as a reduction to the provision for income taxes, if related deferred tax assets are deemed realizable based on changes in facts and circumstances relevant to the assets' recoverability.
we recognize the benefit of uncertain tax positions when, in management's judgment, it is more likely than not that positions we have taken in our tax returns will be sustained upon examination, which are measured at the largest amount that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon settlement. we adjust our tax liabilities when our judgment changes as a result of the evaluation of new information or information not previously available. due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the tax liabilities. these differences will be reflected as increases or decreases to income tax expense in the period in which additional information is available or the position is ultimately settled under audit.
we consider the earnings of certain non-u.s. subsidiaries to be indefinitely invested outside the united states on the basis of estimates that future domestic cash generation will be sufficient to meet future domestic cash needs. should we decide to repatriate the foreign earnings, we may have to adjust the income tax provision in the period we determined that the earnings will no longer be indefinitely invested outside of the united states.

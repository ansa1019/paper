item 7.   management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general as of december 31, 2015, we had consolidated total assets of $245.19 billion, consolidated total deposits of $191.63 billion, consolidated total shareholders' equity of $21.10 billion and 32,356 employees. we operate in more than 100 geographic markets worldwide, including in the u.s., canada, europe, the middle east and asia.
we have two lines of business:
investment servicing provides services for institutional clients, including mutual funds, collective investment funds and other investment pools, corporate and public retirement plans, insurance companies, foundations and endowments worldwide. products include custody; product- and participant-level accounting; daily pricing and administration; master trust and master custody; record-keeping; cash management; foreign exchange, brokerage and other trading services; securities finance, including our enhanced custody product, which integrates securities lending and custody into a platform that offers clients the ability to borrow securities from us as principal and finance their borrowing activities in numerous ways, including by lending securities in our agency lending program; deposit and short-term investment facilities; loans and lease financing; investment manager and alternative investment manager operations outsourcing; and performance, risk and compliance analytics to support institutional investors.
investment management, through ssga, provides a broad array of investment management, investment research and investment advisory services to corporations, public funds and other sophisticated investors. ssga offers active and passive asset management strategies across equity, fixed-income and cash asset classes. products are distributed directly and through intermediaries using a variety of investment vehicles, including etfs, such as the spdr® etf brand.
for financial and other information about our lines of business, refer to "line of business information" included in this management's discussion and analysis and note 24 to the consolidated financial statements included under item 8 of this form 10-k.
this management's discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements included under item 8 of this form 10-k. certain previously reported amounts presented in this form 10-k have been reclassified to conform to current-year presentation.
in addition, certain prior period amounts have been revised to correct for errors related to those prior periods. refer to note 1 to the consolidated financial statements included under item 8 of this form 10-k.
we prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with u.s. gaap. the preparation of financial statements in conformity with u.s. gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions in its application of certain accounting policies that materially affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, equity, revenue and expenses.
the significant accounting policies that require us to make judgments, estimates and assumptions that are difficult, subjective or complex about matters that are uncertain and may change in subsequent periods include accounting for fair value measurements; other-than-temporary impairment of investment securities; impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets; and contingencies. these significant accounting policies require the most subjective or complex judgments, and underlying estimates and assumptions could be subject to revision as new information becomes available. additional information about these significant accounting policies is included under "significant accounting estimates" in this management's discussion and analysis.
certain financial information provided in this form 10-k, including this management's discussion and analysis, is prepared on both a u.s. gaap, or reported basis, and a non-gaap, or operating basis, including certain non-gaap measures used in the calculation of identified regulatory capital ratios. we measure and compare certain financial information on an operating basis, as we believe that this presentation supports meaningful comparisons from period to period and the analysis of comparable financial trends with respect to our normal ongoing business operations. we believe that operating-basis financial information, which reports non-taxable revenue, such as interest revenue associated with tax-exempt investment securities, on a fully taxable-equivalent basis, facilitates an investor's understanding and analysis of our underlying financial performance and trends in addition to financial information prepared and reported in conformity with u.s. gaap. we also believe that the use of certain non-gaap measures in the calculation of identified regulatory capital ratios is useful in understanding our capital position and is of interest to investors.
operating-basis financial information should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for or superior to, financial information prepared in conformity with u.s. gaap. any non-gaap, or operating-basis, financial information presented in

management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (continued)
•   in october 2015, we announced the next phase of our multi-year transformation program, which we refer to as state street beacon. we expect to deliver cost efficiencies through changes in our operational processes, and further digitize our processes and interfaces with clients. we expect state street beacon, which includes the targeted staff reductions that we announced with our third quarter 2015 results, to generate approximately $550 million in estimated annualized pre-tax expense savings over the next five years, including approximately $75 million in 2016. the full effect of the savings generated each year will be realized the following year. to implement state street beacon, we expect to incur aggregate pre-tax restructuring costs of approximately $300 million to $400 million over the five- year period ending december 31, 2020. estimated pre-tax expense savings relate only to state street beacon, include the effects of the targeted staff reductions announced as part of our third quarter of 2015 financial results, and are based on projected improvement from our full-year 2015 operating-basis expenses, all else equal. actual expenses may increase or decrease in the future due to other factors.
•   in 2015, we secured new asset servicing mandates of $797.5 billion; of that total, approximately $444.9 billion was installed prior to december 31, 2015, with the remaining balance expected to be installed in 2016 or later.
•   net outflows of aum totaled $151 billion, which does not include $13 billion of new asset management business which was awarded to ssga but not installed as of december 31, 2015.
•   during 2015, we recorded legal charges of $415 million or $0.76 per share. of that, $400 million was to increase our legal accrual associated with our indirect foreign exchange business prior to 2010. the total legal accrual associated with this matter as of the time of filing this form 10-k is $565 million. the legal accrual is further discussed under "legal and regulatory matters" in note 13 to the consolidated financial statements included under item 8 of this form 10-k.
•   during 2015, we declared common stock dividends of $1.32 per share, totaling approximately $536 million.
•   during 2015, we purchased approximately 20.5 million shares of our common stock at an average per-share cost of $74.07 and an aggregate cost of approximately $1.52 billion. we have approximately $780 million remaining under our current $1.8 billion program approved by our board in march 2015.
additional information with respect to our common stock purchase program and stock dividends is provided under "financial condition - capital" in this management's discussion and analysis.
•   during the fourth quarter of 2015, we identified and corrected an error that originated in prior periods relating to certain expenses billed to certain of our asset servicing clients, which misstated our servicing revenue. this error misstated our servicing fee revenue. based on the results of our analysis, we determined that the error was immaterial to each of the prior reporting periods affected. however, we concluded that correcting the error in the year ended december 31, 2015 would materially misstate the consolidated results of operations for that period. accordingly, our financial results for all prior periods presented herein have been revised for the correction of this error. refer to "investment servicing" under "line of business information" within this management's discussion and analysis, and note 1 to the consolidated financial statements included under item 8 of this form 10-k.
financial results
•   total revenue in 2015 increased 1% compared to 2014, primarily due to a 3% increase in total fee revenue, partially offset by a decline in net interest revenue.
•   total revenue in 2015 included a $165 million pre-tax gain from the sale of commercial real estate in the third-quarter of 2015 and final paydown in the fourth-quarter of a commercial real estate loan, both acquired as a result of the lehman brothers bankruptcy.
•   in 2015, we recorded a $61 million reduction to our income tax expense related to an italian deferred tax liability as a consequence of our european legal entity restructuring activities.
•   servicing fee revenue increased 1% in 2015 compared to 2014, primarily due to net new business, partially offset by $203 million due to the effect of the stronger u.s. dollar.
management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (continued)
•   management fee revenue decreased 3% in 2015 compared to 2014, primarily due to $43 million from the effect of the stronger u.s. dollar, partially offset by net new business.
•   total expenses in 2015 increased 3% compared to 2014, primarily driven by an increase in expenses due to $415 million in legal accruals, as well as higher information systems and communications costs to support new business and other expenses from professional services, partially offset by a $108 million decrease in acquisition and restructuring costs and $251 million from the effect of the stronger u.s. dollar.
consolidated results of operations this section discusses our consolidated results of operations for 2015 compared to 2014, as well as 2014 compared to 2013, and should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements included under item 8 of this form 10-k.

fee revenue table 2: total revenue, provides the breakout of fee revenue for the years ended december 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013.
servicing and management fees collectively made up approximately 76% of our total fee revenue in 2015 compared to approximately 79% and 78%, in 2014 and 2013, respectively. the level of these fees is influenced by several factors, including the mix and volume of our assets under custody and administration and our assets under management, the value and type of securities positions held (with respect to assets under custody) and the volume of portfolio transactions, and the types of products and services used by our clients, and is generally affected by changes in worldwide equity and fixed-income security valuations and trends in market asset class preferences.
generally, servicing fees are affected by changes in daily average valuations of assets under
management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (continued)
custody and administration. additional factors, such as the relative mix of assets serviced, the level of transaction volumes, changes in service level, the nature of services provided, balance credits, client minimum balances, pricing concessions, the geographical location in which services are provided and other factors, may have a significant effect on our servicing fee revenue.
management fees are generally affected by changes in month-end valuations of assets under management. management fees for certain components of managed assets, such as etfs, are affected by daily average valuations of assets under management. management fee revenue is more sensitive to market valuations than servicing fee revenue, as a higher proportion of the underlying services provided, and the associated management fees earned, are dependent on equity and fixed-income security valuations. additional factors, such as the relative mix of assets managed, may have a significant effect on our management fee revenue. while certain management fees are directly determined by the values of assets under management and the investment strategies employed, management fees may reflect other factors as well, including performance fee arrangements, as well as our relationship pricing for clients using multiple services.
asset-based management fees for actively managed products are generally charged at a higher percentage of assets under management than for passive products. actively managed products may also include performance fee arrangements which are recorded when the performance period is complete. performance fees are generated when the performance of certain managed portfolios exceeds benchmarks specified in the management agreements. generally, we experience more volatility with performance fees than with more traditional management fees.
in light of the above, we estimate, using relevant information as of december 31, 2015 and assuming that all other factors remain constant, that:
•   a 10% increase or decrease in worldwide equity valuations, over the relevant periods for which our servicing and management fees are calculated, would result in a corresponding change in our total revenue of approximately 2%; and
•   a 10% increase or decrease in worldwide fixed income security valuations, over the relevant periods for which our servicing and management fees are calculated, would result in a corresponding change in our total revenue of approximately 1%.
see table 3: daily, month-end and year-end indices for selected equity market indices. while the specific indices presented are indicative of general market trends, the asset types and classes relevant to individual client portfolios can and do differ, and the performance of associated relevant indices can therefore differ from the performance of the indices presented.
daily averages and the averages of month-end indices demonstrate worldwide changes in equity markets that affect our servicing and management fee revenue. year-end indices affect the values of assets under custody and administration and assets under management as of those dates. the index names listed in the table are service marks of their respective owners.

net interest revenue see table 2: total revenue, for the breakout of interest revenue and interest expense for the years ended december 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013.
net interest revenue is defined as interest revenue earned on interest-earning assets less interest expense incurred on interest-bearing liabilities. interest-earning assets, which principally consist of investment securities, interest-bearing deposits with banks, repurchase agreements, loans and leases and other liquid assets, are financed primarily by client deposits, short-term borrowings and long-term debt. net interest margin represents the relationship between annualized fully taxable-equivalent net interest revenue and average total interest-earning assets for the period. it is calculated by dividing fully taxable-equivalent net interest
management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (continued)
revenue by average interest-earning assets. revenue that is exempt from income taxes, mainly that earned from certain investment securities (state and political subdivisions), is adjusted to a fully taxable-equivalent basis using a federal statutory income tax rate of 35%, adjusted for applicable state income taxes, net of the related federal tax benefit.

net interest revenue decreased 7% on a fully taxable-equivalent basis in 2015 compared to 2014. the decrease was generally the result of efforts to optimize our capital position to comply with evolving regulatory requirements on liquidity, lower yields on interest earning assets, as lower global interest rates affected our revenue from floating-rate assets and the rate at which payments from the maturity or prepayment on portfolio holdings could be reinvested, and the effect of the stronger u.s. dollar. the stronger u.s. dollar had the effect of reducing net interest revenue by approximately $54 million in 2015 compared to 2014, partially offset by the benefit of higher levels of interest-earning assets.
changes in the components of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities are discussed in more detail below. additional detail about the components of interest revenue and interest expense is provided in note 17 to the consolidated financial statements included under item 8 of this form 10-k.
average total interest-earning assets were higher for 2015 compared to 2014 as a result of elevated levels of client deposits invested in interest-
bearing deposits with banks, higher average loans and leases and higher levels of cash collateral (included in other interest-earning assets in table 4: average balances and interest rates - fully taxable-equivalent basis) provided in connection with our enhanced custody business.
the higher level of investment in interest-bearing deposits with banks resulted from higher levels of client deposits and our efforts to optimize our capital position during 2015 compared to 2014, discussed further below, while the increase in average loans and leases resulted from growth in mutual fund lending and our continued investment in senior secured bank loans.
during the past year, our clients have continued to place elevated levels of deposits with us, as central bank actions have resulted in high levels of liquidity and low global interest rates. we evaluate deposits as either inherent in our relationship with our custodial clients, which we generally invest in our investment portfolio, or transient, or excess, deposits, which we generally deposit with central banks. deposits with central banks generate low returns. consequently, the elevated levels of these transient
management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (continued)
deposits have contributed to a reduction of our net interest margin relative to historical levels.
the deposits with central banks are also included in our total consolidated assets, and higher deposit levels impact our regulatory leverage ratios. during the year, we took action to better balance our clients' cash management needs with our economic and regulatory objectives. these efforts contributed to a reduction of interest and non-interest bearing client deposits of $17 billion, from $209 billion as of december 31, 2014 to $192 billion as of december 31, 2015. if global interest rates increase, we would expect to see decreases in client deposits; however, in general, we continue to anticipate higher levels of client deposits, irrespective of the interest rate environment, particularly during periods of market stress.
the effect of the stronger u.s. dollar relative to other currencies, particularly the euro, also negatively impacted our net interest revenue, as we maintain a portion of our investment portfolio in euro denominated securities.  if ecb monetary policy continues to pressure european interest rates downward and the u.s. dollar remains strong or strengthens, the negative effects on our net interest revenue may continue or worsen.
we recorded aggregate discount accretion in interest revenue of $98 million in 2015 related to the assets we consolidated onto our balance sheet in 2009 from our asset-backed commercial paper conduits. subsequent to the commercial paper conduit consolidation in 2009, we have recorded total discount accretion in interest revenue as follows:
the timing and ultimate recognition of any applicable discount accretion depends, in part, on factors that are outside of our control, including anticipated prepayment speeds and credit quality. the impact of these factors is uncertain and can be significantly influenced by general economic and financial market conditions. the timing and recognition of any applicable discount accretion can also be influenced by our ongoing management of the risks and other characteristics associated with our investment securities portfolio, including sales of securities which would otherwise generate interest revenue through accretion.
depending on the factors discussed above, among others, we anticipate that until the former conduit securities remaining in our investment portfolio mature or are sold, discount accretion will continue to contribute to our net interest revenue, though generally in declining amounts. assuming that we hold the remaining former conduit securities to maturity, all else being equal, we expect the remaining former conduit securities carried in our investment portfolio as of december 31, 2015 to generate aggregate discount accretion in future periods of approximately $209 million over their remaining terms, with approximately half of this discount accretion to be recorded over the next four years.
interest-bearing deposits with banks averaged $69.75 billion for 2015 compared to $55.35 billion for 2014. these deposits reflected our maintenance of cash balances at the federal reserve, the ecb and other non-u.s. central banks both to satisfy regulatory reserve requirements, and due to the continued elevated levels of client deposits and our investment of the excess deposits with central banks.
we expect to continue to invest deposits we deem as elevated in investment securities or short-term assets, including central bank deposits, depending on our assessment of the underlying characteristics of the deposits.
average investment securities decreased to $105.61 billion for 2015 compared to $116.81 billion for 2014, as we seek to optimize our capital position in light of the evolving regulatory environment. detail with respect to our investment securities portfolio as of december 31, 2015 and december 31, 2014 is provided in note 3 to the consolidated financial statements included under item 8 of this form 10-k.
management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (continued)
the decline in the proportion of average daily short-duration advances to average loans and leases is primarily due to growth in the other segments of the loan and lease portfolio. short-duration advances provide liquidity to clients in support of their investment activities.
average other interest-earning assets increased to $22.72 billion for 2015 from $15.94 billion for 2014. growth in our enhanced custody business, which is our principal securities financing business for our custody clients, contributed to this increase. our average other interest-earning assets, largely associated with our enhanced custody business, comprised approximately 10% of our average total interest-earning assets for 2015, compared to approximately 8% of our average total interest-earning assets for 2014. the enhanced custody business supports our overall profitability by generating securities finance revenue. the net interest earned on these transactions is generally lower than the interest earned on other alternative investments.
aggregate average interest-bearing deposits increased to $133.31 billion for 2015 from $130.30 billion for 2014. the higher levels in 2015 were primarily the result of increases in both u.s. and time deposits, offset by decreases in non-u.s. transaction accounts. future transaction account levels will be influenced by the underlying asset servicing business, client deposit behavior, as well as market conditions, including the general levels of u.s. and non-u.s. interest rates.
average other short-term borrowings declined to $3.83 billion for 2015 from $4.18 billion for 2014. the decrease was the result of state street phasing-out its commercial paper program during 2015, consistent with the objectives of its 2015 recovery and resolution plan developed pursuant to the requirements of the dodd-frank act.
average long-term debt increased to $10.33 billion for 2015 from $9.31 billion for 2014. the increase primarily reflected the issuance of $1.0 billion of senior debt issued in december 2014 and $3.0 billion of senior debt issued in august 2015
which was offset by a $900 million extendible note called at the end of february 2015 and the maturities of $500 million of senior debt in may 2014, $250 million of senior debt in march 2014 and $200 million of subordinated debt in december 2015.
average other interest-bearing liabilities decreased to $6.47 billion for 2015 from $7.35 billion for 2014, primarily the result of higher levels of cash collateral received from clients in connection with our enhanced custody business.
average loans and leases also include short-duration advances. although average short-duration advances remained relatively flat for 2015 compared to 2014, such average short-duration advances provided by us remained low relative to historical levels, primarily the result of higher levels of liquidity, including excess deposits, held by our clients.
several factors could affect future levels of our net interest revenue and margin, including the volume and mix of client liabilities; actions of various central banks; changes in u.s. and non-u.s. interest rates; changes in the various yield curves around the world; revised or proposed regulatory capital or liquidity standards, or interpretations of those standards; the amount of discount accretion generated by the former conduit securities that remain in our investment securities portfolio; the yields earned on securities purchased compared to the yields earned on securities sold or matured; and changes in our enhanced custody business.
based on market conditions and other factors, we continue to reinvest the majority of the proceeds from pay-downs and maturities of investment securities in highly-rated securities, such as u.s. treasury and agency securities, municipal securities, federal agency mortgage-backed securities and u.s. and non-u.s. mortgage- and asset-backed securities. the pace at which we continue to reinvest and the types of investment securities purchased will depend on the impact of market conditions and other factors over time. we expect these factors and the levels of global interest rates to influence what effect our reinvestment program will have on future levels of our net interest revenue and net interest margin.
gains (losses) related to investment securities, net we regularly review our investment securities portfolio to identify other-than-temporary impairment of individual securities. additional information about investment securities, the gross gains and losses that compose the net gains from sales of securities and other-than-temporary impairment is provided in note 3 to the consolidated financial statements included under item 8 of this form 10-k.

(1) net impairment losses, recognized in our consolidated statement of income, were composed of the following:
impairment associated with expected credit losses                                                                $-                                             $(10        )           $(11    )
impairment associated with management's intent to sell impaired securities prior to recovery in value            -                                                 -                      (6    )

net impairment losses                                                                                            $(1               )                            $(11        )           $(23    )
from time to time, in connection with the ongoing management of our investment securities portfolio, we sell available-for-sale securities to manage risk, to take advantage of favorable market conditions, to optimize our balance sheet for regulatory changes, or for other reasons. in 2015, we sold approximately $12.31 billion of such investment securities, compared to approximately $9.77 billion in 2014. we recorded $5 million of net realized losses in 2015 and $15 million of net realized gains in 2014, as presented in the preceding table.
provision for loan losses we recorded a provision for loan losses of $12 million in 2015 compared to $10 million in 2014 and $6 million in 2013. the provisions in all periods were recorded as a result of our exposure to certain senior secured bank loans to non-investment grade borrowers, which we purchased in connection with our participation in loan syndications in the non-investment-grade lending market. increases in the provisions in the year-to-date comparison reflected growth of our senior secured loan portfolio. additional information about these senior secured bank loans is provided under "financial condition - loans and leases" in this management's discussion and analysis and in note 4 to the consolidated financial statements included under item 8 of this form 10-k.

compensation and employee benefits expenses were flat in 2015 compared to 2014. increases in costs for additional staffing to support new business, regulatory initiatives and $72.6 million in net severance costs related to targeted staff reductions were offset by the effect of the stronger u.s. dollar and decreases in incentive compensation and benefits.
management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (continued)
compensation and employee benefits expenses increased 7% in 2014 compared to 2013. compensation and employee benefits expenses in 2014 included approximately $53 million of costs related to our business operations and information technology transformation program, which was completed at the end of 2014 and $84 million of net severance costs associated with staffing realignment.
information systems and communications expenses increased 5% in 2015 compared to 2014.the increase was primarily related to $31 million in additional depreciation costs supporting investments associated with regulatory initiatives and costs to support new business.
information systems and communications expenses increased 4% in 2014 compared to 2013. the increase was mainly associated with higher infrastructure costs related to the completion of our business operations and information technology transformation program.
other expenses increased 21% in 2015 compared to 2014. the increase was primarily due to legal accruals of approximately $400 million in 2015 compared to $185 million in 2014 in connection with our indirect fx client activities and higher levels of regulatory fees, which were partially offset by a decrease in amortization of intangible assets due to a write off of intangible assets in 2014. the legal accrual is further discussed under "legal and regulatory matters" in note 13 to the consolidated financial statements included under item 8 of this form 10-k.
other expenses increased 23% in 2014 compared to 2013, primarily due to a legal accrual of $185 million in connection with management's intention to seek to resolve some, but not all, of the outstanding and potential claims arising out of our indirect fx client activities, higher levels of professional services associated with regulatory compliance requirements, a charitable contribution to the state street foundation, as well as the impact of the lehman brothers-related gains and recoveries recorded in 2013.
our compliance obligations have increased due to new regulations in the u.s. and internationally that have been adopted or proposed in response to the financial crisis. as a systemically important financial institution, we are subject to enhanced supervision and prudential standards. our status as a g-sib has also resulted in heightened prudential and conduct expectations of our u.s. and international regulators with respect to our capital and liquidity management and our compliance and risk oversight programs. these heightened expectations have increased our regulatory compliance costs, including personnel and systems, as well as significant additional implementation and related costs to enhance our regulatory compliance programs. we anticipate that these evolving and increasing regulatory compliance requirements and expectations will continue to affect our expenses. our employee compensation and benefits, information systems and other expenses could increase, as we further adjust our operations in response to new or proposed requirements and heightened expectations.
income tax expense income tax expense was $318 million for 2015 compared to $415 million for 2014. the decrease in tax expense was primarily due to deductions for litigation expense recorded in 2015. our effective tax rate for 2015 was 13.8% compared to 17.1% in 2014, and included effects of the approval of a tax refund for prior years and the reduction of $61 million for an italian deferred tax liability, partially offset by a change in new york tax law.
income tax expense was $415 million in 2014 compared to $616 million in 2013. our effective tax rate for 2014 was 17.1% compared to 23.1% in 2013. the decline in the 2014 effective tax rate was primarily attributable to an expansion of our municipal securities portfolio, increased investments in alternative energy projects and greater benefits from our non-u.s. operations.
additional information regarding income tax expense, including unrecognized tax benefits, and tax contingencies are provided in notes 22 and 13, to the consolidated financial statements under item 8 of this form 10-k.
line of business information we have two lines of business: investment servicing and investment management. the results of operations for these lines of business are not necessarily comparable with those of other companies, including companies in the financial services industry. information about our two lines of business, as well as the revenues, expenses and capital allocation methodologies associated with them, is provided in note 24 to the consolidated financial statements included under item 8 of this form 10-k.

nm- not meaningful total revenue in 2015 for our investment servicing line of business, presented in table 9: investment servicing line of business results, increased 2% compared to 2014. total fee revenue increased 5% in 2015 compared to 2014.
total revenue increased 4% in 2014 compared to 2013, presented in table 9: investment servicing line of business results. total fee revenue increased 6% in 2014 compared to 2013.
net interest revenue decreased 7% in 2015 compared to 2014. the decrease was generally the result of our efforts to optimize our capital position, lower yields on interest-earning assets, as lower global interest rates affected our revenue from floating-rate assets and the effect of the stronger u.s. dollar, partially offset by the benefit of higher levels of interest-earning assets. a discussion of net interest revenue is provided under "net interest revenue" in "total revenue."
total expenses increased 5% in 2015 compared to 2014. the increase primarily resulted from expenses for a legal accrual recorded in connection with management's intention to seek to resolve some, but not all, of the outstanding and potential claims arising out of our indirect fx client activities, higher regulatory and compliance costs and increases in compensation and employee benefits due to additional staffing to support new business and regulatory initiatives. the expense increase was partially offset by the effect of the stronger u.s. dollar.
as a result of the previously disclosed review into the manner in which we invoiced certain expenses to certain asset servicing clients, we determined that we had incorrectly invoiced clients in the aggregate amount of approximately $240 million for expenses within the specific categories under review. this amount is reflected as a liability on our consolidated statement of condition as of december 31, 2015, with $223 million of this amount relating to periods prior to the 2015 fiscal year and reflected in the beginning retained earnings balance of our consolidated statement of changes in shareholders' equity as of december 31, 2014. our financial results for all prior periods presented in this form 10-k have been revised to reflect the impact of the reimbursement liability on each prior period presented. in addition to this amount, we will compensate clients for an aggregate of approximately $17 million in interest associated with the incorrect invoicing. there is the potential that as our review continues, our estimates of the amounts reimbursable to clients may increase or that clients or regulators may assert other legal theories of liability. our billing arrangements capture multiple asset classes and transactions executed by our clients and therefore may be subject to operational error or disagreements with clients. we have notified certain governmental authorities about this review. we may become subject to regulatory proceedings and litigation in connection with this matter, and there can be no assurance as to the outcome of any proceedings that may be commenced against us. refer to note 1 to the consolidated financial statements included under item 8 of this form 10-k.
servicing fees servicing fees increased 1% in 2015 compared to 2014, primarily due to net new business (revenue added from new servicing business installed less revenue lost from the removal of assets serviced) and higher transaction volumes, partially offset by $203 million due to the effect of the stronger u.s. dollar.
servicing fees increased 6% in 2014 compared to 2013 primarily as a result of stronger global equity markets and the positive revenue impact of net new business.
servicing fees generated outside the u.s. were approximately 42% of total servicing fees for the years ended december 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013.

(1) geographic mix is based on the location in which the assets are serviced.
the decrease in total assets under custody and administration for year-end 2015 compared to year-end 2014 primarily resulted from weaker global equity markets, partially offset by net new business. asset levels as of december 31, 2015 did not reflect the estimated $352.6 billion of new business in assets to be serviced awarded to us in 2015 and prior periods but not installed prior to december 31, 2015. this new business will be reflected in assets under custody and administration in future periods after installation and will generate servicing fee revenue in subsequent periods.
with respect to these new assets, we will provide various services, including accounting, bank loan servicing, compliance reporting and monitoring, custody, depository banking services, foreign exchange, fund administration, hedge fund servicing, middle-office outsourcing, performance and analytics, private equity administration, real estate administration, securities finance, transfer agency, and wealth management services.
the value of assets under custody and administration is a broad measure of the relative size of various markets served. changes in the values of assets under custody and administration from period to period do not necessarily result in proportional changes in our servicing fee revenue.

management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (continued)
trading services revenue is composed of revenue generated by fx trading, as well as revenue generated by brokerage and other trading services. we primarily earn fx trading revenue by acting as a principal market-maker. we offer a range of fx products, services and execution models. most of our fx products and execution services can be grouped into three broad categories, which are further explained below: "direct sales and trading," "indirect fx trading" and "electronic fx services." with respect to electronic fx services, we provide an execution venue, but do not act as agent or principal.
we also offer a range of brokerage and other trading products tailored specifically to meet the needs of the global pension community, including transition management and commission recapture. in addition, we act as distribution agent for the spdr® gold etf. these products and services are generally differentiated by our role as an agent of the institutional investor. revenue earned from these services is recorded in other trading, transition management and brokerage revenue within brokerage and other trading services revenue.
our fx trading revenue is influenced by multiple factors, including: the volume and type of client fx transactions and related spreads; currency volatility, reflecting market conditions; and our management of exchange rate, interest rate and other market risks associated with our foreign exchange activities. the relative impact of these factors on our total fx trading revenues often differs from period to period. for example, assuming all other factors remain constant, increases or decreases in volumes or spreads across product mix tend to result in increases or decreases, as the case may be, in client-related fx revenue. revenue earned from direct sales and trading and indirect fx trading is recorded in fx trading revenue.
total fx trading revenue increased 14% in 2015 compared to 2014, primarily the result of stronger market-making revenue and higher client volumes. total fx trading revenue increased 3% in 2014 compared to 2013, primarily the result of higher client volumes.
we enter into fx transactions with clients and investment managers that contact our trading desk directly. these trades are all executed at negotiated rates. we refer to this activity, and our principal market-making activities, as "direct sales and trading" and it includes many transactions for funds serviced by third party custodians or prime brokers, as well as those funds under custody at state street. direct sales and trading revenue represented 59% of total foreign exchange trading revenue in 2015 compared to 59% and 52% in 2014 and 2013, respectively.
alternatively, clients or their investment managers may elect to route fx transactions to our fx desk through our asset-servicing operation; we refer to this activity as "indirect fx trading" and, in all cases, we are the funds' custodian. we execute indirect fx trades as a principal at rates disclosed to our clients. estimated indirect sales and trading revenue represented 41% of total foreign exchange trading revenue for the year ended december 31, 2015 as compared to 41% and 48% in 2014 and 2013, respectively. we calculate revenue for indirect fx trading using an attribution methodology. this methodology takes into consideration estimated mark-ups/downs and observed client volumes. direct sales and trading revenue is all other fx trading revenue other than the revenue attributed to indirect fx trading.
our clients that utilize indirect fx trading can, in addition to executing their fx transactions through dealers not affiliated with us, transition from indirect fx trading to either direct sales and trading execution, including our "street fx" service, or to one of our electronic trading platforms. street fx, in which we continue to act as a principal market-maker, enables our clients to define their fx execution strategy and automate the fx trade execution process, both for funds under custody with us as well as those under custody at another bank.
our direct sales and trading revenue increased 14% in 2015 as compared to 2014. the increase primarily resulted from higher market-making activities and client volumes. our estimated indirect fx trading revenue increased 14% in 2015 compared to 2014. the increase mainly resulted from higher spreads.
our direct sales and trading revenue increased 19% in 2014 as compared to 2013. the increase primarily resulted from higher client volumes, partially offset by lower currency volatility and spreads. our estimated indirect fx trading revenue decreased 14% in 2014 compared to 2013. the decline mainly resulted from lower client volumes and spreads.
we continue to expect that some clients may choose, over time, to reduce their level of indirect fx trading transactions in favor of other execution methods, including either direct sales and trading transactions or electronic fx services which we provide. to the extent that clients shift to other execution methods that we provide, our fx trading revenue may decrease, even if volumes remain consistent.
total brokerage and other trading services revenue decreased 3% in 2015 compared to 2014, and decreased 1% in 2014 compared to 2013. decreases in both periods were primarily due a decline in volumes and lower transition management revenue.
management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (continued)
our clients may choose to execute fx transactions through one of our electronic trading platforms. these transactions generate revenue through a "click" fee. revenue from such electronic fx services decreased 3% in 2015 compared to 2014 and decreased 17% in 2014 compared to 2013, mainly due to declines in client volumes.
other trading, transition management and brokerage revenue decreased 3% in 2015 compared to 2014, primarily due to a decrease in transition management revenue, partially offset by an increase in other trading revenue.
other trading, transition management and brokerage revenue increased 14% in 2014 compared to 2013, primarily due to an increase in currency management revenue.
in recent years, our transition management revenue was adversely affected by compliance issues in our u.k. business during 2010 and 2011. the reputational and regulatory impact of those compliance issues may adversely affect our transition management revenue in future periods.
securities finance our securities finance business consists of three components: (1) an agency lending program for ssga-managed investment funds with a broad range of investment objectives, which we refer to as the ssga lending funds, (2) an agency lending program for third-party investment managers and asset owners, which we refer to as the agency lending funds and (3) security lending transactions which we enter into as principal, which we refer to as our enhanced custody business.
see table 9: investment servicing line of business results for the comparison of securities finance revenue for the years ended december 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013.
securities finance revenue earned from our agency lending activities, which is composed of our split of both the spreads related to cash collateral and the fees related to non-cash collateral, is principally a function of the volume of securities on loan, the interest-rate spreads and fees earned on the underlying collateral, and our share of the fee split.
as principal, our enhanced custody business borrows securities from the lending client and then lends such securities to the subsequent borrower, either a state street client or a broker/dealer. we act as principal when the lending client is unable to, or elects not to, transact directly with the market and execute the transaction and furnish the securities. in our role as principal, we provide support to the transaction through our credit rating. while we source a significant proportion of the securities furnished by us in our role as principal from third parties, we have the ability to source securities through our assets under custody and administration from clients who have designated state street as an eligible borrower.
securities finance revenue increased 14% in 2015 compared to 2014. the increase was primarily the result of growth in our enhanced custody business.
securities finance revenue increased 22% in 2014 compared to 2013. the increase was mainly the result of growth in our enhanced custody business and the impact of higher lending volumes associated with our agency lending program.
market influences may continue to affect client demand for securities finance, and as a result our revenue from, and the profitability of, our securities lending activities in future periods. in addition, the constantly evolving regulatory environment may affect the volume of our securities lending activity and related revenue and profitability in future periods.
processing fees and other processing fees and other revenue includes diverse types of fees and revenue, including fees from our structured products business, fees from software licensing and maintenance, equity income from our joint venture investments, gains and losses on sales of leased equipment and other assets, and amortization of our tax-advantaged investments.
processing fees and other revenue increased 82% in 2015 compared to 2014, as presented in table 9: investment servicing line of business results. the increase was primarily due to a gain from the sale of commercial real estate in the third-quarter of 2015 and final paydown in the fourth-quarter of 2015 of a commercial real estate loan, both acquired as a result of the lehman brothers bankruptcy.
processing fees and other revenue declined 13% in 2014 compared to 2013 as presented in table 9: investment servicing line of business results. the decrease was mainly due to higher amortization of tax-advantaged investments, partially offset by higher revenue from our investment in bank-owned life insurance.

nm not meaningful total revenue for our investment management line of business, presented in table 14: investment management line of business results, decreased 5% in 2015 compared to 2014. total fee revenue decreased 4% compared to 2014.
total expenses were flat in 2015 compared to 2014 resulting from higher transaction processing services and increases in regulatory and compliance costs, offset by recoveries associated with lehman brothers-related assets recorded in 2015 and the effect of the stronger u.s. dollar.
management fees through ssga, we provide a broad range of investment management strategies, specialized investment management advisory services and other financial services for corporations, public funds, and other sophisticated investors. ssga offers an array of investment management strategies, including passive and active, such as enhanced indexing, using quantitative and fundamental methods for both u.s. and global equity and fixed income securities. ssga also offers etfs, such as the spdr® etf brand. while certain management fees are directly determined by the values of assets under management and the investment strategies employed, management fees reflect other factors as well, including our relationship pricing for clients who use multiple services, and the benchmarks specified in the respective management agreements related to performance fees.
management fees decreased $33 million, or 3%, in 2015 compared to 2014, primarily due to a $43 million effect of the stronger u.s. dollar, offset by net new business.
management fees increased 9% in 2014 compared to 2013 primarily as a result of stronger global equity markets, net inflows and the positive revenue impact of the excess of revenue added from newly installed assets to be managed over the revenue lost from liquidations of managed assets.
management fees generated outside the u.s. were approximately 35% of total management fees for 2015, compared to 37% in 2014 and 2013.

the decrease in total aum in 2015 compared to 2014 resulted from net outflows of approximately $151 billion. net outflows were driven by approximately $100 billion from long-term institutional portfolios attributable to institutional equity product asset allocation shifts, approximately $27 billion from cash products and approximately $24 billion from etfs which include spy, our s&p 500 etf. net outflows include an expected redemption by one sub-advisory client that is in-sourcing their business. further redemptions by this client, totaling approximately $35 billion, are expected to continue through the remainder of 2016 and are not expected to have a significant impact on revenue.
aum did not include approximately $13 billion of new asset management business, which was awarded to ssga but not installed as of december 31, 2015. this new business will be reflected in assets under management in future periods after installation, and will generate management fee revenue in subsequent periods.
total assets under management as of december 31, 2015 included managed assets lost but not yet liquidated. lost business occurs from time to time and it is difficult to predict the timing of client behavior in transitioning these assets. this timing can vary significantly.
management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (continued)
financial condition the structure of our consolidated statement of condition is primarily driven by the liabilities generated by our investment servicing and investment management lines of business. our clients' needs and our operating objectives determine balance sheet volume, mix, and currency denomination. as our clients execute their worldwide cash management and investment activities, they utilize deposits and short-term investments that constitute the majority of our liabilities. these liabilities are generally in the form of interest-bearing transaction account deposits, which are denominated in a variety of currencies; non-interest-bearing demand deposits; and repurchase agreements, which generally serve as short-term investment alternatives for our clients.
deposits and other liabilities resulting from client initiated transactions are invested in assets that generally have contractual maturities significantly longer than our liabilities; however, we evaluate the operational nature of our deposits and seek to maintain appropriate short-term liquidity of those liabilities that are not operational in nature and maintain longer-termed assets for our operational deposits. our assets consist primarily of securities held in our available-for-sale or held-to-maturity portfolios and short-duration financial instruments, such as interest-bearing deposits with banks and securities purchased under resale agreements. the actual mix of assets is determined by the characteristics of the client liabilities and our desire to maintain a well-diversified portfolio of high-quality assets.

we manage our investment securities portfolio to align with the interest-rate and duration characteristics of our client liabilities that we consider to be operational deposits and in the context of the overall structure of our consolidated statement of condition, in consideration of the global interest-rate environment. we consider a well-diversified, high-credit quality investment securities portfolio to be an important element in the management of our consolidated statement of condition.
in the fourth quarter of 2015, $7.1 billion of u.s. treasuries previously classified as afs were transferred to htm, reflecting our intent to hold these securities until their maturity. these securities were transferred at fair value, which included a net unrealized gain of $89 million within accumulated other comprehensive loss which will be accreted into interest income over the life of the transferred security.
approximately 92% of the carrying value of the portfolio was rated "aaa" or "aa" as of december 31, 2015 and 90% as of december 31, 2014.

as of december 31, 2015, the investment portfolio of 13,520 securities was diversified with respect to asset class. approximately 51% of the aggregate carrying value of the portfolio as of december 31, 2015 was composed of mortgage-backed and asset-backed securities, compared to 64% as of december 31, 2014. the asset-backed securities portfolio, of which approximately 92% and 96% of the carrying value as of december 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, was floating-rate, consisted primarily of student loan-backed and credit card-backed securities. mortgage-backed securities were composed of securities issued by the federal national mortgage association and federal home loan mortgage corporation, as well as u.s. and non-u.s. large-issuer collateralized mortgage obligations.
management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (continued)
in december 2013, u.s. regulators issued final regulations to implement the volcker rule. the volcker rule will, over time, prohibit banking entities, including us and our affiliates, from engaging in certain prohibited proprietary trading activities, as defined in the final volcker rule regulations, subject to exemptions for market making-related activities, risk-mitigating hedging, underwriting and certain other activities. the volcker rule will also require banking entities to either restructure or divest certain ownership interests in, and relationships with, covered funds (as such terms are defined in the final volcker rule regulations).
whether certain types of investment securities or structures, such as clos, constitute covered funds, as defined in the final volcker rule regulations, and do not benefit from the exemptions provided in the volcker rule, and whether a banking organization's investments therein constitute ownership interests remain subject to (1) market, and ultimately regulatory, interpretation, and (2) the specific terms and other characteristics relevant to such investment securities and structures.
refer to the "supervision and regulation" section, included under item 1 of this form 10-k for information regarding the volcker rule and related regulations.
as of december 31, 2015, we held approximately $2.10 billion of investments in clos. as of the same date, these investments had an aggregate pre-tax net unrealized gain of approximately $43 million, composed of gross unrealized gains of $46 million and gross unrealized losses of $3 million. comparatively, as of december 31, 2014, we held approximately $4.54 billion of investments in clos which had an aggregate pre-tax net unrealized gain of approximately $97 million, composed of gross unrealized gains of $105 million and gross unrealized losses of $8 million. in the event that we or our banking regulators conclude that such investments in clos, or other investments, are covered funds under the volker rule, we may be required to divest of such investments. if other banking entities reach similar conclusions with respect to similar investments held by them, the prices of such investments could decline significantly, and we may be required to divest of such investments at a significant discount compared to the investments' book value. this could result in a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations or on our consolidated financial condition in the period in which such a divestiture occurs.
non-u.s. debt securities approximately 23% of the aggregate carrying value of our investment securities portfolio has non-u.s. debt securities as of december 31, 2015 compared to approximately 26% as of december 31, 2014.

(1) included approximately $205 million and $66 million as of december 31, 2015 and december 31, 2014, respectively, related to portugal, ireland and spain, all of which were related to mortgage-backed securities and auto loans.
(2) included approximately $31 million and $36 million as of december 31, 2015 and december 31, 2014, respectively, of securities related to portugal, all of which were mortgage-backed securities.
approximately 89% and 88% of the aggregate carrying value of these non-u.s. debt securities was rated "aaa" or "aa" as of december 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. the majority of these securities comprised senior positions within the security structures; these positions have a level of protection provided through subordination and other forms of credit protection. as of december 31, 2015 and 2014, approximately 70% and 74%, respectively, of the aggregate carrying value of these non-u.s. debt securities was floating-rate, and accordingly, we consider these securities to have minimal interest-rate risk.
management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (continued)
as of december 31, 2015, our non-u.s. debt securities had an average market-to-book ratio of 100.7%, and an aggregate pre-tax net unrealized gain of approximately $162 million, composed of gross unrealized gains of $222 million and gross unrealized losses of $60 million. these unrealized amounts included a pre-tax net unrealized gain of $78 million, composed of gross unrealized gains of $109 million and gross unrealized losses of $31 million, associated with non-u.s. debt securities available for sale.

impairment impairment exists when the fair value of an individual security is below its amortized cost basis. impairment of a security is further assessed to determine whether such impairment is other-than-temporary. when the impairment is deemed to be other-than-temporary, we record the loss in our consolidated statement of income. in addition, for afs and htm debt securities, we record impairment in our consolidated statement of income when management intends to sell (or may be required to sell) the securities before they recover in value, or when management expects the present value of cash flows expected to be collected from the securities to be less than the amortized cost of the impaired security (a credit loss).
management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (continued)
the decrease in the net unrealized gain position as of december 31, 2015 as compared to december 31, 2014, presented in table 25: amortized cost, fair value and net unrealized gains (losses) of investment securities, was primarily attributable to the decrease in the balance of our afs portfolio and widening spreads.

(1) afs securities are carried at fair value, with after-tax net unrealized gains and losses recorded in aoci. htm securities are carried at cost, and unrealized gains and losses are not recorded in our consolidated financial statements.
we conduct periodic reviews of individual securities to assess whether otti exists. our assessment of otti involves an evaluation of economic and security-specific factors. such factors are based on estimates, derived by management, which contemplate current market conditions and security-specific performance. to the extent that market conditions are worse than management's expectations, otti could increase, in particular the credit-related component that would be recorded in our consolidated statement of income.
in the aggregate, we recorded net losses from otti of $1 million and $11 million in 2015 and 2014, respectively. management considers the aggregate decline in fair value of the remaining investment securities and the resulting gross unrealized losses of $841 million as of december 31, 2015 to be temporary and not the result of any material changes in the credit characteristics of the securities. additional information with respect to otti, net impairment losses and gross unrealized losses is provided in note 3 to the consolidated financial statements included under item 8 of this form 10-k.
our evaluation of potential otti of mortgage-backed securities with collateral in spain, italy, ireland, and portugal takes into account slow economic growth, austerity measures, and government intervention in the corresponding mortgage markets and assumes a conservative baseline macroeconomic environment. our baseline view assumes a recessionary period characterized by high unemployment and by additional declines in housing prices between 3% and 17%. our evaluation of otti in our base case does not assume a disorderly sovereign debt restructuring or a break-up of the eurozone.
excluding otti recorded in 2015, management considers the aggregate decline in fair value of the remaining investment securities and the resulting gross unrealized losses as of december 31, 2015 to be temporary and not the result of any material changes in the credit characteristics of the securities. additional information about these gross unrealized losses is provided in note 3 to the consolidated financial statements included under item 8 of this form 10-k.
loans and leases table 26: u.s. and non- u.s. loans and leases as of december 31,
the increase in loans in the institutional segment as of december 31, 2015 as compared to december 31, 2014 was primarily driven by increased investment in the non-investment-grade lending market through participations in loan syndications, specifically senior secured bank loans, partially offset by lower levels of short-duration advances.
short-duration advances to our clients included in the institutional segment were $2.62 billion and $3.54 billion as of december 31, 2015 and december 31, 2014, respectively. these short-duration advances provide liquidity to fund clients in
management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (continued)
support of their transaction flows associated with securities settlement activities.
as of december 31, 2015 and december 31, 2014, our investment in senior secured bank loans totaled approximately $3.14 billion and $2.07 billion, respectively. in addition, we had binding unfunded commitments as of december 31, 2015 and december 31, 2014 of $186 million and $337 million, respectively, to participate in such syndications.
these senior secured bank loans, which we have rated "speculative" under our internal risk-rating framework (refer to note 4 to the consolidated financial statements included under item 8 of this form 10-k), are externally rated "bbb," "bb" or "b," with approximately 93% of the loans rated "bb" or "b" as of december 31, 2015, compared to 95% as of december 31, 2014. our investment strategy involves limiting our investment to larger, more liquid credits underwritten by major global financial institutions, applying our internal credit analysis process to each potential investment, and diversifying our exposure by counterparty and industry segment. however, these loans have significant exposure to credit losses relative to higher-rated loans. as of december 31, 2015 and december 31, 2014, our allowance for loan losses included approximately $35 million and $26 million, respectively, related to these senior secured bank loans. as this portfolio grows and becomes more seasoned, our allowance for loan losses related to these loans may increase through additional provisions for credit losses.
as of december 31, 2015 and december 31, 2014, unearned income deducted from our investment in leveraged lease financing was $102 million and $109 million, respectively, for u.s. leases and $231 million and $261 million, respectively, for non-u.s. leases.
the cre loans are composed of the loans acquired in 2008 pursuant to indemnified repurchase agreements with an affiliate of lehman as a result of the lehman brothers bankruptcy. additional information about all of our loan-and-lease segments, as well as underlying classes, is provided in note 4 to the consolidated financial statements included under item 8 of this form 10-k.

(2) includes $4 million in charge-offs related to institutional loans for the year ended december 31, 2015 and $78 million related to cre loans for the year ended december 31, 2011.
the provision of $12 million and the charge-offs of $4 million recorded in 2015 were associated with our exposure to certain senior secured bank loans to non-investment grade borrowers, which we purchased in connection with our participation in loan syndications in the non-investment-grade lending market.
as of december 31, 2015, approximately $35 million of our allowance for loan losses was related to senior secured bank loans included in the institutional segment; the remaining $11 million was related to other commercial and financial loans in the institutional segment.
cross-border outstandings cross-border outstandings are amounts payable to us by non-u.s. counterparties which are denominated in u.s. dollars or other non-local currency, as well as non-u.s. local currency claims not funded by local currency liabilities. our cross-border outstandings consist primarily of deposits with banks; loans and lease financing, including short-duration advances; investment securities; amounts related to foreign exchange and interest-rate contracts; and securities finance.  in addition to credit risk, cross-border outstandings have the risk that, as a result of political or economic conditions in a country, borrowers may be unable to meet their contractual repayment obligations of principal and/or interest when due because of the unavailability of, or restrictions on, foreign exchange needed by borrowers to repay their obligations.
we place deposits with non-u.s. counterparties that have strong internal state street risk ratings. counterparties are approved and monitored by our country risk committee. this process includes financial analysis of non-u.s. counterparties and the use of an internal risk-rating system. each counterparty is reviewed at least annually and potentially more frequently based on deteriorating credit fundamentals or general market conditions. we also utilize risk mitigation and other facilities that may reduce our exposure through the use of cash collateral and/or balance sheet netting where we deem appropriate. in addition, the country risk committee performs country-risk analyses and monitors limits on country exposure.
the total cross-border outstandings presented in table 30: cross-border outstandings represented approximately 25%, 17% and 19% of our consolidated total assets as of december 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.
(1) cross-border outstandings included countries in which we do business, and which amounted to at least 1% of our consolidated total assets as of the dates indicated.
management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (continued)
as of december 31, 2015, aggregate cross-border outstandings in countries which amounted to 0.75% and 1% of our total consolidated assets totaled approximately $2.20 billion to netherlands. as of december 31, 2014, there were no countries whose aggregate cross-border outstandings amounted to between 0.75% and 1% of our total consolidated assets. as of december 31, 2013, aggregate cross-border outstandings in countries which amounted to 0.75% and 1% of our total consolidated assets totaled approximately $1.85 billion to china.
throughout the sovereign debt crisis, the major independent credit rating agencies have downgraded u.s. and non-u.s. financial institutions and sovereign issuers which have been, and may in the future be, significant counterparties to us, or whose financial instruments serve as collateral on which we rely for credit risk mitigation purposes, and may do so again in the future. as a result, we may be exposed to increased counterparty risk, leading to negative ratings volatility.
risk management general in the normal course of our global business activities, we are exposed to a variety of risks, some inherent in the financial services industry, others more specific to our business activities. our risk management framework focuses on material risks, which include the following:
•   credit and counterparty risk;
•   liquidity risk, funding and management;
•   operational risk;
•   information technology risk;
•   market risk associated with our trading activities;
•   market risk associated with our non-trading activities, which we refer to as asset-and-liability management, and which consists primarily of interest-rate risk;
•   strategic risk;
•   model risk; and
•   reputational, fiduciary and business conduct risk.
many of these risks, as well as certain of the factors underlying each of these risks that could affect our businesses and our consolidated financial statements, are discussed in detail under item 1a, "risk factors," included in this form 10-k.
the scope of our business requires that we balance these risks with a comprehensive and well-integrated risk management function. the identification, assessment, monitoring, mitigation and reporting of risks are essential to our financial performance and successful management of our businesses. these risks, if not effectively managed, can result in losses to state street as well as erosion of our capital and damage to our reputation. our approach, including board and senior management oversight and a system of policies, procedures, limits, risk measurement and monitoring and internal controls, allows for an assessment of risks within a framework for evaluating opportunities for the prudent use of capital that appropriately balances risk and return.
our objective is to optimize our return while operating at a prudent level of risk. in support of this objective, we have instituted a risk appetite framework that aligns our business strategy and financial objectives with the level of risk that we are willing to incur.
our risk management is based on the following major goals:
▪   a culture of risk awareness that extends across all of our business activities;
▪   the identification, classification and quantification of state street's material risks;
▪   the establishment of our risk appetite and associated limits and policies, and our compliance with these limits;
▪   the establishment of a risk management structure at the "top of the house" that enables the control and coordination of risk-taking across the business lines;
▪   the implementation of stress testing practices and a dynamic risk-assessment capability;
management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (continued)
▪   a direct link between risk and strategic-decision making processes and incentive compensation practices; and
▪   the overall flexibility to adapt to the ever-changing business and market conditions.
our risk appetite framework outlines the quantitative limits and qualitative goals that define our risk appetite, as well as the responsibilities for measuring and monitoring risk against limits, and for reporting, escalating, approving and addressing exceptions. our risk appetite framework is established by erm, a corporate risk oversight group, in conjunction with the mrac and the rc of the board. the board formally reviews and approves our risk appetite statement annually, or more frequently as required.
the risk appetite framework describes the level and types of risk that we are willing to accommodate in executing our business strategy, and also serves as a guide in setting risk limits across our business units. in addition to our risk appetite framework, we use stress testing as another important tool in our risk management practice. additional information with respect to our stress testing process and practices is provided under "capital" in management's discussion and analysis.

governance and structure we have an approach to risk management that involves all levels of management, from the board and its committees, including its e&a committee, rc, the ecc, as well as the technology committee, to each business unit and each employee. we allocate responsibility for risk oversight so that risk/return decisions are made at an appropriate level, and are subject to robust and effective review and challenge. risk management is the responsibility of each employee, and is implemented through three lines of defense: the business units, which own and manage the risks inherent in their business, are considered the first line of defense; erm and other support functions, such as compliance, finance and vendor management, provide the second line of defense; and corporate audit, which assesses the effectiveness of the first two lines of defense.
the responsibilities for effective review and challenge reside with senior managers, management oversight committees, corporate audit and, ultimately, the board and its committees. while we believe that our risk management program is effective in managing the risks in our businesses, internal and external factors may create risks that cannot always be identified or anticipated.
corporate-level risk committees provide focused oversight, and establish corporate standards and policies for specific risks, including credit, sovereign exposure, market, liquidity, operational, information technology as well as new business products, regulatory compliance and ethics, vendor risk and model risks. these committees have been delegated the responsibility to develop recommendations and remediation strategies to address issues that affect or have the potential to affect state street.
we maintain a risk governance committee structure which serves as the formal governance mechanism through which we seek to undertake the consistent identification, management and mitigation of various risks facing state street in connection with its business activities. this governance structure is enhanced and integrated through multi-disciplinary involvement, particularly through erm. the following chart presents this structure.

the cro is responsible for state street's risk management globally, leads erm and has a dual reporting line to state street's ceo and the board's rc. erm manages its responsibilities globally through a three-dimensional organization structure:
•   "vertical" business unit-aligned risk groups that support business managers with risk management, measurement and monitoring activities;
•   "horizontal" risk groups that monitor the risks that cross all of our business units (for example, credit and operational risk); and
•   risk oversight for international activities, which combines intersecting "verticals" and "horizontals" through a hub and spoke model to provide important regional and legal entity perspectives to the global risk framework.
sitting on top of this three-dimensional organization structure is a centralized group responsible for the aggregation of risk exposures across the vertical, horizontal and regional dimensions, for consolidated reporting, for setting the corporate-level risk appetite framework and associated limits and policies, and for dynamic risk assessment across state street.
management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (continued)
board committees the board has four committees which assist it in discharging its responsibilities with respect to risk management: the rc, the e&a committee, the ecc, and the technology committee.
the rc is responsible for oversight related to the operation of our global risk management framework, including policies and procedures establishing risk management governance and processes and risk control infrastructure for our global operations. the rc is responsible for reviewing and discussing with management our assessment and management of all risks applicable to our operations, including credit, market, interest rate, liquidity, operational and business risks, as well as compliance and reputational risk and related policies.
in addition, the rc provides oversight on strategic capital governance principles and controls, and monitors capital adequacy in relation to risk. the rc is also responsible for discharging the duties and obligations of the board under applicable basel and other regulatory requirements.
the e&a committee oversees the operation of our system of internal controls covering the integrity of our consolidated financial statements and reports, compliance with laws, regulations and corporate policies. the e&a committee acts on behalf of the board in monitoring and overseeing the performance of corporate audit and in reviewing certain communications with banking regulators. the e&a committee has direct responsibility for the appointment, compensation, retention, evaluation and oversight of the work of our independent registered public accounting firm, including sole authority for the establishment of pre-approval policies and procedures for all audit engagements and any non-audit engagements.
the ecc has direct responsibility for the oversight of all compensation plans, policies, and programs of state street in which executive officers participate and incentive, retirement, welfare as well as equity plans in which certain other employees of state street participate. in addition, the ecc oversees the alignment of our incentive compensation arrangements with our safety and soundness, including the integration of risk management objectives, and related policies, arrangements and control processes consistent with applicable related regulatory rules and guidance.
the technology committee leads and assists in the board's oversight of the role of technology in executing state street's strategy and supporting state street's global business and operational requirements. the technology committee reviews the use of technology in our activities and operations, as well as significant technology and technology-
related strategies, investments and policies. in addition, the technology committee reviews and approves technology and technology-related risk matters, including information and cyber security.
executive management committees mrac is the senior management decision-making body for risk and capital issues, and oversees our financial risks, our consolidated statement of condition, and our capital adequacy, liquidity and recovery and resolution planning. its responsibilities include:
•   the approval of the policies of our global risk, capital and liquidity management frameworks, including our risk appetite framework;
•   the monitoring and assessment of our capital adequacy based on internal policies and regulatory requirements;
•   the oversight of our firm-wide risk identification, model risk governance, stress testing and recovery and resolution plan programs; and
•   the ongoing monitoring and review of risks undertaken within the businesses, and our senior management oversight and approval of risk strategies and tactics.
mrac, which is co-chaired by our cro and the cfo, regularly presents a report to the rc outlining developments in the risk environment and performance trends in our key business areas.
bcrc provides additional risk governance and leadership, by overseeing our business practices in terms of our compliance with laws, regulations and our standards of business conduct, our commitments to clients and others with whom we do business, and potential reputational risks. management considers adherence to high ethical standards to be critical to the success of our business and to our reputation. the bcrc is co-chaired by our cro and our chief legal officer.
torc oversees and assesses the effectiveness of corporate-wide technology and operational risk management programs, to manage and control technology and operational risk consistently across the organization. torc is co-chaired by our cro and our vice chairman & head of the office of regulatory initiatives.

credit risk management core policies and principles we define credit risk as the risk of financial loss if a counterparty, borrower or obligor, collectively referred to as counterparty, is either unable or unwilling to repay borrowings or settle a transaction in accordance with underlying contractual terms. we assume credit risk in our traditional non-trading lending activities, such as loans and contingent commitments, in our investment securities portfolio, where recourse to a counterparty exists, and in our direct and indirect trading activities, such as principal securities lending and foreign exchange and indemnified agency securities lending. we also assume credit risk in our day-to-day treasury and securities and other settlement operations, in the form of deposit placements and other cash balances, with central banks or private sector institutions.
we distinguish between three major types of credit risk:
▪   default risk - the risk that a counterparty fails to meet its contractual payment obligations;
▪   country risk - the risk that we may suffer a loss, in any given country, due to any of the following reasons: deterioration of economic conditions, political and social upheaval, nationalization and appropriation of assets, government repudiation of indebtedness, exchange controls, and disruptive currency depreciation or devaluation; and
▪   settlement risk - the risk that the settlement or clearance of transactions will fail, which arises whenever the exchange of cash, securities and/or other assets is not simultaneous.
the acceptance of credit risk by state street is governed by corporate policies and guidelines, which include standardized procedures applied across the entire organization. these policies and guidelines include specific requirements related to each counterparty's risk profile; the markets served; counterparty, industry and country concentrations; and regulatory compliance. these policies and procedures also implement a number of core principles, which include the following:
•   we measure and consolidate credit risks to each counterparty, or group of counterparties, in accordance with a "one-obligor" principle that aggregates risks across our business units;
•   erm reviews and approves all extensions of credit, or material changes to extensions of credit (such as changes in term, collateral structure or covenants), in accordance with assigned credit-approval authorities;
•   credit-approval authorities are assigned to individuals according to their qualifications, experience and training, and these authorities are periodically reviewed. our largest exposures require approval by the credit committee, a sub-committee of the crpc. with respect to small and low-risk extensions of credit to certain types of counterparties, approval authority is granted to individuals outside of erm;
•   we seek to avoid or limit undue concentrations of risk. counterparty (or groups of counterparties), industry, country and product-specific concentrations of risk
management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (continued)
are subject to frequent review and approval in accordance with our risk appetite;
•   we determine the creditworthiness of counterparties through a detailed risk assessment, including the use of comprehensive internal risk-rating methodologies;
•   we review all extensions of credit and the creditworthiness of counterparties at least annually. the nature and extent of these reviews are determined by the size, nature and term of the extensions of credit and the creditworthiness of the counterparty; and
•   we subject all corporate policies and guidelines to annual review as an integral part of our periodic assessment of our risk appetite.
our corporate policies and guidelines require that the business units which engage in activities that give rise to credit and counterparty risk comply with procedures that promote the extension of credit for legitimate business purposes; are consistent with the maintenance of proper credit standards; limit credit-related losses; and are consistent with our goal of maintaining a strong financial condition.
structure and organization the credit risk group within erm is responsible for the assessment, approval and monitoring of credit risk across state street. the group is managed centrally, has dedicated teams in a number of locations worldwide across our businesses, and is responsible for related policies and procedures, and for our internal credit-rating systems and methodologies. in addition, the group, in conjunction with the business units, establishes appropriate measurements and limits to control the amount of credit risk accepted across its various business activities, both at the portfolio level and for each individual counterparty or group of counterparties, to individual industries, and also to counterparties by product and country of risk. these measurements and limits are reviewed periodically, but at least annually.
in conjunction with other groups in erm, the credit risk group is jointly responsible for the design, implementation and oversight of our credit risk measurement and management systems, including data and assessment systems, quantification systems and the reporting framework.
various key committees within state street are responsible for the oversight of credit risk and associated credit risk policies, systems and models. all credit-related activities are governed by our risk appetite framework and our credit risk guidelines, which define our general philosophy with respect to credit risk and the manner in which we control, manage and monitor such risks.
the previously described crpc (refer to "risk committees") has primary responsibility for the oversight, review and approval of the credit risk guidelines and policies. credit risk guidelines and policies are reviewed periodically, but at least annually.
the credit committee, a sub-committee of the crpc, has responsibility for assigning credit authority and approving the largest and higher-risk extensions of credit to individual counterparties or groups of counterparties.
credit ratings we perform initial and ongoing reviews to exercise due diligence on the creditworthiness of our counterparties when conducting any business with them or approving any credit limits.
this due diligence process generally includes the assignment of an internal credit rating, which is determined by the use of internally developed and validated methodologies, scorecards and a 15-grade rating scale. this risk-rating process incorporates the use of risk-rating tools in conjunction with management judgment; qualitative and quantitative inputs are captured in a replicable manner and, following a formal review and approval process, an internal credit rating based on our rating scale is assigned. credit ratings are reviewed and approved by the credit risk group or designees within erm. to facilitate comparability across the portfolio, counterparties within a given sector are rated using a risk-rating tool developed for that sector.
our risk-rating methodologies are approved by the crpc, after completion of internal model validation processes, and are subject to an annual review, including re-validation.
we generally rate our counterparties individually, although certain portfolios defined by us as low-risk are rated on a pooled basis. we evaluate and rate the credit risk of our counterparties on an ongoing basis.
risk parameter estimates our internal risk-rating system promotes a clear and consistent approach to the determination of appropriate credit risk classifications for our credit counterparties and exposures, tracking the changes in risk associated with these counterparties and exposures over time. this capability enhances our ability to more accurately calculate both risk exposures and capital, enabling better strategic decision making across the organization.
management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (continued)
we use credit risk parameter estimates for the following purposes:
•   the assessment of the creditworthiness of new counterparties and, in conjunction with our risk appetite statement, the development of appropriate credit limits for our products and services, including loans, foreign exchange, securities finance, placements and repurchase agreements;
•   the use of an automated process for limit approvals for certain low-risk counterparties, as defined in our credit risk guidelines, based on the counterparty's probability-of-default, or pd, rating class;
•   the development of approval authority matrices based on pd; riskier counterparties with higher ratings require higher levels of approval for a comparable pd and limit size compared to less risky counterparties with lower ratings;
•   the analysis of risk concentration trends using historical pd and exposure-at-default, or ead, data;
•   the standardization of rating integrity testing by gcr using rating parameters;
•   the determination of the level of management review of short-duration advances depending on pd; riskier counterparties with higher rating class values generally trigger higher levels of management escalation for comparable short-duration advances compared to less risky counterparties with lower rating-class values;
•   the monitoring of credit facility utilization levels using ead values and the identification of instances where counterparties have exceeded limits;
•   the aggregation and comparison of counterparty exposures with risk appetite levels to determine if businesses are maintaining appropriate risk levels; and
•   the determination of our regulatory capital requirements for the airb provided in the basel framework.
credit risk mitigation we seek to limit our credit exposure and reduce our potential credit losses through various types of risk mitigation. in our day-to-day management of credit risks, we utilize and recognize the following types of risk mitigation.
•   collateral. in many parts of our business, we regularly require or agree for collateral to be received from or provided to clients and counterparties in connection with contracts that incur credit risk. in our trading businesses, this collateral is typically in the form of cash and high-grade securities (government securities and other bonds or equity securities). credit risks in our non-trading and securities finance businesses are also often secured by bonds and equity securities and by other types of assets. collateral serves to reduce the risk of loss inherent in an exposure by improving the prospect of recovery in the event of a counterparty default. while collateral is often an alternative source of repayment, it generally does not replace the requirement within our policies and guidelines for high-quality underwriting standards.
our credit risk guidelines require that the collateral we accept for risk mitigation purposes is of high quality, can be reliably valued and can be liquidated if or when required. generally, when collateral is of lower quality, more difficult to value or more challenging to liquidate, higher discounts to market values are applied for the purposes of measuring credit risk. for certain less liquid collateral, longer liquidation periods are assumed when determining the credit exposure.
all types of collateral are assessed regularly by erm, as is the basis on which the collateral is valued. our assessment of collateral, including the ability to liquidate collateral in the event of a counterparty default, and also with regard to market values of collateral under a variety of hypothetical market conditions, is an integral component of our assessment of risk and approval of credit limits. we also seek to identify, limit and monitor instances of "wrong-way" risk, where a counterparty's risk of default is positively correlated with the risk of our collateral eroding in value.
we maintain policies and procedures requiring that documentation used to collateralize a transaction is legal, valid, binding and enforceable in the relevant jurisdictions. we also conduct legal reviews to assess whether our documentation meets these standards on an ongoing basis.
•   netting. netting is a mechanism that allows institutions and counterparties to net offsetting exposures and payment obligations against one another through the use of qualifying master netting agreements. a master netting agreement allows the netting of rights and obligations arising under derivative or other transactions that
management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (continued)
have been entered into under such an agreement upon the counterparty's default, resulting in a single net claim owed by, or to, the counterparty. this is commonly referred to as "close-out netting," and is pursued wherever possible. we may also enter into master agreements that allow for the netting of amounts payable on a given day and in the same currency, reducing our settlement risk. this is commonly referred to as "payment netting," and is widely used in our foreign exchange activities.
as with collateral, we have policies and procedures in place to apply close-out and payment netting only to the extent that we have verified legal validity and enforceability of the master agreement. in the case of payment netting, operational constraints with our counterparties may preclude us from reducing settlement risk, notwithstanding the legal right to require the same under the master netting agreement.
•   guarantees. a guarantee is a financial instrument that results in credit support being provided by a third party, (i.e., the protection provider) to the underlying obligor (the beneficiary of the provided protection) on account of an exposure owing by the obligor. the protection provider may support the underlying exposure either in whole or in part. support of this kind may take different forms. typical forms of guarantees provided to state street include financial guarantees, letters of credit, bankers' acceptances, pua contracts and insurance.
erm and legal teams have established a review process to evaluate guarantees under the applicable requirements of state street policies and basel iii requirements. governance for this evaluation is covered under policies and procedures that require regular reviews of documentation, jurisdictions, and credit quality of protection providers.
pursuant to the basel iii final rule, we are permitted to reflect the application of credit risk mitigation which may include, for example, guarantees, collateral, netting, secured interests in non-financial assets and credit default swaps. state street does not actively use credit default swaps as a risk mitigation tool, although it increasingly applies the recognition of guarantees, collateral and security over non-financial assets to mitigate overall risk within its counterparty credit portfolio.
credit limits central to our philosophy for our management of credit risk is the approval and imposition of credit limits, against which we monitor the actual and potential future credit exposure arising from our business activities with counterparties or groups of counterparties. credit limits are a reflection of our risk appetite, which may be determined by the creditworthiness of the counterparty, the nature of the risk inherent in the business undertaken with the counterparty, or a combination of relevant credit factors. our risk appetite for certain sectors and certain countries and geographic regions may also influence the level of risk we are willing to assume to certain counterparties.
the analysis and approval of credit limits is undertaken in a consistent manner across our businesses, although the nature and extent of the analysis may vary, based on the type, term and magnitude of the risk being assumed. credit limits and underlying exposures are assessed and measured on both a gross and net basis where appropriate, with net exposure determined by deducting the value of any collateral held. for certain types of risk being assumed, we will also assess and measure exposures under a variety of hypothetical market conditions. credit limit approvals across state street are undertaken by the credit risk group, by individuals to whom credit authority has been delegated, or by the credit committee.
credit limits are re-evaluated annually, or more frequently as needed, and are revised periodically on prevailing and anticipated market conditions, changes in counterparty or country-specific credit ratings and outlook, changes in state street's risk appetite for certain counterparties, sectors or countries, and enhancements to the measurement of credit utilization.
reporting ongoing active monitoring and management of our credit risk is an integral part of our credit risk management framework. we maintain management information systems to identify, measure, monitor and report credit risk across businesses and legal entities, enabling erm and our businesses to have timely access to accurate information on credit limits and exposures. monitoring is performed along the dimensions of counterparty, industry, country and product-specific risks to facilitate the identification of concentrations of risk and emerging trends.
key aspects of this credit risk reporting structure include governance and oversight groups, policies that define standards for the reporting of credit risk, data aggregation and sourcing systems, and separate testing of relevant risk reporting functions by corporate audit.
the credit portfolio management group routinely assesses the composition of our overall credit risk portfolio for alignment with our stated risk appetite. this assessment includes routine analysis and reporting of the portfolio, monitoring of market-
management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (continued)
based indicators, the assessment of industry trends and developments, and regular reviews of concentrated risks. the credit portfolio management group is also responsible, in conjunction with the business units, for defining the appetite for credit risk in the major sectors in which we have a concentration of business activities. these sector-level risk appetite statements, which include counterparty selection criteria and granular underwriting guidelines, are reviewed periodically and approved by the crpc.
monitoring regular surveillance of credit and counterparty risks is undertaken by our business units, the credit risk group and designees with erm, allowing for frequent and extensive oversight. this surveillance process includes, but is not limited to, the following components:
•   annual reviews. a formal review of counterparties is conducted at least annually and includes a thorough review of operating performance, primary risk factors and our internal credit risk rating. this annual review also includes a review of current and proposed credit limits, an assessment of our ongoing risk appetite and verification that supporting legal documentation remains effective.
•   interim monitoring. periodic monitoring of our largest and riskiest counterparties is undertaken more frequently, utilizing financial information, market indicators and other relevant credit and performance measures. the nature and extent of this interim monitoring is individually tailored to certain counterparties and/or industry sectors to identify material changes to the risk profile of a counterparty (or group of counterparties) and assign an updated internal risk rating in a timely manner.
we maintain an active "watch list" for all counterparties where we have identified a concern that the actual or potential risk of default has increased. the watch list status denotes a concern with some aspect of a counterparty's risk profile that warrants closer monitoring of the counterparty's financial performance and related risk factors. our ongoing monitoring processes are designed to facilitate the early identification of counterparties whose creditworthiness is deteriorating; any counterparty may be placed on the watch list by erm at its sole discretion.
counterparties that receive an internal risk rating within a certain range on our rating scale are eligible for watch list designation. these risk ratings generally correspond with the non-investment grade or near non-investment grade ratings established by the major independent credit-rating agencies, and also include the regulatory classifications of "special mention," "substandard," "doubtful" and "loss." counterparties whose internal ratings are outside this range may also be placed on the watch list.
the credit risk group maintains primary responsibility for our watch list processes, and generates a monthly report of all watch list counterparties. the watch list is formally reviewed at least on a quarterly basis, with participation from senior erm staff, and representatives from the business units and our corporate finance and legal groups as appropriate. these meetings include a review of individual watch list counterparties, together with credit limits and prevailing exposures, and are focused on actions to contain, reduce or eliminate the risk of loss to state street. identified actions are documented and monitored.
controls gcr provides a separate level of surveillance and oversight over the integrity of our credit risk management processes, including the internal risk-rating system. gcr reviews counterparty credit ratings for all identified sectors on an ongoing basis. gcr is subject to oversight by the crpc, and provides periodic updates to the board's rc.
specific activities of gcr include the following:
•   separate and objective assessments of our credit and counterparty exposures to determine the nature and extent of risk undertaken by the business units;
•   periodic credit process and credit product reviews, focusing on and assessing credit analysis, policy compliance, prudent transaction structure and underwriting standards, administration and documentation, risk-rating integrity, and relevant trends;
•   identification and monitoring of developing counterparty, market and/or industry sector trends to limit risk of loss and protect capital;
•   regular and formal reporting of reviews, including findings and requisite actions to remedy identified deficiencies;
•   allocation of resources for specialized risk assessments (on an as-needed basis);
•   assessment of the level of the allowance for loan and lease losses and otti; and
•   liaison with auditors and regulatory personnel on matters relating to risk rating, reporting, and measurement.
reserve for credit losses we maintain an allowance for loan losses to support our on-balance sheet credit exposures. we also maintain a reserve for unfunded commitments
management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (continued)
and letters of credit to support our off-balance credit exposure. the two components together represent the reserve for credit losses. review and evaluation of the adequacy of the reserve for credit losses is ongoing throughout the year, but occurs at least quarterly, and is based, among other factors, on our evaluation of the level of risk in the portfolio, the volume of adversely classified loans, previous loss experience, current trends, and economic conditions and their effect on our counterparties. additional information about the allowance for loan losses is provided in note 4 to the consolidated financial statements included under item 8 of this form 10-k.
liquidity risk management liquidity risk is defined as the potential that our financial condition or overall viability could be adversely affected by an actual or perceived inability to meet cash and collateral obligations. the goal of liquidity risk management is to maintain, even in the event of stress, our ability to meet our cash and collateral obligations.
liquidity is managed to meet our financial obligations in a timely and cost-effective manner, as well as maintain sufficient flexibility to fund strategic corporate initiatives as they arise. our effective management of liquidity involves the assessment of the potential mismatch between the future cash demands of our clients and our available sources of cash under both normal and adverse economic and business conditions.
we manage our liquidity on a global, consolidated basis. we also manage liquidity on a stand-alone basis at the parent company, as well as at certain branches and subsidiaries of state street bank. state street bank generally has access to markets and funding sources limited to banks, such as the federal funds market and the federal reserve's discount window. our parent company is managed to a more conservative liquidity profile, reflecting narrower market access. our parent company typically holds enough cash, primarily in the form of interest-bearing deposits or time deposits with its banking subsidiaries, to meet its current debt maturities and cash needs, as well as those projected over the next one-year period. as of december 31, 2015, the value of our parent company's net liquid assets totaled $5.73 billion, compared with $6.03 billion as of december 31, 2014. as of december 31, 2015, our parent company and state street bank have approximately $1.0 billion and $400 million, respectively, of senior and subordinated notes outstanding that will mature in the next twelve months.
based on our level of consolidated liquid assets and our ability to access the capital markets for additional funding when necessary, including our ability to issue debt and equity securities under our current universal shelf registration, management considers our overall liquidity as of december 31, 2015 to be sufficient to meet its current commitments and business needs, including accommodating the transaction and cash management needs of its clients.
governance global treasury is responsible for our management of liquidity. this includes the day-to-day management of our global liquidity position, the development and monitoring of early warning indicators, key liquidity risk metrics, the creation and execution of stress tests, the evaluation and implementation of regulatory requirements, the maintenance and execution of our liquidity guidelines and contingency funding plan, and routine management reporting to alco, mrac and the board's rc.
global treasury risk management, part of erm, provides separate oversight over the identification, communication, and management of global treasury's risks in support of our business strategy. global treasury risk management reports to the cro. global treasury risk management's responsibilities relative to liquidity risk management include the development and review of policies and guidelines; the monitoring of limits related to adherence to the liquidity risk guidelines and associated reporting.
liquidity framework our liquidity framework contemplates areas of potential risk based on our activities, size, and other appropriate risk-related factors. in managing liquidity risk we employ limits, maintain established metrics and early warning indicators, and perform routine stress testing to identify potential liquidity needs. this process involves the evaluation of a combination of internal and external scenarios which assist us in measuring our liquidity position and in identifying potential increases in cash needs or decreases in available sources of cash, as well as the potential impairment of our ability to access the global capital markets.
we manage liquidity according to several principles that are equally important to our overall liquidity risk management framework:
•   structural liquidity management addresses liquidity by monitoring and directing the composition of our consolidated statement of condition. structural liquidity is measured by metrics such as the percentage of total wholesale funds to consolidated total assets, and the percentage of non-government investment securities to client deposits. in
management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (continued)
addition, on a regular basis and as described below, our structural liquidity is evaluated under various stress scenarios.
•   tactical liquidity management addresses our day-to-day funding requirements and is largely driven by changes in our primary source of funding, which are client deposits. fluctuations in client deposits may be supplemented with short-term borrowings, which generally include commercial paper and certificates of deposit.
•   stress testing and contingent funding planning are longer-term strategic liquidity risk management practices. regular and ad hoc liquidity stress testing are performed under various severe but plausible scenarios at the consolidated level and at significant subsidiaries, including state street bank. these tests contemplate severe market and state street-specific events under various time horizons and severities. tests contemplate the impact of material changes in key funding sources, credit ratings, additional collateral requirements, contingent uses of funding, systemic shocks to the financial markets, and operational failures based on market and state street-specific assumptions. the stress tests evaluate the required level of funding versus available sources in an adverse environment. as stress testing contemplates potential forward-looking scenarios, results also serve as a trigger to activate specific liquidity stress levels and contingent funding actions.
cfps are designed to assist senior management with decision-making associated with any contingency funding response to a possible or actual crisis scenario. the cfps define roles, responsibilities and management actions to be taken in the event of deterioration of our liquidity profile caused by either a state street-specific event or a broader disruption in the capital markets. specific actions are linked to the level of stress indicated by these measures or by management judgment of market conditions.
liquidity risk metrics in managing our liquidity, we employ early warning indicators and metrics. early warning indicators are intended to detect situations which may result in a liquidity stress, including changes in our common stock price and the spread on our long-term debt. additional metrics that are critical to the management of our consolidated statement of condition and monitored as part of our routine liquidity management include measures of our fungible cash position, purchased wholesale funds, unencumbered liquid assets, deposits, and the total of investment securities and loans as a percentage of total client deposits.
asset liquidity central to the management of our liquidity is asset liquidity, which consists primarily of unencumbered highly liquid securities, cash and cash equivalents reported on our consolidated statement of condition. we restrict the eligibility of securities of asset liquidity to u.s. government and federal agency securities (including mortgage-backed securities), selected non-u.s. government and supranational securities as well as certain other high- quality securities which generally are more liquid than other types of assets even in times of stress. our asset liquidity metric is similar to the hqla under the u.s. lcr, and our hqla, under the lcr final rule definition, were estimated to be $109.39 billion and $115.58 billion as of december 31, 2015 and december 31, 2014, respectively.
table 32: components of hqla by type of asset
with respect to highly liquid short-term investments presented in the preceding table, due to the continued elevated level of client deposits as of december 31, 2015, we maintained cash balances in excess of regulatory requirements governing deposits with the federal reserve of approximately $66.06 billion at the federal reserve, the ecb and other non-u.s. central banks, compared to $85.18 billion as of december 31, 2014. the increase in investment securities as of december 31, 2015 compared to december 31, 2014, presented in the table, was mainly associated with repositioning the investment portfolio in light of the liquidity requirements of the lcr.
liquid securities carried in our asset liquidity include securities pledged without corresponding advances from the federal reserve bank of boston, or frb, the federal home loan bank of boston, or fhlb, and other non-u.s. central banks. state street bank is a member of the fhlb. this membership allows for advances of liquidity in varying terms against high-quality collateral, which helps facilitate asset-and-liability management.
access to primary, intra-day and contingent liquidity provided by these utilities is an important source of contingent liquidity with utilization subject to underlying conditions. as of december 31, 2015 and
management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (continued)
december 31, 2014, we had no outstanding primary credit borrowings from the frb discount window or any other central bank facility, and as of the same dates, no fhlb advances were outstanding.
in addition to the securities included in our asset liquidity, we have significant amounts of other unencumbered investment securities. the aggregate fair value of those securities was $41.00 billion as of december 31, 2015, compared to $60.06 billion as of december 31, 2014. these securities are available sources of liquidity, although not as rapidly deployed as those included in our asset liquidity.
measures of liquidity include lcr, nsfr and tlac which are described in "supervision and regulation" included under item 1, "business" of this form 10-k.
uses of liquidity significant uses of our liquidity could result from the following: withdrawals of client deposits; draw-downs of unfunded commitments to extend credit or to purchase securities, generally provided through lines of credit; and short-duration advance facilities. such circumstances would generally arise under stress conditions including deterioration in credit ratings. we had unfunded commitments to extend credit with gross contractual amounts totaling $22.58 billion and $24.25 billion as of december 31, 2015 and december 31, 2014, respectively. these amounts do not reflect the value of any collateral. as of december 31, 2015, approximately 76% of our unfunded commitments to extend credit expire within one year. since many of our commitments are expected to expire or renew without being drawn upon, the gross contractual amounts do not necessarily represent our future cash requirements.
funding deposits we provide products and services including custody, accounting, administration, daily pricing, foreign exchange services, cash management, financial asset management, securities finance and investment advisory services. as a provider of these products and services, we generate client deposits, which have generally provided a stable, low-cost source of funds. as a global custodian, clients place deposits with state street entities in various currencies. we invest these client deposits in a combination of investment securities and short-duration financial instruments whose mix is determined by the characteristics of the deposits.
for the past several years, we have experienced higher client deposit inflows toward the end of each fiscal quarter or the end of the fiscal year. as a result, we believe average client deposit balances are more reflective of ongoing funding than period-end balances.
(1)  balance as of december 31, 2015 and december 31, 2014 excluded term wholesale cds of $13.72 billion and $13.76 billion, respectively; average balances for the years ended december 31, 2015 and december 31, 2014 excluded average cds of $13.56 billion and $6.87 billion, respectively.
short-term funding our corporate commercial paper program had zero and $2.48 billion of commercial paper outstanding as of december 31, 2015 and december 31, 2014, respectively. state street phased-out its commercial paper program prior to december 31, 2015, consistent with the objectives of its 2015 recovery and resolution plan developed pursuant to the requirements of the dodd-frank act.
our on-balance sheet liquid assets are also an integral component of our liquidity management strategy. these assets provide liquidity through maturities of the assets, but more importantly, they provide us with the ability to raise funds by pledging the securities as collateral for borrowings or through outright sales. in addition, our access to the global capital markets gives us the ability to source incremental funding at reasonable rates of interest from wholesale investors. as discussed earlier under "asset liquidity," state street bank's membership in the fhlb allows for advances of liquidity with varying terms against high-quality collateral.
short-term secured funding also comes in the form of securities lent or sold under agreements to repurchase. these transactions are short-term in nature, generally overnight, and are collateralized by high-quality investment securities. these balances were $4.50 billion and $8.93 billion as of december 31, 2015 and december 31, 2014, respectively.
state street bank currently maintains a line of credit with a financial institution of cad $1.40 billion, or approximately $1.09 billion as of december 31, 2015, to support its canadian securities processing operations. the line of credit has no stated termination date and is cancelable by either party with prior notice. as of december 31, 2015, there was no balance outstanding on this line of credit.
management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (continued)
long-term funding as of december 31, 2015, state street bank had board authority to issue unsecured senior debt securities from time to time, provided that the aggregate principal amount of such unsecured senior debt outstanding at any one time does not exceed $5 billion. as of december 31, 2015, $5 billion was available for issuance pursuant to this authority. as of december 31, 2015, state street bank also had board authority to issue an additional $500 million of subordinated debt.
state street corporation maintains an effective universal shelf registration that allows for the public offering and sale of debt securities, capital securities, common stock, depositary shares and preferred stock, and warrants to purchase such securities, including any shares into which the preferred stock and depositary shares may be convertible, or any combination thereof. we have issued in the past, and we may issue in the future, securities pursuant to our shelf registration. the issuance of debt or equity securities will depend on future market conditions, funding needs and other factors.
agency credit ratings our ability to maintain consistent access to liquidity is fostered by the maintenance of high investment-grade ratings as measured by the major independent credit rating agencies. factors essential to maintaining high credit ratings include diverse and stable core earnings; relative market position; strong risk management; strong capital ratios; diverse liquidity sources, including the global capital markets and client deposits; strong liquidity monitoring procedures; and preparedness for current or future regulatory developments. high ratings limit borrowing costs and enhance our liquidity by providing assurance for unsecured funding and depositors, increasing the potential market for our debt and improving our ability to offer products, serve markets, and engage in transactions in which clients value high credit ratings. a downgrade or reduction of our credit ratings could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity by restricting our ability to access the capital markets, which could increase the related cost of funds. in turn, this could cause the sudden and large-scale withdrawal of unsecured deposits by our clients, which could lead to draw-downs of unfunded commitments to extend credit or trigger requirements under securities purchase commitments; or require additional collateral or force terminations of certain trading derivative contracts.
a majority of our derivative contracts have been entered into under bilateral agreements with counterparties who may require us to post collateral or terminate the transactions based on changes in our credit ratings. we assess the impact of these arrangements by determining the collateral or termination payments that would be required assuming a downgrade by all rating agencies. the additional collateral or termination payments related to our net derivative liabilities under these arrangements that could have been called by counterparties in the event of a downgrade in our credit ratings below levels specified in the agreements is disclosed in note 10 to the consolidated financial statements included under item 8 of this form 10-k. other funding sources, such as secured financing transactions and other margin requirements, for which there are no explicit triggers, could also be adversely affected.

management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (continued)
operational risk management overview we consider operational risk to be the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes and systems, human error, or from external events. operational risk encompasses fiduciary risk and legal risk. fiduciary risk is defined as the risk that state street fails to properly exercise its fiduciary duties in its provision of products or services to clients. legal risk is the risk of loss resulting from failure to comply with laws and contractual obligations as well as prudent ethical standards in business practices in addition to exposure to litigation from all aspects of the state street's activities.
operational risk is inherent in the performance of investment servicing and investment management activities on behalf of our clients. whether it be fiduciary risk, risk associated with execution and processing or other types of operational risk, a consistent, transparent and effective operational risk framework is key to identifying, monitoring and managing operational risk.
we have established an operational risk framework that is based on three major goals:
governance our board is responsible for the approval and oversight of our overall operational risk framework. it does so through its rc, which reviews our operational risk framework and approves our operational risk policy annually.
our operational risk policy establishes our approach to our management of operational risk across state street. the policy identifies the responsibilities of individuals and committees charged with oversight of the management of operational risk, and articulates a broad mandate that supports implementation of the operational risk framework.
erm and other control groups provide the oversight, validation and verification of the management and measurement of operational risk.
executive management actively manages and oversees our operational risk framework through membership on various risk management committees, including mrac, the bcrc, torc, the operational risk committee, the executive information security committee, and the fiduciary review committee, all of which ultimately report to the appropriate committee of the board.
the operational risk committee, chaired by the global head of operational risk, provides cross-
business oversight of operational risk and reviews and approves operational risk guidelines intended to maintain a consistent implementation of our corporate operational risk policy and framework.
ownership and accountability we have implemented our operational risk framework to support the broad mandate established by our operational risk policy. this framework represents an integrated set of processes and tools that assists us in the management and measurement of operational risk, including our calculation of required capital and rwa.
the framework takes a comprehensive view and integrates the methods and tools used to manage and measure operational risk. the framework utilizes aspects of the coso framework and other industry leading practices, and is designed foremost to address state street's risk management needs while complying with regulatory requirements. the operational risk framework is intended to provide a number of important benefits, including:
•   a common understanding of operational risk management and its supporting processes;
•   the clarification of responsibilities for the management of operational risk across state street;
•   the alignment of business priorities with risk management objectives;
•   the active management of risk and early identification of emerging risks;
•   the consistent application of policies and the collection of data for risk management and measurement; and
•   the estimation of our operational risk capital requirement.
the operational risk framework employs a distributed risk management infrastructure executed by erm groups aligned with the business units, which are responsible for the implementation of the operational risk framework at the business unit level.
as with other risks, senior business unit management is responsible for the day-to-day operational risk management of their respective businesses. it is business unit management's responsibility to provide oversight of the implementation and ongoing execution of the operational risk framework within their respective organizations, as well as coordination and communication with erm.
consistency and transparency a number of corporate control functions are directly responsible for implementing and assessing various aspects of state street's operational risk framework, with the overarching goal of consistency
management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (continued)
and transparency to meet the evolving needs of the business:
•   the global head of operational risk, a member of the cro's executive management team, leads erm's corporate orm group. orm is responsible for the strategy, evolution and consistent implementation of our operational risk guidelines, framework and supporting tools across state street. orm reviews and analyzes operational key risk information, events, metrics and indicators at the business unit and corporate level for purposes of risk management, reporting and escalation to the cro, senior management and governance committees;
•   erm's corporate risk analytics group develops and maintains operational risk capital estimation models, and erm's operations group calculates state street's required capital for operational risk;
•   erm's mvg independently validates the quantitative models used to measure operational risk, and orm performs validation checks on the output of the model;
•   cis establishes the framework, policies and related programs to measure, monitor and report on information security risks, including the effectiveness of cyber security program protections.
cis defines and manages the enterprise-wide information security program. cis coordinates with information technology, control functions and business units to support the confidentiality, integrity and availability of corporate information assets. cis identifies and employs a risk-based methodology consistent with applicable regulatory cyber security requirements and monitors the compliance of our systems with information security policies; and
•   corporate audit performs separate reviews of the application of operational risk management practices and methodologies utilized across state street.
our operational risk framework consists of five components, each described below, which provide a working structure that integrates distinct risk programs into a continuous process focused on managing and measuring operational risk in a coordinated and consistent manner.
risk identification, assessment and measurement the objective of risk identification, assessment and measurement is to understand business unit strategy, risk profile and potential exposures. it is achieved through a series of risk assessments across state street using techniques for the identification, assessment and measurement of risk across a spectrum of potential frequency and severity combinations. three primary risk assessment programs, which occur annually, augmented by other business-specific programs, are the core of this component:
•   the rcsa program seeks to understand the risks associated with day-to-day activities, and the effectiveness of controls intended to manage potential exposures arising from these activities. these risks are typically frequent in nature but generally not severe in terms of exposure;
•   the material risk identification process utilizes a bottom-up approach to identify state street's most significant risk exposures across all on- and off-balance sheet risk-taking activities. the program is specifically designed to consider risks that could have a material impact irrespective of their likelihood or frequency. this can include risks that may have an impact on longer-term business objectives, such as significant change management activities or long-term strategic initiatives;
•   the scenario analysis program focuses on the set of risks with the highest severity and most relevance from a capital perspective. these are generally referred to as "tail risks," and serve as important benchmarks for our loss distribution approach model (see below); they also provide inputs into stress testing; and
•   business-specific programs to identify, assess and measure risk, including new business and product review and approval, new client screening, and, as deemed appropriate, targeted risk assessments.
the primary measurement tool used is an internally developed loss distribution approach model, referred to as the lda model. we use the lda model to quantify required operational risk capital, from which we calculate rwa related to operational risk. such required capital and rwa totaled $43.88 billion as of december 31, 2015; refer to the "capital" section of this management's discussion and analysis.
the lda model incorporates the four required operational risk elements described below:
•   internal loss event data is collected from across state street in conformity with our operating loss policy that establishes the requirements for collecting and reporting individual loss events. we categorize the
management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (continued)
data into seven basel-defined event types and further subdivide the data by business unit, as deemed appropriate. each of these loss events are represented in a uom which is used to estimate a specific amount of capital required for the types of loss events that fall into each specific category. some uoms are measured at the corporate level because they are not "business specific," such as damage to physical assets, where the cause of an event is not primarily driven by the behavior of a single business unit. internal losses of $500 or greater are captured, analyzed and included in the modeling approach. loss event data is collected using a corporate-wide data collection tool, which stores the data in a loss event data repository, referred to as the ledr, to support processes related to analysis, management reporting and the calculation of required capital. internal loss event data provides state street-specific frequency and severity information to our capital calculation process for historical loss events experienced by state street.
•   external loss event data provides information with respect to loss event severity from other financial institutions to inform our capital estimation process of events in similar business units at other banking organizations. this information supplements the data pool available for use in our lda model. assessments of the sufficiency of internal data and the relevance of external data are completed before pooling the two data sources for use in our lda model.
•   scenario analysis workshops are conducted annually across state street to inform management of the less frequent but most severe, or "tail," risks that the organization faces. the workshops are attended by senior business unit managers, other support and control partners and business-aligned risk management staff. the workshops are designed to capture information about the significant risks and to estimate potential exposures for individual risks should a loss event occur. workshops are aligned with specific uoms and business units where appropriate. the results of these workshops are used to benchmark our lda model results to determine that our calculation of required capital considers relevant risk-related information.
•   business environment and internal control factors are gathered as part of our scenario analysis program to inform the scenario analysis workshop participants of internal loss event data and business-relevant metrics, such as rcsa results, along with industry loss event data and case studies where appropriate. business environment and internal control factors are those characteristics of a bank's internal and external operating environment that bear an exposure to operational risk. the use of this information indirectly influences our calculation of required capital by providing additional relevant data to workshop participants when reviewing specific uom risks.
monitoring the objective of risk monitoring is to proactively monitor the changing business environment and corresponding operational risk exposure. it is achieved through a series of quantitative and qualitative monitoring tools that are designed to allow us to understand changes in the business environment, internal control factors, risk metrics, risk assessments, exposures and operating effectiveness, as well as details of loss events and progress on risk initiatives implemented to mitigate potential risk exposures.
effectiveness and testing the objective of effectiveness and testing is to verify that internal controls are designed appropriately, are consistent with corporate and regulatory standards, and are operating effectively. it is achieved through a series of assessments by both internal and external parties, including corporate audit, independent registered public accounting firms, business self-assessments and other control function reviews, such as a sarbanes-oxley testing program.
consistent with our standard model validation process, the operational risk lda model is subject to a detailed review, overseen by the mrc. in addition, the model is subject to a rigorous internal governance process. all changes to the model or input parameters, and the deployment of model updates, are reviewed and approved by the operational risk committee, which has oversight responsibility for the model, with technical input from the mrc.
reporting operational risk reporting is intended to provide transparency, thereby enabling management to manage risk, provide oversight and escalate issues in a timely manner. it is designed to allow the business units, executive management, and the board's control functions and committees to gain insight into activities that may result in risks and potential exposures. reports are intended to identify business activities that are experiencing processing issues, whether or
management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (continued)
not they result in actual loss events. reporting includes results of monitoring activities, internal and external examinations, regulatory reviews, and control assessments. these elements combine in a manner designed to provide a view of potential and emerging risks facing state street and information that details its progress on managing risks.
documentation and guidelines documentation and guidelines allow for consistency and repeatability of the various processes that support the operational risk framework across state street.
operational risk guidelines document our practices and describe the key elements in a business unit's operational risk management program. the purpose of the guidelines is to set forth and define key operational risk terms, provide further detail on state street's operational risk programs, and detail the business units' responsibilities to identify, assess, measure, monitor and report operational risk. the guideline supports our operational risk policy.
data standards have been established to maintain consistent data repositories and systems that are controlled, accurate and available on a timely basis to support operational risk management.
market risk management market risk is defined by u.s. banking regulators as the risk of loss that could result from broad market movements, such as changes in the general level of interest rates, credit spreads, foreign exchange rates or commodity prices. we are exposed to market risk in both our trading and certain of our non-trading, or asset-and-liability management, activities.
information about the market risk associated with our trading activities is provided below under "trading activities." information about the market risk associated with our non-trading activities, which consists primarily of interest-rate risk, is provided below under "asset-and-liability management activities."
trading activities in the conduct of our trading activities, we assume market risk, the level of which is a function of our overall risk appetite, business objectives and liquidity needs, our clients' requirements and market volatility, and our execution against those factors.
we engage in trading activities primarily to support our clients' needs and to contribute to our overall corporate earnings and liquidity. in connection with certain of these trading activities, we enter into a variety of derivative financial instruments to support our clients' needs and to manage our interest-rate and currency risk. these activities are generally intended to generate trading services revenue and to manage potential earnings volatility. in addition, we provide services related to derivatives in our role as both a manager and a servicer of financial assets.
our clients use derivatives to manage the financial risks associated with their investment goals and business activities. with the growth of cross-border investing, our clients often enter into foreign exchange forward contracts to convert currency for international investments and to manage the currency risk in their international investment portfolios. as an active participant in the foreign exchange markets, we provide foreign exchange forward and option contracts in support of these client needs, and also act as a dealer in the currency markets.
as part of our trading activities, we assume positions in the foreign exchange and interest-rate markets by buying and selling cash instruments and entering into derivative instruments, including foreign exchange forward contracts, foreign exchange and interest-rate options and interest-rate swaps, interest-rate forward contracts, and interest-rate futures. as of december 31, 2015, the notional amount of these derivative contracts was $1.29 trillion, of which $1.28 trillion was composed of foreign exchange forward, swap and spot contracts. we seek to match positions closely with the objective of minimizing related currency and interest-rate risk. all foreign exchange contracts are valued daily at current market rates.
governance our assumption of market risk in our trading activities is an integral part of our corporate risk appetite. our board reviews and oversees our management of market risk, including the approval of key market risk policies and the receipt and review of regular market risk reporting, as well as periodic updates on selected market risk topics.
the previously described tmrc (refer to "risk committees") oversees all market risk-taking activities across state street associated with trading. the tmrc, which reports to mrac, is composed of members of erm, our global markets business and our global treasury group, as well as our senior executives who manage our trading businesses and other members of management who possess specialized knowledge and expertise. the tmrc meets regularly to monitor the management of our trading market risk activities.
our business units identify, actively manage and are responsible for the market risks inherent in their businesses. a dedicated market risk management group within erm, and other groups within erm, work with those business units to assist them in the identification, assessment, monitoring, management and control of market risk, and assist business unit managers with their market risk management and measurement activities. erm provides an additional line of oversight, support and coordination designed
management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (continued)
to promote the consistent identification, measurement and management of market risk across business units, separate from those business units' discrete activities.
the erm market risk management group is responsible for the management of corporate-wide market risk, the monitoring of key market risks and the development and maintenance of market risk management policies, guidelines, and standards aligned with our corporate risk appetite. this group also establishes and approves market risk tolerance limits and trading authorities based on, but not limited to, measures of notional amounts, sensitivity, var and stress. such limits and authorities are specified in our trading and market risk guidelines which govern our management of trading market risk.
corporate audit separately assesses the design and operating effectiveness of the market risk controls within our business units and erm. other related responsibilities of corporate audit include the periodic review of erm and business unit compliance with market risk policies, guidelines, and corporate standards, as well as relevant regulatory requirements. we are subject to regular monitoring, reviews and supervisory exams of our market risk function by the federal reserve. in addition, we are regulated by, among others, the sec, the financial industry regulatory authority and the u.s. commodities futures trading commission.
risk appetite our corporate market risk appetite is specified in policy statements that outline the governance, responsibilities and requirements surrounding the identification, measurement, analysis, management and communication of market risk arising from our trading activities. these policy statements also set forth the market risk control framework to monitor, support, manage and control this portion of our risk appetite. all groups involved in the management and control of market risk associated with trading activities are required to comply with the qualitative and quantitative elements of these policy statements. our trading market risk control framework is composed of the following components:
•   a trading market risk management process led by erm, separate from the business units' discrete activities;
•   clearly defined responsibilities and authorities for the primary groups involved in trading market risk management;
•   a trading market risk measurement methodology that captures correlation effects and allows aggregation of market risk across risk types, markets and business lines;
•   daily monitoring, analysis, and reporting of market risk exposures associated with trading activities against market risk limits;
•   a defined limit structure and escalation process in the event of a market risk limit excess;
•   use of var models to measure the one-day market risk exposure of trading positions;
•   use of var as a ten-day-based regulatory capital measure of the market risk exposure of trading positions;
•   use of non-var-based limits and other controls;
•   use of stressed-var models, stress-testing analysis and scenario analysis to support the trading market risk measurement and management process by assessing how portfolios and global business lines perform under extreme market conditions;
•   use of back-testing as a diagnostic tool to assess the accuracy of var models and other risk management techniques; and
•   a new product approval process that requires market risk teams to assess trading-related market risks and apply risk tolerance limits to proposed new products and business activities.
we use our cap to assess our overall capital and liquidity in relation to our risk profile and provide a comprehensive strategy for maintaining appropriate capital and liquidity levels. with respect to market risk associated with trading activities, our risk management and our calculations of regulatory and economic capital are based primarily on our internal var models and stress testing analysis. as discussed in detail under "value-at-risk" below, var is measured daily by erm.
the tmrc oversees our market risk exposure in relation to limits established within our risk appetite framework. these limits define threshold levels for var- and stressed var-based measures and are applicable to all trading positions subject to regulatory capital requirements. these limits are designed to prevent any undue concentration of market risk exposure, in light of the primarily non-proprietary nature of our trading activities. the risk appetite framework and associated limits are reviewed and approved by the board's rc.
management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (continued)
covered positions our trading positions are subject to regulatory market risk capital requirements if they meet the regulatory definition of a "covered position." a covered position is generally defined by u.s. banking regulators as an on- or off-balance sheet position associated with the organization's trading activities that is free of any restrictions on its tradability, but does not include intangible assets, certain credit derivatives recognized as guarantees and certain equity positions not publicly traded. all fx and commodity positions are considered covered positions, regardless of the accounting treatment they receive. the identification of covered positions for inclusion in our market risk capital framework is governed by our covered positions policy, which outlines the standards we use to determine whether a trading position is a covered position.
our covered positions consist primarily of the trading portfolios held by our global markets business. they also arise from certain positions held by our global treasury group. these trading positions include products such as spot foreign exchange, foreign exchange forwards, non-deliverable forwards, foreign exchange options, foreign exchange funding swaps, currency futures, financial futures, and interest rate futures. new activities are analyzed to determine if the positions arising from such new activities meet the definition of a covered position and conform to our covered positions policy. this documented analysis, including any decisions with respect to market risk treatments, must receive approval from the tmrc.
we use spot rates, forward points, yield curves and discount factors imported from third-party sources to measure the value of our covered positions, and we use such values to mark our covered positions to market on a daily basis. these values are subject to separate validation by us in order to evaluate reasonableness and consistency with market experience. the mark-to-market gain or loss on spot transactions is calculated by applying the spot rate to the foreign currency principal and comparing the resultant base currency amount to the original transaction principal. the mark-to-market gain or loss on a forward foreign exchange contract or forward cash flow contract is determined as the difference between the life-to-date (historical) value of the cash flow and the value of the cash flow at the inception of the transaction. the mark-to-market gain or loss on interest-rate swaps is determined by discounting the future cash flows from each leg of the swap transaction.
value-at-risk, stress testing and stressed var as noted above, we use a variety of risk measurement tools and methodologies, including var, which is an estimate of potential loss for a given period within a stated statistical confidence interval. we use a risk measurement methodology to measure trading-related var daily. we have adopted standards for measuring trading-related var, and we maintain regulatory capital for market risk associated with our trading activities in conformity with currently applicable bank regulatory market risk requirements.
we utilize an internal var model to calculate our regulatory market risk capital requirements. we use a historical simulation model to calculate daily var- and stressed var-based measures for our covered positions in conformity with regulatory requirements. our var model seeks to capture identified material risk factors associated with our covered positions, including risks arising from market movements such as changes in foreign exchange rates, interest rates and option-implied volatilities.
we have adopted standards and guidelines to value our covered positions which govern our var- and stressed var-based measures. our regulatory var-based measure is calculated based on historical volatilities of market risk factors during a two-year observation period calibrated to a one-tail, 99% confidence interval and a ten-business-day holding period. we also use the same platform to calculate a one-tail, 99% confidence interval, one-business-day var for internal risk management purposes. a 99% one-tail confidence interval implies that daily trading losses are not expected to exceed the estimated var more than 1% of the time, or less than three business days out of a year.
our market risk models, including our var model, are subject to change in connection with the governance, validation and back-testing processes described below. these models can change as a result of changes in our business activities, our historical experiences, market forces and events, regulations and regulatory interpretations and other factors. in addition, the models are subject to continuing regulatory review and approval. changes in our models may result in changes in our measurements of our market risk exposures, including var, and related measures, including regulatory capital. these changes could result in material changes in those risk measurements and related measures as calculated and compared from period to period.
value-at-risk var measures are based on the most recent two years of historical price movements for instruments and related risk factors to which we have exposure. the instruments in question are limited to foreign exchange spot, forward and options contracts and interest-rate contracts, including futures and interest-rate swaps. historically, these instruments
management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (continued)
have exhibited a higher degree of liquidity relative to other available capital markets instruments. as a result, the var measures shown reflect our ability to rapidly adjust exposures in highly dynamic markets. for this reason, risk inventory, in the form of net open positions, across all currencies is typically limited. in addition, long and short positions in major, as well as minor, currencies provide risk offsets that limit our potential downside exposure.
our var methodology uses a historical simulation approach based on market-observed changes in foreign exchange rates, u.s. and non-u.s. interest rates and implied volatilities, and incorporates the resulting diversification benefits provided from the mix of our trading positions. our var model incorporates approximately 5,000 risk factors and includes correlations among currency, interest rates, and other market rates.
all var measures are subject to limitations and must be interpreted accordingly. some, but not all, of the limitations of our var methodology include the following:
•   compared to a shorter observation period, a two-year observation period is slower to reflect increases in market volatility (although temporary increases in market volatility will affect the calculation of var for a longer period); consequently, in periods of sudden increases in volatility or increasing volatility, in each case relative to the prior two-year period, the calculation of var may understate current risk;
•   compared to a longer observation period, a two-year observation period may not reflect as many past periods of volatility in the markets, because such past volatility is no longer in the observation period; consequently, historical market scenarios of high volatility, even if similar to current or likely future market circumstances, may fall outside the two-year observation period, resulting in a potential understatement of current risk;
•   the var-based measure is calibrated to a specified level of confidence and does not indicate the potential magnitude of losses beyond this confidence level;
•   in certain cases, var-based measures approximate the impact of changes in risk factors on the values of positions and portfolios; this may happen because the number of inputs included in the var model is necessarily limited; for example, yield curve risk factors do not exist for all future dates;
•   the use of historical market information may not be predictive of future events, particularly those that are extreme in nature; this "backward-looking" limitation can cause var to understate or overstate risk;
•   the effect of extreme and rare market movements is difficult to estimate; this may result from non-linear risk sensitivities as well as the potential for actual volatility and correlation levels to differ from assumptions implicit in the var calculations; and
•   intra-day risk is not captured.
stress testing and stressed var we have a corporate-wide stress testing program in place that incorporates an array of techniques to measure the potential loss we could suffer in a hypothetical scenario of adverse economic and financial conditions. we also monitor concentrations of risk such as concentration by branch, risk component, and currency pairs. we conduct stress testing on a daily basis based on selected historical stress events that are relevant to our positions in order to estimate the potential impact to our current portfolio should similar market conditions recur, and we also perform stress testing as part of the federal reserve's ccar process. stress testing is conducted, analyzed and reported at the corporate, trading desk, division and risk-factor level (for example, exchange risk, interest-rate risk and volatility risk).
we calculate a stressed var-based measure using the same model we use to calculate var, but with model inputs calibrated to historical data from a range of continuous twelve-month periods that reflect significant financial stress. the stressed var model identifies the second-worst outcome occurring in the worst continuous one-year rolling period since july 2007. this stressed var meets the regulatory requirement as the rolling ten-day period with an outcome that is worse than 99% of other outcomes during that twelve-month period of financial stress. for each portfolio, the stress period is determined algorithmically by seeking the one-year time horizon that produces the largest ten-business-day var from within the available historical data. this historical data set includes the financial crisis of 2008, the highly volatile period surrounding the eurozone sovereign debt crisis and the standard & poor's downgrade of u.s. treasury debt in august 2011. as the historical data set used to determine the stress period expands over time, future market stress events will be automatically incorporated.

conditions recur. relevant scenarios are chosen from an inventory of historical financial stresses and applied to our current portfolio. these historical event scenarios involve spot foreign exchange, credit, equity, unforeseen geo-political events and natural disasters, and government and central bank intervention scenarios. examples of the specific historical scenarios we incorporate in our stress testing program may include the asian financial crisis of 1997, the september 11, 2001 terrorist attacks in the u.s., and the 2008 financial crisis. we continue to update our inventory of historical stress scenarios as new stress conditions emerge in the financial markets.
as each of the historical stress events is associated with a different time horizon, we normalize results by scaling down the longer horizon events to a ten-day horizon and keeping the shorter horizon events (i.e., events that are shorter than ten days) at their original terms. we also conduct sensitivity analysis daily to calculate the impact of a large predefined shock in a specific risk factor or a group of risk factors on our current portfolio. these predefined shocks include parallel and non-parallel yield curve shifts and foreign exchange spot and volatility surface shifts. in a parallel shift scenario, we apply a constant factor shift across all yield curve tenors. in a non-parallel shift scenario, we apply different shock levels to different tenors of a yield curve, rather than shifting the entire curve by a constant amount. non-parallel shifts include steepening, flattening and butterflies.
stress testing results and limits are actively monitored on a daily basis by erm and reported to the tmrc. limit breaches are addressed by erm risk managers in conjunction with the business units, escalated as appropriate, and reviewed by the tmrc if material. in addition, we have established several action triggers that prompt immediate review by management and the implementation of a remediation plan.
validation and back-testing we perform frequent back-testing to assess the accuracy of our var-based model in estimating loss at the stated confidence level. this back-testing involves the comparison of estimated var model outputs to daily, actual profit-and-loss outcomes, or p&l, observed from daily market movements. we back-test our var model using "clean" p&l, which excludes non-trading revenue such as fees, commissions and net interest revenue, as well as estimated revenue from intra-day trading. our var definition of trading losses excludes items that are not specific to the price movement of the trading assets and liabilities themselves, such as fees, commissions, changes to reserves and gains or losses from intra-day activity.
we experienced one back-testing exception in 2015, which occurred in the third quarter. the trading p&l that day exceeded the var based on the prior day's closing positions, following a large depreciation in the u.s. dollar against several major and emerging market currencies, which depreciation can be attributed to a decision and related statements by the federal reserve's federal open market committee to hold interest rates at current levels. we experienced no back-testing exceptions for the full-year of 2014.
our market risk models are governed by our model risk governance guidelines, in conformity with our model risk governance policy. our market risk models are subject to regular review and validation by mvg within erm and overseen by the mrc. additional information about the mrc and mvg is provided under "model risk management" in this disclosure.
as part of its responsibilities, the mrc evaluates model soundness by assessing the quality of the model design and construction, as well as reviewing documentation and empirical evidence supporting the methods used for the model based on the recommendations of mvg. in addition, the mrc considers technical modeling issues for our market risk models, including the selection of an appropriate modeling approach, the setting of key model input assumptions, the deployment of substantive model changes, the deployment of new models as needed, and the monitoring of ongoing model performance.
consistent with regulatory requirements, our market risk regulatory capital models are subject to an annual review process and a validation schedule with frequency based on the model tier. mvg conducts the periodic reviews and validations of our market risk models, and their process identifies the areas of model risk for the three model components (input, processing and output), model implementation, and ongoing monitoring. model testing is concentrated in the areas of model risk identified by mvg. mvg is responsible for the results of this annual review or validation, and for determining whether a model should be approved for a desired use. mvg communicates their result as one of the following three outcomes: "approved", "approved with conditions", or "not approved".
our model validation process also evaluates the integrity of our var models through the use of regular outcome analysis. such outcome analysis includes back-testing, which compares the var model's predictions to actual outcomes using out-of-sample information. mvg examined back testing results for the market risk regulatory capital model used for
management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (continued)
2012. consistent with regulatory guidance, the back-testing compared "clean" p&l, defined above, with the one-day var produced by the model. the back-testing was performed for a time period not used for model development. the number of occurrences where "clean" trading-book p&l exceeded the one-day var was within our expected var tolerance level.
market risk reporting our erm market risk management group is responsible for market risk monitoring and reporting. we use a variety of systems and controlled market feeds from third-party services to compile data for several daily, weekly, and monthly management reports.
our business units and trading market risk teams review daily p&l, market risk limit exceptions, open positions, interest-rate and option sensitivities and var reports on a daily basis. market risk limit exceptions are also reported to and reviewed by the global head of market risk. we produce and review several other reports that summarize relevant market risk metrics, including var, on a periodic basis.
the following tables present var and stressed var associated with our trading activities for covered positions held during the years ended december 31, 2015 and 2014, and as of december 31, 2015 and december 31, 2014, as measured by our var methodology.

the twelve month average of our stressed var-based measure was approximately $63 million for the period ended december 31, 2015, compared to a twelve month average of approximately $62 million for the period ended december 31, 2014.
the increase in the twelve month average of our stressed var-based measure for the period ended december 31, 2015, compared to the period ended december 31, 2014, was primarily the result of an extension of the tenor of fx swaps used by global treasury designed to improve our liquidity position. although the fx swaps are not considered part of our trading activity, all fx activity (trading or banking) generates market risk captured under basel rules. the tenor extension gives rise to additional market risk in our stressed var calculation.
the var-based measures presented in the preceding tables are primarily a reflection of the overall level of market volatility and our appetite for trading market risk. overall levels of volatility have been low both on an absolute basis and relative to the historical information observed at the beginning of the period used for the calculations. both the ten-day var-based measures and the stressed var-based measures are based on historical changes observed during rolling ten-day periods for the portfolios as of the close of business each day over the past one-year period.
we may in the future modify and adjust our models and methodologies used to calculate var and stressed var, subject to regulatory review and approval, and these modifications and adjustments may result in changes in our var-based and stressed var-based measures.

the following tables present the var and stressed-var associated with our trading activities attributable to foreign exchange risk, interest-rate risk and volatility risk as of december 31, 2015 and december 31, 2014. the totals of the var-based and stressed var-based measures for the three attributes for each var and stressed-var component exceeded the related total var and total stressed var presented in the foregoing tables as of each period-end, primarily due to the benefits of diversification across risk types.

(1) for purposes of risk attribution by component, in both tables 39 and 40,  foreign exchange refers only to the risk from market movements in period-end rates.  forwards, futures, options and swaps with maturities greater than period-end have embedded interest-rate risk that is captured by the measures used for interest-rate risk.  accordingly, the interest-rate risk embedded in these foreign exchange instruments is included in the interest-rate risk component.
the decline in the total ten-day var based measure as of december 31, 2015, as compared to december 31, 2014, is the result of a decline in exposure that arose from the tenor extension strategy initiated by global treasury late last year.
asset-and-liability management activities the primary objective of asset-and-liability management is to provide sustainable nir, under varying economic conditions, while protecting the economic value of the assets and liabilities carried in our consolidated statement of condition from the adverse effects of changes in interest rates. while many market factors affect the level of nir and the economic value of our assets and liabilities, one of the most significant factors is our exposure to movements in interest rates. most of our nir is earned from the investment of client deposits generated by our businesses. we invest these client deposits in assets that conform generally to the characteristics of our balance sheet liabilities, including the currency composition of our significant non-u.s. dollar denominated client liabilities, but we manage our overall interest-rate risk position in the context of current and anticipated market conditions and within internally-approved risk guidelines.
our overall interest-rate risk position is maintained within a series of policies approved by the board and guidelines established and monitored by alco. our global treasury group has responsibility for managing our day-to-day interest-rate risk. to effectively manage our consolidated statement of condition and related nir, global treasury has the authority to assume a limited amount of interest-rate risk based on market conditions and its views about the direction of global interest rates over both short-term and long-term time horizons. global treasury manages our exposure to changes in interest rates on a consolidated basis organized into three regional treasury units, north america, europe and asia/pacific, to reflect the growing, global nature of our exposures and to capture the impact of changes in regional market environments on our total risk position.
the economic value of our consolidated statement of condition is a metric designed to estimate the fair value of assets and liabilities which could be garnered if those assets and liabilities were sold immediately. the economic values represent discounted cash flows from all financial instruments; therefore, changes in the yield curves, which are used to discount the cash flows, affect the values of these instruments.
our investment activities and our use of derivative financial instruments are the primary tools used in managing interest-rate risk. we invest in financial instruments with currency, repricing, and maturity characteristics we consider appropriate to manage our overall interest-rate risk position. in addition, we use certain derivative instruments, primarily interest-rate swaps, to alter the interest-rate
management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (continued)
characteristics of specific balance sheet assets or liabilities.
because no one individual measure can accurately assess all of our exposures to changes in interest rates, we use several quantitative measures in our assessment of current and potential future exposures to changes in interest rates and their impact on nir and balance sheet values. nir simulation is the primary tool used in our evaluation of the potential range of possible nir results that could occur under a variety of interest-rate environments. we also use market valuation and duration analysis to assess changes in the economic value of balance sheet assets and liabilities caused by assumed changes in interest rates.
to measure, monitor, and report on our interest-rate risk position, we use nir simulation, referred to as nir-at-risk, and eve sensitivity. nir-at-risk measures the impact on nir over the next twelve months to immediate, or "rate shock," and gradual, or "rate ramp," changes in market interest rates. eve sensitivity is a total return view of interest-rate risk, which measures the impact on the present value of all nir-related principal and interest cash flows of an immediate change in interest rates. although nir-at-risk and eve sensitivity measure interest-rate risk over different time horizons, both utilize consistent assumptions when modeling the positions currently held by state street; however, nir-at-risk also incorporates future actions planned by management over the time horizons being modeled.
in estimating our nir-at-risk, we start with a base amount of nir that is projected over the next twelve months, assuming our forecast yield curve over the period. our existing balance sheet assets and liabilities are adjusted by the amount and timing of transactions that are forecast to occur over the next twelve months. that yield curve is then "shocked," or moved immediately, +/-100 basis points in a parallel fashion at all points along the yield curve. two new twelve-month nir projections are then developed using the same balance sheet and forecast transactions, but with the new yield curves, and compared to the base scenario. we also perform the calculations using interest-rate ramps, which are +/-100-basis-point changes in interest rates that are assumed to occur gradually over the next twelve months, rather than immediately as we do with interest-rate shocks.
eve is based on the change in the present value of all nir-related principal and interest cash flows for changes in market interest rates. the present value of existing cash flows with a then-current yield curve serves as the base case. we then apply an immediate parallel shock to that yield curve of +/-200 basis points and recalculate the cash flows and related present values. a large shock is used to better capture the embedded option risk in our mortgage-backed securities that results from borrowers' prepayment opportunities.
key assumptions used in the models, described in more detail below, along with changes in market conditions, are inherently uncertain. actual results necessarily differ from model results as market conditions differ from assumptions. as such, management performs back-testing, stress testing, and model integrity analyses to validate that the modeled results produce predictive nir-at-risk and eve sensitivity estimates which can be used in our management of interest-rate risk. primary factors affecting the actual results include changes in our balance sheet size and mix, the timing, magnitude and frequency of changes in interest rates (including the slope and the relationship between the interest-rate level of u.s. dollar and non-u.s. dollar yield curves), changes in market conditions and management actions taken in response to the preceding conditions.
both nir-at-risk and eve sensitivity results are managed against alco-approved limits and guidelines and are monitored regularly, along with other relevant simulations, scenario analyses and stress tests, by both global treasury and alco. our alco-approved guidelines are, we believe, in line with industry standards and are periodically examined by the federal reserve.
as a result of differences in measurement between nir-at-risk and eve with respect to certain assumptions, such as the reinvestment of our interest-earning assets, reported results of nir-at-risk could present an increase in nir from an increase in rates while eve presents a loss. changes in assumptions may result in different outcomes under both nir-at-risk and eve. nir-at-risk depicts the change in the nominal (un-discounted) dollar net interest flows which are generated from the forecast statement of condition over the next twelve months.  as interest rates increase, the interest expense associated with our client deposit liabilities is assumed to increase at a slower pace than the investment returns derived from our current balance sheet or the associated reinvestment of our interest-earning assets, resulting in an overall increase to nir. eve, on the other hand, measures the present value change of both principal and interest cash flows based on the current period-end balance sheet. as a result, eve does not contemplate reinvestment of our assets associated with a change in the interest-rate environment.
although nir in both nir-at-risk and eve sensitivity is higher in response to increased interest rates, the future principal flows from fixed-rate
management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (continued)
investments are discounted for eve, which results in lower asset values and a corresponding reduction or loss in eve. as noted above, nir-at-risk does not analyze changes in the value of principal cash flows and therefore does not experience the same reduction experienced by eve sensitivity associated with discounting principal cash flows at higher rates.
net interest revenue at risk nir-at-risk is designed to estimate the potential impact of changes in global market interest rates on nir in the short term. the impact of changes in market rates on nir is measured against a baseline nir which encompasses management's expectations regarding the evolving balance sheet volumes and interest rates in the near-term. the goal is to achieve an acceptable level of nir under various interest-rate environments. assumptions regarding levels of client deposits and our ability to price these deposits under various rate environments have a significant impact on the results of the nir simulations. similarly, the timing of cash flows from our investment portfolio, especially option-embedded financial instruments like mortgage-backed securities, and our ability to replace these cash flows in line with management's expectations, can affect the results of nir simulations.
the following table presents the estimated exposure of our nir for the next twelve months, calculated as of the dates indicated, due to an immediate and gradual +/-100-basis-point shift to our internal forecast of global interest rates. we manage our nir sensitivity to limit declines to 15% or less from baseline nir. estimated exposures presented below are dependent on management's assumptions, and do not reflect any additional actions management may undertake in order to mitigate some of the adverse effects of changes in interest rates on our financial performance.

as of december 31, 2015, nir sensitivity to an upward-100-basis-point shock to our internal forecast of global interest rates, increased compared to such sensitivity as of december 31, 2014, on a dollar exposure basis as well as a percentage of twelve-month forecasted base nir, reflecting slower client deposit repricing expectations in the twelve-month forecast horizon beyond december 31, 2015. the benefit to nir of an upward-100-basis-point ramp is less significant than a shock, since interest rates are assumed to increase gradually.
nir sensitivity to a downward-100-basis-point shock to our internal forecast of global interest rates as of december 31, 2015 decreased compared to such sensitivity as of december 31, 2014 on a dollar and percentage basis, primarily due to higher expected deposit charges when rates decline. december 31, 2015 nir-at-risk sensitivities incorporate additional charges on deposits as rates decline to their floors compared to december 31, 2014 nir-at-risk. a downward-100-basis-point shock in global interest rates places pressure on nir due to declining deposit rates, providing limited funding relief on the liability side, while many assets continue to re-price in the lower-rate environment. the adverse impact on projected nir due to a downward-100-basis-point ramp is less significant than a shock since interest rates are assumed to decrease gradually, thereby reducing the level of projected spread compression experienced between assets and liabilities over a twelve-month horizon.
our baseline nir incorporates an expectation that short-term interest rates will begin to rise in anticipation of central bank tightening of current monetary policies. while this rise in rates benefits our baseline nir, it is detrimental to our nir sensitivity to a downward-100-basis-point shock, as rising short-term interest rates allow asset yields to re-price lower in a downward shock scenario than previously, while deposits are still priced close to natural floors.
other important factors which affect the levels of nir are the size and mix of assets carried in our consolidated statement of condition; interest-rate spreads; the slope and interest-rate level of u.s. and non-u.s. dollar yield curves and the relationship between them; the pace of change in global market interest rates; and management actions taken in response to the preceding conditions.
economic value of equity eve sensitivity measures changes in the market value of equity to quantify potential losses to shareholders due to an immediate +/-200-basis-point rate shock compared to current interest-rate levels if the balance sheet were liquidated immediately. management compares the change in eve sensitivity against state street's aggregate tier 1 and tier 2 risk-based capital, calculated in conformity with current applicable regulatory requirements, to evaluate whether the magnitude of the exposure to interest rates is acceptable. generally, a change resulting from a +/-200-basis-point rate shock that is less than 20% of aggregate tier 1 and tier 2 capital is an
management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (continued)
exposure that management deems acceptable. to the extent that we manage changes in eve sensitivity within the 20% threshold, we would seek to take action to remain below the threshold if the magnitude of our exposure to interest rates approached that limit.
similar to nir-at-risk measures, the timing of cash flows affects eve sensitivity, as changes in asset and liability values under different rate scenarios are dependent on when interest and principal payments are received. in contrast to nir simulations, however, eve sensitivity does not incorporate assumptions regarding reinvestment of these cash flows. in addition, our ability to price client deposits has a much smaller impact on eve sensitivity, as eve sensitivity does not consider the ongoing benefit of investing client deposits.
the following table presents estimated eve exposures, calculated as of the dates indicated, assuming an immediate and prolonged shift in global interest rates, the impact of which would be spread over a number of years.

the dollar measure of eve sensitivity exposure to an upward-200-basis-point shock as of december 31, 2015 increased compared to december 31, 2014 while the dollar measure of eve sensitivity to a downward-200-basis-point shock as of december 31, 2015 improved compared to december 31, 2014. the change in both eve sensitivity measures was primarily driven by investment portfolio activity.
eve sensitivity exposure to an upward-200-basis-point shock as of december 31, 2015, as a percentage of the total of tier 1 and tier 2 regulatory capital, increased compared to december 31, 2014. eve sensitivity to a downward-200-basis-point shock as of december 31, 2015, as a percentage of the total of tier 1 and tier 2 regulatory capital, improved compared to december 31, 2014. these shifts were primarily due to the previously mentioned changes in the dollar measures of eve sensitivity.
model risk management the use of quantitative models is widespread throughout the financial services industry, with large and complex organizations relying on sophisticated models to support numerous aspects of their financial decision making. the models contemporaneously represent both a significant advancement in financial management and a new source of risk. in large banking organizations like state street, model results influence business decisions, and model failure could have a harmful effect on our financial performance. as a result, we manage model risk within a model risk management framework.
our model risk management program has three principal components:
•   a model risk governance program that defines roles and responsibilities, including the authority to restrict model usage, provides policies and guidance, monitors compliance, and reports regularly to the board on the overall degree of model risk across the corporation;
•   a model development process that focuses on sound design and computational accuracy, and includes activities designed to test for robustness, stability, and sensitivity to assumptions; and
•   an independent model validation function designed to verify that models are conceptually sound, computationally accurate, are performing as expected, and are in line with their design objectives.
governance models used in the regulatory capital calculation can only be deployed for use after receiving a satisfactory validation review and approval decision from model risk management.
erm's model risk management group is responsible for defining the corporate-wide model risk governance framework, and maintains policies that achieve the framework's objectives. the team is responsible for overall model risk governance capabilities, with particular emphasis in the areas of model validation, model risk reporting, model performance monitoring, tracking of new model development status, and committee-level review and challenge.
mrc, which is composed of senior staff with technical expertise, reports to mrac, and provides guidance and oversight to the model risk management function.
model development and usage models are developed under standards governing data sourcing, methodology selection and model integrity testing. model development includes a statement of purpose to align development with intended use. it also includes a comparison of alternative approaches to promote a sound modeling approach.
management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (continued)
model developers conduct an assessment of data quality and relevance. the development teams conduct a variety of tests of the accuracy, robustness and stability of each model.
model validation mvg is part of model risk management within erm and performs model validations. mvg is independent, as contemplated by applicable bank regulatory requirements, of both the developers and users of the models. mvg validates models through a review process that assesses the appropriateness, accuracy, and suitability of data inputs, methodologies, assumptions, and processing code. model validation also encompasses an assessment of model performance, sensitivity, and robustness, as well as a model's potential limitations given its particular assumptions or deficiencies. based on the results of its review, mvg issues a model use decision and may require remedial actions and compensating controls on model use. mvg also maintains a model risk-rating system, which assigns a risk rating to each model based on an assessment of a model's inherent and residual risks. these ratings aid in the understanding and reporting of model risk across the model portfolio, and enable the triaging of needs for remediation.
although model validation is the primary method of subjecting models to independent review and challenge, in practice, a multi-step governance process provides the opportunity for challenge by multiple parties. first, mvg conducts model validation and issues a model use decision that may be accompanied by mandatory remedial actions and compensating controls. second, these decisions are reviewed, challenged, and confirmed by the mrc. finally, model use decisions, risk ratings, and overall levels of model risk are reported to and reviewed by mrac. mrm also reports regularly on model risk issues to the board.
strategic risk management we define strategic risk as the current or prospective impact on earnings or capital arising from adverse business decisions, improper implementation of strategic initiatives, or lack of responsiveness to industry-wide changes. strategic risks are influenced by changes in the competitive environment; decline in market performance or changes in our business activities; and the potential secondary impacts of reputational risks, not already captured as market, interest rate, credit, operational, model or liquidity risks. we incorporate strategic risk into our assessment of our business plans and risk and capital management processes. active management of strategic risk is an integral component of all aspects of our business.
separating the effects of a potential material adverse event into operational and strategic risk is sometimes difficult. for instance, the direct financial impact of an unfavorable event in the form of fines or penalties would be classified as an operational risk loss, while the impact on our reputation and consequently the potential loss of clients and corresponding decline in revenue would be classified as a strategic risk loss. an additional example of strategic risk is the integration of a major acquisition. failure to successfully integrate the operations of an acquired business, and the resultant inability to retain clients and the associated revenue, would be classified as a loss due to strategic risk.
strategic risk is managed with a long-term focus. techniques for its assessment and management include the development of business plans, which are subject to robust review and challenge from senior management and the board of directors, as well as a formal review and approval process for all new business and product proposals. the potential impact of the various elements of strategic risk is difficult to quantify with any degree of precision. we use a combination of historical earnings volatility, scenario analysis, stress-testing and management judgment to help assess the potential effect on state street attributable to strategic risk. management and control of strategic risks are generally the responsibility of the business units, with oversight from the control functions, as part of their overall strategic planning and internal risk management processes.
capital managing our capital involves evaluating whether our actual and projected levels of capital are commensurate with our risk profile, are in compliance with all applicable regulatory requirements, and are sufficient to provide us with the financial flexibility to undertake future strategic business initiatives. we assess capital adequacy based on relevant regulatory capital requirements, as well as our own internal capital goals, targets and other relevant metrics.
framework our objective with respect to management of our capital is to maintain a strong capital base in order to provide financial flexibility for our business needs, including funding corporate growth and supporting clients' cash management needs, and to provide protection against loss to depositors and creditors. we strive to maintain an appropriate level of capital, commensurate with our risk profile, on which an attractive return to shareholders is expected to be realized over both the short and long term, while

protecting our obligations to depositors and creditors and complying with regulatory capital requirements.
our capital management focuses on our risk exposures, the regulatory requirements applicable to us with respect to multiple capital measures, the evaluations and resulting credit ratings of the major independent rating agencies, our return on capital at both the consolidated and line-of-business level, and our capital position relative to our peers.
assessment of our overall capital adequacy includes the comparison of capital sources with capital uses, as well as the consideration of the quality and quantity of the various components of capital. the assessment seeks to determine the optimal level of capital and composition of capital instruments to satisfy all constituents of capital, with the lowest overall cost to shareholders. other factors considered in our assessment of capital adequacy are strategic and contingency planning, stress testing and planned capital actions.
capital adequacy process our primary federal banking regulator is the federal reserve. both state street and state street bank are subject to the minimum regulatory capital requirements established by the federal reserve and defined in fdicia. state street bank must exceed the regulatory capital thresholds for "well capitalized" in order for our parent company to maintain its status as a financial holding company. accordingly, one of our primary goals with respect to capital management is to exceed all applicable minimum regulatory capital requirements and to be "well-capitalized" under the pca guidelines established by the fdic. our capital management activities are conducted as part of our corporate-wide cap and associated capital policy and guidelines.
we consider capital adequacy to be a key element of our financial well-being, which affects our ability to attract and maintain client relationships; operate effectively in the global capital markets; and satisfy regulatory, security holder and shareholder needs. capital is one of several elements that affect our credit ratings and the ratings of our principal subsidiaries.
in conformity with our capital policy and guidelines, we strive to achieve and maintain specific internal capital levels, not just at a point in time, but over time and during periods of stress, to account for changes in our strategic direction, evolving economic conditions, and financial and market volatility. we have developed and implemented a corporate-wide cap to assess our overall capital in relation to our risk profile and to provide a comprehensive strategy for maintaining appropriate capital levels. the cap considers material risks under multiple scenarios, with an emphasis on stress scenarios, and encompasses existing processes and systems used to measure our capital adequacy.
capital contingency planning contingency planning is an integral component of capital management. the objective of contingency planning is to monitor current and forecast levels of select capital, liquidity and other measures that serve as early indicators of a potentially adverse capital or liquidity adequacy situation. these measures are one of the inputs used to set our internal capital adequacy level. we review these measures annually for appropriateness and relevance in relation to our financial budget and capital plan.
stress testing we administer a robust state street-wide stress-testing program that executes multiple stress tests each year to assess the institution's capital adequacy and/or future performance under adverse conditions. our stress testing program is structured around what we determine to be the key risks incurred by state street, as assessed through a recurring material risk identification process. the material risk identification process represents a bottom-up approach to identifying the institution's most significant risk exposures across all on- and off-balance sheet risk-taking activities, including credit, market, liquidity, interest rate, operational, fiduciary, business, reputation, and regulatory risks. these key risks serve as an organizing principle for much of our risk management framework, as well as reporting, including the "risk dashboard" provided to the board. over the past few years, stress scenarios have included a deep recession in the u.s., a break-up of the eurozone, a severe recession in china and an oil shock precipitated by turmoil in the middle east/north africa region.
in connection with the focus on our key risks, each stress test incorporates idiosyncratic loss events tailored to state street's unique risk profile and business activities. due to the nature of our business model and our consolidated statement of condition, our risks differ from those of a traditional commercial bank.
the federal reserve requires bank holding companies with total consolidated assets of $50 billion or more, which includes state street, to submit a capital plan on an annual basis. the federal reserve uses its annual ccar process, which incorporates hypothetical financial and economic stress scenarios, to review those capital plans and assess whether banking organizations have capital planning processes that account for idiosyncratic
management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (continued)
risks and provide for sufficient capital to continue operations throughout times of economic and financial stress. as part of its ccar process, the federal reserve assesses each organization's capital adequacy, capital planning process, and plans to distribute capital, such as dividend payments or stock purchase programs. management and board risk committees review, challenge, and approve ccar results and assumptions before submission to the federal reserve.
through the evaluation of state street's capital adequacy and/or future performance under adverse conditions, the stress testing processes provide important insights for capital planning, risk management, and strategic decision-making at state street.
governance in order to support integrated decision making, we have identified three management elements to aid in the compatibility and coordination of our cap:
•   risk management - identification, measurement, monitoring and forecasting of different types of risk and their combined impact on capital adequacy;
•   capital management - determination of optimal capital levels; and
•   business management - strategic planning, budgeting, forecasting, and performance management.
we have a hierarchical structure supporting appropriate committee review of relevant risk and capital information. the ongoing responsibility for capital management rests with our treasurer. the capital planning group within global treasury is responsible for the capital policy and guidelines, development of the capital plan, the management of global capital, capital optimization, and business unit capital management.
mrac provides oversight of our capital management, our capital adequacy, our internal targets and the expectations of the major independent credit rating agencies. in addition, mrac approves our balance sheet strategy and related activities. the board's rc assists the board in fulfilling its oversight responsibilities related to the assessment and management of risk and capital. our capital policy is reviewed and approved annually by the board's rc.
regulatory capital we and our depository institution subsidiaries are subject to the current u.s. basel iii minimum risk-based capital and leverage ratio guidelines. the basel iii final rule incorporates several multi-year transition provisions for capital components and minimum ratio requirements for common equity tier 1 capital, tier 1 capital and total capital. the transition period started in january 2014 and will be completed by january 1, 2019 which is concurrent with the full implementation of the basel iii final rule in the u.s. see "supervision and regulation" included under item 1, "business" of this form 10-k for discussion of our capital and liquidity ratios, including minimum ratios we are required to maintain.
the following table sets forth the transition to full implementation and the minimum risk-based capital ratio requirements under the basel iii final rule. this does not include the potential imposition of an additional countercyclical capital buffer.

management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (continued)
the specific calculation of state street's and state street bank's risk-based capital ratios will change as the provisions of the basel iii final rule related to the numerator (capital) and denominator (risk-weighted assets) are phased in, and as our risk-weighted assets calculated using the advanced approaches change due to potential changes in methodology. these ongoing methodological changes will result in differences in our reported capital ratios from one reporting period to the next that are independent of applicable changes to our capital base, our asset composition, our off-balance sheet exposures or our risk profile.
management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (continued)
the following table presents the regulatory capital structure and related regulatory capital ratios for state street and state street bank as of the dates indicated. as a result of changes in the methodologies used to calculate our regulatory capital ratios from period to period, as the provisions of the basel iii final rule are phased in, the ratios presented in the table for each period are not directly comparable. refer to the footnotes following the table.

(1) common equity tier 1 capital, tier 1 capital and total capital ratios as of december 31, 2015 and december 31, 2014 were calculated in conformity with the advanced approaches provisions of the basel iii final rule. tier 1 leverage ratio as of december 31, 2015 and december 31, 2014 were calculated in conformity with the basel iii final rule.
(2) common equity tier 1 capital, tier 1 capital and total capital ratios as of december 31, 2015 were calculated in conformity with the standardized approach provisions of the basel iii final rule. tier 1 leverage ratio as of december 31, 2015 was calculated in conformity with the basel iii final rule.
(3) common equity tier 1 capital, tier 1 capital, total capital and tier 1 leverage ratios as of december 31, 2014 were calculated in conformity with the transitional provisions of the basel iii final rule. specifically, these ratios reflect common equity tier 1, tier 1 and total capital (the numerator) calculated in conformity with the provisions of the basel iii final rule, and total risk-weighted assets or, with respect to the tier 1 leverage ratio, quarterly average assets (in both cases, the denominator), calculated in conformity with the provisions of basel i.
(4) amounts for state street and state street bank as of december 31, 2015 consisted of goodwill, net of associated deferred tax liabilities, and 40% of other intangible assets, net of associated deferred tax liabilities.  amounts for state street and state street bank as of december 31, 2014 consisted of goodwill, net of deferred tax liabilities and 20% of other intangible assets, net of associated deferred tax liabilities. intangible assets, net of associated deferred tax liabilities is phased in as a deduction from capital, in conformity with the basel iii final rule.
(5)  market risk risk-weighted assets reported in conformity with the basel iii advanced approaches included a cva which reflected the risk of potential fair-value adjustments for credit risk reflected in our valuation of over-the-counter derivative contracts.  the cva was not provided for in the final market risk capital rule; however, it was required by the advanced approaches provisions of the basel iii final rule.  state street used the simple cva approach in conformity with the basel iii advanced approaches.
(6) minimum requirements will be phased in up to full implementation beginning on january 1, 2019; minimum requirements listed are as of december 31, 2015. see table 43: basel iii final rules transition arrangements and minimum risk based capital ratios.
(7) minimum requirements will be phased in up to full implementation beginning on january 1, 2019; minimum requirements listed are as of december 31, 2014. see table 43: basel iii final rules transition arrangements and minimum risk based capital ratios.
(8) amounts for 2014 reflect adjustments related to certain expenses billed to our asset servicing clients as more fully described in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements included under item 8 of this form 10-k.
management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (continued)
the regulatory capital ratios for state street and state street bank as of december 31, 2015, presented in table 44: regulatory capital structure and related regulatory capital ratios, differ from such ratios as of december 31, 2014 for reasons beyond changes to our capital base, our asset composition, our off-balance sheet exposures or our risk profile. the december 31, 2015 ratios reflect a different set of methodologies required by applicable regulators to calculate capital and total risk-weighted assets from those utilized to calculate the december 31, 2014 ratios. as a result, the ratios presented in the table for each period are not directly comparable.
as of january 1, 2015 we used the standardized provisions of the basel iii final rule in addition to the advanced approaches provisions which were previously implemented in the second quarter of 2014, and the lower of our regulatory capital ratios calculated under the advanced approaches and those ratios calculated under the standardized approach are applied in the assessment of our capital adequacy for regulatory capital purposes. beginning in the second quarter of 2014, until january 1, 2015, we used the advanced approaches provisions in the basel iii final rule, and transitional provisions of the basel iii final rule, and the lower of our regulatory capital ratios calculated under the advanced approaches and those ratios calculated under the transitional provisions were applied in the assessment of our capital adequacy for regulatory capital purposes. prior to the second quarter of 2014, we used the provisions of basel i to calculate our risk-weighted assets.
state street's common equity tier 1 capital decreased $894 million as of december 31, 2015 compared to december 31, 2014, as a result of purchases by us of our common stock of approximately $1.52 billion, declarations of common and preferred stock dividends of $666 million, the strengthening u.s. dollar's effect on accumulated other comprehensive income, and the impact of the phase-in provisions of the basel iii final rule related to other intangible assets, partially offset by the positive effect of year-to-date net income. over the same period, state street's tier 1 capital decreased $354 million, total capital decreased $366 million under advanced approaches and total capital decreased $312 million under standardized approach. our tier 1 capital and total capital decreased by less than common equity tier 1 capital over the same period, as the net decrease to common equity tier 1 capital was largely offset by the positive effects on tier 1 capital and total capital of the issuance of $750 million of preferred stock in the second quarter of 2015. state street bank's tier 1 capital increased $750 million, and total capital increased $495 million and $553 million under the advanced and standardized approaches, respectively, as of december 31, 2015, compared to december 31, 2014, the result of year-to-date net income, partially offset by the previously-described impact to accumulated other comprehensive income and phase-in provisions of the basel iii final rule related to other intangible assets.

as of december 31, 2015, total advanced approaches risk-weighted assets decreased $8.28 billion compared to december 31, 2014, primarily the result of a reduction in credit risk due to sales, maturities and pay-downs of the securitized investment portfolio and the subsequent reinvestment in hqla, a decrease associated with the usage of the alternative modified look through approach for investments in investment funds, and a decline in over the counter foreign exchange derivatives mainly due to a decrease in volumes and the addition of new netting agreements. the decreases were partially offset by an $8.02 billion increase in operational risk which reflects adjustments to the model inputs.
as of december 31, 2014, total risk-weighted assets decreased from june 30, 2014 balances primarily due to lower credit risk-weighted assets, partially offset by an increase in market risk-equivalent risk-weighted assets. the increase in market risk-equivalent risk weighted assets resulted from the increase in the sixty-day moving average of our stressed var-based measure. our stressed

var-based measure was impacted by the extension of the tenor of fx swaps by global treasury designed to improve our liquidity position. the decrease in credit risk-weighted assets primarily related to sales, maturities and pay-downs of both wholesale and securitized investments, partially offset by an increase in loan activity.

(1) standardized approach risk-weighted assets as of december 31, 2014 were calculated using state street's estimates, based on our then current interpretation of the basel iii final rule.
as of december 31, 2015, total standardized approach risk-weighted assets decreased $29.12 billion compared to december 31, 2014, primarily the result of a reduction in credit risk due to sales, maturities and pay-downs of both securitized and wholesale investment portfolio and the subsequent reinvestment in hqla, a decrease in securities financing exposure, a decrease associated with the usage of the alternative modified look through approach for investments in investment funds and a decline in over the counter foreign exchange derivatives primarily due to a decrease in volumes and the addition of new netting agreements.
the regulatory capital ratios as of december 31, 2015, presented in table 44: regulatory capital structure and related regulatory capital ratios, are calculated under the standardized approach and advanced approaches in conformity with the basel iii final rule. the advanced approaches-based ratios
(actual and estimated pro forma) reflect calculations and determinations with respect to our capital and related matters as of december 31, 2015, based on state street and external data, quantitative formulae, statistical models, historical correlations and assumptions, collectively referred to as "advanced systems," in effect and used by state street for those purposes as of the time we first reported such ratios in a quarterly report on form 10-q. significant components of these advanced systems involve the exercise of judgment by us and our regulators, and our advanced systems may not, individually or collectively, precisely represent or calculate the scenarios, circumstances, outputs or other results for which they are designed or intended.
due to the influence of changes in these advanced systems, whether resulting from changes in data inputs, regulation or regulatory supervision or interpretation, state street-specific or market activities or experiences or other updates or factors, we expect that our advanced systems and our capital ratios calculated in conformity with the basel iii final rule will change and may be volatile over time, and that those latter changes or volatility could be material as calculated and measured from period to period. models implemented under the basel iii final rule, particularly those implementing the advanced approaches, remain subject to regulatory review and approval. the full effects of the basel iii final rule on state street and state street bank are therefore subject to further evaluation and also to further regulatory guidance, action or rule-making.
estimated basel iii fully phased-in capital ratios table 48: regulatory capital structure and related regulatory capital ratios - state street and table 49: regulatory capital structure and related regulatory capital ratios - state street bank present our capital ratios for state street and state street bank as of december 31, 2015, calculated in conformity with the advanced approaches provisions and standardized approach of the basel iii final rule on an estimated, pro forma basis under the fully phased-in provisions of the basel iii final rule. pro forma fully phased-in capital ratios calculated in accordance with both approaches as of december 31, 2015, are preliminary estimates, based on our present interpretations of the basel iii final rule as applied to our businesses and operations as of december 31, 2015.

management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (continued)
fully phased-in pro-forma estimates of common shareholders' equity include 100% of accumulated other comprehensive income, including accumulated other comprehensive income attributable to available-for-sale securities, cash flow hedges and defined benefit pension plans. fully phased-in pro-forma estimates of common equity tier 1 capital reflect 100% of applicable deductions, including but not limited to, intangible assets net of deferred tax liabilities. as of december 31, 2015, tier 1 capital includes 25% of trust preferred capital securities and the remaining 75% is included in tier 2 capital. fully phased-in tier 1 capital reflects the transition of trust preferred capital securities from tier 1 capital to tier 2 capital. for both basel iii advanced and standardized approaches, fully phased-in pro-forma estimates of risk-weighted assets reflect the exclusion of intangible assets, offset by additions related to non-significant equity exposures and deferred tax assets related to temporary differences.
global systemically important bank we are designated as a large bank holding company subject to enhanced supervision and prudential standards, commonly referred to as a "systemically important financial institution," or sifi, and we are one among a group of 30 institutions worldwide that have been identified by the fsb and the bcbs as g-sibs. our designation as a g-sib will require us to maintain an additional capital buffer above the basel iii final rule minimum common equity tier 1 capital ratio of 4.5%, based on a number of factors, as evaluated by banking regulators. see further discussion of the g-sib surcharge within "supervision and regulation" included under item 1, "business" of this form 10-k.

management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (continued)
the following table presents the dividends declared for each of the series of preferred stock issued and outstanding for the periods indicted:
in january 2016, we declared dividends on our series c, d, e, and f preferred stock of approximately $1,313, $1,475, $1,500 and $2,625, respectively, per share, or approximately $0.33, $0.37, $0.38 and $26.5, respectively, per depositary share. these dividends total approximately $7 million, $11 million, $11 million and $20 million on our series c, d, e, and f preferred stock, respectively, which will be paid in march 2016.
common stock in march 2015, we received the results of the federal reserve's review of our 2015 capital plan in connection with its 2015 annual ccar process. the federal reserve did not object to the capital actions we proposed in our 2015 capital plan and in march 2015 our board approved a common stock purchase program authorizing the purchase of up to $1.8 billion of our common stock through june 30, 2016 (the 2015 program). in march 2014, the board approved the previous program (the 2014 program) that authorized stock purchases through march 2015. the table below presents the activities under each program during the year ended december 31, 2015.

federal and state banking regulations place certain restrictions on dividends paid by subsidiary banks to the parent holding company. in addition, banking regulators have the authority to prohibit bank holding companies from paying dividends. information concerning limitations on dividends from our subsidiary banks is provided in "related stockholder matters" included under item 5, and in note 15 to the consolidated financial statements, included under item 8 of this form 10-k.
stock purchases may be made using various types of mechanisms, including open market purchases or transactions off market, and may be made under rule 10b5-1 trading programs. the timing of stock purchases, types of transactions and number of shares purchased will depend on several factors, including, market conditions and state street's capital positions, its financial performance and investment opportunities. the common stock purchase program does not have specific price targets and may be suspended at any time.
off-balance sheet arrangements on behalf of clients enrolled in our securities lending program, we lend securities to banks, broker/dealers and other institutions. in most circumstances, we indemnify our clients for the fair market value of
management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (continued)
those securities against a failure of the borrower to return such securities. though these transactions are collateralized, the substantial volume of these activities necessitates detailed credit-based underwriting and monitoring processes. the aggregate amount of indemnified securities on loan totaled $320.44 billion as of december 31, 2015, compared to $349.77 billion as of december 31, 2014. we require the borrower to provide collateral in an amount in excess of 100% of the fair market value of the securities borrowed. we hold the collateral received in connection with these securities lending services as agent, and the collateral is not recorded in our consolidated statement of condition. we revalue the securities on loan and the collateral daily to determine if additional collateral is necessary or if excess collateral is required to be returned to the borrower. we held, as agent, cash and securities totaling $335.42 billion and $364.41 billion as collateral for indemnified securities on loan as of december 31, 2015 and december 31, 2014, respectively.
the cash collateral held by us as agent is invested on behalf of our clients. in certain cases, the cash collateral is invested in third-party repurchase agreements, for which we indemnify the client against loss of the principal invested. we require the counterparty to the indemnified repurchase agreement to provide collateral in an amount in excess of 100% of the amount of the repurchase agreement. in our role as agent, the indemnified repurchase agreements and the related collateral held by us are not recorded in our consolidated statement of condition. of the collateral of $335.42 billion and $364.41 billion, referenced above, $63.06 billion and $85.31 billion was invested in indemnified repurchase agreements as of december 31, 2015 and december 31, 2014, respectively. we or our agents held $67.02 billion and $90.82 billion as collateral for indemnified investments in repurchase agreements as of december 31, 2015 and december 31, 2014, respectively.
additional information about our securities finance activities and other off-balance sheet arrangements is provided in notes 10 and 12 to the consolidated financial statements included under item 8 of this form 10-k.
significant accounting estimates our consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with u.s. gaap, and we apply accounting policies that affect the determination of amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements. additional information on our significant accounting policies, including references to applicable footnotes, is provided in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements included under item 8 of this form 10-k.
certain of our accounting policies, by their nature, require management to make judgments, involving significant estimates and assumptions, about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain. these estimates and assumptions are based on information available as of the date of the consolidated financial statements, and changes in this information over time could materially affect the amounts of assets, liabilities, equity, revenue and expenses reported in subsequent consolidated financial statements.
based on the sensitivity of reported financial statement amounts to the underlying estimates and assumptions, the more significant accounting policies applied by state street have been identified by management as those associated with recurring fair-value measurements, otti of investment securities, impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets, and contingencies. these accounting policies require the most subjective or complex judgments, and underlying estimates and assumptions could be most subject to revision as new information becomes available. an understanding of the judgments, estimates and assumptions underlying these accounting policies is essential in order to understand our reported consolidated results of operations and financial condition.
the following is a discussion of the above-mentioned significant accounting estimates. management has discussed these significant accounting estimates with the e&a committee of the board.
fair-value measurements we carry certain of our financial assets and liabilities at fair value in our consolidated financial statements on a recurring basis, including trading account assets, afs investment securities and derivative instruments.
changes in the fair value of these financial assets and liabilities are recorded either as components of our consolidated statement of income, or as components of other comprehensive income within shareholders' equity in our consolidated

statement of condition. in addition to those financial assets and liabilities that we carry at fair value in our consolidated financial statements on a recurring basis, we estimate the fair values of other financial assets and liabilities that we carry at amortized cost in our consolidated statement of condition, and we disclose these fair value estimates in the notes to our consolidated financial statements. we estimate the fair values of these financial assets and liabilities using the definition of fair value described below.
as of december 31, 2015, approximately $75.70 billion of our financial assets and approximately $4.23 billion of our financial liabilities were carried at fair value on a recurring basis, compared to $103.77 billion and $6.31 billion, respectively, as of december 31, 2014. the amounts as of december 31, 2015 represented approximately 31% of our consolidated total assets and approximately 2% of our consolidated total liabilities, compared to 38% and 2%, respectively, as of december 31, 2014. the decrease in the relative percentage of consolidated total assets as of december 31, 2015 compared to 2014 mainly reflects a decline in the investment securities portfolio, associated with a lower level of purchases in 2015 compared to 2014, and an increase in interest-bearing deposits with banks, the result of the continued elevated level of client deposits. additional information with respect to the assets and liabilities carried by us at fair value on a recurring basis is provided in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements included under item 8 of this form 10-k.
u.s. gaap defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in the principal or most advantageous market for an asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. when we measure fair value for our financial assets and liabilities, we consider the principal or the most advantageous market in which we would transact; we also consider assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability. when possible, we look to active and observable markets to measure the fair value of identical, or similar, financial assets and liabilities. when identical financial assets and liabilities are not traded in active markets, we look to market-observable data for similar assets and liabilities. in some instances, certain assets and liabilities are not actively traded in observable markets; as a result, we use alternate valuation techniques to measure their fair value.
we categorize the financial assets and liabilities that we carry at fair value in our consolidated statement of condition on a recurring basis based on u.s. gaap's prescribed three-level valuation hierarchy. the hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (level 1) and the lowest priority to valuation methods using significant unobservable inputs (level 3).
as of december 31, 2015, including the effect of netting, we categorized approximately 8% of our financial assets carried at fair value in level 1, approximately 89% of our financial assets carried at fair value in level 2, and approximately 3% of our financial assets carried at fair value in level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. as of december 31, 2014, including the effect of netting, we categorized less than 10% of our financial assets carried at fair value in level 1, approximately 85% of our financial assets carried at fair value in level 2, and approximately 5% of our financial assets carried at fair value in level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.
as of december 31, 2015, on the same basis, we categorized approximately 2% of our financial liabilities carried at fair value in level 1, approximately 98% of our financial liabilities carried at fair value in level 2, and less than 1% of our financial liabilities carried at fair value in level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. as of december 31, 2014, on the same basis, we had no financial liabilities carried at fair value in level 1, we categorized approximately 99% of our financial liabilities carried at fair value in level 2, and less than 1% of our financial liabilities carried at fair value in level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.
the assets categorized in level 1 were primarily trading account assets. fair value for these securities was measured by management using unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical securities.
the assets categorized in level 2 were primarily afs investment securities and derivative instruments. fair value for the investment securities was measured by management primarily using information obtained from independent third parties. information obtained from third parties is subject to review by management as part of a validation process. management utilizes a process to verify the information provided, including an understanding of underlying assumptions and the level of market-participant information used to support those assumptions. in addition, management compares significant assumptions used by third parties to available market information. such information may include known trades or, to the extent that trading activity is limited, comparisons to market research information pertaining to credit expectations,
management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (continued)
execution prices and the timing of cash flows and, where information is available, back-testing.
the derivative instruments categorized in level 2 primarily comprised of foreign exchange and interest-rate contracts used in our trading activities, for which fair value was measured by management using discounted cash flow techniques, with inputs consisting of observable spot and forward points, as well as observable interest rate curves.
the substantial majority of our financial assets categorized in level 3 were asset-backed and mortgage-backed afs securities. level-3 assets also included foreign exchange derivative contracts. the aggregate fair value of our financial assets and liabilities categorized in level 3 as of december 31, 2015 decreased approximately 55% compared to 2014, primarily the result of transfers out of level 3 and paydowns of asset-backed and non-u.s. debt securities.
with respect to derivative instruments, we evaluated the impact on valuation of the credit risk of our counterparties and of our own credit. we considered such factors as the market-based probability of default by us and our counterparties, and our current and expected potential future net exposures by remaining maturities, in determining the appropriate measurements of fair value. valuation adjustments associated with derivative instruments were not significant to our consolidated financial performance in 2015, 2014 or 2013.
other-than-temporary impairment of investment securities our portfolio of fixed-income investment securities constitutes a significant portion of the assets carried in our consolidated statement of condition. u.s. gaap requires the use of expected future cash flows to evaluate otti of these investment securities. the amount and timing of these expected future cash flows are significant estimates used in our evaluation of otti. an otti is triggered if the intent is to sell the security or the security will more likely than not have to be sold before the amortized cost basis is recovered. additional information with respect to management's assessment of otti is provided in note 3 to the consolidated financial statements included under item 8 of this form 10-k.
expectations of defaults and prepayments are the most significant assumptions underlying our estimates of future cash flows. in determining these estimates, management relies on relevant and reliable information, including but not limited to deal structure, including optional and mandatory calls, market interest-rate curves, industry standard asset-
class-specific prepayment models, recent prepayment history, independent credit ratings, and recent actual and projected credit losses. management considers this information based on its relevance and uses its best judgment in order to determine its assumptions for underlying cash-flow expectations and resulting estimates. management reviews its underlying assumptions and develops expected future cash-flow estimates at least quarterly. additional detail with respect to the sensitivity of these default and prepayment assumptions is provided under "financial condition - investment securities" in management's discussion and analysis.
impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquisition over the fair value of the net tangible and other intangible assets acquired. other intangible assets represent purchased assets that can be distinguished from goodwill because of contractual rights or because the asset can be exchanged on its own or in combination with a related contract, asset or liability. goodwill is not amortized, while other intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives.
goodwill is ultimately supported by revenue from our investment servicing and investment management lines of business. a decline in earnings as a result of a lack of growth, or our inability to deliver cost-effective services over sustained periods, could lead to a perceived impairment of goodwill, which would be evaluated and, if necessary, be recorded as a write-down of the reported amount of goodwill through a charge to other expenses in our consolidated statement of income.
on an annual basis, or more frequently if circumstances arise, management reviews goodwill and evaluates events or other developments that may indicate impairment of the carrying amount. we perform this evaluation at the reporting unit level, which is one level below our two major lines of business. the evaluation methodology for potential impairment is inherently complex and involves significant management judgment in the use of estimates and assumptions.
we evaluate goodwill for impairment using a two-step process. first, we compare the aggregate fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying amount, including goodwill. if the fair value exceeds the carrying amount, no impairment exists. if the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds the fair value, then we compare the "implied" fair value of the reporting unit's goodwill to its carrying amount. if the
management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (continued)
carrying amount of the goodwill exceeds the implied fair value, then goodwill impairment is recognized by writing the goodwill down to the implied fair value. the implied fair value of the goodwill is determined by allocating the fair value of the reporting unit to all of the assets and liabilities of that unit, as if the unit had been acquired in a business combination and the overall fair value of the unit was the purchase price.
to determine the aggregate fair value of the reporting unit being evaluated for goodwill impairment, we use one of two principal methodologies: a market approach, based on a comparison of the reporting unit to publicly-traded companies in similar lines of business; or an income approach, based on the value of the cash flows that the business can be expected to generate in the future.
events that may indicate impairment include significant or adverse changes in the business, economic or political climate; an adverse action or assessment by a regulator; unanticipated competition; and a more-likely-than-not expectation that we will sell or otherwise dispose of a business to which the goodwill or other intangible assets relate. additional information about goodwill and other intangible assets, including information by line of business, is provided in note 5 to the consolidated financial statements included under item 8 of this form 10-k.
our evaluation of goodwill and other intangible assets indicated that no significant impairment occurred in 2015, 2014 or 2013. goodwill and other intangible assets recorded in our consolidated statement of condition as of december 31, 2015 totaled approximately $5.67 billion and $1.77 billion, respectively, compared to $5.83 billion and $2.03 billion, respectively, as of december 31, 2014.
contingencies the significant estimates and judgments related with establishing litigation reserves are discussed in note 13 of the consolidated financial statements included under item 8 of this form 10-k.
recent accounting developments information with respect to recent accounting developments is provided in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements included under item 8 of this form 10-k.

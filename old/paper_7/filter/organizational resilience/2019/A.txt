net income was $1,071 million in 2019 compared to net income of $316 million and $684 million in 2018 and 2017, respectively. net income for the year ended october 31, 2019 was impacted by a discrete tax benefit of $299 million related to restructuring and the extension of the company's tax incentive in singapore. net income for the year ended october 31, 2018 was impacted by a discrete tax charge of $552 million related to the enactment of the tax act that was passed on december 22, 2017. as of october 31, 2019 and 2018, we had cash and cash equivalents balances of $1,382 million and $2,247 million, respectively.
on may 28, 2015 we announced that our board of directors had approved a share repurchase program (the "2015 repurchase program"). the 2015 share repurchase program authorizes the purchase of up to $1.14 billion of our common stock at the company's discretion through and including november 1, 2018. the 2015 repurchase program did not require the company to acquire a specific number of shares and could have been suspended or discontinued at any time. during the year ended october 31, 2017, we repurchased and retired approximately 4.1 million shares for $194 million under this authorization. during the year ended october 31, 2018, we repurchased and retired approximately 6.4 million shares for $422 million under this authorization. as of october 31, 2018, we had remaining authorization to repurchase up to $188 million of our common stock under this program which expired on november 1, 2018.
on november 19, 2018 we announced that our board of directors had approved a new share repurchase program (the "2019 repurchase program") designed, among other things, to reduce or eliminate dilution resulting from issuance of stock under the company's employee equity incentive programs. the 2019 share repurchase program authorizes the purchase of up to $1.75 billion of our common stock at the company's discretion and has no fixed termination date. the 2019 repurchase program does not require the company to acquire a specific number of shares and may be suspended, amended or discontinued at any time. during the year ended october 31, 2019, we repurchased and retired approximately 10.4 million shares for $723 million under this authorization. as of october 31, 2019, we had remaining authorization to repurchase up to $1.03 billion of our common stock under this program.
during the year ended october 31, 2019, cash dividends of 0.656 per share, or $206 million were declared and paid on the company's outstanding common stock. during the year ended october 31, 2018, cash dividends of 0.596 per share, or $191 million were declared and paid on the company's outstanding common stock. during the year ended october 31, 2017, cash dividends of 0.528 per share, or $170 million were declared and paid on the company's outstanding common stock.
on november 20, 2019 we declared a quarterly dividend of $0.18 per share of common stock, or approximately $56 million which will be paid on january 22, 2020 to shareholders of record as of the close of business on december 31, 2019. the timing and amounts of any future dividends are subject to determination and approval by our board of directors.
looking forward, we continue to focus on differentiating product solutions, improving our customers' experience, continued growth and earnings expansion. we remain optimistic that we have the ability and resilience to manage any changing market conditions to deliver positive results in fiscal year 2020. in addition, we remain focused on a balanced capital allocation through our dividend and share repurchase programs. we expect foreign currency to negatively impact revenue for 2020 but we also anticipate the contribution from our recent acquisitions to partially offset the currency impact.
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the u.s. requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. management bases its estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions believed to be reasonable. although these estimates are based on management's best knowledge of current events and actions that may impact the company in the future, actual results may be different from the estimates. an accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made and if different estimates that reasonably could have been used or changes in the accounting estimate that are reasonably likely to occur could materially change the financial statements. our critical accounting policies are those that affect our financial statements materially and involve difficult, subjective or complex judgments by management. those policies are revenue recognition, inventory valuation, retirement and post-retirement plan assumptions, valuation of goodwill and purchased intangible assets and accounting for income taxes.
revenue recognition.    on november 1, 2018, we adopted accounting standard codification topic 606, revenue from contracts with customers ("asc 606").
we enter into contracts to sell products, services or combinations of products and services. products may include hardware or software and services may include one-time service events or services performed over time.
we derive revenue primarily from the sale of analytical and diagnostics products and services. a performance obligation is a promise in a contract to transfer a distinct product or service to a customer and is the unit of account under asc 606. revenue is recognized when control of the promised products or services is transferred to our customers and the performance obligation is fulfilled in an amount that reflects the consideration that we expect to be entitled in exchange for those products or services, the transaction price. for equipment, consumables, and most software licenses, control transfers to the customer at a point in time. we use present right to payment, legal title, physical possession of the asset, and risks and rewards of ownership as indicators to determine the transfer of control to the customer. where acceptance is not a formality, the customer must have documented their acceptance of the product or service. for products that include installation, if the installation meets the criteria to be considered a separate performance obligation, product revenue is recognized when control has passed to the customer, and recognition of installation revenue occurs once completed. product revenue, including sales to resellers and distributors is reduced for provisions for warranties, returns, and other adjustments in the period the related sales are recorded.
service revenue includes extended warranty, customer and software support including: software as a service, post contract support, consulting including companion diagnostics, and training and education. instrument service contracts and software maintenance contracts are typically annual contracts, which are billed at the beginning of the contract or maintenance period. revenue for these contracts is recognized on a straight-line basis to revenue over the service period, as a time-based measure of progress best reflects our performance in satisfying this obligation. there are no deferred costs associated with the service contract, as the cost of the service is recorded when the service is performed. service calls not included in a support contract are recognized to revenue at the time a service is performed.
we have sales from standalone software. these arrangements typically include software licenses and maintenance contracts, both of which we have determined are distinct performance obligations. we determine the amount of the transaction price to allocate to the license and maintenance contract based on the relative standalone selling price of each performance obligation. software license revenue is recognized at the point in time when control has been transferred to the customer. the revenue allocated to the software maintenance contract is recognized on a straight-line basis over the maintenance period, which is the contractual term of the contract, as a time-based measure of progress best reflects our performance in satisfying this obligation. unspecified rights to software upgrades are typically sold as part of the maintenance contract on a when-and-if-available basis.
our multiple-element arrangements are generally comprised of a combination of instruments, installation or other start-up services, and/or software, and/or support or services. hardware and software elements are typically delivered at the same time and revenue is recognized when control passes to the customer. service revenue is deferred and recognized over the contractual period or as services are rendered and accepted by the customer. our arrangements generally do not include any provisions for cancellation, termination, or refunds that would significantly impact recognized revenue.
for contracts with multiple performance obligations, we allocate the consideration to which we expect to be entitled to each performance obligation based on relative standalone selling prices and recognize the related revenue when or as control of each individual performance obligation is transferred to customers. we estimate the standalone selling price by calculating the average historical selling price of our products and services per country for each performance obligation. stand-alone selling prices are determined for each distinct good or service in the contract and then we allocate the transaction price in proportion to those standalone selling prices by performance obligations.
a portion of our revenue relate to lease arrangements. standalone lease arrangements are outside the scope of asc 606 and are therefore accounted for in accordance with asc 840, leases. each of these contracts is evaluated as a lease arrangement, either as an operating lease or a sales-type capital lease using the current lease classification guidance.
inventory valuation.    we assess the valuation of our inventory on a periodic basis and make adjustments to the value for estimated excess and obsolete inventory based upon estimates about future demand and actual usage. such estimates are difficult to make under most economic conditions. the excess balance determined by this analysis becomes the basis for our excess inventory charge. our excess inventory review process includes analysis of sales forecasts, managing product rollovers and working with manufacturing to maximize recovery of excess inventory. if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management, additional write-downs may be required. if actual market conditions are more favorable than anticipated, inventory previously written down may be sold to customers, resulting in lower cost of sales and higher income from operations than expected in that period.
retirement and post-retirement benefit plan assumptions.    retirement and post-retirement benefit plan costs are a significant cost of doing business. they represent obligations that will ultimately be settled sometime in the future and therefore are subject to estimation. pension accounting is intended to reflect the recognition of future benefit costs over the employees' average expected future service to agilent based on the terms of the plans and investment and funding decisions. to estimate the impact of these future payments and our decisions concerning funding of these obligations, we are required to make assumptions using actuarial concepts within the framework of accounting principles generally accepted in the u.s. two critical assumptions are the discount rate and the expected long-term return on plan assets. other important assumptions include, expected future salary increases, expected future increases to benefit payments, expected retirement dates, employee turnover, retiree mortality rates, and portfolio composition. we evaluate these assumptions at least annually.
the discount rate is used to determine the present value of future benefit payments at the measurement date - october 31 for both u.s. and non-u.s. plans. for 2019 and 2018, the u.s. discount rates were based on the results of matching expected plan benefit payments with cash flows from a hypothetically constructed bond portfolio. in 2019, discount rates for the u.s. plans decreased compared to the previous year. for 2019 and 2018, the discount rate for non-u.s. plans was generally based on published rates for high quality corporate bonds and in 2019, decreased compared to the previous year. if we changed our discount rate by 1 percent, the impact would be less than $1 million in u.s. pension expense and $13 million on non-u.s. pension expense. lower discount rates increase present values of the pension benefit obligation and subsequent year pension expense; higher discount rates decrease present values of the pension benefit obligation and subsequent year pension expense.
the company uses alternate methods of amortization as allowed by the authoritative guidance which amortizes the actuarial gains and losses on a consistent basis for the years presented. for u.s. plans, gains and losses are amortized over the average future lifetime of participants using the corridor method. for most non-u.s. plans and u.s. post-retirement benefit plans, gains and losses are amortized using a separate layer for each year's gains and losses.
in the u.s., target asset allocations for our retirement and post-retirement benefit plans are approximately 80 percent to equities and approximately 20 percent to fixed income investments. our deferred profit-sharing plan target asset allocation is approximately 60 percent to equities and approximately 40 percent to fixed income investments. approximately 3 percent of our u.s. equity portfolio consists of limited partnerships. outside the u.s., our target asset allocation ranges from 31 to 60 percent to equities, from 38 to 61 percent to fixed income investments, and from zero to 25 percent to real estate, depending on the plan. all plans' assets are broadly diversified. due to fluctuations in equity markets, our actual allocations of plan assets at october 31, 2019 and 2018 differ from the target allocation. our policy is to bring the actual allocation in line with the target allocation.
equity securities include exchange-traded common stock and preferred stock of companies from broadly diversified industries. fixed income securities include a global portfolio of corporate bonds of companies from diversified industries, government securities, mortgage-backed securities, asset-backed securities, derivative instruments and other. other investments include a group trust consisting primarily of private equity partnerships.
the expected long-term return on plan assets is estimated using current and expected asset allocations as well as historical and expected returns. plan assets are valued at fair value. if we changed our estimated return on assets by 1 percent, the impact would be $4 million on u.s. pension expense and $9 million on non-u.s. pension expense. for 2019, actual return on assets was above expectations which, along with contributions during the year, decreased next year's pension cost as well as resulting in an increase of the funded status at year end. the net periodic pension and post-retirement benefit costs recorded were a $10 million expense in 2019, $3 million benefit in 2018 and $15 million expense in 2017. the years ended october 31, 2018 and 2017 included a gain on curtailment and settlements of $5 million and $32 million, respectively.
goodwill and purchased intangible assets. under the authoritative guidance, we have the option to perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether further impairment testing is necessary. the accounting standard gives an entity the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether performing the two-step test is necessary. if an entity believes, as a result of its qualitative assessment, that it is more-likely-than-not (i.e. greater than 50% chance) that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, the quantitative impairment test will be required. otherwise, no further testing will be required.
the guidance includes examples of events and circumstances that might indicate that a reporting unit's fair value is less than its carrying amount. these include macro-economic conditions such as deterioration in the entity's operating environment or industry or market considerations; entity-specific events such as increasing costs, declining financial performance, or loss of key personnel; or other events such as an expectation that a reporting unit will be sold or a sustained decrease in the stock price on either an absolute basis or relative to peers.
if it is determined, as a result of the qualitative assessment, that it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, the provisions of authoritative guidance require that we perform a two-step impairment test on goodwill. in the first step, we compare the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value. the second step (if necessary) measures the amount of impairment by applying fair-value-based tests to the individual assets and liabilities within each reporting unit. as defined in the authoritative guidance, a reporting unit is an operating segment, or one level below an operating segment. we aggregate components of an operating segment that have similar economic characteristics into our reporting units.
in fiscal year 2019, we assessed goodwill impairment for our three reporting units which consisted of three segments: life sciences and applied markets, diagnostics and genomics and agilent crosslab. we performed a qualitative test for goodwill impairment of the three reporting units, as of september 30, 2019. based on the results of our qualitative testing, we believe that it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of each reporting unit is greater than its respective carrying value. each quarter we review the events and circumstances to determine if goodwill impairment is indicated. there was no impairment of goodwill during the years ended october 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017.
purchased intangible assets consist primarily of acquired developed technologies, proprietary know-how, trademarks, and customer relationships and are amortized using the best estimate of the asset's useful life that reflect the pattern in which the economic benefits are consumed or used up or a straight-line method ranging from 6 months to 15 years. our determination of the fair value of the intangible assets acquired involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions. specifically, our determination of the fair value of the developed product technology and in-process research and development ("ipr&d") acquired involve significant estimates and assumptions related to revenue growth rates and discount rates. our determination of the fair value of customer relationships acquired involved significant estimates and assumptions related to revenue growth rates, discount rates, and customer attrition rates. our determination of the fair value of the tradename acquired involved the use of significant estimates and assumptions related to revenue growth rates, royalty rates and discount rates. the company believes that the fair value assigned to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed are based on reasonable assumptions and estimates that marketplace participants would use. actual results could differ materially from these estimates. ipr&d is initially capitalized at fair value as an intangible asset with an indefinite life and assessed for impairment thereafter. when the ipr&d project is complete, it is reclassified as an amortizable purchased intangible asset and is amortized over its estimated useful life. if an ipr&d project is abandoned, we will record a charge for the value of the related intangible asset to our consolidated statement of operations in the period it is abandoned.
we continually monitor events and changes in circumstances that could indicate carrying amounts of finite-lived intangible assets may not be recoverable. when such events or changes in circumstances occur, we assess the recoverability of finite-lived intangible assets by determining whether the carrying value of such assets will be recovered through undiscounted expected future cash flows. if the total of the undiscounted future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of those assets, we recognize an impairment loss based on the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of the assets. during 2018, we recorded an impairment charge of $21 million related to purchased intangible assets within the diagnostics and genomics segment that were deemed unrecoverable.
our indefinite-lived intangible assets are ipr&d intangible assets. the accounting guidance allows a qualitative approach for testing indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment, similar to the issued impairment testing guidance for goodwill and allows the option to first assess qualitative factors (events and circumstances) that could have affected the significant inputs used in determining the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset to determine whether it is more-likely-than-not (i.e. greater than 50% chance) that the indefinite-lived intangible asset is impaired. an organization may choose to bypass the qualitative assessment for any indefinite-lived intangible asset in any period and proceed directly to calculating its fair value. we performed a qualitative test for impairment of indefinite-lived intangible assets as of september 30, 2019. based on the results of our qualitative testing, we believe that it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of these indefinite-lived intangible assets is greater than their respective carrying values. each quarter we review the events and circumstances to determine if impairment of indefinite-lived intangible asset is indicated. during the year ended october 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017 there were no impairments of indefinite-lived intangible assets.
accounting for income taxes. we must make certain estimates and judgments in determining income tax expense for financial statement purposes. these estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of tax credits, benefits and deductions, and in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities which arise from differences in the timing of recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purposes, as well as interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions. significant changes to these estimates may result in an increase or decrease to our tax provision in a subsequent period. on a quarterly basis, we provide for income taxes based upon an estimated annual effective tax rate. the effective tax rate is highly dependent upon the geographic composition of worldwide earnings, tax regulations governing each region, availability of tax credits and the effectiveness of our tax planning strategies. we monitor the changes in many factors and adjust our effective income tax rate on a timely basis. if actual results differ from these estimates, this could have a material effect on our financial condition and results of operations.
significant management judgment is also required in determining whether deferred tax assets will be realized in full or in part. when it is more-likely-than-not that all or some portion of deferred tax assets may not be realized, a valuation allowance must be established against such deferred tax assets. we consider all available positive and negative evidence on a jurisdiction-by-jurisdiction basis when assessing whether it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets are recoverable. we consider evidence such as our past operating results, the existence of losses in recent years and our forecast of future taxable income.
the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax law and regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions. although the guidance on the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes prescribes the use of a recognition and measurement model, the determination of whether an uncertain tax position has met those thresholds will continue to require significant judgment by management. in accordance with the guidance on the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes, for all u.s. and other tax jurisdictions, we recognize potential liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes and interest will be due. the ultimate resolution of tax uncertainties may differ from what is currently estimated, which could result in a material impact on income tax expense. if our estimate of income tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment, a further charge to expense would be required. if events occur and the payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be unnecessary, the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when we determine the liabilities are no longer necessary. we include interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits within the provision for income taxes on the consolidated statements of operations.
on december 22, 2017, the tax act was enacted into law. the tax act significantly changed the existing u.s. tax law and included numerous provisions that affect our business. there were no substantial changes from our 2018 annual report on form 10-k to the transition tax expenses amount. the company will continue to assess the impact of the further guidance from federal and state tax authorities on its business and consolidated financial statements. any future adjustments will be recognized as discrete income tax expense or benefit in the period the adjustments are determined. we have completed our analysis and elected to treat global intangible low-tax income ("gilti") as "current period cost". see note 6, "income taxes" for more details.
adoption of new pronouncements see note 2, "new accounting pronouncements," to the consolidated financial statements for a description of new accounting pronouncements.
foreign currency our revenues, costs and expenses, and monetary assets and liabilities are exposed to changes in foreign currency exchange rates as a result of our global operating and financing activities. the unfavorable effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates has decreased revenue by approximately 2 percentage point for the year ended october 31, 2019. when movements in foreign currency exchange rates have a negative impact on revenue it will also have a positive impact on our costs and expenses. the favorable effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates has increased revenue by approximately 2 percentage points for the year ended october 31, 2018. when movements in foreign currency exchange rates have a positive impact on revenue it will also have a negative impact on our costs and expenses. we calculate the impact of foreign currency exchange rates movements by applying the actual foreign currency exchange rates in effect during the last month of each quarter of the current year to both the applicable current and prior year periods. we hedge revenues, expenses and balance sheet exposures that are not denominated in the functional currencies of our subsidiaries on a short term and anticipated basis. we do experience some fluctuations within individual lines of the consolidated statement of operations and balance sheet because our hedging program is not designed to offset the currency movements in each category of revenues, expenses, monetary assets and liabilities. our hedging program is designed to hedge currency movements on a relatively short-term basis (up to a rolling twelve-month period). therefore, we are exposed to currency fluctuations over the longer term. to the extent that we are required to pay for all, or portions, of an acquisition price in foreign currencies, we may enter into foreign exchange contracts to reduce the risk that currency movements will impact the u.s. dollar cost of the transaction.

provision (benefit) for income taxes   $(152     )         $630                $119
for 2019, the company's income tax benefit was $152 million with an effective tax rate of (16.5) percent. for the year ended october 31, 2019, our effective tax rate and the resulting provision for income taxes were significantly impacted by the discrete benefit of $299 million related to the extension of the company's tax incentive in singapore.
for 2018, the company's income tax expense was $630 million with an effective tax rate of 66.6 percent. for the year ended october 31, 2018, our effective tax rate and the resulting provision for income taxes were significantly impacted by the discrete charge of $552 million related to the enactment of the tax act as discussed below.
for 2017, the company's income tax expense was $119 million with an effective tax rate of 14.8 percent. our effective tax rate is impacted by earnings realized in foreign jurisdictions with statutory tax rates lower than the federal statutory tax rate. during the year, the company determined a portion of current year foreign earnings from its low tax jurisdictions would not be considered as indefinitely reinvested. as such, a deferred tax liability for that portion of unremitted foreign earnings was accrued causing an increase in the annual tax expense. our annual effective tax rate also included tax benefits due to the settlement of an audit in germany for the years 2005 through 2008 and the lapse of u.s. statute of limitation for the fiscal years 2012 and 2013. this benefit was offset by a deferred tax liability required for the tax expected upon repatriation of related unremitted foreign earnings that were not asserted as indefinitely invested outside the u.s.
the company has negotiated tax holidays in several different jurisdictions, most significantly in singapore. the tax holidays provide lower rates of taxation on certain classes of income and require various thresholds of investments and employment or specific types of income in those jurisdictions. in december 2018, the tax holiday in singapore was renegotiated and extended through 2027. other tax holidays are due for renewal in 2020. as a result of the incentives, the impact of the tax holidays decreased income taxes by $368 million, $87 million, and $93 million in 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively. the benefit of the tax holidays on net income per share (diluted) was approximately $1.16, $0.27, and $0.29 in 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. the increase in the benefit from 2018 to 2019 is primarily due to the singapore restructuring and tax incentive modifications completed in 2019 in response to singapore tax law changes. of the $1.16 benefit of the tax incentives on net income per share (diluted) in 2019, $0.94 of the benefit relates to one-time items from the singapore restructuring.
2017 u.s. tax reform - tax cuts and jobs act on december 22, 2017, the tax act was enacted into law. the tax act enacted significant changes affecting our fiscal year 2018, including, but not limited to, (1) reducing the u.s. federal corporate tax rate and (2) imposing a one-time transition tax on certain unrepatriated earnings of foreign subsidiaries that had not been previously taxed in the u.s.
asc 740, income taxes, requires companies to recognize the effect of the tax law changes in the period of enactment. however, the sec staff issued staff accounting bulletin 118 ("sab 118") which allowed companies to record provisional amounts during a measurement period not extending beyond one year from the tax act enactment date. for the year ended october 31, 2018, the company recognized income tax expense related to the tax act of $552 million which includes (1) an expense of $499 million of u.s. transition tax and correlative items on deemed repatriated earnings of non-u.s. subsidiaries and (2) an expense of $53 million associated with the impact on deferred taxes resulting from the decreased u.s. corporate tax rate as described below.
deemed repatriation transition tax ("transition tax"): the transition tax is based on the company's total unrepatriated post-1986 earnings and profits ("e&p") of its foreign subsidiaries and the amount of non-u.s. taxes paid (tax pools) on such earnings. historically, the company permanently reinvested a significant portion of these post-1986 e&p outside the u.s. for the remaining portion, the company previously accrued deferred taxes. since the tax act required all foreign earnings to be taxed currently, the company recorded an income tax expense of $651 million for its one-time transition u.s. federal tax and a benefit of $152 million for the reversal of related deferred tax liabilities. the resulting $499 million net transition tax, reduced by existing tax credits, will be paid over 8 years in accordance with the election available under the tax act. we have completed our accounting for charges related to the transition tax.
reduction of u.s. federal corporate tax rate: the reduction of the corporate income tax rate requires companies to remeasure their deferred tax assets and liabilities as of the date of enactment. the amount recorded for the year ended october31, 2018 for the remeasurement due to tax rate change is $53 million. we have completed our accounting for the measurement of deferred taxes.
gilti:  the tax act subjects a u.s. corporation to tax on its gilti. u.s. gaap allows companies to make an accounting policy election to either (1) treat taxes due on future gilti inclusions in the u.s. taxable income as a current-period expense when incurred ("period cost method") or (2) factoring such amounts into a company's measurement of its deferred taxes ("deferred method"). we have completed our analysis and elected to treat gilti as a "current period cost".
indefinite reinvestment assertion: prior to the enactment of the tax act, the company had indefinite investment assertion on a significant portion of its undistributed earnings from foreign subsidiaries. as a result of the enactment of the tax act, we have reevaluated our historic assertion and no longer consider these earnings to be indefinitely reinvested in our foreign subsidiaries. the company has recorded a deferred tax liability of $10 million for foreign withholding taxes on repatriation of remaining undistributed earnings.
in the u.s., tax years remain open back to the year 2016 for federal income tax purposes and the year 2015 for significant states. in other major jurisdictions where the company conducts business, the tax years generally remain open back to the year 2009.
with these jurisdictions and the u.s., it is reasonably possible that there could be significant changes to our unrecognized tax benefits in the next twelve months due to either the expiration of a statute of limitation or a tax audit settlement which will be partially offset by an anticipated tax liability related to unremitted foreign earnings, where applicable. given the number of years and numerous matters that remain subject to examination in various tax jurisdictions, management is unable to estimate the range of possible changes to the balance of our unrecognized tax benefits.
the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax law and regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions. although the guidance on the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes prescribes the use of a recognition and measurement model, the determination of whether an uncertain tax position has met those thresholds will continue to require significant judgment by management. in accordance with the guidance on the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes, for all u.s. and other tax jurisdictions, we recognize potential liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes and interest will be due. the ultimate resolution of tax uncertainties may differ from what is currently estimated, which could result in a material impact on income tax expense. if our estimate of income tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment, a further charge to expense would be required. if events occur and the payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be unnecessary, the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when we determine the liabilities are no longer necessary.
segment overview through october 31, 2019, we have three business segments comprised of the life sciences and applied markets business, diagnostics and genomics business and the agilent crosslab business.
in 2019, we adopted new guidance related to the presentation of the net periodic pension and postretirement benefit cost. see note 2, "new accounting pronouncements" for more information. as a result, we have recast our historical segment results to conform to this new presentation required under this guidance.

financial condition liquidity and capital resources our financial position as of october 31, 2019 consisted of cash and cash equivalents of $1,382 million as compared to $2,247 million as of october 31, 2018.
as of october 31, 2019, approximately $1,310 million of our cash and cash equivalents is held outside of the u.s. by our foreign subsidiaries and can be repatriated to the u.s. as local working capital and other regulatory conditions permit. we utilize a variety of funding strategies to ensure that our worldwide cash is available in the locations in which it is needed.
as a result of the tax act, we are required to pay a one-time transition tax on deferred foreign income not previously subject to u.s. federal income tax. this is offset by tax attributes that results in a net tax payable of $200 million. the first installment of $36 million was paid in the second quarter of 2019 and the remaining will be paid over the next seven years. as part of the
business integration of some of our prior acquisitions, we undertook corporate restructurings in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2019 that involved on-shoring certain intangible properties held by our foreign subsidiaries to the united states.  these restructurings resulted in a cash tax liability of $231 million which is payable in the first quarter of fiscal year 2020.
we believe our cash and cash equivalents, cash generated from operations, and ability to access capital markets and credit lines will satisfy, for at least the next twelve months, our liquidity requirements, both globally and domestically, including the following: working capital needs, capital expenditures, business acquisitions, stock repurchases, cash dividends, contractual obligations, commitments, principal and interest payments on debt, and other liquidity requirements associated with our operations.

off balance sheet arrangements and other we have contractual commitments for non-cancelable operating leases. see note 16, "commitments and contingencies", to our consolidated financial statements for further information on our non-cancelable operating leases.
our liquidity is affected by many factors, some of which are based on normal ongoing operations of our business and some of which arise from fluctuations related to global economics and markets. our cash balances are generated and held in many locations throughout the world. local government regulations may restrict our ability to move cash balances to meet cash needs under certain circumstances. we do not currently expect such regulations and restrictions to impact our ability to pay vendors and conduct operations throughout our global organization.
contractual commitments our cash flows from operations are dependent on a number of factors, including fluctuations in our operating results, accounts receivable collections, inventory management, and the timing of tax and other payments. as a result, the impact of contractual obligations on our liquidity and capital resources in future periods should be analyzed in conjunction with such factors.

•   recent accounting pronouncements overview equinix provides a global, vendor-neutral data center, interconnection and edge services platform with offerings that aim to enable our customers to reach everywhere, interconnect everyone and integrate everything. global enterprises, service providers and business ecosystems of industry partners rely on equinix ibx data centers and expertise around the world for the safe housing of their critical it equipment and to protect and connect the world's most valued information assets. they also look to platform equinix® for the ability to directly and securely interconnect to the networks, clouds and content that enable today's information-driven global digital economy. recent equinix ibx data center openings and acquisitions, as well as xscale data center investments, have expanded our total global footprint to 210 ibx and xscale data centers across 55 markets around the world. equinix offers the following solutions:
•   interconnection and data exchange solutions;
•   edge services for deploying networking, security and hardware; and
•   remote expert support and professional services.
our interconnected data centers around the world allow our customers to increase information and application delivery performance to users, and quickly access distributed it infrastructures and business and digital ecosystems, while significantly reducing costs. the equinix global platform and the quality of our ibx data centers, interconnection offerings and edge services have enabled us to establish a critical mass of customers. as more customers choose platform equinix, for bandwidth cost and performance reasons it benefits their suppliers and business partners to colocate in the same data centers. this adjacency creates a "network effect" that enables our customers to capture the full economic and performance benefits of our offerings. these partners, in turn, pull in their business partners, creating a "marketplace" for their services. our global platform enables scalable, reliable and cost-effective interconnection that increases data traffic exchange while lowering overall cost and increasing flexibility. our focused business model is built on our critical mass of enterprise and service provider customers and the resulting "marketplace" effect. this global platform, combined with our strong financial position, continues to drive new customer growth and bookings.
historically, our market was served by large telecommunications carriers who have bundled their products and services with their colocation offerings. the data center market landscape has evolved to include private and vendor-neutral multitenant data center providers, hyperscale cloud providers, managed infrastructure and application hosting providers, and systems integrators. it is estimated that equinix is one of more than 1,200 companies that provide mtdc offerings around the world. each of these data center solutions providers can bundle various colocation, interconnection and network offerings and outsourced it infrastructure solutions. we are able to offer our customers a global platform that reaches 26 countries with the industry's largest and most active ecosystem of partners in our sites, proven operational reliability, improved application performance and a highly scalable set of offerings.
the cabinet utilization rate represents the percentage of cabinet space billed versus total cabinet capacity, which is used to measure how efficiently we are managing our cabinet capacity. our cabinet utilization rate varies from market to market among our ibx data centers across the americas, emea and asia-pacific regions. our cabinet utilization rates were approximately 79% and 81%, respectively, as of december 31, 2019 and 2018. excluding the impact of our ibx data center expansion projects that have opened during the last 12 months, our cabinet utilization rate would have increased to approximately 82% as of december 31, 2019. we continue to monitor the available capacity in each of our selected markets. to the extent we have limited capacity available in a given market, it may limit our ability for growth in that market. we perform demand studies on an ongoing basis to determine if future expansion is warranted in a market. in addition, power and cooling requirements for most customers are growing on a per unit basis. as a result, customers are consuming an increasing amount of power per cabinet. although we generally do not control the amount of power our customers draw from installed circuits, we have negotiated power consumption limitations with certain high power-demand customers. this increased power consumption has driven us to build out our new ibx data centers to support power and cooling needs twice that of previous ibx data centers. we could face power limitations in our ibx data centers, even though we may have additional physical cabinet capacity available within a specific ibx data center. this could have a negative impact on the available utilization capacity of a given ibx data center, which could have a negative impact on our ability to grow revenues, affecting our financial performance, operating results and cash flows.
in 2019, we closed our joint venture with gic to develop and operate xscale data centers to serve the needs of the growing hyperscale data center market, including the world's largest cloud service providers. upon closing, the joint venture acquired certain data center facilities in europe, with the opportunity to add additional facilities to the joint venture in the future.
strategically, we will continue to look at attractive opportunities to grow our market share and selectively improve our footprint and offerings. as was the case with our recent expansions and acquisitions, our expansion criteria will be dependent on a number of factors, including but not limited to demand from new and existing customers, quality of the design, power capacity, access to networks, clouds and software partners, capacity availability in the current market location, amount of incremental investment required by us in the targeted property, automation capabilities, developer talent pool, lead-time to break even on a free cash flow basis and in-place customers. like our recent expansions and acquisitions, the right combination of these factors may be attractive to us. depending on the circumstances, these transactions may require additional capital expenditures funded by upfront cash payments or through long-term financing arrangements in order to bring these properties up to equinix standards. property expansion may be in the form of purchases of real property, long-term leasing arrangements or acquisitions. future purchases, construction or acquisitions may be completed by us or with partners or potential customers to minimize the outlay of cash, which can be significant.
our business is based on a recurring revenue model comprised of colocation and related interconnection and managed infrastructure offerings. we consider these offerings recurring because our customers are generally billed on a fixed and recurring basis each month for the duration of their contract, which is generally one to three years in length. our recurring revenues have comprised more than 90% of our total revenues during the past three years. in addition, during the past three years, more than 80% of our monthly recurring revenue bookings came from existing customers, contributing to our revenue growth. our largest customer accounted for approximately 3% of our recurring revenues for the years ended december 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017. our 50 largest customers accounted for approximately 39%, 38% and 37%, respectively, of our recurring revenues for the years ended december 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017.
our non-recurring revenues are primarily comprised of installation services related to a customer's initial deployment and professional services we perform. these services are considered to be non-recurring because they are billed typically once, upon completion of the installation or the professional services work performed. the majority of these non-recurring revenues are typically billed on the first invoice distributed to the customer in connection with their initial installation. however, revenues from installation services are deferred and recognized ratably over the period of the contract term. additionally, revenue from contract settlements, when a customer wishes to terminate their contract early, is generally treated as a contract modification and recognized ratably over the remaining term of the contract, if any. as a percentage of total revenues, we expect non-recurring revenues to represent less than 10% of total revenues for the foreseeable future.
operating expenses:
cost of revenues. the largest components of our cost of revenues are depreciation, rental payments related to our leased ibx data centers, utility costs, including electricity, bandwidth access, ibx data center employees' salaries and benefits, including stock-based compensation, repairs and maintenance, supplies and equipment and security. a majority of our cost of revenues is fixed in nature and should not vary significantly from period to period, unless we expand our existing ibx data centers or open or acquire new ibx data centers. however, there are certain costs that are considered more variable in nature, including utilities and supplies that are directly related to growth in our existing and new customer base. we expect the cost of our utilities, specifically electricity, will generally increase in the future on a per-unit or fixed basis, in addition to the variable increase related to the growth in consumption by our customers. in addition, the cost of electricity is generally higher in the summer months, as compared to other times of the year. to the extent we incur increased utility costs, such increased costs could materially impact our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. furthermore, to the extent we incur increased electricity or other costs as a result of either climate change policies or the physical effects of climate change, such increased costs could materially impact our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
sales and marketing. our sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of compensation and related costs for sales and marketing personnel, including stock-based compensation, amortization of contract costs, marketing programs, public relations, promotional materials and travel, as well as bad debt expense and amortization of customer relationship intangible assets.
general and administrative. our general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expenses, including stock-based compensation, accounting, legal and other professional service fees, and other general corporate expenses, such as our corporate regional headquarters office leases and some depreciation expense on back office systems.
taxation as a reit we elected to be taxed as a reit for u.s. federal income tax purposes beginning with our 2015 taxable year. as of december 31, 2019, our reit structure included all of our data center operations in the u.s., canada, japan, singapore and the data center operations in emea with the exception of bulgaria, the united arab emirates, and the data center operations outside amsterdam in the netherlands. our data center operations in other jurisdictions are operated as trss. we included our interest in the joint venture in our reit structure.
as a reit, we generally are permitted to deduct from our u.s. taxable income the dividends we pay to our stockholders. the income represented by such dividends is not subject to u.s. federal income taxes at the entity level but is taxed, if at all, at the stockholder level. nevertheless, the income of our trss which hold our u.s. operations that may not be reit compliant is subject to u.s. corporate federal and state income taxes, as applicable. likewise, our foreign subsidiaries continue to be subject to foreign income taxes in jurisdictions in which they hold assets or conduct operations, regardless of whether held or conducted through trss or through qrss. we are also subject to a separate u.s. federal corporate income tax on any gain recognized from a sale of a reit asset where our basis in the asset is determined by reference to the basis of the asset in the hands of a c corporation (such as an asset held by us or a qrs following the liquidation or other conversion of a former trs). this built-in-gains tax is generally applicable to any disposition of such an asset during the five-year period after the date we first owned the asset as a reit asset to the extent of the built-in-gain based on the fair market value of such asset on the date we first held the asset as a reit asset. if we fail to remain qualified for u.s. federal income taxation as a reit, we will be subject to u.s. federal income taxes at regular corporate income tax rates. even if we remain qualified for u.s. federal income taxation as a reit, we may be subject to some federal, state, local and foreign taxes on our income and property in addition to taxes owed with respect to our trss' operations. in particular, while state income tax regimes often parallel the u.s. federal income tax regime for reits, many states do not completely follow federal rules, and some may not follow them at all.
we continue to monitor our reit compliance in order to maintain our qualification for u.s. federal income taxation as a reit. for this and other reasons, as necessary, we may convert some of our data center operations in other countries into the reit structure in future periods. we converted our data center operations in singapore into the reit structure effective september 30, 2019.
on each of march 20, june 19, september 18, and december 11, 2019, we paid quarterly cash dividends of $2.46 per share. we expect these quarterly and other applicable distributions to equal or exceed the reit taxable income that we recognized in 2019.
•   in march, we issued and sold 2,985,575 shares of common stock for net proceeds of approximately $1,213.4 million, after underwriting discounts, commissions and offering expenses. see note 12 within the consolidated financial statements.
•   in april, we completed the acquisition of switch datacenters' ams1 data center business in amsterdam, netherlands (the "am11 data center"), for a cash purchase price of approximately €30.6 million, or approximately $34.3 million. see note 3 within the consolidated financial statements.
•   in october, we closed our joint venture with gic to develop and operate xscale data centers in europe. upon closing, we sold certain data center facilities in europe to the joint venture. see note 5 and note 6 within the consolidated financial statements.
•   in november, we issued $2.8 billion in senior notes due 2024, 2026 and 2029 with a weighted average interest rate of 2.93% and redeemed $1.9 billion in senior notes due 2022, 2023 and 2025 with a weighted average interest rate of 5.47% in november and december 2019. see note 11 within the consolidated financial statements.
•   by the end of december, we had sold 903,555 shares of our common stock for approximately $447.7 million in proceeds, net of payment of commissions and other offering expenses, under our current atm program. see note 12 within the consolidated financial statements.
results of operations our results of operations for the year ended december 31, 2019 include the results of operations from the acquisition of the am11 data center from april 18, 2019 within the emea region. our results of operations for the year ended december 31, 2018 include the results of operations from the acquisition of metronode from april 18, 2018 within the asia-pacific region and the acquisition of infomart dallas from april 2, 2018 within the americas region.
our results of operations for the year ended december 31, 2019 reflect the adoption of topic 842, leases, while the comparative information has not been restated and continues to be reported under the lease accounting standard in effect for those periods. see note 1 within the consolidated financial statements for further discussion.
in order to provide a framework for assessing our performance excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations, we supplement the year-over-year actual change in operating results with comparative changes on a constant currency basis. presenting constant currency results of operations is a non-gaap financial measure. see "non-gaap financial measures" below for further discussion.
years ended december 31,                          % change
americas revenues. during the year ended december 31, 2019, americas revenue increased by 4% (5% on a constant currency basis). growth in americas revenues was primarily due to:
•   approximately $10.6 million of incremental revenues from the infomart dallas acquisition;
•   $52.6 million of incremental revenues generated from our recently-opened ibx data centers or ibx data center expansions; and
•   an increase in orders from both our existing customers and new customers during the period.
emea revenues.  during the year ended december 31, 2019, emea revenue increased by 16% (14% on a constant currency basis). growth in emea revenues was primarily due to:
•   approximately $76.0 million of incremental revenues generated from our recently-opened ibx data centers or ibx data center expansions;
•   an increase in orders from both our existing customers and new customers during the period; and
•   a net increase of $110.6 million of realized cash flow hedge gains from foreign currency forward contracts.
asia-pacific revenues.  during the year ended december 31, 2019, asia-pacific revenue increased by 14% (16% on a constant currency basis). growth in asia-pacific revenue was primarily due to:
•   approximately $16.6 million of incremental revenues from the metronode acquisition;
•   approximately $35.4 million of incremental revenues generated from our recently-opened ibx data centers or ibx data center expansions; and
•   an increase in orders from both our existing customers and new customers during the period.

cost of revenues
(dollars in thousands; percentages indicate expenses as a percentage of revenues)
americas cost of revenues. during the year ended december 31, 2019, americas cost of revenues increased by 3% (4% on a constant currency basis). the increase in our americas cost of revenues was primarily due to:
•   $11.3 million of higher utilities costs driven by ibx data center expansions, increased utility usage and utility price increases;
•   $10.0 million of higher bandwidth costs in support of our business growth;
•   approximately $9.9 million of incremental cost of revenues from the infomart dallas acquisition;
•   $8.6 million of higher compensation costs, including salaries, bonuses, and stock-based compensation; and
•   $7.2 million of higher depreciation expense primarily due to ibx expansion activity.
this increase was partially offset by:
•   $8.9 million of reduced property tax expenses, primarily due to accrual releases based on tax appeal settlements; and
•   $6.9 million of reduced office expenses.
emea cost of revenues. during the year ended december 31, 2019, emea cost of revenues increased by 11% (12% on a constant currency basis). the increase in our emea cost of revenues was primarily due to:
•   a net increase of $40.6 million of realized cash flow hedge losses from foreign currency forward contracts;
•   $30.5 million of higher utilities costs driven by increased utility usage to support ibx data center expansions and utility price increases, primarily in germany, the netherlands and the united kingdom;
•   $21.3 million of higher costs from increased equipment resale activities, primarily in germany and the united kingdom;
•   $7.9 million of higher depreciation expenses driven by ibx data center expansions in london, frankfurt and amsterdam; and
•   $7.2 million of higher compensation costs, including salaries, bonuses, stock-based compensation and headcount growth.
this increase was partially offset by:
•   $5.9 million of reduced outside services consulting expenses.
asia-pacific cost of revenues. during the year ended december 31, 2019, asia-pacific cost of revenues increased by 12% (14% on a constant currency basis). the increase in our asia-pacific cost of revenues was primarily due to:
•   $45.3 million of higher rent and facility costs and utilities costs, primarily driven by expansions and higher utility usage in hong kong, singapore, australia and japan;
•   $20.5 million of higher depreciation expense, primarily from ibx data center expansions in singapore, japan, australia and hong kong;
•   approximately $11.2 million of incremental cost of revenues from the metronode acquisition; and
•   $4.3 million of higher outside services consulting expenses.
this increase was partially offset by:
•   $12.8 million of reduced costs due to lower equipment resale activities in the current period as compared to the prior year.
we expect americas, emea and asia-pacific cost of revenues to increase as we continue to grow our business, including from the impact of acquisitions.
sales and marketing expenses. our sales and marketing expenses for the years ended december 31, 2019 and 2018 were split among the following geographic regions (dollars in thousands):
years ended december 31,                          % change
sales and marketing expenses
(dollars in thousands; percentages indicate expenses as a percentage of revenues)
americas sales and marketing expenses. during the year ended december 31, 2019, americas sales and marketing expenses increased by 2% (3% on a constant currency basis). the increase in our americas sales and marketing expenses was primarily due to:
•   $7.4 million of higher compensation costs, including sales compensation, salaries and stock-based compensation and headcount growth; and
•   $3.7 million of higher travel and entertainment expenses.
emea sales and marketing expenses. during the year ended december 31, 2019, emea sales and marketing increased by 4% (and also 4% on a constant currency basis). the increase in our emea sales and marketing expenses was primarily due to:
•   a net increase of $7.2 million of realized cash flow hedge losses from foreign currency forward contracts; and
•   $5.6 million increase in compensation costs, including sales compensation, salaries and stock-based compensation and headcount growth.
this increase was partially offset by:
•   $6.2 million of reduced amortization expense driven by certain intangibles being fully amortized in the current year.
asia-pacific sales and marketing expenses. our asia-pacific sales and marketing expense did not materially change during the year ended december 31, 2019 as compared to the year ended december 31, 2018.
we anticipate that we will continue to invest in americas, emea and asia-pacific sales and marketing initiatives and expect our americas, emea and asia-pacific sales and marketing expenses to increase as we grow our business. additionally, given that certain global sales and marketing functions are located within the u.s., we expect americas sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of revenues to be higher than our other regions.
years ended december 31,                          % change
(dollars in thousands; percentages indicate expenses as a percentage of revenues)
•   $51.1 million of higher compensation costs, including salaries, bonuses, stock-based compensation, and headcount growth;
•   $22.3 million of higher depreciation expense associated with the implementation of certain systems to support the integration and growth of our business; and
•   $10.7 million of higher consulting expenses in support of our business growth.
•   a net increase of $8.8 million of realized cash flow hedge losses from foreign currency forward contracts; and
•   $3.9 million of higher compensation costs, including salaries, bonuses, stock-based compensation and headcount growth.
•   $3.8 million of higher compensation costs, including salaries, bonuses, stock-based compensation and headcount growth.
going forward, although we are carefully monitoring our spending, we expect americas, emea and asia-pacific general and administrative expenses to increase as we continue to further scale our operations to support our growth, including investments in our back office systems and investments to maintain our qualification for taxation as a reit and to integrate recent acquisitions. additionally, given that our corporate headquarters is located within the u.s., we expect americas general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues to be higher than our other regions.
transaction costs.  during the year ended december 31, 2019, we recorded transaction costs totaling $24.8 million primarily related to costs incurred in connection with the formation of the new joint venture in the emea region. during the year ended december 31, 2018, we recorded transaction costs totaling $34.4 million, primarily in the asia-pacific and americas regions, due to our acquisitions of metronode and infomart dallas.
impairment charges.  during the year ended december 31, 2019, we recorded impairment charges totaling $15.8 million in the americas region primarily as a result of the fair value adjustment for the new york 12 ("ny12") data center, which was classified as a held for sale asset before it was sold in october 2019. we did not have impairment charges during the year ended december 31, 2018.
gain on asset sales. during the year ended december 31, 2019, we recorded a gain on asset sales of $44.3 million primarily relating to the sale of both the london 10 and paris 8 data centers, as well as certain construction development and leases in london and frankfurt, as part of the closing of the joint venture. during the year ended december 31, 2018, we recorded gain on asset sales of $6.0 million primarily relating to the sale of a data center in frankfurt.
years ended december 31,   % change
americas income from operations. our americas income from operations did not materially change during the year ended december 31, 2019 as compared to the year ended december 31, 2018.
emea income from operations. during the year ended december 31, 2019, emea income from operations increased by 35% (24% on a constant currency basis). the increase in our emea income from operations was primarily due to higher revenues as a result of our ibx data center expansion activity and organic growth, as described above, as well as lower operating expenses as a percentage of revenues.
asia-pacific income from operations. during the year ended december 31, 2019, asia-pacific income from operations increased by 32% (35% on a constant currency basis). the increase in our asia-pacific income from operations was primarily due to higher revenues as a result of our ibx data center expansion activity, acquisition and organic growth as described above, lower operating expenses as a percentage of revenues and lower transaction costs in the current period as compared to the prior year.
interest expense.  interest expense decreased to $479.7 million for the year ended december 31, 2019 from $521.5 million for the year ended december 31, 2018, primarily attributable to the reduction in lease interest expense due to the conversion of certain build-to-suit leases to operating leases upon the adoption of asc 842 and the utilization of cross-currency interest rate swaps in 2019. during the years ended december 31, 2019 and 2018, we capitalized $32.2 million and $19.9 million, respectively, of interest expense to construction in progress.
other income. we recorded net other income of $27.8 million and $14.0 million for the years ended december 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. other income is primarily comprised of foreign currency exchange gains and losses during the periods.
loss on debt extinguishment. during the year ended december 31, 2019, the company recorded $52.8 million of loss on debt extinguishment primarily related to the loss on debt extinguishment from the redemption of the senior notes due 2022, 2023 and 2025.
during the year ended december 31, 2018, the company recorded $51.4 million of loss on debt extinguishment comprised of:
•   $17.1 million of loss on debt extinguishment as a result of amendments to leases impacting the related financing obligations;
•   $19.5 million of loss on debt extinguishment from the settlement of financing obligations as a result of the infomart dallas acquisition;
•   $12.6 million of loss on debt extinguishment as a result of the settlement of financing obligations for properties purchased; and
•   $2.2 million of loss on debt extinguishment as a result of the redemption of the japanese yen term loan.
income taxes. we operate as a reit for u.s. federal income tax purposes. as a reit, we are generally not subject to u.s. federal and state income taxes on our taxable income distributed to stockholders. we intend to distribute or have distributed the entire taxable income generated by the operations of our reit and qrss for the tax years ended december 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. as such, other than tax attributable to built-in-gains recognized and withholding taxes, no provision for u.s. federal income taxes for the reit and qrss has been included in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for the years ended december 31, 2019 and 2018.
we have made trs elections for some of our subsidiaries in and outside the u.s. in general, a trs may provide services that would otherwise be considered impermissible for reits to provide and may hold assets that may not be reit compliant.
u.s. federal income taxes for the trs entities located in the u.s. and foreign income taxes for our foreign operations regardless of whether the foreign operations are operated as qrss or trss have been accrued, as necessary, for the years ended december 31, 2019 and 2018.
for the years ended december 31, 2019 and 2018, we recorded $185.4 million and $67.7 million of income tax expenses, respectively. our effective tax rates were 26.8% and 15.6%, respectively, for the years ended december 31, 2019 and 2018. the higher effective tax rate in 2019 as compared to 2018 is primarily due to a release of valuation allowance in 2018 as a result of a legal entity reorganization in our americas region.
adjusted ebitda. adjusted ebitda is a key factor in how we assess the operating performance of our segments and develop regional growth strategies such as ibx data center expansion decisions. we define adjusted ebitda as income or loss from operations excluding depreciation, amortization, accretion, stock-based compensation expense, restructuring charges, impairment charges, transaction costs and gain on asset sales. see "non-gaap financial measures" below for more information about adjusted ebitda and a reconciliation of adjusted ebitda to income or loss from operations. our adjusted ebitda for the years ended december 31, 2019 and 2018 was split among the following geographic regions (dollars in thousands):
years ended december 31,                                  % change
americas adjusted ebitda. during the year ended december 31, 2019, americas adjusted ebitda increased by 5% (and also 5% on a constant currency basis). the increase in our americas adjusted ebitda was primarily due to higher revenues as a result of our ibx data center expansion activity, acquisition and organic growth as described above.
emea adjusted ebitda. during the year ended december 31, 2019, emea adjusted ebitda increased by 19% (17% on a constant currency basis). the increase in our emea adjusted ebitda was primarily due to higher revenues as a result of our ibx data center expansion activity and organic growth, as described above, as well as lower operating expenses as a percentage of revenues.
asia-pacific adjusted ebitda. during the year ended december 31, 2019, asia-pacific adjusted ebitda increased by 17% (19% on a constant currency basis). the increase in our asia-pacific adjusted ebitda was primarily due to higher revenues as a result of our ibx data center expansion activity, acquisition and organic growth as described above and lower operating expenses as a percentage of revenues.
non-gaap financial measures we provide all information required in accordance with gaap, but we believe that evaluating our ongoing operating results may be difficult if limited to reviewing only gaap financial measures. accordingly, we use non-gaap financial measures to evaluate our operations.
non-gaap financial measures are not a substitute for financial information prepared in accordance with gaap. non-gaap financial measures should not be considered in isolation, but should be considered together with the most directly comparable gaap financial measures and the reconciliation of the non-gaap financial measures to the most directly comparable gaap financial measures. we have presented such non-gaap financial measures to provide investors with an additional tool to evaluate our operating results in a manner that focuses on what management believes to be our core, ongoing business operations. we believe that the inclusion of these non-gaap financial measures provides consistency and comparability with past reports and provides a better understanding of the overall performance of the business and ability to perform in subsequent periods. we believe that if we did not provide such non-gaap financial information, investors would not have all the necessary data to analyze equinix effectively.
investors should note that the non-gaap financial measures used by us may not be the same non-gaap financial measures, and may not be calculated in the same manner, as those of other companies. investors should therefore exercise caution when comparing non-gaap financial measures used by us to similarly titled non-gaap financial measures of other companies.
our primary non-gaap financial measures, adjusted ebitda and adjusted funds from operations ("affo"), exclude depreciation expense as these charges primarily relate to the initial construction costs of our ibx data centers and do not reflect our current or future cash spending levels to support our business. our ibx data centers are long-lived assets and have an economic life greater than 10 years. the construction costs of an ibx data center do not recur with respect to such data center, although we may incur initial construction costs in future periods with respect to additional ibx data centers, and future capital expenditures remain minor relative to our initial investment. this is a trend we expect to continue. in addition, depreciation is also based on the estimated useful lives of our ibx data centers. these estimates could vary from actual performance of the asset, are based on historical costs incurred to build out our ibx data centers and are not indicative of current or expected future capital expenditures. therefore, we exclude depreciation from our operating results when evaluating our operations.
in addition, in presenting adjusted ebitda and affo, we exclude amortization expense related to acquired intangible assets. amortization expense is significantly affected by the timing and magnitude of our acquisitions and these charges may vary in amount from period to period. we exclude amortization expense to facilitate a more meaningful evaluation of our current operating performance and comparisons to our prior periods. we exclude accretion expense, both as it relates to asset retirement obligations as well as accrued restructuring charge liabilities, as these expenses represent costs which we believe are not meaningful in evaluating our current operations. we exclude stock-based compensation expense, as it can vary significantly from period to period based on share price, the timing, size and nature of equity awards. as such, we, and many investors and analysts, exclude stock-based compensation expense to compare our operating results with those of other companies. we also exclude restructuring charges. the restructuring charges relate to our decisions to exit leases for excess space adjacent to several of our ibx data centers, which we did not intend to build out, or our decision to reverse such restructuring charges. we also exclude impairment charges related to certain long-lived assets. the impairment charges are related to expense recognized whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of long-lived assets are not recoverable. we also exclude gain or loss on asset sales as it represents profit or loss that is not meaningful in evaluating the current or future operating performance. finally, we exclude transaction costs from affo and adjusted ebitda to allow more comparable comparisons of our financial results to our historical operations. the transaction costs relate to costs we incur in connection with business combinations and the formation of joint ventures, including advisory, legal, accounting, valuation, and other professional or consulting fees. such charges generally are not relevant to assessing the long-term performance of the company. in addition, the frequency and amount of such charges vary significantly based on the size and timing of the transactions. management believes items such as restructuring charges, impairment charges, gain or loss on asset sales and transaction costs are non-core transactions; however, these types of costs may occur in future periods.
adjusted ebitda we define adjusted ebitda as income from operations excluding depreciation, amortization, accretion, stock-based compensation expense, restructuring charges, impairment charges, transaction costs, and gain on asset sales as presented below (in thousands):
impairment charges                                         15,790                         -                         -
our adjusted ebitda results have improved each year and in each region in total dollars due to the improved operating results discussed earlier in "results of operations", as well as the nature of our business model consisting of a recurring revenue stream and a cost structure which has a large base that is fixed in nature also discussed earlier in "overview".
funds from operations ("ffo") and affo we use ffo and affo, which are non-gaap financial measures commonly used in the reit industry. ffo is calculated in accordance with the standards established by the national association of real estate investment trusts. ffo represents net income (loss), excluding gain (loss) from the disposition of real estate assets, depreciation and amortization on real estate assets and adjustments for unconsolidated joint ventures' and non-controlling interests' share of these items.
in presenting affo, we exclude certain items that we believe are not good indicators of our current or future operating performance. affo represents ffo excluding depreciation and amortization expense on non-real estate assets, accretion, stock-based compensation, restructuring charges, impairment charges, transaction costs, an installation revenue adjustment, a straight-line rent expense adjustment, a contract cost adjustment, amortization of deferred financing costs and debt discounts and premiums, gain (loss) on debt extinguishment, an income tax expense adjustment, recurring capital expenditures, net income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of tax, and adjustments from ffo to affo for unconsolidated joint ventures' and noncontrolling interests' share of these items. the adjustments for installation revenue, straight-line rent expense and contract costs are intended to isolate the cash activity included within the straight-lined or amortized results in the consolidated statement of operations. we exclude the amortization of deferred financing costs and debt discounts and premiums as these expenses relate to the initial costs incurred in connection with debt financings that have no current or future cash obligations. we exclude gain (loss) on debt extinguishment since it generally represents the write-off of initial costs incurred in connection with debt financings or a cost that is incurred to reduce future interest costs and is not a good indicator of our current or future operating performance. we include an income tax expense adjustment, which represents the non-cash tax impact due to changes in valuation allowances, uncertain tax positions and deferred taxes that do not relate to current period's operations. we deduct recurring capital expenditures, which represent expenditures to extend the useful life of its ibx data centers or other assets that are required to support current revenues. we also exclude net income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of tax, which represents results that may not recur and are not a good indicator of our current future operating performance.

our affo results have improved due to the improved operating results discussed earlier in "results of operations," as well as due to the nature of our business model which consists of a recurring revenue stream and a cost structure which has a large base that is fixed in nature as discussed earlier in "overview."
constant currency presentation our revenues and certain operating expenses (cost of revenues, sales and marketing and general and administrative expenses) from our international operations have represented and will continue to represent a significant portion of our total revenues and certain operating expenses. as a result, our revenues and certain operating expenses have been and will continue to be affected by changes in the u.s. dollar against major international currencies. during the year ended december 31, 2019 as compared to the same period in 2018, the u.s. dollar was stronger relative to the brazilian real, euro, british pound, singapore dollar and australian dollar, which resulted in an unfavorable foreign currency impact on revenue, operating income and adjusted ebitda, and a favorable foreign currency impact on operating expenses. in order to provide a framework for assessing how each of our business segments performed excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations, we present period-over-period percentage changes in our revenues and certain operating expenses on a constant currency basis in addition to the historical amounts as reported. our constant currency presentation excludes the impact of our foreign currency cash flow hedging activities. presenting constant currency results of operations is a non-gaap financial measure and is not meant to be considered in isolation or as an alternative to gaap results of operations. however, we have presented this non-gaap financial measure to provide investors with an additional tool to evaluate our operating results. to present this information, our current period revenues and certain operating expenses from entities reporting in currencies other than the u.s. dollar are converted into u.s. dollars at constant exchange rates rather than the actual exchange rates in effect during the respective periods (i.e. average rates in effect for the year ended december 31, 2018 are used as exchange rates for the year ended december 31, 2019 when comparing the year ended december 31, 2019 with the year ended december 31, 2018).
liquidity and capital resources as of december 31, 2019, our total indebtedness was comprised of debt and lease obligations totaling approximately $11.9 billion (gross of debt issuance cost, debt discount, plus mortgage premium) consisting of:
•   approximately $9,029.2 million of principal from our senior notes;
•   $1,371.9 million of principal from our loans payable and mortgage.
we believe we have sufficient cash, coupled with anticipated cash generated from operating activities, to meet our operating requirements, including repayment of the current portion of our debt as it becomes due, payment of regular dividend distributions and completion of our publicly-announced expansion projects.
•   redeemed $1,906.3 million of senior notes due 2022, 2023 and 2025;
•   repaid $300.0 million of 5.0% infomart senior notes according to their repayment terms;
•   issued and sold 2,985,575 shares of common stock in a public equity offering and received net proceeds of approximately $1,213.4 million, net of underwriting discounts, commissions and offering expenses; and
•   issued and sold 903,555 shares of common stock under our atm program, for proceeds of approximately $447.5 million, net of payment of commissions to sales agents and other offering expenses.
as of december 31, 2019, we had $1,879.9 million of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments, of which approximately $1,456.8 million was held in the u.s. in addition to our cash and investment portfolio, we had $1.9 billion of additional liquidity available to us from our $2.0 billion revolving facility and $300.0 million of shares issuance available for sale under our atm program.
besides any further financing activity we may pursue, customer collections are our primary source of cash. while we believe we have a strong customer base, and have continued to experience relatively strong collections, if the current market conditions were to deteriorate, some of our customers may have difficulty paying us and we may experience increased churn in our customer base, including reductions in their commitments to us, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity. additionally, we may pursue additional expansion opportunities, primarily the build out of new ibx data centers, in certain of our existing markets which are at or near capacity within the next year, as well as potential acquisitions and joint ventures. while we expect to fund these plans with our existing resources, additional financing, either debt or equity, may be required, and if current market conditions were to deteriorate, we may be unable to secure additional financing, or any such additional financing may only be available to us on unfavorable terms. an inability to pursue additional expansion opportunities will have a material adverse effect on our ability to maintain our desired level of revenue growth in future periods.
sources and uses of cash years ended december 31,
net cash provided by operating activities      $1,992,728                  $1,815,426
operating activities our cash provided by our operations is generated by colocation, interconnection, managed infrastructure and other revenues. our primary uses of cash from our operating activities include compensation and related costs, interest payments, other general corporate expenditures and taxes. the increase in net cash provided by operating activities during 2019 compared to 2018 was primarily due to improved operating results combined with the inclusion of full year operating results of the acquisitions of infomart dallas and metronode closed in april 2018, offset by increases in cash paid for cost of revenues, operating expenses, interest expense and income taxes.
investing activities the decrease in net cash used in investing activities during 2019 compared to 2018 was primarily due to the decrease in spending for business acquisitions of approximately $795.5 million, primarily due to the metronode and infomart dallas acquisitions in 2018 combined with an increase in proceeds from asset sales of approximately $346.6 million, primarily due to the sale of xscale data center facilities in connection with the closing of the joint venture.
during 2020, we anticipate our ibx expansion construction activity will increase from our 2019 levels. if the opportunity to expand is greater than planned and we have sufficient funding to pursue such expansion opportunities, we may further increase the level of capital expenditure to support this growth as well as pursue additional business and real estate acquisitions or joint ventures.

contractual obligations and off-balance-sheet arrangements we lease a majority of our ibx data centers and certain equipment under long-term lease agreements. the following represents our debt maturities, financings, leases and other contractual commitments as of december 31, 2019 (in thousands):
operating leases (3)                           193,663                 191,954                 183,908               168,353                 156,502           1,106,944             2,001,324
(1)   represents principal of senior notes, term loans and other loans payable, as well as premium on mortgage payable.
(2)   represents interest on mortgage payable, senior notes, term loan facilities and other loans payable based on their approximate interest rates as of december 31, 2019, as well as the credit facility fee for the revolving credit facility.
(3)   represents lease payments under finance and operating lease arrangements, including renewal options that are certain to be exercised.
(5)   represents liability, net of future accretion expense.
in connection with certain of our leases and other contracts requiring deposits, we entered into 41 irrevocable letters of credit totaling $84.0 million under the revolving credit facility. these letters of credit were provided in lieu of cash deposits. if the landlords for these ibx leases decide to draw down on these letters of credit triggered by an event of default under the lease, we will be required to fund these letters of credit either through cash collateral or borrowing under the revolving credit facility. these contingent commitments are not reflected in the table above.
we had accrued liabilities related to uncertain tax positions totaling approximately $132.2 million as of december 31, 2019. these liabilities, which are reflected on our balance sheet, are not reflected in the table above since it is unclear when these liabilities will be paid.
primarily as a result of our various ibx data center expansion projects, as of december 31, 2019, we were contractually committed for $795.0 million of unaccrued capital expenditures, primarily for ibx equipment not yet delivered and labor not
yet provided in connection with the work necessary to complete construction and open these ibx data centers prior to making them available to customers for installation. this amount, which is expected to be paid during 2020 and thereafter, is reflected in the table above as "other contractual commitments."
we had other non-capital purchase commitments in place as of december 31, 2019, such as commitments to purchase power in select locations and other open purchase orders, which contractually bind us for goods, services or arrangements to be delivered or provided during 2020 and beyond. such other purchase commitments as of december 31, 2019, which total $988.2 million, are also reflected in the table above as "other contractual commitments."
in connection with the joint venture which closed in october 2019, we agreed to make future equity contributions to the joint venture of €17.6 million and £15.7 million, or $40.6 million in total at the exchange rate in effect on december 31, 2019, to fund the joint venture's future development over the next 3 years, which are not reflected in the table above.
additionally, we entered into lease agreements with various landlords primarily for data center spaces and ground leases which have not yet commenced as of december 31, 2019. these leases will commence between fiscal years 2020 and 2022, with lease terms of 10 to 49 years and total lease commitments of approximately $608.1 million, which are not reflected in the table above.
other off-balance-sheet arrangements we have various guarantor arrangements with both our directors and officers and third parties, including customers, vendors and business partners. as of december 31, 2019, there were no significant liabilities recorded for these arrangements. for additional information, see "guarantor arrangements" in note 15 within the consolidated financial statements.
concurrent with the closing of the joint venture, the joint venture entered into a credit agreement with a group of lenders for secured credit facilities of €850.0 million, or $953.7 million in total at the exchange rate in effect on december 31, 2019, consisting of two secured term loan facilities and a secured revolving credit facility. the joint venture's debt is secured by net assets of the joint venture, is without recourse to the partners, and does not represent a liability of the partners. we do not provide any guarantees to make principle payment to the lenders for the joint ventures' indebtedness. under the joint venture agreement, we and our joint venture partner gic are also required to make additional equity contribution proportionately to the joint venture upon situations such as interest shortfall, cost-overrun or capital shortfall to complete certain construction phases.
critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with u.s. gaap. the preparation of our financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. on an ongoing basis, management evaluates the accounting policies, assumptions, estimates and judgments to ensure that our consolidated financial statements are presented fairly and in accordance with gaap. management bases its assumptions, estimates and judgments on historical experience, current trends and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. however, because future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty, actual results may differ from these assumptions and estimates, and such differences could be material.
our significant accounting policies are discussed in note 1 to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k. management believes that the following critical accounting policies and estimates are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our consolidated financial statements, and they require significant judgments, resulting from the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain:

deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized based on the future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences that exist between the financial statement carrying value of assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases, and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards on a taxing jurisdiction basis. we measure deferred tax assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates that will apply in the years in which we expect the temporary differences to be recovered or settled. the accounting standard for income taxes requires a reduction of the carrying amounts of deferred tax assets by recording a valuation allowance if, based on the available evidence, it is more likely than not (defined by the accounting standard as a likelihood of more than 50%) that such assets will not be realized.   in assessing the need for a valuation allowance, we consider both positive and negative evidence related to the likelihood of realization of the deferred tax assets. if, based on the weight of that available evidence, it is more likely than not the deferred tax assets will not be realized, we record a valuation allowance. the weight given to the positive and negative evidence is commensurate with the extent to which the evidence may be objectively verified.                                                                                                                                                                       during the year ended december 31, 2018, we released the full or partial valuation allowances against the deferred tax assets in certain jurisdictions in the americas, asia-pacific and emea regions. as part of the purchase accounting determination for the metronode acquisition, we provided full valuation allowance against certain deferred tax assets in australia that are not expected to be realizable in the foreseeable future.
a tax benefit from an uncertain income tax position may be recognized in the financial statements only if it is more likely than not that the position is sustainable, based solely on its technical merits and consideration of the relevant taxing authority's widely understood administrative practices and precedents. the company recognizes interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits within income tax benefit (expense) in the consolidated statements of operations.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              this assessment, which is completed on a taxing jurisdiction basis, takes into account a number of types of evidence, including the following: 1) the nature, frequency and severity of current and cumulative financial reporting losses, 2) sources of future taxable income and 3) tax planning strategies.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      as of december 31, 2019 and 2018, we had unrecognized tax benefits of $173.7 million and $150.9 million, respectively, exclusive of interest and penalties. during the year ended december 31, 2019, the unrecognized tax benefit increased by $22.8 million primarily due to integrations, which was partially offset by the recognition of unrecognized tax benefits related to the company's tax positions in france as a result of a lapse in statutes of limitations and the partial payment of the metronode pre-acquisition tax audit assessment which was fully indemnified by the seller. during the year ended december 31, 2018, the unrecognized tax benefits increased by $68.5 million primarily due to the metronode acquisition and the reorganization of the spanish entities from the itconic acquisition. the unrecognized tax benefits of $173.7 million as of december 31, 2019, if subsequently recognized, will affect our effective tax rate favorably at the time when such a benefit is recognized, of which $30.8 million is subject to an indemnification agreement.
in assessing the tax benefit from an uncertain income tax position, the tax position that meets the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold is initially and subsequently measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information.
for purposes of the quarterly reit asset tests, we estimate the fair market value of assets within our qrss and trss using a discounted cash flow approach, by calculating the present value of forecasted future cash flows. we apply discount rates based on industry benchmarks relative to the market and forecasting risks. other significant assumptions used to estimate the fair market value of assets in qrss and trss include projected revenue growth, projected operating margins and projected capital expenditure. we revisit significant assumptions periodically to reflect any changes due to business or economic environment.

in accordance with the accounting standard for business combinations, we allocate the purchase price of an acquired business to its identifiable assets and liabilities based on estimated fair values. the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, if any, is recorded as goodwill.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       as of december 31, 2019 and 2018, we had net intangible assets of $2.1 billion and $2.3 billion, respectively. we recorded amortization expense for intangible assets of $196.3 million, $203.4 million and $177.0 million for the years ended december 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
we use all available information to estimate fair values. we typically engage outside appraisal firms to assist in determining the fair value of identifiable intangible assets such as customer contracts, leases and any other significant assets or liabilities and contingent consideration, as well as the estimated useful life of intangible assets. we adjust the preliminary purchase price allocation, as necessary, up to one year after the acquisition closing date if we obtain more information regarding asset valuations and liabilities assumed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the estimates or assumptions we used to complete the purchase price allocations and the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed. however, if actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions, we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material, which would be recorded in our consolidated statements of operations in 2019 or beyond.

in accordance with the accounting standard for goodwill and other intangible assets, we perform goodwill and other intangible assets impairment reviews annually, or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. we complete the annual goodwill impairment assessment for the americas, emea and asia-pacific reporting units to determine if the fair values of the reporting units exceeded their carrying values. we perform a review of other intangible assets for impairment by assessing events or changes in circumstances that indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable.   we performed our annual review of other intangible assets by assessing if there were events or changes in circumstances indicating that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable, such as a significant decrease in market price of an asset, a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which an asset is being used, a significant adverse change in legal factors or business climate that could affect the value of an asset or a continuous deterioration of our financial condition. this assessment requires assumptions and estimates derived from a review of our actual and forecasted operating results, approved business plans, future economic conditions and other market data. there were no specific events in 2019 or 2018 that indicated a potential impairment.   future events, changing market conditions and any changes in key assumptions may result in an impairment charge. while we have not recorded an impairment charge against our goodwill to date, the development of adverse business conditions in our americas, emea or asia-pacific reporting units, such as higher than anticipated customer churn or significantly increased operating costs, or significant deterioration of our market comparables that we use in the market approach, could result in an impairment charge in future periods.
the balance of our other intangible assets, net, for the year ended december 31, 2019 and 2018 was $2.1 billion and $2.3 billion, respectively. while we have not recorded an impairment charge against our other intangible assets to date, future events or changes in circumstances, such as a significant decrease in market price of an asset, a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which an asset is being used, a significant adverse change in legal factors or business climate, may result in an impairment charge in future periods.
any potential impairment charge against our goodwill and other intangible assets would not exceed the amounts recorded on our consolidated balance sheets.

we have a substantial amount of property, plant and equipment recorded on our consolidated balance sheet. the vast majority of our property, plant and equipment represent the costs incurred to build out or acquire our ibx data centers. our ibx data centers are long-lived assets. we depreciate our property, plant and equipment using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the respective assets (subject to the term of the lease in the case of leased assets or leasehold improvements and integral equipment located in leased properties).   the assessment of long-lived assets for impairment requires assumptions and estimates of undiscounted and discounted future cash flows. these assumptions and estimates require significant judgment and are inherently uncertain.
accounting for property, plant and equipment includes determining the appropriate period in which to depreciate such assets, assessing such assets for potential impairment, capitalizing interest during periods of construction and assessing the asset retirement obligations required for certain leased properties that require us to return the leased properties back to their original condition at the time we decide to exit a leased property.
accounting for leases                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            determination of accounting treatment, including the result of the lease classification test for each new lease or lease amendment, is dependent on a variety of judgments, such as identification of lease and non-lease components, allocation of total consideration between lease and non-lease components, determination of lease term, including assessing the likelihood of lease renewals, valuation of leased property, and establishing the incremental borrowing rate to calculate the present value of the minimum lease payment for the lease test. the judgments used in the accounting for leases are inherently subjective; different assumptions or estimates could result in different accounting treatment for a lease.                                                                                                                                                                                                                  as of december 31, 2019, we recorded operating lease right-of-use assets of $1.5 billion, finance lease assets of $1.3 billion, operating lease liabilities of $1.5 billion, and finance lease liabilities of $1.5 billion. additionally, during the years ended december 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, we recorded rent expense of approximately $219.0 million, $185.4 million and $157.9 million respectively.
a significant portion of our data center spaces, office spaces and equipment are leased. each time we enter into a new lease or lease amendments, we analyze each lease or lease amendment for the proper accounting, including determining if an arrangement is or contains a lease at inception and making assessment of the leased properties to determine if they are operating or finance leases.

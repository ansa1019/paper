overview business ebay inc., a global commerce leader, includes marketplace, stubhub and classifieds platforms. collectively, ebay connects millions of buyers and sellers around the world, empowering people and creating opportunity for all. founded in 1995 in san jose, california, ebay is one of the world's largest and most vibrant marketplaces for discovering great value and unique selection. our technologies and services are designed to give buyers choice and a breadth of relevant inventory and to enable sellers worldwide to organize and offer their inventory for sale, virtually anytime and anywhere. in 2019, ebay enabled over $90 billion of gross merchandise volume.
presentation in addition to the corresponding measures under generally accepted accounting principles ("gaap"), management uses non-gaap measures in reviewing our financial results. the foreign exchange neutral ("fx-neutral"), or constant currency, net revenue amounts discussed below are non-gaap financial measures and are not in accordance with, or an alternative to, measures prepared in accordance with gaap. accordingly, the fx-neutral information appearing in the following discussion of our results of operations should be read in conjunction with the information provided below in "non-gaap measures of financial performance," which includes reconciliations of fx-neutral financial measures to the most directly comparable gaap measures. we calculate the year-over-year impact of foreign currency movements using prior period foreign currency rates applied to current year transactional currency amounts.
our commerce platforms operate globally, resulting in certain revenues that are denominated in foreign currencies, primarily the euro, british pound, korean won and australian dollar, subjecting us to foreign currency risk which may impact our financial results. because of this and the fact that we generate a majority of our net revenues internationally, including during the years ended december 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, we are subject to the risks related to doing business in foreign countries as discussed under "item 1a: risk factors."
the effect of foreign currency exchange rate movements during 2019 was primarily attributable to the strengthening of the u.s. dollar against the euro, british pound and korean won.
fiscal year highlights net revenues increased 1% to $10.8 billion in 2019 compared to 2018, primarily driven by marketplace net transaction revenues and classifieds marketing services and other revenues. fx-neutral net revenue (as defined above) increased 2% in 2019 compared to 2018. operating margin increased to 21.5% in 2019 compared to 20.7% in 2018.
we generated cash flow from continuing operating activities of $3.1 billion in 2019 compared to $2.7 billion in 2018, ending the year with cash, cash equivalents and non-equity investments of $3.8 billion.
in the first quarter of 2019, we completed the acquisition of the u.k. based classifieds site, motors.co.uk for $93 million in cash. during the third quarter of 2019, $400 million of floating rate notes and $1.15 billion of 2.200% fixed rate notes matured and were repaid. during the year ended december 31, 2019 we paid $473 million in cash dividends.
in the fourth quarter of 2019, we entered into a definitive agreement to sell stubhub to viagogo for a purchase price of $4.05 billion in cash. the sale is expected to close in the first quarter of 2020, subject to regulatory approval and closing conditions.
diluted earnings per share from continuing operations was $2.10 in 2019 compared to diluted earnings per share of $2.55 in 2018. in january 2020, we declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.16 per share of common stock to be paid on march 20, 2020 to stockholders of record as of march 2, 2020.
results of operations net revenues seasonality we expect transaction activity patterns on our platforms to mirror general consumer buying patterns and expect that these trends will continue. the following table sets forth, for the periods presented, our total net revenues and the sequential quarterly movements of these net revenues (in millions, except percentages):

net revenues included $81 million of hedging gains and $8 million and $28 million of hedging losses during the years ended december 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. the hedging activity in net revenues specifically relates to hedges of net transaction revenues generated by our marketplace segment. foreign currency movements relative to the u.s. dollar had an unfavorable impact of $211 million, a favorable impact of $174 million and unfavorable impact of $39 million on net revenues for the years december 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. the effect of foreign currency exchange rate movements in 2019 compared to 2018 was primarily attributable to the strengthening of the u.s. dollar against the euro, british pound and korean won. the effect of foreign currency exchange rate movements in 2018 compared to 2017 was primarily attributable to the weakening of the u.s. dollar against the euro, british pound and korean won.
net revenues by type and segment we generate two types of net revenues:
net transaction revenues primarily include final value fees, feature fees, including fees to promote listings, and listing fees from sellers on our marketplace platforms and final value fees from sellers and buyers on our stubhub platforms. our net transaction revenues also include store subscription and other fees often from large enterprise sellers. our net transaction revenues are reduced by incentives, including discounts, coupons and rewards, provided to our customers.
marketing services and other ("ms&o") revenues consist of marketplace, stubhub and classifieds revenues principally from the sale of advertisements, classifieds fees, revenue sharing arrangements and first-party inventory programs.

**   not meaningful net transaction revenues key operating metrics gross merchandise volume ("gmv") and take rate are significant factors that we believe affect our net transaction revenues.
gmv consists of the total value of all successfully closed transactions between users on our marketplace or stubhub platforms during the applicable period, regardless of whether the buyer and seller actually consummated the transaction. despite gmv's divergence from revenue during 2019, we still believe that gmv provides a useful measure of the overall volume of closed transactions that flow through our platforms in a given period, notwithstanding the inclusion in gmv of closed transactions that are not ultimately consummated.

(1)   marketplace net transaction revenues were net of $81 million, $8 million and $28 million hedging activity during the years ended december 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017 respectively.
marketplace net transaction revenues increased in 2019 compared to 2018 primarily due to growth in promoted listing fees and a higher take rate. marketplace transaction take rate was higher in 2019 compared to 2018, primarily due to growth in promoted listing fees, which along with final value fees are calculated as a percentage of an item's sale price, and category mix. the increase in marketplace net transaction revenues in 2019 compared to 2018 was due to take rate considerations discussed above, despite declining marketplace gmv. we expect that the divergence between marketplace net transaction revenues and marketplace gmv will continue. despite gmv's divergence from net transaction revenues during the year, we still believe the metric provides a useful measure of overall volume of closed transactions that flow through the platform in a given period.
the increase in marketplace net transaction revenues in 2018 compared to 2017 was primarily due to an increase in marketplace gmv and a favorable impact from foreign currency movements relative to the u.s. dollar. marketplace transaction take rate was higher in 2018 compared to 2017, primarily due to growth in promoted listing fees, which along with final value fees are calculated as a percentage of an items sale price, and a decrease in seller incentives, partially offset by a decrease in revenues from final value fees attributable to pricing and category mix.
stubhub net transaction revenues the following table presents stubhub net transaction revenues and supplemental operating data (in millions, except percentages):

stubhub net transaction revenues in 2019 compared to 2018 decreased slightly primarily driven by lower gmv from concerts and theater, partially offset by an increase in sporting events and a slightly higher take rate. the slight increase in stubhub transaction take rate in 2019 compared to 2018 was primarily due to pricing changes partially offset by event mix.
the increase in stubhub net transaction revenues in 2018 compared to 2017 was primarily due to an increase in stubhub gmv. the increase in stubhub gmv in 2018 compared to 2017 was primarily driven by concerts and sporting events. the increase in stubhub transaction take rate in 2018 compared to 2017 was primarily due to pricing changes on the platform.

**   not meaningful marketplace ms&o revenues the decrease in marketplace ms&o revenues during 2019 compared to 2018 was primarily due to a decrease in advertising revenues that was driven by our ongoing shift to promoted listing fees, which are recognized in net transaction revenues and lower revenues resulting from the sale of brands4friends. these decreases were partially offset by increases in first-party inventory program in korea in 2019 compared to 2018.
the increase in marketplace ms&o revenues in 2018 compared to 2017 was primarily driven by an increase in revenues attributable to our first-party inventory program in korea and revenue sharing arrangements, particularly shipping, partially offset by a decrease in advertising revenues that was driven by our ongoing shift to promoted listing fees, which are recognized in net transaction revenues.
stubhub ms&o revenues the increase in stubhub ms&o revenues in 2019 compared to 2018 primarily related to growth in revenues from first-party inventory sales from sporting events. the change in stubhub ms&o revenue in 2018 compared to 2017 was relatively flat.
cost of net revenues cost of net revenues primarily consists of costs associated with customer support, site operations, costs of goods sold and payment processing. significant components of these costs include employee compensation, contractor costs, facilities costs, depreciation of equipment and amortization expense, first party inventory costs, bank transaction fees, and credit card interchange and assessment fees. the following table presents cost of net revenues (in millions, except percentages):

the increase in cost of net revenues in 2019 compared to 2018 and 2018 compared to 2017 was primarily due to an increase in site operation and payment processing costs as we increased our investments in our business, and an increase in costs of goods sold driven by our first-party inventory program in korea.
cost of net revenues, net of immaterial hedging activities, was favorably impacted by $56 million attributable to foreign currency movements relative to the u.s. dollar in 2019 compared to 2018. cost of net revenues was unfavorably impacted by $34 million attributable to foreign currency movements relative to the u.s. dollar in 2018. there was no hedging activity within cost of net revenues in 2018.

foreign currency movements relative to the u.s. dollar had a favorable impact of $118 million on operating expenses in 2019 compared to 2018. operating expenses were unfavorably impacted by $68 million attributable to foreign currency movements relative to the u.s. dollar in 2018 compared to 2017. there was no hedging activity within operating expenses in 2019 and 2018.
sales and marketing sales and marketing expenses primarily consist of advertising and marketing program costs (both online and offline), employee compensation, certain user coupons and rewards, contractor costs, facilities costs and depreciation on equipment. online marketing expenses represent traffic acquisition costs in various channels such as paid search, affiliates marketing and display advertising. offline advertising primarily includes brand campaigns and buyer/seller communications.
the decrease in sales and marketing expense in 2019 compared to 2018 was primarily due to a favorable impact from foreign currency movements relative to the u.s. dollar and decreases in offline advertising spend and employee-related costs. these costs were partially offset by online marketing spend and user coupons and rewards largely driven by our japan platform acquired in the second quarter of 2018.
the increase in sales and marketing expense in 2018 compared to 2017 was primarily due to an increase in user coupons and rewards and traffic acquisition costs.
product development product development expenses primarily consist of employee compensation, contractor costs, facilities costs and depreciation on equipment. product development expenses are net of required capitalization of major platform and other product development efforts, including the development and maintenance of our technology platform. our top technology priorities include payment intermediation capabilities and improved seller tools and buyer experiences built on a foundation of structured data.
capitalized internal use and platform development costs were $137 million and $147 million in 2019 and 2018, respectively, and are primarily reflected as a cost of net revenues when amortized in future periods.
the decrease in product development expenses in 2019 compared to 2018 was primarily due to decreases in employee-related costs, foreign currency movement relative to the u.s. dollar and depreciation on equipment. the increase in product development expenses in 2018 compared to 2017 was primarily due to an increase in employee-related costs, partially offset by a decrease in depreciation on equipment.
general and administrative general and administrative expenses primarily consist of employee compensation, contractor costs, facilities costs, depreciation of equipment, employer payroll taxes on stock-based compensation, legal expenses, restructuring, insurance premiums and professional fees. our legal expenses, including those related to various ongoing legal proceedings, may fluctuate substantially from period to period.
the increase in general and administrative expenses in 2018 compared to 2017 was primarily due to restructuring costs related to our global workforce reduction and an increase in employee-related costs. for additional details related to the restructuring, refer to "note 18 - restructuring" to the consolidated financial statements included in this report.
provision for transaction losses provision for transaction losses primarily consists of transaction loss expense associated with our buyer protection programs, fraud and bad debt expense associated with our accounts receivable balance. we expect our provision for transaction losses to fluctuate depending on many factors, including changes to our protection programs and the impact of regulatory changes.

the increase in income from operations in 2019 compared 2018 was primarily due to an increase in income from our marketplace segment. income from our stubhub and classifieds segments was not a significant contributor to the increase in total income from operations in 2019 compared to 2018. the decrease in income from operations in 2018 compared to 2017 was primarily due to global workforce reduction and an increase in employee related costs, partially offset by an increase in income from our marketplace and classifieds segments.
interest and other, net interest and other, net primarily consists of interest earned on cash, cash equivalents and investments, as well as foreign exchange transaction gains and losses, gains and losses due to changes in fair value of the warrant received from adyen, our portion of operating results from investments accounted for under the equity method of accounting, investment gain/loss on acquisitions or disposals and interest expense, consisting of interest charges on any amounts borrowed and commitment fees on unborrowed amounts under our credit agreement and interest expense on our outstanding debt securities and commercial paper, if any. the following table presents interest and other, net (in millions, except percentages):

the decrease in interest and other, net in 2019 compared to 2018 was primarily attributable to the gain recognized on the sale of our investment in flipkart of $313 million and the relinquishment of our existing equity method investment in giosis of $266 million that did not occur in 2019, the loss recorded upon the divestiture of brands4friends of $52 million partially offset by the gain recognized due to the change in fair value of the adyen warrant of $133 million that occurred in 2019.
the increase in interest and other, net in 2018 compared to 2017 was primarily attributable to the $313 million gain recognized on the sale of our investment in flipkart and $266 million gain recognized upon relinquishment of our existing equity method investment in giosis and $104 million gain recognized due to the change in fair value of the warrant.
income tax provision (benefit)      $415                $190                $3,288
the increase in our effective tax rate in 2019 compared to 2018 was primarily due to a reduction in 2018 to the provisional tax amounts recorded in 2017 related to the tax cuts and jobs act and the gain recognized from the relinquishment of our existing equity method investment in giosis that was not subject to u.s. federal income tax on a current basis that did not recur in 2019, and certain expenses in 2019 including a negotiated reduction in the tax basis of the intangible assets in our classifieds platforms. these impacts were partially offset in 2019 by the effective settlements of audits, reduction in the u.s. deferred tax liability for minimum tax on foreign earnings, related to the above reduction in tax basis of intangible assets, and a benefit due to the enacted new york state legislation regarding the taxability of foreign earnings.
the decrease in our effective tax rate in 2018 compared to 2017 was primarily due to the $3.1 billion provisional tax charge related to the tax cuts and jobs act (the "act" or "u.s. tax reform") recorded in 2017. in 2018, as we completed our analysis of u.s. tax reform, we recorded a $463 million reduction to the provisional tax amounts recorded in 2017. further, the 2018 effective tax rate was favorably impacted by u.s. tax reform and the gain recognized from the relinquishment of our existing equity method investment in giosis in the second quarter 2018 that is not subject to u.s. federal income tax on a current basis.
on december 22, 2017, the tax cuts and jobs act was enacted. u.s. tax reform, among other things, reduced the u.s. federal income tax rate from 35% to 21% beginning in 2018, instituted a dividends received deduction for foreign earnings with a related tax for the deemed repatriation of unremitted foreign earnings in 2017 and created a new u.s. minimum tax on earnings of foreign subsidiaries. we recognized a provisional income tax charge of $3.1 billion in the fourth quarter of 2017, which was included as a component of the income tax provision on our consolidated statement of income. we completed our analysis of the impacts of u.s. tax reform in the fourth quarter of 2018 and recognized a $463 million reduction to the provisional tax amounts recorded in the fourth quarter of 2017, which is included as a component of income tax expense from continuing operations in 2018.
included in the 2017 provisional amount was $1.4 billion for the income tax on the deemed repatriation of unremitted foreign earnings. we completed the computation of this amount as part of the 2017 income tax return filing and reduced the provisional amount by $18 million and we utilized $213 million of foreign tax credits to reduce the net liability, both in 2018.
the remaining provisional amount of $1.7 billion was for the deferred income tax effects of the act, primarily the impact of the new u.s. minimum tax on foreign earnings, partially offset by the reversal of our existing deferred tax liability associated with repatriation of unremitted foreign earnings. we completed our analysis of the components of the deferred tax computation in the fourth quarter of 2018 and recognized a tax benefit of $445 million as a reduction to the provisional amounts recorded in the fourth quarter of 2017 for the deferred income tax effects of the act. this amount includes a $389 million tax benefit as a result of clarification by swiss tax authorities regarding the applicability of withholding tax to repatriated earnings in october 2018.
as a result of u.s. tax reform, our earnings in foreign jurisdictions are taxed at substantially the same rate as the u.s. federal statutory tax rate of 21%. in 2017, our provision for income taxes differed from the provision computed by applying the u.s. federal statutory rate of 35% primarily due to lower tax rates associated with certain earnings from our operations in jurisdictions outside the u.s. the impact on our provision for income taxes of foreign income being taxed at different rates that the u.s. federal statutory rate was a benefit of approximately $217 million in 2017. the foreign jurisdictions with lower tax rates that had the most significant impact on our provision for income taxes in 2017 include switzerland. see "note 15 - income taxes" to the consolidated financial statements included in this report for more information on our tax rate reconciliation.
from time to time we engage in certain intercompany transactions. we consider many factors when evaluating these transactions. these transactions may impact our tax rate and/or result in additional cash tax payments. the impact in any period may be significant. these transactions are complex and the impact of such transactions on future periods may be difficult to estimate.
we are regularly under examination by tax authorities both domestically and internationally. we believe that adequate amounts have been reserved for any adjustments that may ultimately result from these examinations, although we cannot assure you that this will be the case given the inherent uncertainties in these examinations. due to the ongoing tax examinations, it is generally impractical to determine the amount and timing of these adjustments. however, we expect several tax examinations to close within the next twelve months. see "note 15 - income taxes" to the consolidated financial statements included in this report for more information on estimated settlements within the next twelve months.
non-gaap measures of financial performance to supplement our consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles we use fx-neutral net revenues, which are non-gaap financial measures. management uses the foregoing non-gaap measures in reviewing our financial results. we define fx-neutral net revenues as net revenues minus the exchange rate effect. we define exchange rate effect as the year-over-year impact of foreign currency movements using prior period foreign currency rates applied to current year transactional currency amounts, excluding hedging activity.
these non-gaap measures are not in accordance with, or an alternative to, measures prepared in accordance with gaap and may be different from non-gaap measures used by other companies. in addition, these non-gaap measures are not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles. non-gaap measures have limitations in that they do not reflect all of the amounts associated with our results of operations as determined in accordance with gaap. these measures should only be used to evaluate our results of operations in conjunction with the corresponding gaap measures.
these non-gaap measures are provided to enhance investors' overall understanding of our current financial performance and its prospects for the future. specifically, we believe these non-gaap measures provide useful information to both management and investors by excluding the foreign currency exchange rate impact that may not be indicative of our core operating results and business outlook. in addition, because we have historically reported certain non-gaap results to investors, we believe that the inclusion of these non-gaap measures provide consistency in our financial reporting.

continuing operating activities cash provided by continuing operating activities of $3.1 billion in 2019 was primarily attributable to net income of $1.8 billion with adjustments of $681 million in depreciation and amortization, $505 million in stock-based compensation, $300 million in provision for transaction losses, $117 million for deferred income taxes, $52 million loss on the sale of a business, partially offset by a decrease of $200 million in changes in assets and liabilities, net of acquisition effects, and $133 million for changes in the fair value of the adyen warrant.
cash provided by continuing operating activities of $2.7 billion in 2018 was primarily attributable to net income of $2.5 billion with adjustments of $696 million in depreciation and amortization, $538 million in stock-based compensation and $286 million in provision for transaction losses, partially offset by a decrease of $577 million in changes in assets and liabilities, net of acquisition effects, and adjustments of $572 million for gain on investments, $153 million for deferred income taxes and $104 million for changes in fair value of the adyen warrant.
the net cash provided by continuing operating activities of $3.1 billion in 2017 was primarily due to $1.1 billion of changes in assets and liabilities, net of acquisition effects, and a net loss of $1.0 billion offset by adjustments of $1.7 billion in deferred income taxes, $676 million in depreciation and amortization and $483 million in stock-based compensation.
cash paid for income taxes in 2019, 2018 and 2017 was $333 million, $597 million and $308 million, respectively. cash paid for income taxes in 2018 included tax payments related to our liability for deemed repatriation of foreign earnings under u.s. tax reform of $168 million, including a prepayment of $72 million.
investing activities cash provided by investing activities of $2.8 billion in 2019 was primarily attributable to proceeds of $50.5 billion from the maturities and sales of investments, partially offset by cash paid for purchases of investments of $47.0 billion, property and equipment of $554 million, equity investment in paytm mall of $160 million and acquisitions of $93 million.
cash provided by investing activities of $2.9 billion in 2018 was primarily attributable to proceeds of $30.9 billion from the maturities and sales of investments and $1.0 billion from the sale of equity investment in flipkart, partially offset by cash paid for purchases of investments of $28.1 billion, property and equipment of $651 million and acquisitions of $302 million.
the net cash used in investing activities of $1.3 billion in 2017 was primarily due to cash paid for property and equipment of $666 million and cash paid for our equity investment in flipkart of $514 million.
the largely offsetting effects of purchases of investments and maturities and sale of investments results from the management of our investments. as our immediate cash needs change, purchase and sale activity will fluctuate.
financing activities cash used in financing activities of $7.1 billion in 2019 was primarily used to repurchase $5.0 billion of common stock, repay outstanding debt of $1.6 billion and pay $473 million of cash dividends.
cash used in financing activities of $5.4 billion in 2018 was primarily used to repurchase $4.5 billion of common stock and repay $750 million of our outstanding senior notes.
the net cash used in financing activities of $1.8 billion in 2017 was primarily due to $2.7 billion of cash used to repurchase common stock and $1.5 billion of cash used to repay outstanding debt, partially offset by $2.5 billion of cash proceeds from debt issuances.
the negative effect of exchange rate movements on cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash was due to the strengthening of the u.s. dollar against other currencies, primarily the korean won, euro and british pound during 2019. the negative effect of exchange rate movements on cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash was due to the strengthening of the u.s. dollar against other currencies, primarily the euro, korean won and british pound, during 2018. the positive effect of exchange rate movements on cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash was due to the weakening of the u.s. dollar against other currencies, primarily the euro and korean won, during 2017.
stock repurchases in january 2018, our board authorized a $6.0 billion stock repurchase program and in january 2019, our board authorized an additional $4.0 billion stock repurchase program. these stock repurchase programs have no expiration from the date of authorization. our stock repurchase programs are intended to programmatically offset the impact of dilution from our equity compensation programs and, subject to market conditions and other factors, to make opportunistic and programmatic repurchases of our common stock to reduce our outstanding share count. any share repurchases under our stock repurchase programs may be made through open market transactions, block trades, privately negotiated transactions (including accelerated share repurchase transactions) or other means at times and in such amounts as management deems appropriate and will be funded from our working capital or other financing alternatives.
during 2019, we repurchased approximately $5.0 billion of our common stock under our stock repurchase programs. as of december 31, 2019, a total of approximately $2.2 billion remained available for future repurchases of our common stock under our stock repurchase programs. in january 2020, our board authorized an additional $5.0 billion stock repurchase program, with no expiration from the date of authorization.
we expect, subject to market conditions and other uncertainties, to continue making opportunistic and programmatic repurchases of our common stock. however, our stock repurchase programs may be limited or terminated at any time without prior notice. the timing and actual number of shares repurchased will depend on a variety of factors, including corporate and regulatory requirements, price and other market conditions and management's determination as to the appropriate use of our cash.
dividends the company paid a total of $473 million in cash dividends during the year ended december 31, 2019. no cash dividends were paid in 2018 and 2017. in january 2020, we declared a cash dividend of $0.16 per share of common stock to be paid on march 20, 2020 to stockholders of record as of march 2, 2020.
shelf registration statement and debt as of december 31, 2019, we had an effective shelf registration statement on file with the securities and exchange commission that allows us to issue various types of debt securities, as well as common stock, preferred stock, warrants, depositary shares representing fractional interest in shares of preferred stock, purchase contracts and units from time to time in one or more offerings. each issuance under the shelf registration statement will require the filing of a prospectus supplement identifying the amount and terms of the securities to be issued. the registration statement does not limit the amount of securities that may be issued thereunder. our ability to issue securities is subject to market conditions and other factors including, in the case of our debt securities, our credit ratings and compliance with the covenants in our credit agreement.
senior notes as of december 31, 2019, we had floating- and fixed-rate senior notes outstanding for an aggregate principal amount of $7.8 billion. the net proceeds from the issuances of these senior notes are used for general corporate purposes, including, among other things, capital expenditures, share repurchases, repayment of indebtedness and possible acquisitions. the floating rate notes are not redeemable prior to maturity. on and after march 1, 2021, we may redeem some or all of the 6.000% fixed rate notes due 2056 at any time and from time to time prior to their maturity, at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest. we may redeem some or all of the other fixed rate notes of each series at any time and from time to time prior to their maturity, generally at a make-whole redemption price plus accrued and unpaid interest. if a change of control triggering event occurs with respect to the 2.150% fixed rate notes due 2020, the 3.800% fixed rate notes due 2022, the floating rate notes due 2023, the 2.750% fixed rate notes due 2023, the 3.600% fixed rate notes due 2027 or the 6.000% fixed rate notes due 2056, we must, subject to certain exceptions, offer to repurchase all of the notes of the applicable series at a price equal to 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. for additional details related to our senior notes, please see "note 10 - debt" to the consolidated financial statements included in this report.
to help achieve our interest rate risk management objectives, in connection with the previous issuance of certain senior notes, we entered into interest rate swap agreements that effectively converted $2.4 billion of the fixed rate notes to floating rate debt based on the london interbank offered rate ("libor") plus a spread. these swaps were designated as fair value hedges against changes in the fair value of certain fixed rate senior notes resulting from changes in interest rates. as of december 31, 2019, we had no interest rate swaps outstanding as $1.15 billion related to our 2.200% senior notes of the $2.4 billion aggregate notional amount matured. in addition, during the year ended december 31, 2019, we terminated the interest rate swaps related to $750 million of our 2.875% senior notes due july 2021 and $500 million of our 3.450% senior notes due july 2024. as a result of the early termination, hedge accounting was discontinued prospectively and the gain on termination was recorded as an increase to the long-term debt balance and is being recognized over the remaining life of the underlying debt as a reduction to interest expense. the gain recognized during the year ended december 31, 2019 was immaterial. for additional details related to the interest rate swap termination, please see, "note 10 - debt" to the consolidated financial statements included in this report.
the indenture pursuant to which the senior notes were issued includes customary covenants that, among other things and subject to exceptions, limit our ability to incur, assume or guarantee debt secured by liens on specified assets or enter into sale and lease-back transactions with respect to specified properties, and also includes customary events of default.
commercial paper we have a commercial paper program pursuant to which we may issue commercial paper notes in an aggregate principal amount at maturity of up to $1.5 billion outstanding at any time with maturities of up to 397 days from the date of issue. as of december 31, 2019, there were no commercial paper notes outstanding.
credit agreement in november 2015, we entered into a credit agreement that provides for an unsecured $2 billion five-year revolving credit facility. we may also, subject to the agreement of the applicable lenders, increase the commitments under the revolving credit facility by up to an aggregate amount of $1 billion. funds borrowed under the credit agreement may be used for working capital, capital expenditures, dividends, acquisitions and other general corporate purposes.
as of december 31, 2019, no borrowings were outstanding under our $2 billion credit agreement. however, as described above, we have an up to $1.5 billion commercial paper program and therefore maintain $1.5 billion of available borrowing capacity under our credit agreement in order to repay commercial paper borrowings in the event we are unable to repay those borrowings from other sources when they become due. as a result, $500 million of borrowing capacity was available as of december 31, 2019 for other purposes permitted by the credit agreement.
loans under the credit agreement bear interest at either (i) libor plus a margin (based on our public debt credit ratings) ranging from 0.875 percent to 1.5 percent or (ii) a formula based on the agent bank's prime rate, the federal funds effective rate plus 0.5 percent or libor plus 1.0 percent, plus a margin (based on our public debt credit ratings) ranging from zero percent to 0.5 percent. the credit agreement will terminate and all amounts owing thereunder will be due and payable on november 9, 2020, unless (a) the commitments are terminated earlier, either at our request
or, if an event of default occurs, by the lenders (or automatically in the case of certain bankruptcy-related events of default), or (b) the maturity date is extended upon our request, subject to the agreement of the lenders. the credit agreement includes customary representations, warranties, affirmative and negative covenants, including financial covenants, events of default and indemnification provisions in favor of the banks. the negative covenants include restrictions regarding the incurrence of liens and subsidiary indebtedness, in each case, subject to certain exceptions. the financial covenants require us to meet a quarterly financial test with respect to a minimum consolidated interest coverage ratio and a maximum consolidated leverage ratio. the events of default include the occurrence of a change of control (as defined in the credit agreement) with respect to us.
credit ratings as of december 31, 2019, we were rated investment grade by standard and poor's financial services, llc (long-term rated bbb+, short-term rated a-2, with a stable outlook), moody's investor service (long-term rated baa1, short-term rated p-2, with a stable outlook), and fitch ratings, inc. (long-term rated bbb, short-term rated f-2, with a stable outlook). we disclose these ratings to enhance the understanding of our sources of liquidity and the effects of our ratings on our costs of funds. our borrowing costs depend, in part, on our credit ratings and any actions taken by these credit rating agencies to lower our credit ratings will likely increase our borrowing costs.
commitments and contingencies we have certain fixed contractual obligations and commitments that include future estimated payments for general operating purposes. changes in our business needs, contractual cancellation provisions, fluctuating interest rates, and other factors may result in actual payments differing from the estimates. we cannot provide certainty regarding the timing and amounts of these payments. the following table summarizes our fixed contractual obligations and commitments (in millions):
the significant assumptions used in our determination of amounts presented in the above table are as follows:
•   debt amounts include the principal and interest amounts of the respective debt instruments. for additional details related to our debt, please see "note 10 - debt" to the consolidated financial statements included in this report. this table does not reflect any amounts payable under our $2 billion revolving credit facility or $1.5 billion commercial paper program, for which no borrowings were outstanding as of december 31, 2019.
•   lease amounts include payments for our operating and finance leases for office space, data centers, as well as fulfillment centers and other corporate assets that we utilize under lease arrangements. the amounts presented are consistent with contractual terms and are not expected to differ significantly from actual results under our existing leases, unless a substantial change in our headcount needs requires us to expand our occupied space or exit an office facility early.
•   purchase obligation amounts include minimum purchase commitments for advertising, capital expenditures (computer equipment, software applications, engineering development services, construction contracts) and other goods and services entered into in the ordinary course of business.
as we are unable to reasonably predict the timing of settlement of liabilities related to unrecognized tax benefits, net, the table does not include $285 million of such non-current liabilities included in other liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet as of december 31, 2019. the gross amount of unrecognized tax benefits expected to be reduced within the next twelve months is approximately $19 million. see "note 15 - income taxes" to the consolidated financial statements included in this report for more information on unrecognized tax benefits.
liquidity and capital resource requirements as of december 31, 2019 and december 31, 2018, we had assets classified as cash and cash equivalents, as well as short-term and long-term non-equity investments, in an aggregate amount of $3.8 billion and $8.6 billion, respectively. as of december 31, 2019, this amount included assets held in certain of our foreign operations totaling approximately $3.4 billion. as we repatriate these funds to the u.s., we will be required to pay income taxes in certain u.s. states and applicable foreign withholding taxes on those amounts during the period when such repatriation occurs. we have accrued deferred taxes for the tax effect of repatriating the funds to the u.s.
we actively monitor all counterparties that hold our cash and cash equivalents and non-equity investments, focusing primarily on the safety of principal and secondarily on improving yield on these assets. we diversify our cash and cash equivalents and investments among various counterparties in order to reduce our exposure should any one of these counterparties fail or encounter difficulties. to date, we have not experienced any material loss or lack of access to our invested cash, cash equivalents or short-term investments; however, we can provide no assurances that access to our invested cash, cash equivalents or short-term investments will not be impacted by adverse conditions in the financial markets. at any point in time we have funds in our operating accounts and customer accounts that are deposited and invested with third party financial institutions.
we believe that our existing cash, cash equivalents and short-term and long-term investments, together with cash expected to be generated from operations, borrowings available under our credit agreement and commercial paper program, and our access to capital markets, will be sufficient to fund our operating activities, anticipated capital expenditures, repayment of debt, stock repurchases and dividends for the foreseeable future.
off-balance sheet arrangements as of december 31, 2019, we had no off-balance sheet arrangements that have, or are reasonably likely to have, a current or future material effect on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.
we have a cash pooling arrangement with a financial institution for cash management purposes. this arrangement allows for cash withdrawals from the financial institution based upon our aggregate operating cash balances held within the same financial institution ("aggregate cash deposits"). this arrangement also allows us to withdraw amounts exceeding the aggregate cash deposits up to an agreed-upon limit. the net balance of the withdrawals and the aggregate cash deposits are used by the financial institution as a basis for calculating our net interest expense or income under the arrangement. as of december 31, 2019, we had a total of $4.8 billion in aggregate cash deposits, partially offset by $4.7 billion in cash withdrawals, held within the financial institution under the cash pooling arrangement.
indemnification provisions we entered into a separation and distribution agreement and various other agreements with paypal to govern the separation and relationship of the two companies. these agreements provide for specific indemnity and liability obligations and could lead to disputes between us and paypal, which may be significant. in addition, the indemnity rights we have against paypal under the agreements may not be sufficient to protect us and our indemnity obligations to paypal may be significant.
in addition, we have entered into indemnification agreements with each of our directors, executive officers and certain other officers. these agreements require us to indemnify such individuals, to the fullest extent permitted by delaware law, for certain liabilities to which they may become subject as a result of their affiliation with us.
in the ordinary course of business, we have included limited indemnification provisions in certain of our agreements with parties with which we have commercial relations, including our standard marketing, promotions and application-programming-interface license agreements. under these contracts, we generally indemnify, hold harmless and agree to reimburse the indemnified party for losses suffered or incurred by the indemnified party in connection with claims by a third party with respect to our domain names, trademarks, logos and other branding elements to the extent that such marks are applicable to our performance under the subject agreement. in certain cases, we have agreed to provide indemnification for intellectual property infringement. it is not possible to determine the maximum potential loss under these indemnification provisions due to our limited history of prior indemnification claims and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular provision. to date, losses recorded in our consolidated statement of income in connection with our indemnification provisions have not been significant, either individually or collectively.
critical accounting policies, judgments and estimates general the preparation of our consolidated financial statements and related notes requires us to make judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. we have based our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. our senior management has discussed the development, selection and disclosure of these estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors. actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
an accounting policy is considered to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made, and if different estimates that reasonably could have been used, or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely to occur periodically, could materially impact the consolidated financial statements. we believe the following critical accounting policies reflect the more significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. the following descriptions of critical accounting policies, judgments and estimates should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes and other disclosures included in this report.
revenue recognition we may enter into certain revenue contracts that include promises to transfer multiple goods or services including discounts on future services. we also may enter into arrangements to purchase services from certain customers. as a result, significant interpretation and judgment is sometimes required to determine the appropriate accounting for these transactions including: (1) whether services are considered distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately or combined; (2) developing an estimate of the stand-alone selling price of each distinct performance obligation; (3) whether revenue should be reported gross (as ebay is acting as a principal), or net (as ebay is acting as an agent); (4) evaluating whether a promotion or incentive is a payment to a customer; and (5) whether the arrangement would be characterized as revenue or reimbursement of costs incurred. changes in judgments with respect to these assumptions and estimates could impact the timing or amount of revenue recognition.
income taxes our annual tax rate is based on our income, statutory tax rates and tax planning opportunities available to us in the various jurisdictions in which we operate. tax laws are complex and subject to different interpretations by the taxpayer and respective government taxing authorities. significant judgment is required in determining our tax expense and in evaluating our tax positions, including evaluating uncertainties and the complexity of taxes on foreign earnings. we review our tax positions quarterly and adjust the balances as new information becomes available. tax positions are evaluated for potential reserves for uncertainty based on the estimated probability of sustaining the position under examination. our income tax rate is affected by the tax rates that apply to our foreign earnings including u.s. minimum taxes on foreign earnings. the deferred tax benefit derived from the amortization of our intellectual property is based on the fair value, which has been agreed with foreign tax authorities. the deferred tax benefit may from time to time change based on changes in tax rates. as a result of u.s. tax reform and the current u.s. taxation of deemed repatriated earnings, management has no specific plans to indefinitely reinvest the undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries at the balance sheet date.
deferred tax assets represent amounts available to reduce income taxes payable on taxable income in future years. such assets arise because of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, as well as from net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. we evaluate the recoverability of these future tax deductions and credits by assessing the adequacy of future expected taxable income from all sources, including reversal of taxable temporary differences, forecasted operating earnings and available tax planning strategies. these sources of income rely heavily on estimates that are based on a number of factors, including our historical experience and short-range and long-range business forecasts. as of december 31, 2019, we had a valuation allowance on certain net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards based on our assessment that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset will not be realized.
we recognize and measure uncertain tax positions in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the u.s., or gaap, pursuant to which we only recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such positions are then measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. we report a liability for unrecognized tax benefits resulting from uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. gaap further requires that a change in judgment related to the expected ultimate resolution of uncertain tax positions be recognized in earnings in the quarter in which such change occurs. we recognize interest and penalties, if any, related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense.
we file annual income tax returns in multiple taxing jurisdictions around the world. a number of years may elapse before an uncertain tax position is audited by the relevant tax authorities and finally resolved. while it is often difficult to predict the final outcome or the timing of resolution of any particular uncertain tax position, we believe that our reserves for income taxes reflect the most likely outcome. we adjust these reserves, as well as the related interest, where appropriate in light of changing facts and circumstances. settlement of any particular position could require the use of cash.
income tax provision (benefit)        $415                    $190                  $3,288
our future effective tax rates could be adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in countries where we have lower statutory rates and higher than anticipated in countries where we have higher statutory rates, by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets or liabilities, or by changes or interpretations in tax laws, regulations or accounting principles. in addition, we are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the internal revenue service, as well as various state and foreign tax authorities. we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes.
based on our results for the year ended december 31, 2019, a one-percentage point change in our provision for income taxes as a percentage of income before taxes would have resulted in an increase or decrease in the provision of approximately $22 million, resulting in an approximate $0.03 change in diluted earnings per share.
goodwill and intangible assets the purchase price of an acquired company is allocated between intangible assets and the net tangible assets of the acquired business with the residual of the purchase price recorded as goodwill. the determination of the value of the intangible assets acquired involves certain judgments and estimates. these judgments can include, but are not limited to, the cash flows that an asset is expected to generate in the future and the appropriate weighted average cost of capital.
as of december 31, 2019, our goodwill totaled $5.2 billion and our identifiable intangible assets, net totaled $67 million. we assess the impairment of goodwill of our reporting units annually, or more often if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level by first performing a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value. if the reporting unit does not pass the qualitative assessment, then the reporting unit's carrying value is compared to its fair value. the fair values of the reporting units are estimated using market and discounted cash flow approaches. goodwill is considered impaired if the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value. the discounted cash flow approach uses expected future operating results. the market approach uses comparable company information to determine revenue and earnings multiples to value our reporting units. failure to achieve these expected results or market multiples may cause a future impairment of goodwill at the reporting unit. we conducted our annual impairment test of goodwill as of august 31, 2019 and 2018. as of december 31, 2019, we determined that no impairment of the carrying value of goodwill for any reporting units was required. see "note 4 - goodwill and intangible assets" to the consolidated financial statements included in this report.
legal contingencies in connection with certain pending litigation and other claims, we have estimated the range of probable loss, net of expected recoveries, and provided for such losses through charges to our consolidated statement of income. these estimates have been based on our assessment of the facts and circumstances at each balance sheet date and are subject to change based upon new information and future events.
from time to time, we are involved in disputes and regulatory inquiries that arise in the ordinary course of business. we are currently involved in legal proceedings, some of which are discussed in "item 1a: risk factors," "item 3: legal proceedings" and "note 12 - commitments and contingencies" to the consolidated financial statements included in this report. we believe that we have meritorious defenses to the claims against us, and we intend to defend ourselves vigorously. however, even if successful, our defense against certain actions will be costly and could require significant amounts of management's time and result in the diversion of significant operational resources. if the plaintiffs were to prevail on certain claims, we might be forced to pay significant damages and licensing fees, modify our business practices or even be prohibited from conducting a significant part of our business. any such results could materially harm our business and could result in a material adverse impact on the financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

overview blackrock, inc. (together, with its subsidiaries, unless the context otherwise indicates, "blackrock" or the "company") is a leading publicly traded investment management firm with $7.43 trillion of aum at december 31, 2019. with approximately 16,200 employees in more than 30 countries, blackrock provides a broad range of investment and technology services to institutional and retail clients in more than 100 countries across the globe. for further information see note 1, business overview, and note 27, segment information, in the notes to the consolidated financial statements contained in part ii, item 8.
the following discussion includes a comparison of blackrock's results for 2019 and 2018. for a discussion of blackrock's results for 2017, see "item 7 - management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations" of the company's annual report on form 10-k for the year ended december 31, 2018, which was filed with the sec on february 28, 2019.
united kingdom exit from european union following the june 2016 vote to exit the european union ("eu"), commonly referred to as brexit, the united kingdom ("uk") left the eu on january 31, 2020 and entered an eleven-month transition period during which the uk, and uk-based entities, will retain the rights and obligations of eu membership.
substantial uncertainty remains surrounding the future relationship between the uk and eu, but the uk government has indicated its preference for negotiating a trade deal with the eu before the end of the transition period rather than continuing single market or customs union membership. blackrock is implementing a number of steps to prepare for various outcomes, including there being no agreement in place when the transition period expires. these steps, many of which are time consuming and costly, include effecting organizational, governance and operational changes, applying for and receiving licenses and permissions in the eu, and engaging in client communications, and are expected to add complexity to blackrock's european operations. in addition, depending on the terms of the future relationship between the uk and the eu, blackrock may experience further organizational and operational challenges and incur additional costs in connection with its european operations during the transition period and post-brexit, which may impede the company's growth or impact its financial performance.
acquisition on may 10, 2019, the company acquired 100% of the equity interests of efront holding sas ("efront transaction" or "efront"), a leading alternative investment management software and solutions provider for approximately $1.3 billion, excluding the settlement of efront's outstanding debt. the acquisition of efront expands aladdin's illiquid alternative capabilities and enables blackrock to provide individual alternative or whole-portfolio technology solutions to clients.
business outlook blackrock's framework for long-term value creation is predicated on generating differentiated organic growth, leveraging scale to increase operating margins over time, and returning capital to shareholders on a consistent basis. blackrock's diversified platform, in terms of style, product, client and geography, enables it to generate more stable cash flows through market cycles, positioning blackrock to invest for the long-term by striking an appropriate balance between investing for future growth and prudent discretionary expense management.
blackrock's investment management revenue is primarily comprised of fees earned as a percentage of aum and, in some cases, performance fees, which are normally expressed as a percentage of fund returns to the client. numerous factors, including price movements in the equity, debt or currency markets, or in the price of real assets, commodities or alternative investments in which blackrock invests on behalf of clients, could impact blackrock's aum, revenue and earnings.
blackrock manages $3.8 trillion of equity assets across markets globally. beta divergence between equity markets, where certain markets perform differently than others, may lead to an increase in the proportion of blackrock aum weighted toward lower fee equity products, resulting in a decline in blackrock's effective fee rate. divergent market factors may also erode the correlation between the growth rates of aum and base fees.
blackrock's highly diversified multi-product platform was created to meet client needs in all market environments. blackrock is positioned to provide alpha-seeking active, index and cash management investment strategies across asset classes and geographies. in addition, blackrock leverages its world-class risk management, analytics and technology capabilities, including the aladdin platform, on behalf of clients. blackrock serves a diverse mix of institutional and retail clients across the globe, including investors in ishares etfs, maintaining differentiated client relationships and a fiduciary focus. the diversity of blackrock's platform facilitates the generation of organic growth in various market environments, and as client preferences evolve. client demand continues for etfs and illiquid alternatives, which are two areas of focus for blackrock.
the index investing industry has been growing rapidly - with etfs as a major beneficiary - driven by structural tailwinds including the migration from commission-based to fee-based wealth management, clients' focus on value for money, the use of etfs as alpha tools and the growth of all-to-all networked trading. ishares etfs' growth strategy is centered on increasing scale and pursuing global growth themes in client and product segments, including core, strategic, which includes fixed income, factors, sustainable and megatrends etfs, and precision exposures.
as the wealth management landscape shifts globally from individual product selection to a whole-portfolio approach, blackrock's retail strategy is focused on creating outcome-oriented client solutions. this includes having a diverse platform of alpha-seeking active, index and alternative products, as well as enhanced distribution and portfolio construction technology offerings. digital wealth tools are an important component of blackrock's retail strategy, as blackrock scales and customizes model portfolios, extends aladdin wealth and digital wealth partnerships globally, and helps advisors build better portfolios through portfolio construction and risk management, powered by aladdin.
blackrock continues to invest in technology services offerings, which enhance the ability to manage portfolios and risk, effectively serve clients and operate efficiently. anticipated industry consolidation and regulatory requirements should continue to drive demand for holistic and flexible technology solutions. in 2019, blackrock completed the acquisition of efront, a leading end-to-end alternative investment management software and solutions provider. efront, in combination with aladdin, will provide clients with an ability to manage portfolios and risk across public and private asset classes on a single platform.
across blackrock, more clients are focusing on the impact of sustainability on their portfolios. this shift has been driven by an increased understanding of how sustainability-related factors can affect economic growth, asset values, and financial markets as a whole. as a fiduciary, blackrock is committed to helping clients build more resilient portfolios. since sustainable investment options have the potential to offer clients better outcomes, we are making sustainability integral to the way blackrock manages risk, constructs portfolios, designs products, and engages with companies. over the past several years, blackrock has been deepening the integration of sustainability into technology, risk management, and product choice across blackrock, and plans to accelerate those efforts.

gaap.  operating income of $5,551 million increased $94 million from 2018. operating income growth reflected higher base fees and technology services revenue, partially offset by higher compensation and benefits expense and higher general and administration expense. operating income for 2019 also included $61 million of product launch costs associated with the close of the $1.4 billion blackrock science and technology trust ii, a closed-end active equity fund. operating income for 2018 included a restructuring charge of $60 million from an initiative to modify the size and shape of the workforce. nonoperating income (expense), less net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests ("nci"), increased $262 million from 2018 driven by higher marks on unhedged seed capital investments and the revaluation of certain minority investments. nonoperating results for 2018 included a $40 million pre-tax gain related to the sale of the company's minority interest in dsp blackrock investment managers pvt. ltd. to the dsp group ("dsp transaction").
income tax expense for 2019 included $28 million of discrete tax benefits, primarily related to stock-based compensation awards. income tax expense for 2018 included $145 million of discrete tax benefits, primarily related to changes in the company's organizational entity structure and stock-based compensation awards. see income tax expense within discussion of financial results for more information.
diluted earnings per common share increased $1.85, or 7%, from 2018, reflecting higher operating and nonoperating income, and a lower diluted share count, partially offset by a higher effective tax rate in the current year.
as adjusted.  operating income of $5,551 million increased $20 million from 2018. in 2018, the pre-tax restructuring charge of $60 million described above has been excluded from as adjusted results. diluted earnings per common share increased $1.55, or 6%, from 2018, driven primarily by higher nonoperating income and a lower diluted share count, partially offset by a higher effective tax rate.
see non-gaap financial measures for further information on as adjusted items.
for further discussion of blackrock's revenue, expense, nonoperating results and income tax expense, see discussion of financial results herein.
non-gaap financial measures blackrock reports its financial results in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states ("gaap"); however, management believes evaluating the company's ongoing operating results may be enhanced if investors have additional non-gaap financial measures. management reviews non-gaap financial measures to assess ongoing operations and considers them to be helpful, for both management and investors, in evaluating blackrock's financial performance over time. management also uses non-gaap financial measures as a benchmark to compare its performance with other companies and to enhance the comparability of this information for the reporting periods presented. non-gaap measures may pose limitations because they do not include all of blackrock's revenue and expense. blackrock's management does not advocate that investors consider such non-gaap financial measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with gaap. non-gaap measures may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies.
management uses both gaap and non-gaap financial measures in evaluating blackrock's financial performance. adjustments to gaap financial measures ("non-gaap adjustments") include certain items management deems nonrecurring or that occur infrequently, transactions that ultimately will not impact blackrock's book value or certain tax items that do not impact cash flow.
computations for all periods are derived from the consolidated statements of income as follows:
(1) operating income, as adjusted, and operating margin, as adjusted:
management believes operating income, as adjusted, and operating margin, as adjusted, are effective indicators of blackrock's financial performance over time and, therefore, provide useful disclosure to investors. management believes that operating margin, as adjusted, reflects the company's long-term ability to manage ongoing costs in relation to its revenues. the company uses operating margin, as adjusted, to assess the company's financial performance and to determine the long-term and annual compensation of the company's senior-level employees. furthermore, this metric is used to evaluate the company's relative performance against industry peers, as it eliminates margin variability arising from the accounting of revenues and expenses related to distributing different product structures in multiple distribution channels utilized by asset managers.
operating income, gaap basis                                       $5,551                 $5,457
non-gaap expense adjustments:
operating income, as adjusted                                       5,551                  5,531
operating income used for operating margin measurement             $5,612                 $5,544
non-gaap adjustments:
revenue used for operating margin measurement                     $12,854                $12,523
operating margin, gaap basis                                         38.2   %               38.4   %
operating margin, as adjusted                                        43.7   %               44.3   %
•   operating income, as adjusted, includes non-gaap expense adjustments. in 2018, a restructuring charge, primarily comprised of severance and accelerated amortization expense of previously granted deferred compensation awards, has been excluded to provide more meaningful analysis of blackrock's ongoing operations and to ensure comparability among periods presented. in 2018, the portion of compensation expense associated with certain long-term incentive plans ("ltip") funded, or to be funded, through share distributions to participants of blackrock stock held by pnc has been excluded because it ultimately does not impact blackrock's book value.
•   operating income used for measuring operating margin, as adjusted, is equal to operating income, as adjusted, excluding the impact of product launch costs (e.g. closed-end fund launch costs) and related commissions. management believes the exclusion of such costs and related commissions is useful because these costs can fluctuate considerably and revenue associated with the expenditure of these costs will not fully impact blackrock's results until future periods.
•   revenue used for calculating operating margin, as adjusted, is reduced to exclude all of the company's distribution fees, which are recorded as a separate line item on the consolidated statements of income, as well as a portion of investment advisory fees received that is used to pay distribution and servicing costs. for certain products, based on distinct arrangements, distribution fees are collected by the company and then passed-through to third-party client intermediaries. for other products, investment advisory fees are collected by the company and a portion is passed-through to third-party client intermediaries. however, in both structures, the third-party client intermediary similarly owns the relationship with the retail client and is responsible for distributing the product and servicing the client. the amount of distribution and investment advisory fees fluctuates each period primarily based on a predetermined percentage of the value of aum during the period. these fees also vary based on the type of investment product sold and the geographic location where it is sold. in addition, the company may waive fees on certain products that could result in the reduction of payments to the third-party intermediaries.
non-gaap adjustments:
restructuring charge, net of tax                                      -              47
pnc ltip funding obligation, net of tax                               -              12
management believes net income attributable to blackrock, inc., as adjusted, and diluted earnings per common share, as adjusted, are useful measures of blackrock's profitability and financial performance. net income attributable to blackrock, inc., as adjusted, equals net income attributable to blackrock, inc., gaap basis, adjusted for significant nonrecurring items, charges that ultimately will not impact blackrock's book value or certain tax items that do not impact cash flow.
see aforementioned discussion regarding operating income, as adjusted, and operating margin, as adjusted, for information on the pnc ltip funding obligation and restructuring charge.
for each period presented, the non-gaap adjustment related to the restructuring charge and pnc ltip funding obligation was tax effected at the respective blended rates applicable to the adjustments. amounts for income tax matters represent net noncash (benefits) expense primarily associated with the revaluation of certain deferred tax liabilities related to intangible assets and goodwill as a result of tax rate changes. amounts have been excluded from the as adjusted results as these items will not have a cash flow impact and to ensure comparability among periods presented.
(3) nonvoting participating preferred stock is considered to be a common stock equivalent for purposes of determining basic and diluted earnings per share calculations.
assets under management aum for reporting purposes generally is based upon how investment advisory and administration fees are calculated for each portfolio. net asset values, total assets, committed assets or other measures may be used to determine portfolio aum.

(3)   average aum is calculated as the average of the month-end spot aum amounts for the trailing thirteen months.
aum decreased $312.4 billion to $5.98 trillion at december 31, 2018 from $6.29 trillion at december 31, 2017 driven by net market depreciation and the impact of foreign exchange movements, partially offset by positive long-term net flows, led by ishares etfs, active multi-asset and illiquid alternatives, and net aum added from strategic transactions.
net market depreciation of $384.1 billion was driven by lower global equity markets.
aum decreased $79.4 billion due to the impact of foreign exchange movements, primarily due to the strengthening of the us dollar, largely against the british pound and euro.
discussion of financial results introduction the company derives a substantial portion of its revenue from investment advisory and administration fees, which are recognized as the services are performed over time because the customer is receiving and consuming the benefits as they are provided by the company. fees are primarily based on agreed-upon percentages of aum and recognized for services provided during the period, which are distinct from services provided in other periods. such fees are affected by changes in aum, including market appreciation or depreciation, foreign exchange translation and net inflows or outflows. net inflows or outflows represent the sum of new client assets, additional fundings from existing clients (including dividend reinvestment), withdrawals of assets from, and termination of, client accounts and distributions to investors representing return of capital and return on investments to investors. market appreciation or depreciation includes current income earned on, and changes in the fair value of, securities held in client accounts. foreign exchange translation reflects the impact of translating non-us dollar denominated aum into us dollars for reporting purposes.
the company also earns revenue by lending securities on behalf of clients, primarily to highly rated banks and broker-dealers. the securities loaned are secured by collateral in the form of cash or securities, with minimum collateral generally ranging from approximately 102% to 112% of the value of the loaned securities. generally, the revenue earned is shared between the company and the funds or accounts managed by the company from which the securities are borrowed. historically, securities lending revenue in the second quarter exceeds revenue in the other quarters during the year driven by higher seasonal demand.
investment advisory agreements for certain separate accounts and investment funds provide for performance fees based upon relative and/or absolute investment performance, in addition to base fees based on aum. investment advisory performance fees generally are earned after a given period of time and when investment performance exceeds a contractual threshold. as such, the timing of recognition of performance fees may increase the volatility of the company's revenue and earnings. the magnitude of performance fees can fluctuate quarterly due to the timing of carried interest recognition on alternative products; however, the third and fourth quarters have a greater number of nonalternative products with performance measurement periods that end on either september 30 or december 31.
the company offers investment management technology systems, risk management services, wealth management and digital distribution tools, all on a fee basis. clients include banks, insurance companies, official institutions, pension funds, asset managers, retail distributors and other investors. fees earned for technology services are primarily recorded as services are performed over time and are generally determined using the value of positions on the aladdin platform, or on a fixed-rate basis.  revenue derived from the sale of software licenses is recognized upon the granting of access rights.
the company earns distribution and service fees for distributing investment products and providing support services to investments portfolios. the fees are based on aum and are recognized when the amount of fees is known.
the company advises global financial institutions, regulators, and government entities across a range of risk, regulatory, capital markets and strategic services. fees earned for advisory services, which are included in advisory and other revenue, are determined using fixed-rate fees and are recognized over time as the related services are completed.
the company earns fees for transition management services primarily comprised of commissions recognized in connection with buying and selling securities on behalf of its customers. commissions related to transition management services, which are included in advisory and other revenue, are recorded on a trade-date basis as transactions occur.
operating expense reflects employee compensation and benefits, distribution and servicing costs, direct fund expense, general and administration expense and amortization of finite-lived intangible assets.
•   employee compensation and benefits expense includes salaries, commissions, temporary help, deferred and incentive compensation, employer payroll taxes, severance and related benefit costs.
•   distribution and servicing costs, which are primarily aum driven, include payments to third parties, primarily associated with distribution and servicing of client investments in certain company products.
•   direct fund expense primarily consists of third-party nonadvisory expenses incurred by the company related to certain funds for the use of index trademarks, reference data for indices, custodial services, fund administration, fund accounting, transfer agent services, shareholder reporting services, legal expense, and audit and tax services as well as other fund-related expenses directly attributable to the nonadvisory operations of the fund. these expenses may vary over time with fluctuations in aum, number of shareholder accounts, or other attributes directly related to volume of business.
•   general and administration expense includes marketing and promotional, occupancy and office-related costs, portfolio services (including clearing expense related to transition management services), technology, professional services, communications, contingent consideration fair value adjustments, product launch costs, the impact of foreign currency remeasurement, and other general and administration expense. foreign currency remeasurement losses were $31 million and $16 million for 2019 and 2018, respectively.
approximately 75% of the company's revenue is generated in us dollars. the company's revenue and expense generated in foreign currencies (primarily the euro and british pound) are impacted by foreign exchange rates. any effect of foreign exchange rate change on revenue is partially offset by a change in expense driven by the company's considerable non-dollar expense base related to its operations outside the united states.
nonoperating income (expense) includes the effect of changes in the valuations on investments and earnings on equity method investments as well as interest and dividend income and interest expense. the company primarily holds seed and co-investments in sponsored investment products that invest in a variety of asset classes, including private equity, hedge funds and real assets. investments generally are made for co-investment purposes, to establish a performance track record or for regulatory purposes, including federal reserve bank stock. the company does not engage in proprietary trading activities that could conflict with the interests of its clients.
in addition, nonoperating income (expense) includes the impact of changes in the valuations of consolidated sponsored investment funds. the portion of nonoperating income (expense) not attributable to the company is allocated to nci on the consolidated statements of income.

revenue increased $341 million, or 2%, from 2018, primarily driven by higher base fees and 24% growth in technology services revenue.
investment advisory, administration fees and securities lending revenue of $11,777 million in 2019 increased $224 million from $11,553 million in 2018, reflecting the positive impact of market beta and foreign exchange movements, organic growth and acquisitions, partially offset by the negative impact of strategic price changes to certain products. securities lending revenue of $617 million in 2019 compared with $627 million in 2018.
investment advisory performance fees of $450 million in 2019 increased $38 million from $412 million in 2018, primarily reflecting higher revenue from illiquid and liquid alternative products, partially offset by lower revenue from long-only equity products.
technology services revenue of $974 million for 2019 increased $189 million from $785 million in 2018, primarily reflecting the impact of the efront transaction and higher revenue from aladdin.
advisory and other revenue of $269 million in 2019 decreased $24 million from $293 million in 2018, primarily reflecting lower fees from advisory assignments.

gaap. expense increased $247 million, or 3%, from 2018, primarily driven by higher employee compensation and benefits expense, higher general and administration expense and expense linked to the efront transaction.
employee compensation and benefits expense increased $150 million, or 3%, to $4,470 million in 2019 from $4,320 million in 2018, primarily reflecting higher headcount, higher performance fees and higher deferred compensation expense. employees at december 31, 2019 totaled approximately 16,200 compared with approximately 14,900 at december 31, 2018.
general and administration expense increased $120 million from 2018, reflecting higher technology expense, higher product launch costs, the impact of the efront transaction and the impact of foreign exchange remeasurement expense, partially offset by lower contingent consideration fair value adjustments related to prior acquisitions and lower marketing and promotional, and portfolio services expense.
amortization of intangible assets expense increased $47 million, or 94%, to $97 million in 2019, primarily reflecting amortization of intangible assets associated with the efront transaction.

balance sheet overview the following table presents a reconciliation of the consolidated statement of financial condition presented on a gaap basis to the consolidated statement of financial condition, excluding the impact of separate account assets and separate account collateral held under securities lending agreements (directly related to lending separate account securities) and separate account liabilities and separate account collateral liabilities under securities lending agreements and consolidated sponsored investment products.
the company presents the as adjusted balance sheet as additional information to enable investors to exclude certain assets that have equal and offsetting liabilities or noncontrolling interests that ultimately do not have an impact on stockholders' equity or cash flows. management views the as adjusted balance sheet, which contains non-gaap financial measures, as an economic presentation of the company's total assets and liabilities; however, it does not advocate that investors consider such non-gaap financial measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with gaap.
separate account assets and liabilities and separate account collateral held under securities lending agreements separate account assets are maintained by blackrock life limited, a wholly owned subsidiary of the company that is a registered life insurance company in the united kingdom, and represent segregated assets held for purposes of funding individual and group pension contracts. the company records equal and offsetting separate account liabilities. the separate account assets are not available to creditors of the company and the holders of the pension contracts have no recourse to the company's assets. the net investment income attributable to separate account assets accrues directly to the contract owners and is not reported on the consolidated statements of income. while blackrock has no economic interest in these assets or liabilities, blackrock earns an investment advisory fee for the service of managing these assets on behalf of its clients.
in addition, the company records on its consolidated statements of financial condition the separate account collateral received under blackrock life limited securities lending arrangements as its own asset in addition to an equal and offsetting separate account collateral liability for the obligation to return the collateral. the collateral is not available to creditors of the company, and the borrowers under the securities lending arrangements have no recourse to the company's assets.
consolidated sponsored investment products the company consolidates certain sponsored investment products accounted for as vies and voting rights entities ("vres"), (collectively, "consolidated sponsored investment products"). see note 2, significant accounting policies, in the notes to the consolidated financial statements contained in part ii, item 8 of this filing for more information on the company's consolidation policy.
the company cannot readily access cash and cash equivalents or other assets held by consolidated sponsored investment products to use in its operating activities. in addition, the company cannot readily sell investments held by consolidated sponsored investment products in order to obtain cash for use in the company's operations.

(1)   amounts represent segregated client assets and related liabilities. blackrock has no economic interest in these assets or liabilities. blackrock earns an investment advisory fee for the service of managing these assets on behalf of its clients.
(2)   amounts represent the portion of assets and liabilities of consolidated sponsored investment products attributable to nci.
(4)   amount includes approximately $4.2 billion of deferred income tax liabilities related to goodwill and intangibles. see note 25, income taxes, in the notes to the consolidated financial statements contained in part ii, item 8 of this filing for more information.
the following discussion summarizes the significant changes in assets and liabilities on a gaap basis. please see the consolidated statements of financial condition as of december 31, 2019 and 2018 contained in part ii, item 8 of this filing. the discussion does not include changes related to assets and liabilities that are equal and offsetting and have no impact on blackrock's stockholders' equity.
assets. cash and cash equivalents at december 31, 2019 and 2018 included $141 million and $245 million, respectively, of cash held by consolidated sponsored investment products (see liquidity and capital resources for details on the change in cash and cash equivalents during 2019).
accounts receivable at december 31, 2019 increased $522 million from december 31, 2018, primarily due to higher base fees, technology services and performance fee receivables. investments were $5,489 million at december 31, 2019 (for more information see investments herein). goodwill and intangible assets increased $1,566 million from december 31, 2018, primarily due to the efront transaction, partially offset by amortization of intangible assets. other assets (including operating lease right-of-use ("rou") assets and property and equipment) increased $237 million from december 31, 2018, primarily due to the initial recognition of the operating lease rou assets related to the adoption of the new lease accounting guidance and an increase in certain corporate minority investments, property and equipment, and unit trust receivables (substantially offset by an increase in unit trust payables recorded within other liabilities), partially offset by a decrease in other assets of consolidated sponsored investment products.
liabilities. accrued compensation and benefits at december 31, 2019 increased $69 million from december 31, 2018, primarily due to higher 2019 deferred compensation accruals. other liabilities increased $207 million from december 31, 2018, primarily due to the initial recognition of the operating lease liabilities related to the adoption of the new lease accounting guidance and higher unit trust payables (substantially offset by an increase in unit trust receivables recorded within other assets), partially offset by a decrease in contingent liability in connection with certain prior acquisitions, and restructuring liability payments and a decrease in other liabilities of consolidated sponsored investment products. net deferred income tax liabilities at december 31, 2019 increased $163 million from december 31, 2018, primarily due to the effects of temporary differences associated with the efront transaction and investment income.
investments the company's investments were $5,489 million and $4,476 million at december 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. investments include consolidated investments held by sponsored investment products accounted for as vies and vres. management reviews blackrock's investments on an "economic" basis, which eliminates the portion of investments that does not impact blackrock's book value or net income attributable to blackrock. blackrock's management does not advocate that investors consider such non-gaap financial measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with gaap.
the company presents investments, as adjusted, to enable investors to understand the portion of investments that is owned by the company, net of nci, as a gauge to measure the impact of changes in net nonoperating income (expense) on investments to net income (loss) attributable to blackrock.
the company further presents net "economic" investment exposure, net of deferred compensation investments and hedged investments, to reflect another helpful measure for investors. the economic impact of investments held pursuant to deferred compensation arrangements is offset by a change in compensation expense. the impact of certain investments is substantially mitigated by swap hedges. carried interest capital allocations are excluded as there is no impact to blackrock's stockholders' equity until such amounts are realized as performance fees. finally, the company's regulatory investment in federal reserve bank stock, which is not subject to market or interest rate risk, is excluded from the company's net economic investment exposure.
total "economic" investment exposure                                      $2,707                $2,385
(1)   amount included $514 million and $369 million of carried interest (vies) as of december 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, which has no impact on the company's "economic" investment exposure.
the following table represents the carrying value of the company's economic investment exposure, by asset type, at december 31, 2019 and 2018:
total "economic" investment exposure            $2,707            $2,385

liquidity and capital resources blackrock cash flows excluding the impact of consolidated sponsored investment products the consolidated statements of cash flows include the cash flows of the consolidated sponsored investment products. the company uses an adjusted cash flow statement, which excludes the impact of consolidated sponsored investment products, as a supplemental non-gaap measure to assess liquidity and capital requirements. the company believes that its cash flows, excluding the impact of the consolidated sponsored investment products, provide investors with useful information on the cash flows of blackrock relating to its ability to fund additional operating, investing and financing activities. blackrock's management does not advocate that investors consider such non-gaap measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, its cash flows presented in accordance with gaap.
the following table presents a reconciliation of the consolidated statements of cash flows presented on a gaap basis to the consolidated statements of cash flows, excluding the impact of the cash flows of consolidated sponsored investment products:

sources of blackrock's operating cash primarily include investment advisory, administration fees and securities lending revenue, performance fees, technology services revenue, advisory revenue and distribution fees. blackrock uses its cash to pay for all operating expense, interest and principal on borrowings, income taxes, dividends on blackrock's capital stock, repurchases of the company's stock, acquisitions, capital expenditures and purchases of co-investments and seed investments.
for details of the company's gaap cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities, see the consolidated statements of cash flows contained in part ii, item 8 of this filing.
cash flows provided by operating activities, excluding the impact of consolidated sponsored investment products, primarily include the receipt of investment advisory and administration fees, securities lending revenue and performance fees offset by the payment of operating expenses incurred in the normal course of business, including year-end incentive compensation accrued for in the prior year.
cash flows used in investing activities, excluding the impact of consolidated sponsored investment products, for 2019 were $1,904 million and primarily reflected $1.5 billion of cash outflow related to the efront transaction, $693 million of investment purchases and $254 million of purchases of property and equipment, partially offset by $417 million of net proceeds from sales and maturities of certain investments.
cash flows used in financing activities, excluding the impact of consolidated sponsored investment products, for 2019 were $4,152 million, primarily resulting from $1.9 billion of share repurchases, including $400 million in open market transactions, a $1.3 billion private transaction and $245 million of employee tax withholdings related to employee stock transactions, $2.1 billion of cash dividend payments, and $1 billion of repayments of long-term borrowings, partially offset by $992 million of proceeds from long-term borrowings.
the company manages its financial condition and funding to maintain appropriate liquidity for the business. liquidity resources at december 31, 201 and 201 were as follows:
total liquidity resources(3)                                                               $8,688               $10,243
(1)   the percentage of cash and cash equivalents held by the company's us subsidiaries was approximately 45% and 50% at december 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. see net capital requirements herein for more information on net capital requirements in certain regulated subsidiaries.
(2)   the company cannot readily access such cash to use in its operating activities.
(3)   amounts do not reflect a reduction for year-end incentive compensation accruals of approximately $1.4 billion for both 2019 and 2018, which are paid in the first quarter of the following year.
total liquidity resources decreased $1,555 million during 2019, primarily reflecting cash dividend payments of $2.1 billion, share repurchases of $1.9 billion, reflecting the impact of a $1.3 billion private transaction, and approximately $1.5 billion of cash outflow related to the efront transaction, partially offset by cash flows from operating activities.
a significant portion of the company's $3,995 million of investments, as adjusted, is illiquid in nature and, as such, cannot be readily convertible to cash.
share repurchases. in january 2019, the board of directors authorized the repurchase of an additional seven million shares under the company's existing share repurchase program for a total up to approximately 9.9 million shares of blackrock common stock.
during 2019, the company repurchased 4.0 million common shares under the share repurchase program for approximately $1.7 billion, including a $1.3 billion private transaction that closed on march 25, 2019. at december 31, 2019, there were 5.9 million shares still authorized to be repurchased.
net capital requirements. the company is required to maintain net capital in certain regulated subsidiaries within a number of jurisdictions, which is partially maintained by retaining cash and cash equivalent investments in those subsidiaries or jurisdictions. as a result, such subsidiaries of the company may be restricted in their ability to transfer cash between different jurisdictions and to their parents. additionally, transfers of cash between international jurisdictions may have adverse tax consequences that could discourage such transfers.
blackrock institutional trust company, n.a. ("btc") is chartered as a national bank that does not accept deposits or make commercial loans and whose powers are limited to trust and other fiduciary activities. btc provides investment management and other fiduciary services, including investment advisory and securities lending agency services, to institutional clients. btc is subject to regulatory capital and liquid asset requirements administered by the office of the comptroller of the currency.
at december 31, 2019 and 2018, the company was required to maintain approximately $1.9 billion and $1.8 billion, respectively, in net capital in certain regulated subsidiaries, including btc, entities regulated by the financial conduct authority and prudential regulation authority in the united kingdom, and the company's broker-dealers. the company was in compliance with all applicable regulatory net capital requirements.
undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries. as a result of the 2017 tax cuts and jobs act and the one-time mandatory deemed repatriation tax on untaxed accumulated foreign earnings, us income taxes were provided on the company's undistributed foreign earnings. the financial statement basis in excess of tax basis of its foreign subsidiaries remains indefinitely reinvested in foreign operations. the company will continue to evaluate its capital management plans throughout 2020.
2019 revolving credit facility. the company's credit facility has an aggregate commitment amount of $4 billion and was amended in march 2019 to extend the maturity date to march 2024 (the "2019 credit facility"). the 2019 credit facility permits the company to request up to an additional $1 billion of borrowing capacity, subject to lender credit approval, increasing the overall size of the 2019 credit facility to an aggregate principal amount not to exceed $5 billion. interest on borrowings outstanding accrues at a rate based on the applicable london interbank offered rate plus a spread. the 2019 credit facility requires the company not to exceed a maximum leverage ratio (ratio of net debt to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, where net debt equals total debt less unrestricted cash) of 3 to 1, which was satisfied with a ratio of less than 1 to 1 at december 31, 2019. the 2019 credit facility provides back-up liquidity to fund ongoing working capital for general corporate purposes and various investment opportunities. at december 31, 2019, the company had no amount outstanding under the credit facility.
commercial paper program.  the company can issue unsecured commercial paper notes (the "cp notes") on a private-placement basis up to a maximum aggregate amount outstanding at any time of $4 billion. the commercial paper program is currently supported by the 2019 credit facility. at december 31, 2019, blackrock had no cp notes outstanding.
long-term borrowings the carrying value of long-term borrowings at december 31, 2019 included the following:
(1)   the carrying value of the 1.25% notes is calculated using the eur/usd foreign exchange rate as of december 31, 2019.
in april 2019, the company issued $1 billion in aggregate principal amount of 3.25% senior unsecured and unsubordinated notes maturing on april 30, 2029 (the "2029 notes"). the net proceeds of the 2029 notes were used for general corporate purposes, which included a portion of the purchase price of the efront transaction, repayment of a portion of the $1 billion 5.00% notes in december 2019 and repayment of borrowings under its commercial paper program. interest is payable semi-annually on april 30 and october 30 of each year, which commenced on october 30, 2019, and is approximately $33 million per year. the 2029 notes may be redeemed prior to january 30, 2029 in whole or in part at any time, at the option of the company, at a "make-whole" redemption price or at par thereafter. the unamortized discount and debt issuance costs are being amortized over the remaining term of the 2029 notes.
in december 2019, the company fully repaid $1 billion of 5.00% notes at maturity.
in january 2020, the company issued $1 billion in aggregate principal amount of 2.40% senior unsecured and unsubordinated notes maturing on april 30, 2030 (the "2030 notes"). the net proceeds of the 2030 notes will be used for general corporate purposes. interest of approximately $24 million per year will be payable semi-annually on april 30 and october 30 of each year, commencing april 30, 2020. the 2030 notes may be redeemed prior to january 30, 2030 in whole or in part at any time, at the option of the company, at a "make-whole" redemption price or at 100% of the principal amount of the 2030 notes thereafter. the discount and debt issuance costs will be amortized over the term of the 2030 notes.

contractual obligations, commitments and contingencies the following table sets forth contractual obligations, commitments and contingencies by year of payment at december 31, 2019:
operating leases                                                  158               152               141           125               110           1,682         2,368
contingent payments related to business acquisitions(2)           189                19                 -             -                 -               -           208
(1)   the amount of principal and interest payments for the 1.25% notes (issued in euros) represents the expected payment amounts using the eur/usd foreign exchange rate as of december 31, 2019.
(2)   the amount of contingent payments reflected for any year represents the expected payments using foreign currency exchange rates as of december 31, 2019. the fair value of the remaining aggregate contingent payments at december 31, 2019 totaled $193 million and is included in other liabilities on the consolidated statements of financial condition.
(3)   at december 31, 2019, the company had approximately $618 million of net unrecognized tax benefits. due to the uncertainty of timing and amounts that will ultimately be paid, this amount has been excluded from the table above.
operating leases. the company leases its primary office locations under agreements that expire on varying dates through 2043. in connection with certain lease agreements, the company is responsible for escalation payments. the contractual obligations table above includes only guaranteed minimum lease payments for such leases and does not project potential escalation or other lease-related payments.
in may 2017, the company entered into an agreement with 50 hymc owner llc, for the lease of approximately 847,000 square feet of office space located at 50 hudson yards, new york, new york. the term of the lease is twenty years from the date that rental payments begin, expected to occur in may 2023, with the option to renew for a specified term. the lease requires annual base rental payments of approximately $51 million per year during the first five years of the lease term, increasing every five years to $58 million, $66 million and $74 million per year (or approximately $1.2 billion in base rent over its twenty-year term). in november 2019, the company exercised its initial expansion option with respect to two additional floors of approximately 122,000 square feet of office space. the additional space requires approximately $185 million in base rent over its twenty-year term.
for more information on the company's operating leases, see note 13, leases, in the notes to the consolidated financial statements contained in part ii, item 8 of this filing.
purchase obligations. in the ordinary course of business, blackrock enters into contracts or purchase obligations with third parties whereby the third parties provide services to or on behalf of blackrock. purchase obligations included in the contractual obligations table above represent executory contracts, which are either noncancelable or cancelable with a penalty. at december 31, 201, the company's obligations primarily reflected standard service contracts for portfolio services, market data, office-related services and third-party marketing and promotional services, and obligations for equipment. purchase obligations are recorded on the consolidated financial statements when services are provided and, as such, obligations for services and equipment not received are not included in the consolidated statement of financial condition at december 31, 2019.
investment commitments. at december 31, 2019, the company had $553 million of various capital commitments to fund sponsored investment products, including consolidated sponsored investment products. these products include private equity funds, real assets funds and opportunistic funds. this amount excludes additional commitments made by consolidated funds of funds to underlying third-party funds as third-party noncontrolling interest holders have the legal obligation to fund the respective commitments of such funds of funds. generally, the timing of the funding of these commitments is unknown and the commitments are callable on demand at any time prior to the expiration of the commitment. these unfunded commitments are not recorded on the consolidated statements of financial condition. these commitments do not include potential future commitments approved by the company that are not yet legally binding. the company intends to make additional capital commitments from time to time to fund additional investment products for, and with, its clients.
contingent payments related to business acquisitions. in connection with certain acquisitions, blackrock is required to make contingent payments, subject to achieving specified performance targets, which may include revenue related to acquired contracts or new capital commitments for certain products. the fair value of the remaining aggregate contingent payments at december 31, 2019 totaled $193 million, and is included in other liabilities on the consolidated statements of financial condition.
carried interest clawback. as a general partner in certain investment products, including private equity partnerships and certain hedge funds, the company may receive carried interest cash distributions from the partnerships in accordance with distribution provisions of the partnership agreements. the company may, from time to time, be required to return all or a portion of such distributions to the limited partners in the event the limited partners do not achieve a return as specified in the various partnership agreements. therefore, blackrock records carried interest subject to such clawback provisions in investments, or cash and cash equivalents to the extent that it is distributed, and as a deferred carried interest liability on its consolidated statements of financial condition. carried interest is recorded as performance fees on blackrock's consolidated statements of income when fees are no longer probable of significant reversal.
indemnifications. in the ordinary course of business or in connection with certain acquisition agreements, blackrock enters into contracts pursuant to which it may agree to indemnify third parties in certain circumstances. the terms of these indemnities vary from contract to contract and the amount of indemnification liability, if any, cannot be determined or the likelihood of any liability is considered remote and, therefore, has not been included in the table above or recorded in the consolidated statement of financial condition at december 31, 2019. see further discussion in note 16, commitments and contingencies, in the notes to the consolidated financial statements contained in part ii, item 8 of this filing.
on behalf of certain clients, the company lends securities to highly rated banks and broker-dealers. in these securities lending transactions, the borrower is required to provide and maintain collateral at or above regulatory minimums. securities on loan are marked to market daily to determine if the borrower is required to pledge additional collateral. in connection with securities lending transactions, blackrock has agreed to indemnify certain securities lending clients against potential loss resulting from a borrower's failure to fulfill its obligations under the securities lending agreement should the value of the collateral pledged by the borrower at the time of default be insufficient to cover the borrower's obligation under the securities lending agreement. the amount of securities on loan as of december 31, 2019 and subject to this type of indemnification was $210 billion. in the company's capacity as lending agent, cash and securities totaling $226 billion was held as collateral for indemnified securities on loan at december 31, 2019. the fair value of these indemnifications was not material at december 31, 2019.
while the collateral pledged by a borrower is intended to be sufficient to offset the borrower's obligations to return securities borrowed and any other amounts owing to the lender under the relevant securities lending agreement, in the event of a borrower default, the company can give no assurance that the collateral pledged by the borrower will be sufficient to fulfill such obligations. if the amount of such pledged collateral is not sufficient to fulfill such obligations to a client for whom the company has provided indemnification, blackrock would be responsible for the amount of the shortfall. these indemnifications cover only the collateral shortfall described above, and do not in any way guarantee, assume or otherwise insure the investment performance or return of any cash collateral vehicle into which securities lending cash collateral is invested.
compensation and benefit obligations. the company has various compensation and benefit obligations, including bonuses, commissions and incentive payments payable, defined contribution plan matching contribution obligations, and deferred compensation arrangements, that are excluded from the contractual obligations and commitments table above. accrued compensation and benefits at december 31, 2019 totaled $2,057 million and included annual incentive compensation of $1,372 million, deferred compensation of $399 million and other compensation and benefits related obligations of $286 million. substantially all of the incentive compensation liability was paid in the first quarter of 2020, while the deferred compensation obligations are payable over various periods, with the majority payable over periods of up to three years.
critical accounting policies the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expense during the reporting periods. actual results could differ significantly from those estimates. management considers the following critical accounting policies important to understanding the consolidated financial statements. for a summary of these and additional accounting policies see note 2, significant accounting policies, in the consolidated financial statements included in part ii, item 8 of this filing, including information regarding the adoption of accounting standards update 2016-02, leases.
consolidation in the normal course of business, the company is the manager of various types of sponsored investment vehicles. the company performs an analysis for investment products to determine if the product is a vie or a vre. assessing whether an entity is a vie or a vre involves judgment and analysis. factors considered in this assessment include the entity's legal organization, the entity's capital structure and equity ownership, and any related party or de facto agent implications of the company's involvement with the entity. investments that are determined to be vres are consolidated if the company can exert control over the financial and operating policies of the investee, which generally exists if there is greater than 50% voting interest. investments that are determined to be vies are consolidated if the company is the primary beneficiary ("pb") of the entity. blackrock is deemed to be the pb of a vie if it has the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the entities' economic performance and has the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits that potentially could be significant to the vie. the company generally consolidates vies in which it holds an economic interest of 10% or greater and deconsolidates such vies once equity ownership falls below 10%. see note 6, consolidated sponsored investment products, in the notes to the consolidated financial statements contained in part ii, item 8 of this filing for more information.
investments equity method investments. for equity investments where blackrock does not control the investee, and where it is not the pb of a vie, but can exert significant influence over the financial and operating policies of the investee, the company follows the equity method of accounting. the evaluation of whether the company exerts control or significant influence over the financial and operational policies of its investees requires significant judgment based on the facts and circumstances surrounding each individual investment. factors considered in these evaluations may include the type of investment, the legal structure of the investee, the terms and structure of the investment agreement, including investor voting or other rights, the terms of blackrock's advisory agreement or other agreements with the investee, any influence blackrock may have on the governing board of the investee, the legal rights of other investors in the entity pursuant to the fund's operating documents and the relationship between blackrock and other investors in the entity.
blackrock's equity method investees that are investment companies record their underlying investments at fair value. therefore, under the equity method of accounting, blackrock's share of the investee's underlying net income predominantly represents fair value adjustments in the investments held by the equity method investees. blackrock's share of the investee's underlying net income or loss is based upon the most currently available information and is recorded as nonoperating income (expense) for investments in investment companies, or as advisory and other revenue for certain corporate minority investments, which are recorded in other assets, since such investees are considered to be an extension of blackrock's core business.
at december 31, 2019, the company had $943 million and $531 million of equity method investments, included in investments and other assets, respectively, and at december 31, 2018, the company had $781 million and $459 million of equity method investments included in investments and other assets, respectively.
other nonequity method corporate minority investments.  other nonequity method corporate minority investments are recorded within other assets on the consolidated statements of financial condition. at december 31, 2019 and 2018, these investments totaled $282 million and $199 million, respectively, and included investments in equity securities, which are generally measured at fair value or under the measurement alternative to fair value for nonmarketable securities. changes in value of these securities are recorded in nonoperating income (expense) on the consolidated statements of income. see note 2, significant accounting policies, in the consolidated financial statements contained in part ii, item 8 of this filing for more information.
impairments of investments. evaluation of impairments involves significant assumptions and management judgments, which could differ from actual results, and these differences could have a material impact on the consolidated statements of income. see note 2, significant accounting policies, in the consolidated financial statements contained in part ii, item 8 of this filing for more information.
fair value measurements the company's assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement according to the fair value hierarchy (i.e., level 1, 2 and 3 inputs, as defined) in its entirety requires judgment and considers factors specific to the financial instrument. see note 2, significant accounting policies, in the consolidated financial statements contained in part ii, item 8 of this filing for more information on fair value measurements.
changes in valuation. changes in value on $5,489 million of investments will impact the company's nonoperating income (expense), $342 million are held at cost or amortized cost and the remaining $528 million relates to carried interest, which will not impact nonoperating income (expense). at december 31, 2019, changes in fair value of $3,270 million of consolidated sponsored investment products will impact blackrock's net income (loss) attributable to nci on the consolidated statements of income. blackrock's net exposure to changes in fair value of consolidated sponsored investment products was $1,776 million.
leases the company determines if a contract is a lease or contains a lease at inception. the identification of whether a contract contains a lease requires judgment, including determining whether there are identified assets in the contract that the company has control over for a specified period of time in exchange for consideration.
fixed lease payments are included in the measurement of rou assets and lease liabilities on the consolidated statement of financial condition. the company recognizes rou assets and lease liabilities based on the present value of these future lease payments over the lease term at the commencement date discounted using the company's incremental borrowing rate ("ibr"). management judgment is required in determining the company's ibr, including assessing the company's credit rating using various financial metrics, such as revenue, operating margin and revenue growth, and, as appropriate, performing market analysis of yields on publicly traded bonds (secured or unsecured) of comparable companies. see note 2, significant accounting policies, in the consolidated financial statements contained in part ii, item 8 of this filing for more information on leases.
goodwill and intangible assets the value of advisory contracts acquired in business acquisitions to manage aum in proprietary open-end investment funds as well as collective trust funds without a specified termination date are classified as indefinite-lived intangible assets. the assignment of indefinite lives to such investment fund contracts is based upon the assumption that there is no foreseeable limit on the contract period to manage these funds due to the likelihood of continued renewal at little or no cost. in addition, trade names/trademarks are considered indefinite-lived intangibles if they are expected to generate cash flows indefinitely. goodwill represents the cost of a business acquisition in excess of the fair value of the net assets acquired. indefinite-lived intangible assets and goodwill are not amortized.
finite-lived management contracts, which relate to acquired separate accounts and funds, investor/customer relationships, and technology related assets that are expected to contribute to the future cash flows of the company for a specified period of time are amortized over their remaining expected useful lives, which, at december 31, 2019 ranged from 1 to 11 years with a weighted-average remaining estimated useful life of 7.8 years.
goodwill. the company assesses its goodwill for impairment at least annually, considering such factors as the book value and the market capitalization of the company. the impairment assessment performed as of july 31, 2019 indicated no impairment charge was required. the company continues to monitor its book value per share compared with closing prices of its common stock for potential indicators of impairment. at december 31, 2019, the company's common stock closed at $502.70, which exceeded its book value of approximately $216.15 per share.
indefinite-lived and finite-lived intangibles. the company performs assessments to determine if any intangible assets are impaired and whether the indefinite-life and finite-life classifications are still appropriate.
in evaluating whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of indefinite-lived intangibles is less than carrying value, blackrock performed certain quantitative assessments and assessed various significant qualitative factors including aum, revenue basis points, projected aum growth rates, operating margins, tax rates and discount rates. in addition, the company considered other factors including: (i) macroeconomic conditions such as a deterioration in general economic conditions, limitations on accessing capital, fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, or other developments in equity and credit markets; (ii) industry and market considerations such as a deterioration in the environment in which the company operates, an increased competitive environment, a decline in market-dependent multiples or metrics, a change in the market for an entity's services, or regulatory, legal or political developments; and (iii) the company-specific events, such as a change in management or key personnel, overall financial performance and litigation that could affect significant inputs used to determine the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset. if an indefinite-lived intangible is determined to be more likely than not impaired, then the fair value of the asset is compared with its carrying value and any excess of the carrying value over the fair value would be recognized as an expense in the period in which the impairment occurs.
for finite-lived intangible assets, if potential impairment circumstances are considered to exist, the company will perform a recoverability test, using an undiscounted cash flow analysis. actual results could differ from these cash flow estimates, which could materially impact the impairment conclusion. if the carrying value of the asset is determined not to be recoverable based on the undiscounted cash flow test, the difference between the book value of the asset and its current fair value would be recognized as an expense in the period in which the impairment occurs.
in addition, management judgment is required to estimate the period over which finite-lived intangible assets will contribute to the company's cash flows and the pattern in which these assets will be consumed. a change in the remaining useful life of any of these assets, or the reclassification of an indefinite-lived intangible asset to a finite-lived intangible asset, could have a significant impact on the company's amortization expense, which was $97 million, $50 million and $89 million for 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
in 2019, 2018 and 2017, the company performed impairment tests, including evaluating various qualitative factors and performing certain quantitative assessments. the company determined that no impairment charges were required and that the classification of indefinite-lived versus finite-lived intangibles was still appropriate and no changes were required to the expected lives of the finite-lived intangibles. the company continuously monitors various factors, including aum, for potential indicators of impairment.
contingent consideration liabilities in connection with certain acquisitions, blackrock is required to make contingent payments, subject to achieving specified performance targets. the fair value of this contingent consideration is estimated at the time of acquisition closing and is included in other liabilities on the consolidated statements of financial condition. as the fair value of the expected payments amount subsequently changes, the contingent consideration liability is adjusted, resulting in contingent consideration fair value adjustments recorded within general and administration expense of the consolidated statements of income. cash payments up to the acquisition date fair value amount of the contingent consideration liability are reflected as financing activities with excess (if any) cash payments classified in operating activities. any cash payments made soon after the acquisition date will be classified in investing activities.
revenue recognition revenue is recognized upon transfer of control of promised services to customers in an amount to which the company expects to be entitled in exchange for those services. the company enters into contracts that can include multiple services, which are accounted for separately if they are determined to be distinct. management judgment is required to identify distinct services and involves assessing such factors as whether the promised services significantly modify or customize one another or are highly interdependent or interrelated. management judgment may be also required when determining the following: when variable consideration is no longer probable of significant reversal (and hence can be included in revenue); whether certain revenue should be presented gross or net of certain related costs; when a promised service transfers to the customer; and the applicable method of measuring progress for services transferred to the customer over time. many of blackrock's promised services represent a series of distinct services (e.g., investment advisory services) in which the associated variable consideration (e.g., management fees) is allocated to specific days of service as opposed to over the entire contract term.
investment advisory and administration fees are recognized as the services are performed over time because the customer is receiving and consuming the benefits as they are provided by the company. fees are primarily based on agreed-upon percentages of aum and recognized for services provided during the period, which are distinct from services provided in other periods. such fees are affected by changes in aum, including market appreciation or depreciation, foreign exchange translation and net inflows or outflows. aum represents the broad range of financial assets the company manages for clients on a discretionary basis pursuant to investment management and trust agreements that are expected to continue for at least 12 months. in general, reported aum reflects the valuation methodology that corresponds to the basis used for determining revenue (for example, net asset values).
the company earns revenue by lending securities on behalf of clients, primarily to highly rated banks and broker-dealers. the securities loaned are secured by collateral, generally ranging from 102% to 112% of the value of the loaned securities. for 2019, 2018 and 2017, securities lending revenue earned by the company totaled $617 million, $627 million and $597 million, respectively, and is recorded in investment advisory, administration and securities lending revenue on the consolidated statements of income. investment advisory, administration fees and securities lending revenue are reported together as the fees for these services often are agreed upon with clients as a bundled fee.
the company receives investment advisory performance fees, including incentive allocations (carried interest) from certain actively managed investment funds and certain separately managed accounts. these performance fees are dependent upon exceeding specified relative or absolute investment return thresholds, which may vary by product or account, and include monthly, quarterly, annual or longer measurement periods.
performance fees, including carried interest, are recognized when it is determined that they are no longer probable of significant reversal (such as upon the sale of a fund's investment or when the amount of aum becomes known as of the end of a specified measurement period). given the unique nature of each fee arrangement, contracts with customers are evaluated on an individual basis to determine the timing of revenue recognition. significant judgement is involved in making such determination. performance fees typically arise from investment management services that began in prior reporting periods. consequently, a portion of the fees the company recognizes may be partially related to the services performed in prior periods that meet the recognition criteria in the current period. at each reporting date, the company considers various factors in estimating performance fees to be recognized, including carried interest. these factors include but are not limited to whether: (1) the fees are dependent on the market and thus are highly susceptible to factors outside the company's influence; (2) the fees have a large number and a broad range of possible amounts; and (3) the funds or separately managed accounts have the ability to invest or reinvest their sales proceeds.
the company is allocated carried interest from certain alternative investment products upon exceeding performance thresholds. the company may be required to reverse/return all, or part, of such carried interest allocations/distributions depending upon future performance of these funds. carried interest subject to such clawback provisions is recorded in investments or cash and cash equivalents to the extent that it is distributed, on its consolidated statements of financial condition.
the company records a liability for deferred carried interest to the extent it receives cash or capital allocations related to carried interest prior to meeting the revenue recognition criteria. at december 31, 2019 and 2018, the company had $483 million and $293 million, respectively, of deferred carried interest recorded in other liabilities on the consolidated statements of financial condition. a portion of the deferred carried interest may also be paid to certain employees. the ultimate timing of the recognition of performance fee revenue and related compensation expense, if any, for these products is unknown. see note 17, revenue, in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for detailed changes in the deferred carried interest liability balance for 2019 and 2018.
fees earned for technology services are primarily recorded as services are performed and are generally determined using the value of positions on the aladdin platform or on a fixed-rate basis. revenue derived from the sale of software licenses is recognized upon the granting of access rights.
distribution and service fees earned for distributing investment products and providing support services to investment portfolios, are based on aum, and are recognized when the amount of fees is known.
adjustments to revenue arising from initial estimates recorded historically have been immaterial since the majority of blackrock's investment advisory and administration revenue is calculated based on aum and since the company does not record performance fee revenue until: (1) performance thresholds have been exceeded and (2) management determines the fees are no longer probable of significant reversal.
income taxes deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognized for future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases using currently enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. the effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.
significant management judgment is required in estimating the ranges of possible outcomes and determining the probability of favorable or unfavorable tax outcomes and potential interest and penalties related to such unfavorable outcomes. actual future tax consequences relating to uncertain tax positions may be materially different than the company's current estimates. at december 31, 2019, blackrock had $900 million of gross unrecognized tax benefits, of which $513 million, if recognized, would affect the effective tax rate.
management is required to estimate the timing of the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities, make assumptions about the future deductibility of deferred income tax assets and assess deferred income tax liabilities based on enacted tax rates for the appropriate tax jurisdictions to determine the amount of such deferred income tax assets and liabilities. at december 31, 2019, the company had deferred income tax assets of $175 million and deferred income tax liabilities of $3,734 million on the consolidated statement of financial condition. changes in deferred tax assets and liabilities may occur in certain circumstances, including statutory income tax rate changes, statutory tax law changes, changes in the anticipated timing of recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities or changes in the structure or tax status of the company.
the company assesses whether a valuation allowance should be established against its deferred income tax assets based on consideration of all available evidence, both positive and negative, using a more likely than not standard. the assessment considers, among other matters, the nature, frequency and severity of recent losses, forecast of future profitability, the duration of statutory carry back and carry forward periods, the company's experience with tax attributes expiring unused, and tax planning alternatives.
the company records income taxes based upon its estimated income tax liability or benefit. the company's actual tax liability or benefit may differ from the estimated income tax liability or benefit. the company had current income taxes receivables of approximately $282 million and current income taxes payables of $293 million at december 31, 2019.

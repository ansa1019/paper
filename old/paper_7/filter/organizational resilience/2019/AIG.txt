general operating and other expenses declined in 2019 compared to 2018 primarily due to lower employee related expenses and professional fee reductions pertaining to expense reduction initiatives. the declines were partially offset by an increase in expenses caused by the acquisitions of validus and glatfelter in the third and fourth quarters of 2018, respectively. general operating and other expenses increased in 2018 compared to 2017 due to the acquisition of validus, business growth and continued investments in business platforms. in keeping with our broad and ongoing efforts to transform for long-term competitiveness, general operating and other expenses for 2019, 2018 and 2017 included approximately $218 million, $395 million and $413 million, respectively, of pre-tax restructuring and other costs which were primarily comprised of employee severance charges and other exit costs related to organizational simplification, operational efficiency, and business rationalization.

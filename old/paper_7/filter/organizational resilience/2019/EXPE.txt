management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations" in part ii, item 7 of the company's annual report on form 10-k for the fiscal year ended december 31, 2018. all percentages within this section are calculated on actual, unrounded numbers.
trends the travel industry, including offline agencies, online agencies and other suppliers of travel products and services, has historically been characterized by intense competition, as well as rapid and significant change. generally, 2017 and 2018 represented years of continuing growth for the travel industry. while 2019 has seen continued growth for the industry, it has been at a slower pace than in prior years. additionally, political instability, geopolitical conflicts, acts of terrorism, significant fluctuations in currency values, sovereign debt issues, natural disasters, macroeconomic concerns and particularly the impact of the 2019 novel coronavirus outbreak are examples of events that contribute to a somewhat uncertain environment, which could have a negative impact on the travel industry in the future. with respect to the 2019 novel coronavirus outbreak specifically, we currently expect that our first quarter 2020 financial results will be negatively impacted, potentially to a material degree. in addition, as of the time of this annual report on form 10-k, we expect that the 2019 novel coronavirus will continue to negatively impact our businesses beyond the first quarter of 2020, but the extent and duration of such impacts over the longer term remain uncertain and dependent on future developments that cannot be accurately predicted at this time, such as the severity and transmission rate of the coronavirus, the extent and effectiveness of containment actions taken, including mobility restrictions, and the impact of these and other factors on travel behavior.
for additional information about our growth strategy for expedia group, see the disclosure set forth in part i, item 1, business, under the caption "growth strategy."
online travel increased usage and familiarity with the internet are driving rapid growth in online penetration of travel expenditures. according to phocuswright, an independent travel, tourism and hospitality research firm, in 2020, approximately 50% of u.s. and european leisure and unmanaged corporate travel expenditures are expected to occur online. online penetration rates in the emerging markets, such as asia pacific and latin american regions, are lagging behind that of the united states and europe. these penetration rates increased over the past few years, and are expected to continue growing, which presents an attractive growth opportunity for our business, while also attracting many competitors to online travel. this competition intensified in recent years, and the industry is expected to remain highly competitive for the foreseeable future. in addition to the growth of online travel agencies, we see increased interest in the online travel industry from search engine companies such as google, evidenced by continued product enhancements, including new trip planning features for users and the integration of its various travel products into the google travel offering, as well as further prioritizing its own products in search results. competitive entrants such as "metasearch" companies, including kayak.com (owned by booking holdings), trivago (in which expedia group owns a majority interest) as well as tripadvisor, introduced differentiated features, pricing and content compared with the legacy online travel agency companies, as well as various forms of direct or assisted booking tools. further, airlines and lodging companies are aggressively pursuing direct online distribution of their products and services. in addition, the increasing popularity of the "sharing economy," accelerated by online penetration, has had a direct impact on the travel and lodging industry. businesses such as airbnb, vrbo (previously homeaway, which expedia group acquired in december 2015) and booking.com (owned by booking holdings) have emerged as the leaders, bringing incremental alternative accommodation and vacation rental inventory to the market. many other competitors, including vacation rental metasearch players, continue to emerge in this space, which is expected to continue to grow as a percentage of the global accommodation market. finally, traditional consumer ecommerce and group buying websites expanded their local offerings into the travel market by adding hotel offers to their websites. for additional detail regarding the competitive trends and risks we face, see part i item 1 business - "competition," and part i, item 1a, risk factors - "we operate in an increasingly competitive global environment."
the online travel industry also saw the development of alternative business models and variations in the timing of payment by travelers and to suppliers, which in some cases place pressure on historical business models. in particular, the agency hotel model saw rapid adoption in europe. expedia group facilitates both merchant (expedia collect) and agency (hotel collect) hotel offerings with our hotel supply partners through both agency-only contracts as well as our hybrid etp program, which offers travelers the choice of whether to pay expedia group at the time of booking or pay the hotel at the time of stay.
intense competition also historically led to aggressive marketing efforts by the travel suppliers and intermediaries, and a meaningful unfavorable impact on our overall marketing efficiencies and operating margins. we manage our marketing spending on a brand basis, making decisions in each applicable market that we think are appropriate based on the relative growth opportunity and the expected returns and the competitive environment. in certain cases, particularly in many international markets, we are pursuing and expect to continue to pursue long-term growth opportunities for which our marketing efficiency is less favorable than that for our consolidated business, but for which we still believe the opportunity to be attractive. in addition, the crowded online travel environment is now driving certain secondary and tertiary online travel companies to establish marketing agreements with global players in order to leverage distribution and technology capabilities while focusing resources on capturing traveler mind share. for more detail, see part i, item 1a, risk factors - "we rely on the value of our brands, and the cost of maintaining and enhancing our brand awareness are increasing" and "our international operations involve additional risks and our exposure to these risks will increase as our business expands globally."
lodging lodging includes hotel accommodations and alternative accommodations. as a percentage of our total worldwide revenue in 2019, lodging accounted for 70%. our room night growth has been healthy, with room nights growing 16% in 2017, 13% in 2018, and 11% in 2019. adrs for rooms booked on expedia group websites increased 3% in 2017, 5% in 2018, and decreased 1% in 2019. the decrease in 2019 was primarily due to the negative impact of foreign exchange. more recently, we have seen pressure on a local currency basis on adrs, similar to the recent trends for hotel companies.
hotel. we generate the majority of our revenue through the facilitation of hotel reservations (stand-alone and package bookings). although our relationships with our hotel supply partners remained broadly stable in the past few years, as part of the global rollout of etp, we reduced negotiated economics in certain instances to compensate for hotel supply partners absorbing expenses such as credit card fees and customer service costs, which has negatively impacted the margin of revenue we earn per booking. in addition, as we continue to expand the breadth and depth of our global hotel offering, in some cases we have reduced our economics in various geographies based on local market conditions. these impacts are due to specific initiatives intended to drive greater global size and scale through faster overall room night growth. additionally, increased promotional activities such as growing loyalty programs contribute to declines in revenue per room night and profitability.
since our hotel supplier agreements are generally negotiated on a percentage basis, any increase or decrease in adrs has an impact on the revenue we earn per room night. over the course of the last several years, occupancies and adrs in the lodging industry generally increased on a currency-neutral basis in a gradually improving overall travel environment. current occupancy rates for hotels in the united states remain high compared to historical levels; however, u.s. hotel supply has continued to grow, which may put additional pressure on adrs. in addition, macroeconomic factors could also influence adr trends. in some international markets, hotel supply is being added at a faster rate as hotel owners and operators try to take advantage of opportunities in faster growing regions. in addition, the increase in alternative accommodations space could pressure hotel adrs. further, while the global lodging industry remains very fragmented, there has been consolidation in the hotel space among chains as well as ownership groups. in the meantime, certain hotel chains have been focusing on driving direct bookings on their own websites and mobile applications by advertising lower rates than those available on third-party websites as well as incentives such as loyalty points, increased or exclusive product availability and complimentary wi-fi.
we have continued to add supply to our global lodging marketplace with nearly 1.6 million properties on our global websites as of december 31, 2019, including over 765,000 integrated vrbo alternative accommodations listings.
alternative accommodations. with our acquisition of vrbo (previously homeaway) and all of its brands in december 2015, we expanded into the fast growing alternative accommodations market. vrbo is a leader in this market and represents an attractive growth opportunity for expedia group. vrbo has been undergoing a transition from a listings-based classified advertising model to an online transactional model that optimizes for both travelers and homeowner and property manager partners, with a goal of increasing monetization and driving growth through investments in marketing as well as in product and technology. vrbo offers hosts subscription-based listing or pay-per-booking service models. it also generates revenue from a traveler service fee for bookings. as of december 31, 2019, there are over 2.1 million online bookable listings available on vrbo. in addition, we have actively moved to integrate vrbo listings into our global ota services, as well as directly add alternative accommodation listings to our offerings, to position our key global brands to offer a full range of lodging options for consumers.
air significant airline sector consolidation in the united states in recent years generally resulted in lower overall capacity and higher fares, which combined with the significant declines in fuel prices led to record levels of profitability for the u.s. air carriers, further strengthening their position. however, in 2017 and into 2018, there was evidence of discounting by the u.s. carriers while currency headwinds and weaker macroeconomic trends put pressure on international results. starting in the second half of 2018, there has been evidence of modest fare increases. the airline industry experienced more constrained supply, particularly in the second half of 2019, which was also a factor. it remains unclear if this trend will continue. ticket prices on expedia group websites declined 1% in 2017, increased 2% in 2018, and were flat in 2019. based on airline reports, demand for airline tickets seems to be strong, helping increase air revenue globally. there is significant correlation between airline revenue and fuel prices, and fluctuations in fuel prices generally take time to be reflected in air revenue. given current volatility, it is uncertain how fuel prices could impact airfares. we could encounter pressure on air remuneration as air carriers combine, certain supply agreements renew, and as we continue to add airlines to ensure local coverage in new markets.
air ticket volumes increased 4% in 2017, 5% in 2018, and 7% in 2019. as a percentage of our total worldwide revenue in 2019, air accounted for 7%.
advertising & media our advertising and media business is principally driven by revenue generated by trivago, a leading hotel metasearch website, in addition to expedia group media solutions, which is responsible for generating advertising revenue on our global online travel brands. in 2019, we generated a total of $1.1 billion of advertising and media revenue, a slight increase from 2018, representing 9% of our total worldwide revenue. in 2018, trivago shifted its operational focus, reducing marketing spend to better balance revenue and profit growth. the lower marketing spend negatively impacted revenue growth, while benefiting profitability. this trend continued in 2019.
seasonality we generally experience seasonal fluctuations in the demand for our travel services. for example, traditional leisure travel bookings are generally the highest in the first three quarters as travelers plan and book their spring, summer and winter holiday travel. the number of bookings typically decreases in the fourth quarter. because revenue for most of our travel services, including merchant and agency hotel, is recognized as the travel takes place rather than when it is booked, revenue typically lags bookings by several weeks for our hotel business and can be several months or more for our alternative accommodations business. historically, vrbo has seen seasonally stronger bookings in the first quarter of the year, with the relevant stays occurring during the peak summer travel months. the seasonal revenue impact is exacerbated with respect to income by the nature of our variable cost of revenue and direct sales and marketing costs, which we typically realize in closer alignment to booking volumes, and the more stable nature of our fixed costs. furthermore, operating profits for our primary advertising business, trivago, have typically been experienced in the second half of the year, particularly the fourth quarter, as selling and marketing costs offset revenue in the first half of the year as we typically increase marketing during the busy booking period for spring, summer and winter holiday travel. as a result on a consolidated basis, revenue and income are typically the lowest in the first quarter and highest in the third quarter. the continued growth of our international operations, advertising business or a change in our product mix, including the growth of vrbo, may influence the typical trend of the seasonality in the future, and there may also be business or market driven dynamics that result in short-term impacts to revenue or profitability that differ from the typical seasonal trends. as vrbo has further shifted to a predominately transaction-based business model for alternative accommodations listings and due to its elongated booking window, its seasonal trends are more pronounced than our other traditional leisure businesses.
critical accounting policies and estimates critical accounting policies and estimates are those that we believe are important in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements because they require that we use judgment and estimates in applying those policies. we prepare our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states ("gaap"). preparation of the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes requires that we make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the consolidated financial statements as well as revenue and expenses during the periods reported. we base our estimates on historical experience, where applicable, and other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. actual results may differ from our estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
there are certain critical estimates that we believe require significant judgment in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. we consider an accounting estimate to be critical if:
•   it requires us to make an assumption because information was not available at the time or it included matters that were highly uncertain at the time we were making the estimate; and
•   changes in the estimate or different estimates that we could have selected may have had a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations.
for more information on each of these policies, see note 2 - significant accounting policies, in the notes to consolidated financial statements. we discuss information about the nature and rationale for our critical accounting estimates below.
accounting for certain merchant revenue we accrue the cost of certain merchant revenue based on the amount we expect to be billed by suppliers. in certain instances when a supplier invoices us for less than the cost we accrued, we generally reduce our merchant accounts payable and the supplier costs within net revenue six months in arrears, net of an allowance, when we determine it is not probable that we will be required to pay the supplier, based on historical experience. actual revenue could be greater or less than the amounts estimated due to changes in hotel billing practices or changes in traveler behavior.
deferred loyalty rewards we offer certain internally administered traveler loyalty programs to our customers, such as our hotels.com rewards program, our expedia rewards program and our orbitz rewards program. hotels.com rewards offers travelers one free night at any hotels.com partner property after that traveler stays 10 nights, subject to certain restrictions. expedia rewards enables participating travelers to earn points on all hotel, flight, package and activities made on over 40 brand expedia websites. orbitz rewards allows travelers to earn orbucks, the currency of orbitz rewards, on flights, hotels and vacation packages and instantly redeem those orbucks on future bookings at various hotels worldwide. as travelers accumulate points towards free travel products, we defer the relative standalone selling price of earned points, net of expected breakage, as deferred loyalty rewards within deferred merchant bookings on the consolidated balance sheet. in order to estimate the standalone selling price of the underlying services on which points can be redeemed for all loyalty programs, we use an adjusted market assessment approach and consider the redemption values expected from the traveler. we then estimate the number of rewards that will not be redeemed based on historical activity in our members' accounts as well as statistical modeling techniques. revenue is recognized when we have satisfied our performance obligation relating to the points, that is when the travel service purchased with the loyalty award is satisfied. both the actual standalone selling price of the underlying services and ultimate redemption rates could differ materially from our estimates due to a number of factors, including fluctuations in reward value, product utilization and divergence from historical member behavior.
business combinations we assign the value of the consideration transferred to acquire a business to the tangible assets and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed on the basis of their fair values at the date of acquisition. any excess purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired is allocated to goodwill. when determining the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, management makes significant estimates and assumptions, especially with respect to intangible assets. critical estimates in valuing certain intangible assets include but are not limited to future expected cash flows from customer relationships and trade names, and discount rates. management's estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable, but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and, as a result, actual results may differ from estimates.
recoverability of goodwill and indefinite and definite-lived intangible assets goodwill. we assess goodwill for impairment annually as of october 1, or more frequently, if events and circumstances indicate impairment may have occurred. in the evaluation of goodwill for impairment, we typically perform a quantitative assessment and compare the fair value of the reporting unit to the carrying value and, if applicable, record an impairment charge based on the excess of the reporting unit's carrying amount over its fair value. periodically, we may choose to perform a qualitative assessment, prior to performing the quantitative analysis, to determine whether the fair value of the goodwill is more likely than not impaired.
we generally base our measurement of fair value of reporting units on a blended analysis of the present value of future discounted cash flows and market valuation approach with the exception of our standalone publicly traded subsidiary, which is based on market valuation. the discounted cash flows model indicates the fair value of the reporting units based on the present value of the cash flows that we expect the reporting units to generate in the future. our significant estimates in the discounted cash flows model include: our weighted average cost of capital; long-term rate of growth and profitability of our business; and working capital effects. the market valuation approach indicates the fair value of the business based on a comparison of the company to comparable publicly traded firms in similar lines of business. our significant estimates in the market approach model include identifying similar companies with comparable business factors such as size, growth, profitability, risk and return on investment and assessing comparable revenue and operating income multiples in estimating the fair value of the reporting units.
we believe the weighted use of discounted cash flows and market approach is the best method for determining the fair value of our reporting units because these are the most common valuation methodologies used within the travel and internet industries; and the blended use of both models compensates for the inherent risks associated with either model if used on a stand-alone basis.
in addition to measuring the fair value of our reporting units as described above, we consider the combined carrying and fair values of our reporting units in relation to the company's total fair value of equity plus debt as of the assessment date. our equity value assumes our fully diluted market capitalization, using either the stock price on the valuation date or the average stock price over a range of dates around the valuation date, plus an estimated acquisition premium which is based on observable transactions of comparable companies. the debt value is based on the highest value expected to be paid to repurchase the debt, which can be fair value, principal or principal plus a premium depending on the terms of each debt instrument.
indefinite-lived intangible assets. we base our measurement of fair value of indefinite-lived intangible assets, which primarily consist of trade name and trademarks, using the relief-from-royalty method. this method assumes that the trade name and trademarks have value to the extent that their owner is relieved of the obligation to pay royalties for the benefits received from them. this method requires us to estimate the future revenue for the related brands, the appropriate royalty rate and the weighted average cost of capital.
definite-lived intangible assets. we review the carrying value of long-lived assets or asset groups to be used in operations whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets might not be recoverable. factors that would necessitate an impairment assessment include a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which an asset is used, a significant adverse change in legal factors or the business climate that could affect the value of the asset, or a significant decline in the observable market value of an asset, among others. if such facts indicate a potential impairment, we would assess the recoverability of an asset group by determining if the carrying value of the asset group exceeds the sum of the projected undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the assets over the remaining economic life of the primary asset in the asset group. if the recoverability test indicates that the carrying value of the asset group is not recoverable, we will estimate the fair value of the asset group using appropriate valuation methodologies, which would typically include an estimate of discounted cash flows. any impairment would be measured as the difference between the asset groups carrying amount and its estimated fair value.
the use of different estimates or assumptions in determining the fair value of our goodwill, indefinite-lived and definite-lived intangible assets may result in different values for these assets, which could result in an impairment or, in the period in which an impairment is recognized, could result in a materially different impairment charge.
income taxes we record income taxes under the liability method. deferred tax assets and liabilities reflect our estimation of the future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for book and tax purposes. we determine deferred income taxes based on the differences in accounting methods and timing between financial statement and income tax reporting. accordingly, we determine the deferred tax asset or liability for each temporary difference based on the enacted tax rates expected to be in effect when we realize the underlying items of income and expense. we consider many factors when assessing the likelihood of future realization of our deferred tax assets, including our recent earnings experience by jurisdiction, expectations of future taxable income, and the carryforward periods available to us for tax reporting purposes, as well as other relevant factors. we may establish a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount we believe is more likely than not to be realized. due to inherent complexities arising from the nature of our businesses, future changes in income tax law, tax sharing agreements or variances between our actual and anticipated operating results, we make certain judgments and estimates. therefore, actual income taxes could materially vary from these estimates.
we record liabilities to address uncertain tax positions we have taken in previously filed tax returns or that we expect to take in a future tax return. the determination for required liabilities is based upon an analysis of each individual tax position, taking into consideration whether it is more likely than not that our tax position, based on technical merits, will be sustained upon examination. for those positions for which we conclude it is more likely than not it will be sustained, we recognize the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement with the taxing authority. the difference between the amount recognized and the total tax position is recorded as a liability. the ultimate resolution of these tax positions may be greater or less than the liabilities recorded.
other long-term liabilities various legal and tax contingencies. we record liabilities to address potential exposures related to business and tax positions we have taken that have been or could be challenged by taxing authorities. in addition, we record liabilities associated with legal proceedings and lawsuits. these liabilities are recorded when the likelihood of payment is probable and the amounts can be reasonably estimated. the determination for required liabilities is based upon analysis of each individual tax issue, or legal proceeding, taking into consideration the likelihood of adverse judgments and the range of possible loss. in addition, our analysis may be based on discussions with outside legal counsel. the ultimate resolution of these potential tax exposures and legal proceedings may be greater or less than the liabilities recorded.
occupancy and other taxes. some states and localities impose taxes (e.g. transient occupancy, accommodation tax, sales tax and/or business privilege tax) on the use or occupancy of hotel accommodations or other traveler services. generally, hotels collect taxes based on the rate paid to the hotel and remit these taxes to the various tax authorities. when a customer books a room through one of our travel services, we collect a tax recovery charge from the customer which we pay to the hotel. we calculate the tax recovery charge by applying the applicable tax rate supplied to us by the hotels to the amount that the hotel has agreed to receive for the rental of the room by the consumer. in most jurisdictions, we do not collect or remit taxes, nor do we pay taxes to the hotel operator, on the portion of the customer payment we retain. some jurisdictions have questioned our practice in this regard. while the applicable tax provisions vary among the jurisdictions, we generally believe that we are not required to pay such taxes. more recently, a limited number of taxing jurisdictions have made similar claims against vrbo for tax amounts due on the rental amounts charged by owners of alternative accommodations properties or for taxes on vrbo's services. vrbo is an intermediary between a traveler and a party renting an alternative accommodations property and we believe is similarly not liable for such taxes. we are engaged in discussions with tax authorities in various jurisdictions to resolve these issues. some tax authorities have brought lawsuits or have levied assessments asserting that we are required to collect and remit tax. the ultimate resolution in all jurisdictions cannot be determined at this time. certain jurisdictions may require us to pay tax assessments, including occupancy and other transactional tax assessments, prior to contesting any such assessments.
we have established a reserve for the potential settlement of issues related to hotel occupancy and other tax litigation for prior and current periods, consistent with applicable accounting principles and in light of all current facts and circumstances. a variety of factors could affect the amount of the liability (both past and future), which factors include, but are not limited to, the number of, and amount of revenue represented by, jurisdictions that ultimately assert a claim and prevail in assessing such additional tax or negotiate a settlement and changes in relevant statutes.
we note that there are more than 10,000 taxing jurisdictions in the united states, and it is not feasible to analyze the statutes, regulations and judicial and administrative rulings in every jurisdiction. rather, we have obtained the advice of state and local tax experts with respect to tax laws of certain states and local jurisdictions that represent a large portion of our hotel revenue. many of the statutes and regulations that impose these taxes were established before the emergence of the internet and ecommerce. certain jurisdictions have enacted, and others may enact, legislation regarding the imposition of taxes on businesses that arrange the booking of hotel or alternative accommodations. we continue to work with the relevant tax authorities and legislators to clarify our obligations under new and emerging laws and regulations. we will continue to monitor the issue closely and provide additional disclosure, as well as adjust the level of reserves, as developments warrant. additionally, certain of our businesses are involved in tax related litigation, which is discussed in part i, item 3, legal proceedings. recent occupancy tax developments are also discussed below under the caption "occupancy and other taxes."
stock-based compensation historically, our primary form of employee stock-based compensation was stock option awards. our employee stock options consist of service based awards, some of which also have market-based vesting conditions. we measure the value of stock option awards on the date of grant at fair value using the appropriate valuation techniques, including the black-scholes and monte carlo option-pricing models, for awards that contain market-based vesting conditions. we amortize the fair value over the remaining explicit vesting term in the case of service-based awards and the longer of the derived service period or the explicit service period for awards with market conditions, on a straight-line basis. we account for forfeitures as they occur. the pricing models require various highly judgmental assumptions including volatility and expected option term. if any of the assumptions used in the models change significantly, stock-based compensation expense may differ materially in the future from that recorded in the current period.
new accounting pronouncements for a discussion of new accounting pronouncements, see note 2 - significant accounting policies in the notes to consolidated financial statements.
occupancy and other taxes we are currently involved in ten lawsuits brought by or against states, cities and counties over issues involving the payment of hotel occupancy and other taxes. we continue to defend these lawsuits vigorously. with respect to the principal claims in these matters, we believe that the statutes and/or ordinances at issue do not apply to us or the services we provide and, therefore, that we do not owe the taxes that are claimed to be owed. we believe that the statutes and ordinances at issue generally impose occupancy and other taxes on entities that own, operate or control hotels (or similar businesses) or furnish or provide hotel rooms or other accommodations.
recent developments include:
•   pine bluff, arkansas litigation. on december 12, 2019, the arkansas supreme court dismissed the defendant online travel companies' appeal from the trial court's summary judgment decision as premature and remanded for further proceedings in the trial court.
•   state of mississippi litigation. on december 12, 2019, the mississippi supreme court denied the defendant online travel companies' petition for interlocutory review. a trial on damages issues is currently scheduled for june 2020.
•   colorado department of revenue tax litigation. the parties reached a settlement and the case was dismissed by the court on december 12, 2019, thereby ending the matter.
for additional information on these and other legal proceedings, see part i, item 3, legal proceedings.
we have established a reserve for the potential settlement of issues related to hotel occupancy and other tax litigation, consistent with applicable accounting principles and in light of all current facts and circumstances, in the amount of $48 million as of december 31, 2019 and $46 million as of december 31, 2018.
certain jurisdictions, including without limitation the states of new york, new jersey, north carolina, minnesota, oregon, rhode island, maryland, pennsylvania, hawaii, iowa, massachusetts, arizona, wisconsin, idaho, the city of new york, and the district of columbia, have enacted legislation seeking to tax online travel company services as part of sales or other taxes for hotel and/or other accommodations and/or car rental. in addition, in certain jurisdictions, we have entered into voluntary collection agreements pursuant to which we have agreed to voluntarily collect and remit taxes to state and/or local taxing jurisdictions. we are currently remitting taxes to a number of jurisdictions, including without limitation the states of new york, new jersey, south carolina, north carolina, minnesota, georgia, wyoming, west virginia, oregon, rhode island, montana, maryland, kentucky, maine, new jersey, pennsylvania, hawaii, iowa, massachusetts, arizona, wisconsin, idaho, colorado, the city of new york and the district of columbia, as well as certain other jurisdictions.
pay-to-play certain jurisdictions may assert that we are required to pay any assessed taxes prior to being allowed to contest or litigate the applicability of the ordinances. this prepayment of contested taxes is referred to as "pay-to-play." payment of these amounts is not an admission that we believe we are subject to such taxes and, even when such payments are made, we continue to defend our position vigorously. if we prevail in the litigation, for which a pay-to-play payment was made, the jurisdiction collecting the payment will be required to repay such amounts and also may be required to pay interest. however, any significant pay-to-play payment or litigation loss could negatively impact our liquidity. for additional information, see note 17 - commitments and contingencies - legal proceedings - pay-to-play in the notes to the consolidated financial statements.
other jurisdictions. we are also in various stages of inquiry or audit with domestic and foreign tax authorities, some of which, including the city of los angeles regarding hotel occupancy taxes and the united kingdom regarding the application of value added tax ("vat") to our european union related transactions, may impose a pay-to-play requirement to challenge an adverse inquiry or audit result in court.
segments we have four reportable segments: core online travel agencies ("core ota"), trivago, vrbo and egencia. our core ota segment provides a full range of travel and advertising services to our worldwide customers through a variety of brands including: expedia.com and hotels.com in the united states and localized expedia and hotels.com websites throughout the world, expedia partner solutions, orbitz, travelocity, wotif group, ebookers, cheaptickets, hotwire.com, carrentals.com, classic vacations and silverrail. our trivago segment generates advertising revenue primarily from sending referrals to online travel companies and travel service providers from its hotel metasearch websites. our vrbo segment operates an online marketplace for the alternative accommodations industry. our egencia segment provides managed travel services to corporate customers worldwide.
operating metrics our operating results are affected by certain metrics, such as gross bookings and revenue margin, which we believe are necessary for understanding and evaluating us. gross bookings generally represent the total retail value of transactions booked for agency, merchant and vrbo transactions, recorded at the time of booking reflecting the total price due for travel by travelers, including taxes, fees and other charges, and are reduced for cancellations and refunds. as travelers have increased their use of the internet to book travel arrangements, we have generally seen our gross bookings increase, reflecting the growth in the online travel industry, our organic market share gains and our business acquisitions. revenue margin is defined as revenue as a percentage of gross bookings.
when vrbo properties are booked through our core ota websites and vice versa, the segments split the third-party revenue for management and segment reporting purposes with the majority of the third-party revenue residing with the website marketing the property or room. the operating metrics, including gross bookings and room nights, are not split but instead generally reside entirely with the website marketing the property or room.
gross bookings and revenue margin year ended december 31,                                   % change
(1)   trivago, which is comprised of a hotel metasearch business that differs from our transaction-based websites, does not have associated gross bookings or revenue margin. however, third-party revenue from trivago is included in revenue used to calculate total revenue margin.
the increase in worldwide gross bookings in 2019 compared to 2018 was primarily due to growth in the core ota segment, including growth at expedia partner solutions, which includes the benefit from enterprise deals launched in late 2018, and hotels.com.
results of operations revenue year ended december 31,                                    % change
in 2019, revenue increased primarily driven by growth in the core ota segment, including growth at expedia partner solutions, hotels.com and brand expedia, as well as growth at vrbo.
year ended december 31,                                    % change
revenue by service type lodging                       $8,472                $7,712                $6,851                10        %           13        %
lodging revenue increased 10% in 2019 on an 11% increase in room nights stayed driven by growth in hotels.com, expedia partner solutions and brand expedia, partially offset by a 1% decrease in revenue per room night.
air revenue decreased 1% in 2019 on an 8% decrease in revenue per ticket, mostly offset by a 7% increase in air tickets sold. the decrease in revenue per ticket was primarily related to changes in classification of certain fees, a shift in product mix and a negative impact from foreign exchange. the increase in air tickets sold was driven by growth at expedia partner solutions, largely related to enterprise deals launched in late 2018.
advertising and media revenue increased 1% in 2019 due to growth at expedia group media solutions, largely offset by declines in local currency revenue at trivago as well as negative impacts from foreign exchange.
all other revenue, which includes car rental, insurance, destination services, fees related to our corporate travel business and revenue related to bodybuilding.com, increased by 6% in 2019 benefiting from the inorganic impact related to the acquisition of bodybuilding.com and the reclassification of certain partner fees from air revenue.
in addition to the above segment and product revenue discussion, our revenue by business model is as follows:

the increase in agency revenue in 2019 was primarily due to the growth in agency hotel.
vrbo revenue increased 14% in 2019 compared to 2018 due to growth in transactional revenue of approximately 20% primarily driven by a benefit from the traveler service fee, partially offset by subscription revenue decreasing approximately 10%.

cost of revenue primarily consists of (1) customer operations, including our customer support and telesales as well as fees to air ticket fulfillment vendors, (2) credit card processing, including merchant fees, fraud and chargebacks, and (3) other costs, primarily including data center and cloud costs to support our websites, supplier operations, destination supply, certain transactional level taxes, costs related to bodybuilding.com and stock-based compensation.
in 2019, the increase in cost of revenue expense was driven by $126 million of higher data center, cloud and other costs primarily due to higher cloud expense and an inorganic impact related to the bodybuilding.com acquisition. in addition, customer operations expenses increased $58 million.

selling and marketing expense primarily relates to direct costs, including traffic generation costs from search engines and internet portals, television, radio and print spending, private label and affiliate program commissions, public relations and other costs. the remainder of the expense relates to indirect costs, including personnel and related overhead in our various brands and global supply organization as well as stock-based compensation costs.
selling and marketing expenses increased $368 million during 2019 compared to 2018 driven by an increase of $373 million of direct costs as a result of increases at expedia partner solutions as well as at vrbo and hotels.com, partially offset by a decrease at trivago.

technology and content expense includes product development and content expense, as well as information technology costs to support our infrastructure, back-office applications and overall monitoring and security of our networks, and is principally comprised of personnel and overhead, depreciation and amortization of technology assets including hardware, and purchased and internally developed software, and other costs including cloud expense, licensing and maintenance expense and stock-based compensation.
technology and content expense increased $146 million for 2019 compared to 2018 primarily due to higher personnel and overhead costs of $45 million to support our investments in product and technology initiatives. depreciation and amortization of technology assets also increased by $42 million. other costs increased $59 million year-over-year primarily due to higher licensing and maintenance costs to support the growth of our technology platforms as well as higher cloud expenses.

general and administrative expense consists primarily of personnel-related costs, including our executive leadership, finance, legal and human resource functions as well as fees for external professional services including legal, tax and accounting, and other costs including stock-based compensation.
general and administrative expense increased $39 million in 2019 compared to 2018 primarily driven by higher stock-based compensation of $23 million, which includes acceleration of expense related to the departure of our former ceo in the fourth quarter of 2019, as well as higher professional fees and an inorganic impact related to bodybuilding.com.
amortization and impairment of intangible assets year ended december 31,                                % change
amortization of intangible assets   $198                   $283             $275           (30      )%       3            %

in 2018, we recorded an impairment loss of $42 million and related to indefinite-lived trade names within our core ota segment due to changes in estimated future revenue of the related brands.
impairment of goodwill during 2018, we recognized a goodwill impairment charge of $86 million related to a reporting unit within our core ota segment. see note 4 - fair value measurements in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further information.
legal reserves, occupancy tax and other year ended december 31,                                % change
legal reserves, occupancy tax and other   $34                 $(59      )         $25            n/a                 n/a legal reserves, occupancy tax and other primarily consists of increases in our reserves for court decisions and the potential and final settlement of issues related to hotel occupancy and other taxes, expenses recognized related to monies paid in advance of occupancy and other tax proceedings ("pay-to-play") as well as certain other legal reserves.
during 2019, we received a $10 million refund of prepaid pay-to-play amounts from the state of hawaii in connection with the general excise tax litigation resulting in a corresponding benefit during the period, which nets down increases in reserves for occupancy tax and other matters.
during 2018, we received a refund of prepaid pay-to-play payments of $78 million from the city of san francisco and recorded a related gain in legal reserves, occupancy tax and other, which was partially offset by expense related to changes in our reserve related to hotel occupancy and other taxes for other jurisdictions.
for additional information, see note 17 - commitments and contingencies in the notes to the consolidated financial statements.
restructuring and related reorganization charges in connection with the centralization and migration of certain operational functions and systems as well as certain organizational alignment activities, we recognized $24 million in restructuring and related reorganization charges during 2019. these charges were primarily related to severance, benefits and professional fees. during 2018, we did not recognize any restructuring and related reorganization charges.
operating income year ended december 31,                                    % change
operating income      $903                $714                $625                26        %   14                %
% of revenue           7.5    %   6.4             %            6.2    %
in 2019, operating income increased primarily due to growth in revenue in excess of operating costs, including lower intangible amortization and the absence of impairment charges in 2019, partially offset by the $78 million gain recognized related to the san francisco pay-to-play refund during 2018.
in 2020, we plan to pursue operating cost savings by simplifying our organization, streamlining priorities and operating more efficiently. we do not currently have an estimate of the savings we may realize during 2020, but expect to reach nearly the full run-rate annualized savings opportunity by the end of 2020.
adjusted ebitda by segment year ended december 31,                                    % change
(1) includes immaterial operating results of bodybuilding.com subsequent to our acquisition on july 26, 2019.
(2) adjusted ebitda is a non-gaap measure. see "definition and reconciliation of adjusted ebitda" below for more information.
adjusted ebitda is our primary segment operating metric. see note 20 - segment information in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on intersegment transactions, unallocated overhead costs and for a reconciliation of adjusted ebitda by segment to net income (loss) attributable to expedia group, inc. for the periods presented above.
core ota adjusted ebitda increased $142 million during 2019, primarily due to an increase in revenue, partially offset by higher operating expenses, including an increase in direct sales and marketing expense.
trivago adjusted ebitda increased $69 million during 2019. beginning late in the second quarter of 2018, trivago started focusing on improved profitability and made significant reductions in its advertising spend as a result of this increased focus on reducing operating expenditures. the negative marketing spend negatively impacted revenue growth, while benefiting profitability. this trend continued in 2019.
vrbo adjusted ebitda decreased $7 million during 2019 as higher operating expenses mainly related to investments in direct marketing costs were partially offset by the increase in revenue.
egencia adjusted ebitda increased $9 million during 2019 as a result of growth in revenue as well as leverage on operating expenses.
interest income and expense year ended december 31,                                % change
interest income decreased in 2019 compared to 2018 as a result of $19 million in interest income recognized in 2018 on the san francisco pay-to-play refund mentioned above, partially offset by higher invested balances and to a lesser extent higher rates of return.
interest expense decreased in 2019 compared to 2018 as a result of the august 2018 maturity of our $500 million senior unsecured notes, partially offset by additional interest on the $1.25 billion senior unsecured notes issued in september 2019. as of december 31, 2019 and 2018, our senior unsecured notes indebtedness totaled $4.9 billion and $3.7 billion, respectively.

foreign exchange rate gains (losses), net            $(34      )              $3             $(46      )
provision for income taxes year ended december 31,                                    % change
our effective tax rate for 2019 was higher than the 21% federal statutory income tax rate due to state income taxes, foreign income taxed at higher than the federal statutory tax rate, as well as losses in foreign jurisdictions for which we do not record a tax benefit. our effective tax rate for 2018 was lower than the 21% federal statutory rate primarily due to earnings in foreign jurisdictions outside of the united states, predominately switzerland, where our statutory income tax rate is lower, as well as excess tax benefits related to stock-based payments and foreign-derived intangible income ("fdii"). the increase in our effective tax rate for 2019 compared to 2018 was due to an increase in u.s. federal and state taxable income as a result of an internal reorganization.
we are subject to taxation in the united states and various other state and foreign jurisdictions. during 2017, the internal revenue service ("irs") issued proposed adjustments related to transfer pricing with our foreign subsidiaries for our 2009 to
2010 audit cycle. on july 12, 2019, we settled the audit for an immaterial impact to the consolidated financial statements. in addition, we are under examination by the irs for our 2011 through 2013 tax years. during the fourth quarter of 2019, the irs issued final adjustments related to transfer pricing with our foreign subsidiaries for our 2011 to 2013 audit cycle. the proposed adjustments would increase our u.s. taxable income by $696 million, which would result in federal tax of approximately $244 million subject to interest. we do not agree with the position of the irs and are formally protesting the irs position. subsequent years remain open to examination by the irs. we do not anticipate a significant impact to our gross unrecognized tax benefits within the next 12 months related to these years.
for additional information including additional information on the impacts of the tax act, see note 11 - income taxes in the notes to the consolidated financial statements.
definition and reconciliation of adjusted ebitda we report adjusted ebitda as a supplemental measure to u.s. generally accepted accounting principles ("gaap"). adjusted ebitda is among the primary metrics by which management evaluates the performance of the business and on which internal budgets are based. management believes that investors should have access to the same set of tools that management uses to analyze our results. this non-gaap measure should be considered in addition to results prepared in accordance with gaap, but should not be considered a substitute for or superior to gaap. adjusted ebitda has certain limitations in that it does not take into account the impact of certain expenses to our consolidated statements of operations. we endeavor to compensate for the limitation of the non-gaap measure presented by also providing the most directly comparable gaap measure and a description of the reconciling items and adjustments to derive the non-gaap measure. adjusted ebitda also excludes certain items related to transactional tax matters, which may ultimately be settled in cash, and we urge investors to review the detailed disclosure regarding these matters included above, in the legal proceedings section, as well as the notes to the financial statements. the non-gaap financial measure used by the company may be calculated differently from, and therefore may not be comparable to, similarly titled measures used by other companies.
adjusted ebitda is defined as net income (loss) attributable to expedia group, inc. adjusted for (1) net income (loss) attributable to non-controlling interests; (2) provision for income taxes; (3) total other expenses, net; (4) stock-based compensation expense, including compensation expense related to certain subsidiary equity plans; (5) acquisition-related impacts, including (i) amortization of intangible assets and goodwill and intangible asset impairment, (ii) gains (losses) recognized on changes in the value of contingent consideration arrangements, if any, and (iii) upfront consideration paid to settle employee compensation plans of the acquiree, if any; (6) certain other items, including restructuring; (7) items included in legal reserves, occupancy tax and other; (8) that portion of gains (losses) on revenue hedging activities that are included in other, net that relate to revenue recognized in the period; and (9) depreciation.
the above items are excluded from our adjusted ebitda measure because these items are noncash in nature, or because the amount and timing of these items is unpredictable, not driven by core operating results and renders comparisons with prior periods and competitors less meaningful. we believe adjusted ebitda is a useful measure for analysts and investors to evaluate our future on-going performance as this measure allows a more meaningful comparison of our performance and projected cash earnings with our historical results from prior periods and to the results of our competitors. moreover, our management uses this measure internally to evaluate the performance of our business as a whole and our individual business segments. in addition, we believe that by excluding certain items, such as stock-based compensation and acquisition-related impacts, adjusted ebitda corresponds more closely to the cash operating income generated from our business and allows investors to gain an understanding of the factors and trends affecting the ongoing cash earnings capabilities of our business, from which capital investments are made and debt is serviced.
the reconciliation of net income attributable to expedia group, inc. to adjusted ebitda is as follows:
operating income                                                    903                   714                   625

financial position, liquidity and capital resources our principal sources of liquidity are cash flows generated from operations; our cash and cash equivalents and short-term investment balances, which were $3.8 billion and $2.5 billion at december 31, 2019 and 2018, and our $2 billion revolving credit facility, which is essentially untapped and expires in may 2023.
as of december 31, 2019, the total cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments held outside the united states was $1.0 billion ($747 million in wholly-owned foreign subsidiaries and $265 million in majority-owned subsidiaries). the amount of undistributed earnings in foreign subsidiaries where the foreign subsidiary has or will invest undistributed earnings indefinitely outside of the united states, and for which future distributions could be taxable, was $85 million as of december 31, 2019. the unrecognized deferred tax liability related to the u.s. federal income tax consequences of these earnings was $18 million as of december 31, 2019.
in september 2019, we privately placed $1.25 billion of senior unsecured notes that are due in february 2030 and bear interest at 3.25% (the "3.25% notes"). the 3.25% notes were issued at 99.225% of par resulting in a discount, which is being amortized over their life. interest is payable semi-annually in arrears in february and august of each year, beginning february 15, 2020. we used or expect to use the net proceeds of this offering for general corporate purposes, which may include, but are not limited to, the repayment, prepayment, redemption or repurchase of our indebtedness (including, but not limited to, our 5.95% senior notes due 2020) as well as working capital, capital expenditures and acquisitions.
as of december 31, 2019, we maintained a $2 billion revolving credit facility with a may 2023 maturity date. interest is payable under the facility based on the company's credit ratings with the applicable interest rate on drawn amounts at libor plus 112.5 basis points and the commitment fee on undrawn amounts at 15 basis points as of december 31, 2019. the facility contains various restrictive covenants, including a maximum permissible leverage ratio and a minimum permissible interest coverage ratio. as of december 31, 2019, the maximum permissible leverage ratio and the minimum interest coverage were 4.00 to 1.00 and 2.75 to 1.00, respectively.
our credit ratings are periodically reviewed by rating agencies. as of december 31, 2019, moody's rating was baa3 with an outlook of "positive," which was upgraded during the third quarter of 2019 from ba1 in connection with the closing of the liberty expedia transaction, s&p's rating was bbb with an outlook of "watch negative" and fitch's rating was bbb with an outlook of "stable." changes in our operating results, cash flows, financial position, capital structure, financial policy or capital allocations to share repurchase, dividends, investments and acquisitions could impact the ratings assigned by the various rating agencies. should our credit ratings be adjusted downward, we may incur higher costs to borrow and/or limited to access to capital markets, which could have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations.
as of december 31, 2019, we were in compliance with the covenants and conditions in our revolving credit facility and outstanding debt, which was comprised of $750 million in registered senior unsecured notes due in august 2020 that bear interest at 5.95% (the "5.95% notes"), $500 million in registered senior unsecured notes due in august 2024 that bear interest at 4.5% (the "4.5% notes"), euro 650 million of registered senior unsecured notes due in june 2022 that bear interest at 2.5% (the "2.5% notes"), $750 million of registered senior unsecured notes due in february 2026 that bear interest at 5.0% ("the 5.0% notes") and the $1 billion of registered senior unsecured notes due in february 2028 that bear interest at 3.8% ("the 3.8% notes") and the 3.25% notes.
under the merchant model, we receive cash from travelers at the time of booking and we record these amounts on our consolidated balance sheets as deferred merchant bookings. we pay our airline suppliers related to these merchant model bookings generally within a few weeks after completing the transaction, but we are liable for the full value of such transactions until the flights are completed. for most other merchant bookings, which is primarily our merchant lodging business, we generally pay after the travelers' use and, in some cases, subsequent to billing from the hotel suppliers. therefore, generally we receive cash from the traveler prior to paying our supplier, and this operating cycle represents a working capital source of cash to us. as long as the merchant hotel business grows, we expect that changes in working capital related to merchant hotel transactions will positively impact operating cash flows. however, we are using both the merchant model and the agency model in many of our markets. if the merchant hotel model declines relative to our other business models that generally consume working capital such as agency hotel, managed corporate travel, advertising or certain expedia partner solutions relationships, or if there are changes to the merchant model, supplier payment terms, including programs where we remit payment to suppliers in advance of the travelers stay, or booking patterns that compress the time period between our receipt of cash from travelers and our payment to suppliers, our overall working capital benefits could be reduced, eliminated or even reversed. our future working capital benefits could also be impacted by vrbo's continued shift to become the merchant of record on more of its transactions.
seasonal fluctuations in our merchant hotel bookings affect the timing of our annual cash flows. during the first half of the year, hotel bookings have traditionally exceeded stays, resulting in much higher cash flow related to working capital. during the second half of the year, this pattern reverses and cash flows are typically negative. while we expect the impact of seasonal fluctuations to continue, merchant hotel growth rates, changes to the model or booking patterns, changes in the relative mix of merchant hotel transactions compared with transactions in our working capital consuming businesses, including etp, as well as the transformation of the vrbo's alternative accommodation listing business, may counteract or intensify the anticipated seasonal fluctuations.
as of december 31, 2019, we had a deficit in our working capital of $3.0 billion, compared to a deficit of $2.9 billion as of december 31, 2018.
we will continue to invest in capital at similar to increasing levels over time to improve our technology platforms, infrastructure, operational capabilities, and in the development of service offerings and expansion of our operations. in addition to the capital requirements in support of our business strategy, our future capital requirements may also include capital needs for acquisitions (including purchases of non-controlling interest), share repurchases, or dividend payments among others; thus reducing our cash balance and/or increasing our debt. for the new headquarters, we expect to spend approximately $900 million. of the total, approximately $290 million was spent between 2016 and 2018, and approximately $390 million was spent during 2019. during full year 2020, we expect to spend approximately $220 million.

in 2019, net cash provided by operating activities increased by $792 million primarily due to increase in benefits from working capital changes mainly due to higher deferred merchant bookings at vrbo as it transitioned to the expedia group payment platform.
in 2019, $994 million more cash was used in investing activities primarily due to net purchases of investments of $494 million in 2019 compared to net sales of investments of $334 million in 2018 and higher current year capital expenditures, including amounts related to our new corporate headquarters.

during 2019, 2012, 2010, and 2006, our board of directors, or the executive committee, acting on behalf of the board of directors, authorized a repurchase of up to 20 million outstanding shares of our common stock in each of the respective years, during 2018 authorized a repurchase of up to 15 million shares of our common stock and during 2015 authorized a repurchase of up to 10 million shares of our common stock for a total of 105 million shares. shares repurchased under the authorized programs were as follows:
number of shares repurchased                   5.6 million               7.7 million               2.3 million average price per share                            $122.72                   $117.02                   $127.04
total cost of repurchases (in millions)(1)            $683                      $903                      $294
as of december 31, 2019, 26.7 million shares remain authorized for repurchase under the 2018 authorization with no fixed termination date for the repurchases. subsequent to december 31, 2019, we repurchased an additional 3.4 million shares for a total cost of $370 million, excluding transaction costs, representing an average purchase price of $109.88 per share.
our common stock dividend was $1.32 per share for 2019, $1.24 per share for 2018 and $1.16 per share for 2017. see note 13 - stockholders' equity in the notes to consolidated financial statements for a detail of the quarterly dividend payments by year. in addition, in february 2020, the executive committee, acting on behalf of the board of directors, declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.34 per share of outstanding common stock payable on march 26, 2020 to the stockholders of record as of the close of business on march 10, 2020. future declarations of dividends are subject to final determination by our board of directors.
foreign exchange rate changes resulted in immaterial increases of our cash balances denominated in foreign currency in 2019 of $3 million. foreign exchange rate changes resulted in a reduction of our cash balances denominated in foreign currency in 2018 of $139 million reflecting net depreciations in foreign currencies during 2018.
in our opinion, available cash, funds from operations and available borrowings will provide sufficient capital resources to meet our foreseeable liquidity needs. there can be no assurance, however, that the cost of availability of future borrowings, including refinancing, if any, will be available on terms acceptable to us.
contractual obligations and commercial commitments the following table presents our material contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of december 31, 2019:
operating leases, including imputed interest (2)         881                     154                       256          146                      325
letters of credit (4)                                     39                      22                        13                        -          4
(1)   our 5.95% notes, 2.5% notes, 4.5% notes, 5.0% notes, 3.8% and 3.25% notes include interest payments through maturity in 2020, 2022, 2024, 2026, 2028 and 2030 respectively, based on the stated fixed rates. for the 2.5% notes, the december 31, 2019 euro exchange rate was used to convert the euro 650 million to u.s. dollars and calculate the related u.s. dollar interest payments.
(2)   operating lease obligations include leases for office space and data centers, including those leases entered into but not yet commenced as of december 31, 2019. certain leases contain periodic rent escalation adjustments and renewal options. lease obligations expire at various dates with the latest maturity in 2038.
(3)   our purchase obligations represent the minimum obligations we have under agreements with certain of our vendors and marketing partners. these minimum obligations are less than our projected use for those periods. payments may be more than the minimum obligations based on actual use.
(4)   guarantees and locs are commitments that represent funding responsibilities that may require our performance in the event of third-party demands or contingent events. we use our stand-by locs primarily for certain regulatory purposes as well as to secure payment for hotel room transactions to particular hotel properties. of the outstanding balance of our stand-by locs, $16 million directly reduces the amount available to us from our revolving credit facility. the loc amounts in the above table represent the amount of commitment expiration per period. in addition, we provide a guarantee to the aviation authorities of certain foreign countries to protect against potential non-delivery of our packaged travel services sold within those countries. these countries hold all travel agents and tour companies to the same standard. our guarantees also include bonds relating to tax assessments that we are contesting and certain surety bonds related to various company performance obligations.
(5)   excludes $243 million of net unrecognized tax benefits for which we cannot make a reasonably reliable estimate of the amount and period of payment.
other than the items described above, we do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements as of december 31, 2019.

the comparison of our financial results for the year ended december 31, 2018 to those for the year ended december 31, 2017, is included in our management's discussion and analysis in the annual report on form 10-k for the fiscal year ended december 31, 2018 filed with the sec on february 21, 2019, as amended by exhibit 99.2 to our current report on form 8-k filed with the sec on may 2, 2019.
for the fourth quarter of 2019, we recorded a charge of $140 million to increase our legal accrual for government investigations and civil litigation associated with our invoicing matter first reported in december 2015. this additional legal accrual relates to events that developed subsequent to january 17, 2020, the date we originally announced our financial results for the fourth quarter and year ended december 31, 2019, and was reported on february 20, 2020. the effects of the additional accrual are reflected in the financial and other information reported in this form 10-k.
in this management's discussion and analysis, where we describe the effects of changes in fx rates, those effects are determined by applying applicable weighted average fx rates from the relevant 2018 period to the relevant 2019 period results.
financial results and highlights
•   eps of $5.38 in 2019 decreased 16% compared to $6.39 in 2018. both years include the impact of notable items:
◦   repositioning charges of approximately $110 million;
◦   acquisition and restructuring costs of approximately $77 million, primarily related to crd;
◦   gain of approximately $44 million on the extinguishment of approximately $297 million of our outstanding floating rate junior subordinated debentures due 2047 following a cash tender offer;
◦   legal and related expenses of approximately $172 million; and
◦   costs of $22 million due to the redemption of all outstanding series e non-cumulative perpetual preferred stock representing the difference between the redemption value and the net carrying value of the preferred stock.
◦   repositioning charges of approximately $300 million;
◦   legal and related expenses of approximately $50 million; and
◦   acquisition and restructuring costs primarily related to crd of approximately $24 million.
•   crd was acquired on october 1, 2018. total revenue contributed by crd was approximately $385 million and $119 million in 2019 and 2018, respectively. total expenses contributed by crd were approximately $201 million and $39 million in 2019 and 2018, respectively. in addition, crd-related expenses include $65 million and $18 million in amortization of other intangible assets in 2019 and 2018, respectively.
•   total expenses were up slightly in 2019 compared to 2018, including the impact of the incremental legal reserve, and reflect our successfully executed previously announced 2019 expense savings program. that program achieved approximately $415 million in gross savings in 2019 through expense savings of approximately $230 million in resource discipline initiatives and $185 million in process re-engineering and automation benefits, exceeding our revised goal of $400 million gross savings in 2019 (itself reflecting an increase from our initial goal of $350 million gross savings).
•   in 2019, return on equity of 9.4% decreased from 12.1% in 2018, primarily due to a decrease in net income available to common shareholders. pre-tax margin of 23.1% in 2019 decreased from 25.6% in 2018, primarily due to a decrease in total revenue.
•   operating leverage was (3.3)% in 2019. operating leverage represents the difference between the percentage change in total revenue and the percentage change in total expenses, in each case relative to the prior year period.
•   we purchased a total of approximately $1.6 billion and $350 million of our common stock in 2019 and 2018, respectively. these purchases were all conducted under share purchase state street corporation |
management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations programs approved by our board of directors. our current share purchase program authorizes the purchase of up to $2.0 billion of our common stock from july 1, 2019 through june 30, 2020 (the 2019 program). $1.0 billion remains available for repurchases under that program in the first and second quarters of 2020. the lower level of common stock repurchases in 2018 reflects our funding plan for our acquisition of crd, which included an issuance of approximately $1.15 billion of common stock and a suspension of approximately $950 million of common stock repurchases in 2018.
•   total revenue and fee revenue both decreased 3% in 2019 compared to 2018, primarily driven by decreases in servicing fees, management fees, foreign exchange trading services and securities finance revenues and, in the case of total revenue, by nii. these decreases were partially offset by higher software and processing fee revenue in 2019, which includes a full year of revenue from crd. total fee revenue in the second half of 2019 was approximately $4.63 billion compared to $4.52 billion in the first half of 2019, representing a 2% increase, primarily driven by higher equity markets as well as moderating fee pressure in the second half of the year.
◦   total revenues contributed by crd in 2019 were approximately $385 million, including $370 million in software and processing fees and $15 million in brokerage and other trading services, within foreign exchange trading services.
•   servicing fee revenue decreased 6% in 2019 compared to 2018, primarily due to elevated fee pressure and lower client activity and flows.
•   management fee revenue decreased 4% in 2019 compared to 2018, primarily reflecting the run rate impact of late 2018 outflows and mix changes away from higher fee products, partially offset by higher equity market levels.
•   foreign exchange trading services decreased 7% in 2019 compared to 2018 primarily due to lower market volatility.
•   securities finance revenue decreased 13% in 2019 compared to 2018, reflecting lower securities on loan, enhanced custody balances and spreads, and the impact of balance sheet optimization efforts implemented in the second half of 2018.
•   software and processing fees revenue increased 64% in 2019 compared to 2018 primarily due to $370 million from crd, which we acquired in october 2018.
•   nii decreased 4% in 2019 compared to 2018, primarily due to lower average non-interest bearing client deposit balances and lower long-end u.s. market rates, partially offset by ficc, investment portfolio and loan growth.
•   total expenses were up slightly in 2019 compared to 2018, primarily reflecting the impact of the incremental legal reserve of $140 million, technology infrastructure investments and the impact of the crd acquisition, partially offset by savings from resource discipline, process re-engineering and automation initiatives and lower repositioning charges in 2019 compared to 2018.
◦   we recorded a repositioning charge in 2019 of approximately $110 million, consisting of $98 million of compensation and employee benefits expenses and $12 million of occupancy expenses, to further drive process automation, information technology optimizations and organization rationalization in 2020.
◦   total expenses contributed by crd in 2019 and 2018 were approximately $201 million and $39 million, respectively, including $148 million and $28 million in compensation and employee benefits and $53 million and $11 million in other expense lines, respectively. in addition, crd-related expenses in 2019 and 2018 included $65 million and $18 million, respectively in amortization of other intangible assets.
•   auc/a increased 9% as of december 31, 2019 compared to december 31, 2018, primarily due to higher end of period market levels and client flows, partially offset by a previously announced client transition. in 2019, newly announced asset servicing mandates totaled approximately $1.84 trillion, in line with a high state street corporation |
management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations of $1.89 trillion in 2018, primarily driven by additional services for an existing large asset manager client. servicing assets remaining to be installed in future periods totaled approximately $1.17 trillion as of december 31, 2019.
•   aum increased 24% as of december 31, 2019 compared to december 31, 2018, primarily due to higher end of period market levels and net inflows, driven by institutional, etf and cash inflows.
capital and capital redemptions
•   in 2019, we returned a total of approximately $2.33 billion to our shareholders in the form of common stock dividends and share purchases.
◦   we declared aggregate common stock dividends of $1.98 per share, totaling $728 million in 2019, compared to $1.78 per share, totaling $665 million in 2018, representing an increase of approximately 11% on a per share basis.
◦   in 2019, we acquired 24.9 million shares of common stock at an average per share cost of $64.30 and an aggregate cost of approximately $1.6 billion. in 2018, we acquired 3.3 million shares of common stock at an average per share cost of $105.31 and an aggregate cost of approximately $350 million. these purchases were all conducted under share purchase programs approved by our board of directors.
•   in june 2019, the federal reserve issued a non-objection to our capital plan included as part of our 2019 ccar submission. pursuant to that plan, our board authorized the 2019 program and we increased our quarterly common stock dividend to $0.52 per share in the third quarter of 2019.
•   our cet1 capital ratio was 11.7% as of both december 31, 2019 and 2018, and tier 1 leverage ratio decreased to 6.9% as of december 31, 2019, compared to 7.2% as of december 31, 2018. as of december 31, 2019, advanced approaches capital ratios were binding for the period. as of december 31, 2018, standardized approaches capital ratios were binding for the period.
capital redemptions
•   we redeemed all outstanding series e non-cumulative perpetual preferred stock as of december 15, 2019 at a redemption price of $750 million ($100,000 per share equivalent to
$25.00 per depositary share) plus accrued and unpaid dividends. the difference of $22 million between the redemption value and the net carrying value resulted in an eps impact of approximately ($0.06) per share in 2019.
•   on february 12, 2020, we announced that we will redeem all 5,000 of our outstanding shares of our non-cumulative perpetual preferred stock, series c, for cash at a redemption price of $100,000 per share (equivalent to $25.00 per depositary share) plus all declared and unpaid dividends. the redemption price will be payable on march 16, 2020, and this redemption will be reflected in our first quarter 2020 results of operations.
•   on november 1, 2019, we issued $1 billion aggregate principal amount of fixed-to-floating rate senior notes due 2025 and $500 million aggregate principal amount of fixed-to-floating rate senior subordinated notes due 2034 in a public offering.
•   on january 24, 2020, we issued $750 million aggregate principal amount of 2.400% senior notes due 2030 in a public offering.
•   in the fourth quarter of 2019, we completed a cash tender offer for approximately $297 million of our $800 million aggregate principal amount of outstanding floating rate junior subordinated debentures due 2047, resulting in a gain of approximately $44 million.
•   in the fourth quarter of 2019, we redeemed approximately $50 million of our $150 million aggregate principal amount of outstanding floating rate junior subordinated debentures due 2028.

(1) the revenue recognition standard impact was approximately $319 million in total revenue for 2018, including approximately $190 million in management fees, $58 million in foreign exchange trading services and $71 million across all other revenue lines.
(2) crd contributed approximately $385 million in total revenue in 2019, including approximately $370 million in software and processing fees and $15 million in brokerage and other trading services within foreign exchange trading services. crd contributed approximately $119 million in total revenue in 2018, including approximately $114 million in software and processing fees and $5 million in brokerage and other trading services within foreign exchange trading services.
management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations fee revenue table 2: total revenue, provides the breakout of fee revenue for the years ended december 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017. servicing and management fees collectively made up approximately 75%, 77% and 78% of the total fee revenue in 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
servicing fee revenue generally, our servicing fee revenues are affected by several factors including changes in market valuations, client activity and asset flows, net new business and the manner in which we price our services. we provide a range of services to our clients, including core custody services, accounting, reporting and administration and middle office services, and the nature and mix of services provided affects our servicing fees. the basis for fees will differ across regions and clients. on average and over time, approximately 55% of our servicing fee revenues have been variable due to changes in asset valuations including changes in daily average valuations of auc/a; another 15% of our servicing fees are impacted by the volume of activity in the funds we serve; and the remaining 30% of our servicing fees tend not to be variable in nature nor impacted by market fluctuations or values.
changes in market valuations our servicing fee revenue is impacted by both our levels and the geographic and product mix of our auc/a. increases or decreases in market valuations have a corresponding impact on the level of our auc/a and servicing fee revenues, though the degree of impact will vary depending on asset types and classes and geography of assets held within our clients' portfolios.
over the five years ended december 31, 2019, we estimate that worldwide market valuations impacted our servicing fee revenues by approximately (2)% to 5% annually and approximately 0% and 2% in 2019 and 2018, respectively. see table 3: daily averages, month-end averages and year-end equity indices for selected indices. while the specific indices presented are indicative of general market trends, the asset types and classes relevant to individual client portfolios can and do differ, and the performance of associated relevant indices and of client portfolios can therefore differ from the performance of the indices presented. in addition, our asset classifications may differ from those industry classifications presented.
we estimate, using relevant information as of december 31, 2019 and assuming that all other factors remain constant, that:
•   a 10% increase or decrease in worldwide equity valuations, on a weighted average basis, over the relevant periods for which our servicing fees are calculated, would result in a corresponding change in our total servicing fee revenues, on average and over time, of approximately 3%; and
•   a 10% increase or decrease in worldwide fixed income valuations, on a weighted average basis, over the relevant periods for which our servicing fees are calculated, would result in a corresponding change in our total servicing fee revenues, on average and over time, of approximately 1%.

management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations client activity and asset flows client activity and asset flows are impacted by the number of transactions we execute on behalf of our clients, including fx settlements, equity and derivative trades, and wire transfer activity, as well as actions by our clients to change the asset class in which their assets are invested. our servicing fee revenues are impacted by a number of factors, including transaction volumes, asset levels and asset classes in which funds are invested, as well as industry trends associated with these client-related activities.
our clients may change the asset classes in which their assets are invested, based on their market outlook, risk acceptance tolerance or other considerations. over the five years ended december 31, 2019, we estimate that client activity and asset flows, together, impacted our servicing fee revenues by approximately (1)% to 2% annually and approximately (1)% and 1% in 2019 and 2018, respectively. see table 5: industry asset flows for selected asset flow information. while the asset flows presented are indicative of general market trends, the asset types and classes relevant to individual client portfolios can and do differ, and our flows may differ from those market trends. in addition, our asset classifications may differ from those industry classifications presented.

pricing the industry in which we operate has historically faced pricing pressure, and our servicing fee revenues are also affected by such pressures today. consequently, no assumption should be drawn as to future revenue run rate from announced servicing wins, as the amount of revenue associated with auc/a can vary materially. on average, over the five years ended december 31, 2019, we estimate that pricing pressure with respect to existing clients has impacted our servicing fees by approximately (2)% annually, with the impact ranging from (1)% to (4)% in any given year, and approximately (4)% in both 2019 and 2018. pricing concessions can be a part of a contract renegotiation with a client including terms that may benefit us, such as extending the terms of our relationship with the client, expanding the scope of services that we provide or reducing our dependency on manual processes through the standardization of the services we provide. the timing of the impact of additional revenue generated by anticipated additional services, and the amount of revenue generated, may differ from the impact of pricing concessions on existing services due to the necessary time required to onboard those new services, the nature of those services and client investment practices. these same market pressures also impact the fees we negotiate when we win business from new clients.
net new business over the five years ended december 31, 2019, net new business, which includes business both won and lost, has affected our servicing fee revenues by approximately 2% on average with a range of 0% to 3% annually and approximately 0% and 1% in 2019 and 2018, respectively, inclusive of a client transition.
new business impacting servicing fees can include: custody; product and participant level accounting; daily valuation and administration; record-keeping; cash management; and other services. revenues associated with new servicing mandates may vary based on the breadth of services provided, the time required to install the assets, and the types of assets installed.
management fee revenue management fees generally are affected by our level of aum, which we report based on month-end valuations. management fees for certain components of managed assets, such as etfs, mutual funds and ucits, are affected by daily average valuations of aum. management fee revenue is more sensitive to market valuations than servicing fee revenue, as a higher proportion of the underlying services provided, and the associated management fees earned, are dependent on equity and fixed-income security valuations. additional factors, such as the relative mix of assets managed, may have a significant effect on our state street corporation |
management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations management fee revenue. while certain management fees are directly determined by the values of aum and the investment strategies employed, management fees may reflect other factors, including performance fee arrangements, as well as our relationship pricing for clients.
asset-based management fees for passively managed products, to which our aum is currently primarily weighted, are generally charged at a lower fee of aum than for actively managed products. actively managed products may also include performance fee arrangements which are recorded when the fee is earned, based on predetermined benchmarks associated with the applicable account's performance.
in light of the above, we estimate, using relevant information as of december 31, 2019 and assuming that all other factors remain constant, including the impact of business won and lost and client flows, that:
•   a 10% increase or decrease in worldwide equity valuations, on a weighted average basis, over the relevant periods for which our management fees are calculated, would result in a corresponding change in our total management fee revenues, on average and over time, of approximately 5%; and
•   a 10% increase or decrease in worldwide fixed-income valuations, on a weighted average basis, over the relevant periods for which our management fees are calculated, would result in a corresponding change in our total management fee revenues, on average and over time, of approximately 4%.
daily averages, month-end averages and year-end indices demonstrate worldwide changes in equity and debt markets that affect our management fee revenue. year-end indices affect the values of aum as of those dates. see table 3: daily averages, month-end averages and year-end equity indices for selected indices.
additional information about fee revenue is provided under "line of business information" included in this management's discussion and analysis.
net interest income see table 2: total revenue, for the breakout of interest income and interest expense for the years ended december 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017.
nii is defined as interest income earned on interest-earning assets less interest expense incurred on interest-bearing liabilities. interest-earning assets, which principally consist of investment securities, interest-bearing deposits with banks, resale agreements, loans and other liquid assets, are financed primarily by client deposits, short-term borrowings and long-term debt.
nii on a fte basis decreased in 2019 compared to 2018, primarily due to lower long-end u.s. market rates and lower average non-interest bearing deposit balances, partially offset by ficc expansion and higher core loan and investment securities balances. investment securities net premium amortization, which is included in interest income, was $434 million in 2019 compared to $391 million in 2018 and $364 million in 2017, primarily related to higher mbs premium amortization.
interest income related to debt securities is recognized in our consolidated statement of income using the effective interest method, or on a basis approximating a level rate of return over the contractual or estimated life of the security. the rate of return considers any non-refundable fees or costs, as well as purchase premiums or discounts, resulting in amortization or accretion, accordingly. the amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts are adjusted for prepayments when they occur, such that the level rate of return remains constant throughout the contractual life of the security.
the following table presents the investment securities amortizable purchase premium net of discount accretion for the periods indicated:
unamortized premiums, net of discounts at period end        $1,585                      $1,575                      $2,249

changes in the components of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities are discussed in more detail below. additional information about the components of interest income and interest expense is provided in note 17 to the consolidated financial statements in this form 10-k.
management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations average total interest-earning assets were $181.89 billion in 2019 compared to $185.64 billion in 2018. the decrease is primarily driven by lower average total client deposits.
interest-bearing deposits with banks averaged $48.50 billion in 2019 compared to $54.33 billion in 2018. these deposits primarily reflect our maintenance of cash balances at the federal reserve, the european central bank (ecb) and other non-u.s. central banks. the lower levels of average cash balances with central banks reflect lower levels of client deposits and an increase in the investment portfolio.
securities purchased under resale agreements averaged $2.51 billion in 2019 compared to $2.90 billion in 2018. while the on-balance sheet amount has remained relatively stable, the impact of balance sheet netting increased to $86.67 billion on average in 2019, respectively, compared to $35.74 billion in 2018. we maintain an agreement with fixed income clearing corporation (ficc), a clearing organization that enables us to net all securities sold under repurchase agreements against those purchased under resale agreements with counterparties that are also members of the clearing organization. the increase in average balance sheet netting, in 2019 compared to 2018, is primarily due to the expansion of our ficc program and new client activity.
we have been a netting and sponsoring member within ficc since 2005. ficc expanded the service in 2017, and since then, we have increased our participation. we enter into repurchase and resale transactions in eligible securities with sponsored clients and with other ficc members and, pursuant to ficc government securities division rules, submit, novate and net the transactions. we may sponsor clients to clear their eligible repurchase transactions with ficc, backed by our guarantee to ficc of the prompt and full payment and performance of our sponsored member clients' respective obligations. we obtain a security interest from our sponsored clients in the high quality securities collateral that they receive, which is designed to mitigate our potential exposure to ficc.
average other interest-earning assets, largely associated with our enhanced custody business, decreased to $14.16 billion in 2019 from $15.71 billion in 2018, primarily driven by a reduction in the level of cash collateral posted. enhanced custody is our securities financing business where we act as principal with respect to our custody clients and generate securities finance revenue. the nii earned on these transactions is generally lower than the interest earned on other alternative investments.
aggregate average total interest-bearing deposits increased to $128.85 billion in 2019 from $125.58 billion in 2018. average u.s. interest-bearing deposits increased as a result of a gradual shift from non-interest bearing deposits and new deposit initiatives. future deposit levels will be influenced by the underlying asset servicing business, client deposit behavior and market conditions, including the general levels of u.s. and non-u.s. interest rates.
average long-term debt was $11.47 billion in 2019 compared to $10.69 billion in 2018. these amounts reflect issuances, redemptions and maturities of senior debt during the respective periods, including the issuance of $1.0 billion of senior debt and $500 million of subordinated debt in november 2019.
average other interest-bearing liabilities were $4.10 billion in 2019 compared to $4.96 billion in 2018. other interest-bearing liabilities primarily reflect our level of cash collateral received from clients in connection with our enhanced custody business, which is presented on a net basis where we have enforceable netting agreements.
several factors could affect future levels of nii and nim, including the volume and mix of client deposits and funding sources; central bank actions; balance sheet management activities; changes in the level and slope of u.s. and non-u.s. interest rates; revised or proposed regulatory capital or liquidity standards, or interpretations of those standards; the yields earned on securities purchased compared to the yields earned on securities sold or matured and changes in the type and amount of credit or other loans we extend.
based on market conditions and other factors, including regulatory standards, we continue to reinvest the majority of the proceeds from pay-downs and maturities of investment securities in highly-rated u.s. and non-u.s. securities, such as federal agency mbs, sovereign debt securities and u.s. treasury and agency securities. the pace at which we reinvest and the types of investment securities purchased will depend on the impact of market conditions, the implementation of regulatory standards, including interpretation of those standards and other factors over time. we expect these factors and the levels of global interest rates to impact our reinvestment program and future levels of nii and nim.
management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations provision for loan losses we recorded a provision for loan losses of $10 million in 2019 compared to $15 million in 2018 and $2 million in 2017. additional information is provided under "loans and leases" in "financial condition" in this management's discussion and analysis and in note 4 to the consolidated financial statements in this form 10-k.

(1) crd contributed approximately $201 million in total expenses in 2019, including approximately $148 million in compensation and employee benefits and $53 million in other expense lines. in addition, crd-related expenses in 2019 include $65 million in amortization of other intangible assets.
crd contributed approximately $39 million in total expenses in 2018, including approximately $28 million in compensation and employee benefits and $11 million in other expense lines. in addition, crd-related expenses in 2018 include $18 million in amortization of other intangible assets.
(2) the revenue recognition standard contributed approximately $319 million in total expenses for 2018, including approximately $183 million in other expenses, $106 million in transaction processing and $30 million across other expense line items.
nm not meaningful compensation and employee benefits expenses decreased 5% in 2019 compared to 2018, primarily driven by savings from the process re-engineering and resource discipline savings initiatives under our expense savings program and lower repositioning charges in 2019 compared to 2018, partially offset by the impact of the crd acquisition and annual merit increases.
total headcount decreased by approximately 3% as of december 31, 2019 compared to december 31, 2018, primarily driven by productivity savings, including a reduction in headcount in higher cost locations.
information systems and communications expenses increased 11% in 2019 compared to 2018. the increase was primarily related to technology infrastructure enhancements.
transaction processing services expenses remained flat in 2019 compared to 2018.
occupancy expenses decreased 6% in 2019 compared to 2018, primarily due to lower repositioning charges in 2019 compared to 2018 and the advancement of our global footprint strategy.
amortization of other intangible assets increased 4% in 2019 compared to 2018, primarily due to the crd acquisition.
other expenses increased 7% in 2019 compared to 2018, primarily driven by higher legal expenses and state street foundation funding, partially offset by lower professional services, travel, and insurance costs.
acquisition costs we recorded approximately $79 million of acquisition costs in 2019 compared to $31 million in 2018, related to our acquisition of crd, and $21 million in 2017 related to our acquisition of the geam business. as we integrate crd into our business, we expect to incur a total of approximately $200 million of acquisition costs, including merger and integration costs, through 2021, out of which $110 million has been incurred as of december 31, 2019, since the acquisition.
restructuring and repositioning charges repositioning charges in late 2018, we initiated an expense program to accelerate efforts to become a higher-performing organization and help navigate challenging market and industry conditions, with an initial goal to realize $350 million in gross expense savings in 2019, which was subsequently revised to $400 million gross savings for 2019. in 2019, we achieved approximately $415 million of gross expense savings under this program, including approximately $230 million in resource discipline initiatives and $185 million in process re-engineering and automation benefits.
resource discipline initiatives include reducing senior management headcount, rigorous performance management, vendor management and optimization of real estate. process re-engineering and automation benefits can include high-cost location workforce reductions, reducing manual/bespoke and redundant activities, streamlining operational centers and moving to common platforms/retiring legacy applications.

line of business information our operations are organized into two lines of business: investment servicing and investment management, which are defined based on products and services provided. the results of operations for these lines of business are not necessarily comparable with those of other companies, including companies in the financial services industry.
investment servicing, through state street global services, state street global markets, state street global exchange and crd, provides services for institutional clients, including mutual funds, collective investment funds and other investment pools, corporate and public retirement plans, insurance companies, investment managers, foundations and endowments worldwide. products include: custody; product and participant level accounting; daily pricing and administration; master trust and master custody; depotbank services (a fund oversight role created by non-u.s. regulation); record-keeping; cash management; foreign exchange, brokerage and other trading services; securities finance and enhanced custody products; deposit and short-term investment facilities; loans and lease financing; investment manager and alternative investment manager operations outsourcing; performance, risk and compliance analytics; and financial data management to support institutional investors. our crd business also falls within our investment servicing line of business and includes products and services, such as: portfolio modeling and construction; trade order management; investment risk and compliance; and wealth management solutions.
investment management, through state street global advisors, provides a broad range of investment management strategies and products for our clients. our investment management strategies and products span the risk/reward spectrum, including core and enhanced indexing, multi-asset strategies, active quantitative and fundamental active capabilities and alternative investment strategies. our aum is currently primarily weighted to indexed strategies. in addition, we provide a breadth of services and solutions, including environmental, social and governance investing, defined benefit and defined contribution and global fiduciary solutions (formerly outsourced chief investment officer). state street global advisors is also a provider of etfs, including the spdr® etf brand. while management fees are primarily determined by the values of aum and the investment strategies employed, management fees reflect other factors as well, including the benchmarks specified in the respective management agreements related to performance fees.

management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations asset servicing mandates newly announced in 2019 totaled approximately $1.84 trillion, in line with a high of $1.89 trillion in 2018. servicing assets remaining to be installed in future periods totaled approximately $1.17 trillion as of december 31, 2019, which will be reflected in auc/a in future periods after installation and will generate servicing fee revenue in subsequent periods. the full revenue impact of such mandates will be realized over several quarters as the assets are installed and additional services are added over that period.
new asset servicing mandates may be subject to completion of definitive agreements, approval of applicable boards and shareholders and customary regulatory approvals. new asset servicing mandates and servicing assets remaining to be installed in future periods exclude certain new business which has been contracted, but for which the client has not yet provided permission to publicly disclose and the expected installation date extends beyond one quarter. these excluded assets, which from time to time may be significant, will be included in new asset servicing mandates and reflected in servicing assets remaining to be installed in the period in which the client provides its permission. servicing mandates and servicing assets remaining to be installed in future periods are presented on a gross basis and therefore also do not include the impact of clients who have notified us during the period of their intent to terminate or reduce their relationship with us, which may from time to time be significant.
with respect to these new servicing mandates, once installed we may provide various services, including accounting, bank loan servicing, compliance reporting and monitoring, custody, depository banking services, fx, fund administration, hedge fund servicing, middle office outsourcing, performance and analytics, private equity administration, real estate administration, securities finance, transfer agency and wealth management services. revenues associated with new servicing mandates may vary based on the breadth of services provided and the timing of installation, and the types of assets.
for additional information about the impact of worldwide equity and fixed-income valuations on our fee revenue, as well as other key drivers of our servicing fee revenue, refer to "fee revenue" in "consolidated results of operations" included in this management's discussion and analysis.
foreign exchange trading services foreign exchange trading services revenue, as presented in table 10: investment servicing line of business results, decreased 9% in 2019 compared to 2018, primarily due to lower market volatility. foreign exchange trading services is composed of revenue generated by fx trading and revenue generated by brokerage and other trading services, which made up 56% and 44%, respectively, of foreign exchange trading services revenue in 2019.
we primarily earn fx trading revenue by acting as a principal market-maker through both "direct sales and trading" and "indirect fx trading."
•   direct sales and trading: represent fx transactions at negotiated rates with clients and investment managers that contact our trading desk directly. these principal market-making activities include transactions for funds serviced by third party custodians or prime brokers, as well as those funds under custody with us.
our fx trading revenue is influenced by multiple factors, including: the volume and type of client fx transactions and related spreads; currency volatility, reflecting market conditions; and our management of exchange rate, interest rate and other market risks associated with our fx activities. the relative impact of these factors on our total fx trading revenues often differs from period to period. for example, assuming all other factors remain constant, increases or decreases in volumes or bid-offer spreads across product mix tend to result in increases or decreases, as the case may be, in client-related fx revenue.
our clients that utilize indirect fx trading can, in addition to executing their fx transactions through dealers not affiliated with us, transition from indirect fx trading to either direct sales and trading execution, including our "street fx" service, or to one of our electronic trading platforms. street fx, in which we continue to act as a principal market-maker, enables our clients to define their fx execution strategy and automate the fx trade execution process, both for funds under custody with us as well as those under custody at another bank.
we also earn foreign exchange trading services revenue through "electronic fx services" and "other trading, transition management and brokerage revenue."
•   electronic fx services: our clients may choose to execute fx transactions through one of our electronic trading platforms. these transactions generate revenue through a "click" fee.
•   other trading, transition management and brokerage revenue: as our clients look to us to state street corporation |
management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations enhance and preserve portfolio values, they may choose to utilize our transition or currency management capabilities or transact with our equity trade execution group. these transactions, which are not limited to foreign exchange, generate revenue via commissions charged for trades transacted during the management of these portfolios.
securities finance our securities finance business consists of three components:
(1) an agency lending program for state street global advisors managed investment funds with a broad range of investment objectives, which we refer to as the state street global advisors lending funds;
(2) an agency lending program for third-party investment managers and asset owners, which we refer to as the agency lending funds; and
(3) security lending transactions which we enter into as principal, which we refer to as our enhanced custody business.
securities finance revenue earned from our agency lending activities, which is composed of our split of both the spreads related to cash collateral and the fees related to non-cash collateral, is principally a function of the volume of securities on loan, the interest rate spreads and fees earned on the underlying collateral and our share of the fee split.
as principal, our enhanced custody business borrows securities from the lending client or other market participants and then lends such securities to the subsequent borrower, either our client or a broker/dealer. we act as principal when the lending client is unable to, or elects not to, transact directly with the market and execute the transaction and furnish the securities. in our role as principal, we provide support to the transaction through our credit rating. while we source a significant proportion of the securities furnished by us in our role as principal from third parties, we have the ability to source securities through assets under custody from clients who have designated us as an eligible borrower.
securities finance revenue, as presented in table 10: investment servicing line of business results, decreased 15% in 2019 compared to 2018, reflecting lower securities on loan, enhanced custody balances and spreads and the impact of balance sheet optimization efforts implemented in the second half of 2018.
market influences may continue to affect client demand for securities finance, and as a result our revenue from, and the profitability of, our securities lending activities in future periods. in addition, the constantly evolving regulatory environment, including revised or proposed capital and liquidity standards, interpretations of those standards, and our own balance sheet management activities, may influence modifications to the way in which we deliver our agency lending or enhanced custody businesses, the volume of our securities lending activity and related revenue and profitability in future periods.
software and processing fees software and processing fees revenue includes diverse types of fees and revenue, including fees from software licensing and maintenance, fees from our structured products business and other revenue including equity income from our joint venture investments, gains and losses on sales of other assets and amortization of our tax-advantaged investments.
software and processing fees revenue, presented in table 10: investment servicing line of business results, increased significantly in 2019 compared to 2018 and reflects approximately $370 million from crd in 2019. crd was acquired on october 1, 2018. revenue related to the front office solutions provided by crd is primarily driven by the sale of term software licenses and software as service arrangements, including professional services such as consulting and implementation services, software support and maintenance. revenue for a sale of software to be installed on premise is recognized at a point in time when the customer benefits from obtaining access to and use of the software license. revenue for a software as a service (saas) related arrangement is recognized over time as services are provided.
other income in the fourth quarter of 2019, we completed a cash tender offer for approximately $297 million of our $800 million aggregate principal amount of outstanding floating rate junior subordinated debentures due 2047, resulting in a gain of approximately $44 million.
expenses total expenses for investment servicing increased 1% in 2019 compared to 2018. the increases are primarily due to the impact of the crd acquisition, technology infrastructure investments and business volumes, partially offset by savings from resource discipline initiatives and process re-engineering benefits through our expense savings program. total expenses contributed by crd in 2019 were approximately $201 million. in addition, crd-related expenses in 2019 include $65 million in amortization of other intangible assets. additional information about expenses is provided under "expenses" in "consolidated results of operations" included in this management's discussion and analysis.

management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations expenses total expenses for investment management decreased 1% in 2019 compared to 2018, primarily due to savings from resource discipline initiatives and process re-engineering benefits through our expense savings program.
additional information about expenses is provided under "expenses" in "consolidated results of operations" included in this management's discussion and analysis.
financial condition the structure of our consolidated statement of condition is primarily driven by the liabilities generated by our investment servicing and investment management lines of business. our clients' needs and our operating objectives determine balance sheet volume, mix and currency denomination. as our clients execute their worldwide cash management and investment activities, they utilize deposits and short-term investments that constitute the majority of our liabilities. these liabilities are generally in the form of interest-bearing transaction account deposits, which are denominated in a variety of currencies; non-interest-bearing demand deposits; and repurchase agreements, which generally serve as short-term investment alternatives for our clients.
deposits and other liabilities resulting from client initiated transactions are invested in assets that generally have contractual maturities significantly longer than our liabilities; however, we evaluate the operational nature of our deposits and seek to maintain appropriate short-term liquidity of those liabilities that are not operational in nature and maintain longer-termed assets for our operational deposits. our assets consist primarily of securities held in our afs or htm portfolios and short-duration financial instruments, such as interest-bearing deposits with banks and securities purchased under resale agreements. the actual mix of assets is determined by the characteristics of the client liabilities and our desire to maintain a well-diversified portfolio of high-quality assets.

we manage our investment securities portfolio to align with the interest rate and duration characteristics of our client liabilities and in the context of the overall structure of our consolidated statement of condition, in consideration of the global interest rate environment. we consider a well-diversified, high-credit quality investment securities portfolio to be an important element in the management of our consolidated statement of condition.
average duration of our investment securities portfolio was 2.7 years and 3.1 years as of december 31, 2019 and december 31, 2018, respectively. the decrease in securities duration is primarily driven by the impact of lower long-end u.s. interest rates shortening the duration of mortgage backed securities.
approximately 90% of the carrying value of the portfolio was rated "aaa" or "aa" as of both december 31, 2019 and december 31, 2018.

management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations impairment impairment exists when the fair value of an individual security is below its amortized cost basis. impairment of a security is further assessed to determine whether such impairment is other-than-temporary. for afs and htm debt securities, we record impairment in our consolidated statement of income when management intends to sell (or may be required to sell) the securities before they recover in value, or when management expects the present value of cash flows expected to be collected from the securities to be less than the amortized cost of the impaired security (a credit loss).
we conduct periodic reviews of individual securities to assess whether otti exists. our assessment of otti involves an evaluation of economic and security-specific factors. such factors are based on estimates, derived by management, which contemplate current market conditions and security-specific performance. to the extent that market conditions are worse than management's expectations or due to idiosyncratic bond performance, otti could increase, in particular the credit-related component that would be recorded in our consolidated statement of income. additional information with respect to otti, net impairment losses and gross unrealized losses is provided in note 3 to the consolidated financial statements in this form 10-k.
our evaluation of potential otti of structured credit securities with collateral in the u.k. and continental europe takes into account the outcome from the brexit referendum and other geopolitical events, and assumes no disruption of payments on these securities.

(4) as of december 31, 2019, floating rate loans totaled $24,289 million and fixed rate loans totaled $2,020 million.
the decrease in domestic loans in the commercial and financial segment as of december 31, 2019 compared to december 31, 2018 was primarily driven by a decrease in loans to investment funds and senior secured loans. the increase in foreign loans in the same period was primarily driven by an increase in loans to investment funds and senior secured loans.
as of december 31, 2019 and december 31, 2018, our investment in senior secured loans, otherwise known as leveraged loans, totaled approximately $4.46 billion and $4.42 billion, respectively. in addition, we had binding unfunded commitments as of december 31, 2019 and december 31, 2018 of $176 million and $238 million, respectively, to participate in such syndications. additional information about these unfunded commitments is provided in note 12 to the consolidated financial statements in this form 10-k.
these senior secured loans, which are primarily rated "speculative" under our internal risk-rating framework (refer to note 4 to the consolidated financial statements in this form 10-k), are externally rated "bbb," "bb" or "b," with approximately 86% and 90% of the loans rated "bb" or "b" as of december 31, 2019 and december 31, 2018, respectively. our investment strategy involves generally limiting our investment to larger, more liquid credits underwritten by major global financial institutions, applying our internal credit analysis process to each potential investment and diversifying our exposure by counterparty and industry segment. however, these loans have significant exposure to credit losses relative to higher-rated loans in our portfolio.
additional information about all of our loan segments, as well as underlying classes, is provided in note 4 to the consolidated financial statements in this form 10-k.
no loans were modified in troubled debt restructurings as of both december 31, 2019 and december 31, 2018.

we recorded a provision for loan losses of $10 million in 2019 compared to $15 million in 2018 and $2 million in 2017.
as of december 31, 2019, approximately $61 million of our allowance for loan and lease losses (alll) was related to senior secured loans included in the commercial and financial segment compared to $60 million as of december 31, 2018. as this portfolio grows and matures, our alll related to these loans may increase through additional provisions for credit losses. the remaining $13 million and $7 million as of december 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, was related to other components of commercial and financial loans.
cross-border outstandings cross-border outstandings are amounts payable to us by non-u.s. counterparties which are denominated in u.s. dollars or other non-local currency, as well as non-u.s. local currency claims not funded by local currency liabilities. our cross-border outstandings consist primarily of deposits with banks; loans and lease financing, including short-duration advances; investment securities; amounts related to fx and interest rate contracts; and securities finance.  in addition to credit risk, cross-border outstandings have the risk that, as a result of political or economic conditions in a country, borrowers may be unable to meet their contractual repayment obligations of principal and/or interest when due because of the unavailability of, or restrictions on, fx needed by borrowers to repay their obligations.
as market and economic conditions change, the major independent credit rating agencies may downgrade u.s. and non-u.s. financial institutions and sovereign issuers which have been, and may in the future be, significant counterparties to us, or whose financial instruments serve as collateral on which we rely for credit risk mitigation purposes, and may do so again in the future. as a result, we may be exposed to increased counterparty risk, leading to negative ratings volatility.
the cross-border outstandings presented in table 30: cross-border outstandings, represented approximately 28% of our consolidated total assets as of both december 31, 2019 and december 31, 2018.
(1) cross-border outstandings included countries in which we do business, and which amounted to at least 1% of our consolidated total assets as of the dates indicated.
as of december 31, 2019, aggregate cross-border outstandings in the netherlands amounted to between 0.75% and 1% of our consolidated assets, at approximately $1.89 billion. as of both december 31, 2018 and december 31, 2017, there were no countries whose aggregate cross-border outstandings amounted to between 0.75% and 1% of our consolidated assets.
management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations risk management general in the normal course of our global business activities, we are exposed to a variety of risks, some inherent in the financial services industry, others more specific to our business activities. our risk management framework focuses on material risks, which include the following:
•   credit and counterparty risk;
•   liquidity risk, funding and management;
•   operational risk;
•   information technology risk;
•   market risk associated with our trading activities;
•   market risk associated with our non-trading activities, which we refer to as asset-and-liability management, and which consists primarily of interest rate risk;
•   strategic risk;
•   model risk; and
•   reputational, fiduciary and business conduct risk.
many of these risks, as well as certain factors underlying each of these risks that could affect our businesses and our consolidated financial statements, are discussed in detail under "risk factors" in this form 10-k.
the scope of our business requires that we balance these risks with a comprehensive and well-integrated risk management function. the identification, assessment, monitoring, mitigation and reporting of risks are essential to our financial performance and successful management of our businesses. these risks, if not effectively managed, can result in losses to us as well as erosion of our capital and damage to our reputation. our approach, including board and senior management oversight and a system of policies, procedures, limits, risk measurement and monitoring and internal controls, allows for an assessment of risks within a framework for evaluating opportunities for the prudent use of capital that appropriately balances risk and return.
our objective is to optimize our return while operating at a prudent level of risk. in support of this objective, we have instituted a risk appetite framework that aligns our business strategy and financial objectives with the level of risk that we are willing to incur.
our risk management is based on the following major goals:
•   a culture of risk awareness that extends across all of our business activities;
•   the identification, classification and quantification of our material risks;
•   the establishment of our risk appetite and associated limits and policies, and our compliance with these limits;
•   the establishment of a risk management structure at the "top of the house" that enables the control and coordination of risk-taking across the business lines;
•   the implementation of stress testing practices and a dynamic risk-assessment capability;
•   a direct link between risk and strategic-decision making processes and incentive compensation practices; and
•   the overall flexibility to adapt to the ever-changing business and market conditions.
our risk appetite framework outlines the quantitative limits and qualitative goals that define our risk appetite, as well as the responsibilities for measuring and monitoring risk against limits, and for reporting, escalating, approving and addressing exceptions. our risk appetite framework is established by erm, a corporate risk oversight group, in conjunction with the mrac and the rc of the board. the board formally reviews and approves our risk appetite statement annually, or more frequently as required.
the risk appetite framework describes the level and types of risk that we are willing to accommodate in executing our business strategy, and also serves as a guide in setting risk limits across our business units. in addition to our risk appetite framework, we use stress testing as another important tool in our risk management practice. additional information with respect to our stress testing process and practices is provided under "capital" in this management's discussion and analysis.
governance and structure we have an approach to risk management that involves all levels of management, from the board and its committees, including its e&a committee, rc, the hrc and tops, to each business unit and each employee. we allocate responsibility for risk oversight so that risk/return decisions are made at an appropriate level, and are subject to robust and effective review and challenge. risk management is the responsibility of each employee, and is implemented through three lines of defense: the business units, which own and manage the risks inherent in their business, are considered the first line of defense; erm and other support functions, such as compliance, finance and vendor management, provide the second line of defense; and corporate audit, which assesses the effectiveness of the first two lines of defense.
management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the responsibilities for effective review and challenge reside with senior managers, management oversight committees, corporate audit and, ultimately, the board and its committees. while we believe that our risk management program is effective in managing the risks in our businesses, internal and external factors may create risks that cannot always be identified or anticipated.
corporate-level risk committees provide focused oversight, and establish corporate standards and policies for specific risks, including credit, sovereign exposure, market, liquidity, operational, information technology as well as new business products, regulatory compliance and ethics, vendor risk and model risks. these committees have been delegated the responsibility to develop recommendations and remediation strategies to address issues that affect or have the potential to affect us.
we maintain a risk governance committee structure which serves as the formal governance mechanism through which we seek to undertake the consistent identification, management and mitigation of various risks facing us in connection with its business activities. this governance structure is enhanced and integrated through multi-disciplinary involvement, particularly through erm. the following chart presents this structure.

management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the chief risk officer (cro) is responsible for our risk management globally, leads erm and has a dual reporting line to our ceo and the board's rc. erm manages its responsibilities globally through a three-dimensional organization structure:
•   "vertical" business unit-aligned risk groups that support business managers with risk management, measurement and monitoring activities;
•   "horizontal" risk groups that monitor the risks that cross all of our business units (for example, credit and operational risk); and
•   risk oversight for international activities, which combines intersecting "verticals" and "horizontals" through a hub and spoke model to provide important regional and legal entity perspectives to the global risk framework.
sitting on top of this three-dimensional organization structure is a centralized group responsible for the aggregation of risk exposures across the vertical, horizontal and regional dimensions, for consolidated reporting, for setting the corporate-level risk appetite framework and associated limits and policies, and for dynamic risk assessment across our business.
board committees the board has four committees which assist it in discharging its responsibilities with respect to risk management: the rc, the e&a committee, the hrc and the tops.
the rc is responsible for oversight related to the operation of our global risk management framework, including policies and procedures establishing risk management governance and processes and risk control infrastructure for our global operations. the rc is responsible for reviewing and discussing with management our assessment and management of all risks applicable to our operations, including credit, market, interest rate, liquidity, operational, regulatory, technology, business, compliance and reputation risks, and related policies.
in addition, the rc provides oversight of capital policies, capital planning and balance sheet management, resolution planning and monitors capital adequacy in relation to risk. the rc is also responsible for discharging the duties and obligations of the board under applicable basel and other regulatory requirements.
the e&a committee oversees management's operation of our comprehensive system of internal controls covering the integrity of our consolidated financial statements and reports, compliance with laws, regulations and corporate policies. the e&a committee acts on behalf of the board in monitoring and overseeing the performance of corporate audit and in reviewing certain communications with banking regulators. the e&a committee has direct responsibility for the appointment, compensation, retention, evaluation and oversight of the work of our independent registered public accounting firm, including sole authority for the establishment of pre-approval policies and procedures for all audit engagements and any non-audit engagements.
the hrc has direct responsibility for the oversight of human capital management, all compensation plans, policies and programs in which executive officers participate and incentive, retirement, welfare as well as equity plans in which certain of our other employees participate. in addition, the hrc oversees the alignment of our incentive compensation arrangements with our safety and soundness, including the integration of risk management objectives, and related policies, arrangements and control processes consistent with applicable related regulatory rules and guidance.
the tops leads and assists in the board's oversight of technology and operational risk management and the role of these risks in executing our strategy and supporting our global business requirements. the tops reviews strategic initiatives from a technology and operational risk perspective and reviews and approves technology-related risk matters. in addition, tops reviews matters related to corporate information security and cyber-security programs, business continuity and technology resiliency, data and access management and third-party risk management.
executive management committees mrac is the senior management decision-making body for risk and capital issues, and oversees our financial risks, our consolidated statement of condition, and our capital adequacy, liquidity and recovery and resolution planning. its responsibilities include:
•   the approval of the policies of our global risk, capital and liquidity management frameworks, including our risk appetite framework;
•   the monitoring and assessment of our capital adequacy based on internal policies and regulatory requirements;
•   the oversight of our firm-wide risk identification, model risk governance, stress testing and recovery and resolution plan programs; and
•   the ongoing monitoring and review of risks undertaken within the businesses, and our senior management oversight and approval of risk strategies and tactics.
mrac, is co-chaired by our cro and chief financial officer, who regularly present to the rc on developments in the risk environment and performance trends in our key business areas.

credit risk management core policies and principles we define credit risk as the risk of financial loss if a counterparty, borrower or obligor, collectively referred to as a counterparty, is either unable or unwilling to repay borrowings or settle a transaction in accordance with underlying contractual terms. we assume credit risk in our traditional non-trading lending activities, such as loans and contingent commitments, in our investment securities portfolio, where recourse to a counterparty exists, and in our direct and indirect trading activities, such as principal securities lending and foreign exchange and indemnified agency securities lending. we also assume credit risk in our day-to-day treasury and securities and other settlement operations, in the form of deposit placements and other cash balances, with central banks or private sector institutions.
we distinguish between three major types of credit risk:
•   default risk - the risk that a counterparty fails to meet its contractual payment obligations;
•   country risk - the risk that we may suffer a loss, in any given country, due to any of the following reasons: deterioration of economic conditions, political and social upheaval, nationalization and appropriation of assets, government repudiation of indebtedness, exchange controls and disruptive currency depreciation or devaluation; and
•   settlement risk - the risk that the settlement or clearance of transactions will fail, which arises whenever the exchange of cash, securities and/or other assets is not simultaneous.
the acceptance of credit risk by us is governed by corporate policies and guidelines, which include standardized procedures applied across the entire organization. these policies and guidelines include specific requirements related to each counterparty's risk profile; the markets served; counterparty, industry and country concentrations; and regulatory compliance. these policies and procedures also implement a number of core principles, which include the following:
•   we measure and consolidate credit risks to each counterparty, or group of counterparties, in accordance with a "one-obligor" principle that aggregates risks across our business units;
•   erm reviews and approves all extensions of credit, or material changes to extensions of credit (such as changes in term, collateral structure or covenants), in accordance with assigned credit-approval authorities;
•   credit-approval authorities are assigned to individuals according to their qualifications, experience and training, and these authorities are periodically reviewed. our largest exposures require approval by the credit committee, a sub-committee of the crpc.
management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations with respect to small and low-risk extensions of credit to certain types of counterparties, approval authority is granted to individuals outside of erm;
•   we seek to avoid or limit undue concentrations of risk. counterparty (or groups of counterparties), industry, country and product-specific concentrations of risk are subject to frequent review and approval in accordance with our risk appetite;
•   we determine the creditworthiness of counterparties through a risk assessment, including the use of internal risk-rating methodologies;
•   we seek to review all extensions of credit and the creditworthiness of counterparties at least annually. the nature and extent of these reviews are determined by the size, nature and term of the extensions of credit and the creditworthiness of the counterparty; and
•   we subject all corporate policies and guidelines to annual review as an integral part of our periodic assessment of our risk appetite.
our corporate policies and guidelines require that the business units which engage in activities that give rise to credit and counterparty risk comply with procedures that promote the extension of credit for legitimate business purposes; are consistent with the maintenance of proper credit standards; limit credit-related losses; and are consistent with our goal of maintaining a strong financial condition.
structure and organization the credit and global markets risk group within erm is responsible for the assessment, approval and monitoring of credit risk across our business. the group is managed centrally, has dedicated teams in a number of locations worldwide across our businesses, and is responsible for related policies and procedures, and for our internal credit-rating systems and methodologies. in addition, the group, in conjunction with the business units, establishes measurements and limits to control the amount of credit risk accepted across its various business activities, both at the portfolio level and for each individual counterparty or group of counterparties, to individual industries, and also to counterparties by product and country of risk. these measurements and limits are reviewed periodically, but at least annually.
in conjunction with other groups in erm, the credit and global markets risk group is jointly responsible for the design, implementation and oversight of our credit risk measurement and management systems, including data and assessment systems, quantification systems and the reporting framework.
various key committees are responsible for the oversight of credit risk and associated credit risk policies, systems and models. all credit-related activities are governed by our risk appetite framework and our credit risk guidelines, which define our general philosophy with respect to credit risk and the manner in which we control, manage and monitor such risks.
the previously described crpc (refer to "risk committees") has primary responsibility for the oversight, review and approval of the credit risk guidelines and policies. credit risk guidelines and policies are reviewed periodically, but at least annually.
the credit committee, a sub-committee of the crpc, has responsibility for assigning credit authority and approving the largest and higher-risk extensions of credit to individual counterparties or groups of counterparties.
credit ratings we perform initial and ongoing reviews to exercise due diligence on the creditworthiness of our counterparties when conducting any business with them or approving any credit limits.
this due diligence process generally includes the assignment of an internal credit rating, which is determined by the use of internally developed and validated methodologies, scorecards and a 15-grade rating scale. this risk-rating process incorporates the use of risk-rating tools in conjunction with management judgment; qualitative and quantitative inputs are captured in a replicable manner and, following a formal review and approval process, an internal credit rating based on our rating scale is assigned. credit ratings are reviewed and approved by the credit and global markets risk group or designees within erm. to facilitate comparability across the portfolio, counterparties within a given sector are rated using a risk-rating tool developed for that sector.
our risk-rating methodologies are approved by the crpc, after completion of internal model validation processes, and are subject to an annual review, including re-validation.
we generally rate our counterparties individually, although accounts defined by us as low-risk are rated on a pooled basis. we evaluate and rate the credit risk of our counterparties on an ongoing basis.
risk parameter estimates our internal risk-rating system seeks to promote a clear and consistent approach to the determination of appropriate credit risk classifications for our credit counterparties and exposures, tracking the changes in risk associated with these counterparties and exposures over time. this capability enhances our ability to more accurately calculate both risk exposures and capital, enabling better strategic decision making across the organization.
management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations we use credit risk parameter estimates for the following purposes:
•   the assessment of the creditworthiness of new counterparties and, in conjunction with our risk appetite statement, the development of appropriate credit limits for our products and services, including loans, foreign exchange, securities finance, placements and repurchase agreements;
•   the use of an automated process for limit approvals for certain low-risk counterparties, as defined in our credit risk guidelines, based on the counterparty's probability-of-default, or pd, rating class;
•   the development of approval authority matrices based on pd; riskier counterparties with higher ratings require higher levels of approval for a comparable pd and limit size compared to less risky counterparties with lower ratings;
•   the analysis of risk concentration trends using historical pd and exposure-at-default, or ead, data;
•   the standardization of rating integrity testing by gcr using rating parameters;
•   the determination of the level of management review of short-duration advances depending on pd; riskier counterparties with higher rating class values generally trigger higher levels of management escalation for comparable short-duration advances compared to less risky counterparties with lower rating-class values;
•   the monitoring of credit facility utilization levels using ead values and the identification of instances where counterparties have exceeded limits;
•   the aggregation and comparison of counterparty exposures with risk appetite levels to determine if businesses are maintaining appropriate risk levels; and
•   the determination of our regulatory capital requirements for the airb provided in the basel framework.
credit risk mitigation we seek to limit our credit exposure and reduce our potential credit losses through various types of risk mitigation. in our day-to-day management of credit risks, we utilize and recognize the following types of risk mitigation.
collateral in many parts of our business, we regularly require or agree for collateral to be received from or provided to clients and counterparties in connection with contracts that incur credit risk. in our trading businesses, this collateral is typically in the form of cash and highly-rated securities (government securities and other bonds or equity securities). credit risks in our non-trading and securities finance businesses are also often secured by bonds and equity securities and by other types of assets. collateral serves to reduce the risk of loss inherent in an exposure by improving the prospect of recovery in the event of a counterparty default. however, rapidly changing market values of the collateral we hold, unexpected increases in the credit exposure to a client or counterparty, reductions in the value or change in the type of securities held by us, as well as operational errors or errors in the manner in which we seek to exercise our rights, may reduce the risk mitigation effects of collateral or result in other security interests not being effective to reduce potential credit exposure. while collateral is often an alternative source of repayment, it generally does not replace the requirement within our policies and guidelines for high-quality underwriting standards. we also may choose to incur credit exposure without the benefit of collateral or other risk mitigating credits rights.
our credit risk guidelines require that the collateral we accept for risk mitigation purposes is of high quality, can be reliably valued and can be liquidated if or when required. generally, when collateral is of lower quality, more difficult to value or more challenging to liquidate, higher discounts to market values are applied for the purposes of measuring credit risk. for certain less liquid collateral, longer liquidation periods are assumed when determining the credit exposure.
all types of collateral are assessed regularly by erm, as is the basis on which the collateral is valued. our assessment of collateral, including the ability to liquidate collateral in the event of a counterparty default, and also with regard to market values of collateral under a variety of hypothetical market conditions, is an integral component of our assessment of risk and approval of credit limits. we also seek to identify, limit and monitor instances of "wrong-way" risk, where a counterparty's risk of default is positively correlated with the risk of our collateral eroding in value.
we maintain policies and procedures requiring that documentation used to collateralize a transaction is legal, valid, binding and enforceable in the relevant jurisdictions. we also conduct legal reviews to assess whether our documentation meets these standards on an ongoing basis.
netting netting is a mechanism that allows institutions and counterparties to net offsetting exposures and payment obligations against one another through the use of qualifying master netting agreements. a master netting agreement allows the netting of rights and obligations arising under derivative or other transactions that have state street corporation |
management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations been entered into under such an agreement upon the counterparty's default, resulting in a single net claim owed by, or to, the counterparty. this is commonly referred to as "close-out netting," and is pursued wherever possible. we may also enter into master agreements that allow for the netting of amounts payable on a given day and in the same currency, reducing our settlement risk. this is commonly referred to as "payment netting," and is widely used in our foreign exchange activities.
as with collateral, we have policies and procedures in place to apply close-out and payment netting only to the extent that we have verified legal validity and enforceability of the master agreement. in the case of payment netting, operational constraints may preclude us from reducing settlement risk, notwithstanding the legal right to require the same under the master netting agreement. in the event we become unable, due to operational constraints, actions by regulators, changes in accounting principles, law or regulation (or related interpretations) or other factors, to net some or all of our offsetting exposures and payment obligations under those agreements, we would be required to gross up our assets and liabilities on our statement of condition and our calculation of rwa, accordingly.  this would result in a potentially material increase in our regulatory ratios, including lcr, and present increased credit, liquidity, asset-and-liability management and operational risks, some of which could be material.
guarantees a guarantee is a financial instrument that results in credit support being provided by a third party, (i.e., the protection provider) to the underlying obligor (the beneficiary of the provided protection) on account of an exposure owing by the obligor. the protection provider may support the underlying exposure either in whole or in part. support of this kind may take different forms. typical forms of guarantees provided to us include financial guarantees, letters of credit, bankers' acceptances, purchase undertaking agreements contracts and insurance.
we have established a review process to evaluate guarantees under the applicable requirements of our policies and basel iii requirements. governance for this evaluation is covered under policies and procedures that require regular reviews of documentation, jurisdictions and credit quality of protection providers.
pursuant to the basel iii rule, we are permitted to reflect the application of credit risk mitigation which may include, for example, guarantees, collateral, netting, secured interests in non-financial assets and credit default swaps. we do not actively use credit default swaps as a risk mitigation tool, although it increasingly applies the recognition of guarantees, collateral and security over non-financial assets to mitigate overall risk within its counterparty credit portfolio.
credit limits central to our philosophy for our management of credit risk is the approval and imposition of credit limits, against which we monitor the actual and potential future credit exposure arising from our business activities with counterparties or groups of counterparties. credit limits are a reflection of our risk appetite, which may be determined by the creditworthiness of the counterparty, the nature of the risk inherent in the business undertaken with the counterparty, or a combination of relevant credit factors. our risk appetite for certain sectors and certain countries and geographic regions may also influence the level of risk we are willing to assume to certain counterparties.
the analysis and approval of credit limits is undertaken in a consistent manner across our businesses, although the nature and extent of the analysis may vary, based on the type, term and magnitude of the risk being assumed. credit limits and underlying exposures are assessed and measured on both a gross and net basis where appropriate, with net exposure determined by deducting the value of any collateral held. for certain types of risk being assumed, we will also assess and measure exposures under a variety of hypothetical market conditions. credit limit approvals across our business are undertaken by the credit and global markets risk group, by individuals to whom credit authority has been delegated, or by the credit committee.
credit limits are re-evaluated annually, or more frequently as needed, and are revised periodically on prevailing and anticipated market conditions, changes in counterparty or country-specific credit ratings and outlook, changes in our risk appetite for certain counterparties, sectors or countries, and enhancements to the measurement of credit utilization.
reporting ongoing active monitoring and management of our credit risk is an integral part of our credit risk management framework. we maintain management information systems to identify, measure, monitor and report credit risk across businesses and legal entities, enabling erm and our businesses to have timely access to accurate information on credit limits and exposures. monitoring is performed along the dimensions of counterparty, industry, country and product-specific risks to facilitate the identification of concentrations of risk and emerging trends.
key aspects of this credit risk reporting structure include governance and oversight groups, policies that define standards for the reporting of credit risk, data aggregation and sourcing systems and separate testing of relevant risk reporting functions by corporate audit.
management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the credit portfolio management group routinely assesses the composition of our overall credit risk portfolio for alignment with our stated risk appetite. this assessment includes routine analysis and reporting of the portfolio, monitoring of market-based indicators, the assessment of industry trends and developments and regular reviews of concentrated risks. the credit portfolio management group is also responsible, in conjunction with the business units, for defining the appetite for credit risk in the major sectors in which we have a concentration of business activities. these sector-level risk appetite statements, which include counterparty selection criteria and granular underwriting guidelines, are reviewed periodically and approved by the crpc.
monitoring regular surveillance of credit and counterparty risks is undertaken by our business units, the credit and global markets risk group and designees with erm, allowing for frequent and extensive oversight. this surveillance process includes, but is not limited to, the following components:
•   annual reviews. a formal review of counterparties is conducted at least annually and includes a thorough review of operating performance, primary risk factors and our internal credit risk rating. this annual review also includes a review of current and proposed credit limits, an assessment of our ongoing risk appetite and verification that supporting legal documentation remains effective.
•   interim monitoring. periodic monitoring of our largest and riskiest counterparties is undertaken more frequently, utilizing financial information, market indicators and other relevant credit and performance measures. the nature and extent of this interim monitoring is individually tailored to certain counterparties and/or industry sectors to identify material changes to the risk profile of a counterparty (or group of counterparties) and assign an updated internal risk rating in a timely manner.
we maintain an active "watch list" for all counterparties where we have identified a concern that the actual or potential risk of default has increased. the watch list status denotes a concern with some aspect of a counterparty's risk profile that warrants closer monitoring of the counterparty's financial performance and related risk factors. our ongoing monitoring processes are designed to facilitate the early identification of counterparties whose creditworthiness is deteriorating; any counterparty may be placed on the watch list by erm at its sole discretion.
counterparties that receive an internal risk rating within a certain range on our rating scale are eligible for watch list designation. these risk ratings generally correspond with the non-investment grade or near non-investment grade ratings established by the major independent credit-rating agencies, and also include the regulatory classifications of "special mention," "substandard," "doubtful" and "loss." counterparties whose internal ratings are outside this range may also be placed on the watch list.
the credit and global markets risk group maintains primary responsibility for our watch list processes, and generates a monthly report of all watch list counterparties. the watch list is formally reviewed at least on a quarterly basis, with participation from senior erm staff, and representatives from the business units and our corporate finance and legal groups as appropriate. these meetings include a review of individual watch list counterparties, together with credit limits and prevailing exposures, and are focused on actions to contain, reduce or eliminate the risk of loss to us. identified actions are documented and monitored.
controls gcr provides a separate level of surveillance and oversight over the integrity of our credit risk management processes, including the internal risk-rating system. gcr reviews counterparty credit ratings for all identified sectors on an ongoing basis. gcr is subject to oversight by the crpc, and provides periodic updates to the board's rc.
specific activities of gcr include the following:
•   perform separate and objective assessments of our credit and counterparty exposures to determine the nature and extent of risk undertaken by the business units;
•   execute periodic credit process and credit product reviews to assess the quality of credit analysis, compliance with policies, guidelines and relevant regulation, transaction structures and underwriting standards, and risk-rating integrity;
•   identify and monitor developing counterparty, market and/or industry sector trends to limit risk of loss and protect capital;
•   deliver regular and formal reporting to stakeholders, including exam results, identified issues and the status of requisite actions to remedy identified deficiencies;
•   allocate resources for specialized risk assessments (on an as-needed basis); and
•   liaise with assurance partners and regulatory personnel on matters relating to risk rating, reporting and measurement.
management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations reserve for credit losses we maintain an allowance for loan and lease losses to support our on-balance sheet credit exposures. we also maintain a reserve for unfunded commitments and letters of credit to support our off-balance credit exposure. the two components together represent the reserve for credit losses. review and evaluation of the adequacy of the reserve for credit losses is ongoing throughout the year, but occurs at least quarterly, and is based, among other factors, on our evaluation of the level of risk in the portfolio, the volume of adversely classified loans, previous loss experience, current trends, and economic conditions and their effect on our counterparties. additional information about the allowance for loan losses is provided in note 4 to the consolidated financial statements in this form 10-k.
liquidity risk management our liquidity framework contemplates areas of potential risk based on our activities, size and other appropriate risk-related factors. in managing liquidity risk we employ limits, maintain established metrics and early warning indicators and perform routine stress testing to identify potential liquidity needs. this process involves the evaluation of a combination of internal and external scenarios which assist us in measuring our liquidity position and in identifying potential increases in cash needs or decreases in available sources of cash, as well as the potential impairment of our ability to access the global capital markets.
we manage our liquidity on a global, consolidated basis. we also manage liquidity on a stand-alone basis at our parent company, as well as at certain branches and subsidiaries of state street bank. state street bank generally has access to markets and funding sources limited to banks, such as the federal funds market and the federal reserve's discount window. the parent company is managed to a more conservative liquidity profile, reflecting narrower market access. additionally, the parent company typically holds, or has direct access to, primarily through ssif (a direct subsidiary of the parent company), as discussed in "supervision and regulation" in business in this form 10-k, enough cash to meet its current debt maturities and cash needs, as well as those projected over the next one-year period. absent financial distress at the parent company, the liquid assets available at ssif continue to be available to the parent company. as of december 31, 2019, the value of our parent company's net liquid assets totaled $428 million, compared with $486 million as of december 31, 2018, which amount does not include available liquidity through ssif. as of december 31, 2019, our parent company and state street bank had approximately $1.7 billion of senior notes or subordinated debentures outstanding that will mature in the next twelve months.
as a sifi, our liquidity risk management activities are subject to heightened and evolving regulatory requirements, including interpretations of those requirements, under specific u.s. and international regulations and also resulting from published and unpublished guidance, supervisory activities, such as stress tests, resolution planning, examinations and other regulatory interactions. satisfaction of these requirements could, in some cases, result in changes in the composition of our investment portfolio, reduced nii or nim, a reduction in the level of certain business activities or modifications to the way in which we deliver our products and services. if we fail to meet regulatory requirements to the satisfaction of our regulators, we could receive negative regulatory stress test results, incur a resolution plan deficiency or determination of a non-credible resolution plan or otherwise receive an adverse regulatory finding. our efforts to satisfy, or our failure to satisfy, these regulatory requirements could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.
governance global treasury is responsible for our management of liquidity. this includes the day-to-day management of our global liquidity position, the development and monitoring of early warning indicators, key liquidity risk metrics, the creation and execution of stress tests, the evaluation and implementation of regulatory requirements, the maintenance and execution of our liquidity guidelines and contingency funding plan (cfp), and routine management reporting to alco, mrac and the board's rc.
global treasury risk management, part of erm, provides separate oversight over the identification, communication and management of global treasury's risks in support of our business strategy. global treasury risk management reports to the cro. global treasury risk management's responsibilities relative to liquidity risk management include the development and review of policies and guidelines; the monitoring of limits related to adherence to the liquidity risk guidelines and associated reporting.
management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity framework our liquidity framework contemplates areas of potential risk based on our activities, size and other appropriate risk-related factors. in managing liquidity risk we employ limits, maintain established metrics and early warning indicators, and perform routine stress testing to identify potential liquidity needs. this process involves the evaluation of a combination of internal and external scenarios which assist us in measuring our liquidity position and in identifying potential increases in cash needs or decreases in available sources of cash, as well as the potential impairment of our ability to access the global capital markets.
we manage liquidity according to several principles that are equally important to our overall liquidity risk management framework:
•   structural liquidity management addresses liquidity by monitoring and directing the composition of our consolidated statement of condition. structural liquidity is measured by metrics such as the percentage of total wholesale funds to consolidated total assets, and the percentage of non-government investment securities to client deposits. in addition, on a regular basis and as described below, our structural liquidity is evaluated under various stress scenarios.
•   tactical liquidity management addresses our day-to-day funding requirements and is largely driven by changes in our primary source of funding, which are client deposits. fluctuations in client deposits may be supplemented with short-term borrowings, repurchase agreements, fhlb products and certificates of deposit.
•   stress testing and contingent funding planning are longer-term strategic liquidity risk management practices. regular and ad hoc liquidity stress testing are performed under various severe but plausible scenarios at the consolidated level and at significant subsidiaries, including state street bank. these tests contemplate severe market and events specific to us under various time horizons and severities. tests contemplate the impact of material changes in key funding sources, credit ratings, additional collateral requirements, contingent uses of funding, systemic shocks to the financial markets and operational failures based on market and assumptions specific to us. the stress tests evaluate the required level of funding versus available sources in an adverse environment. as stress testing contemplates potential forward-looking scenarios, results also serve as a trigger to activate specific liquidity stress levels and contingent funding actions.
cfps are designed to assist senior management with decision-making associated with any contingency funding response to a possible or actual crisis scenario. the cfps define roles, responsibilities and management actions to be taken in the event of deterioration of our liquidity profile caused by either an event specific to us or a broader disruption in the capital markets. specific actions are linked to the level of stress indicated by these measures or by management judgment of market conditions.
liquidity risk metrics in managing our liquidity, we employ early warning indicators and metrics. early warning indicators are intended to detect situations which may result in a liquidity stress, including changes in our common stock price and the spread on our long-term debt. additional metrics that are critical to the management of our consolidated statement of condition and monitored as part of our routine liquidity management include measures of our fungible cash position, purchased wholesale funds, unencumbered liquid assets, deposits and the total of investment securities and loans as a percentage of total client deposits.
asset liquidity central to the management of our liquidity is asset liquidity, which consists primarily of hqla. hqla is the amount of liquid assets that qualify for inclusion in the lcr. as a banking organization, we are subject to a minimum lcr under the lcr rule approved by u.s. banking regulators. the lcr is intended to promote the short-term resilience of internationally active banking organizations, like us, to improve the banking industry's ability to absorb shocks arising from market stress over a 30 calendar day period and improve the measurement and management of liquidity risk. the lcr measures an institution's hqla against its net cash outflows. hqla primarily consists of unencumbered cash and certain high quality liquid securities that qualify for inclusion under the lcr rule. the lcr was fully implemented beginning on january 1, 2017. we report lcr to the federal reserve daily. for the quarters ended december 31, 2019 and december 31, 2018, daily average lcr for the parent company was 110% and 108%, respectively. the average hqla for the parent company under the lcr final rule definition was $100.23 billion and $91.67 billion, post-prescribed haircuts, for the quarters ended december 31, 2019 and december 31, 2018, respectively. the increase in average hqla for the quarter ended december 31, 2019, compared to the quarter ended december 31, 2018, was primarily a result of an increase in hqla purchases as part of the repositioning of the investment portfolio.
management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations we maintained average cash balances in excess of regulatory requirements governing deposits with the federal reserve of approximately $41.56 billion at the federal reserve, the ecb and other non-u.s. central banks as of december 31, 2019, compared to $44.17 billion as of december 31, 2018. the lower levels of average cash balances with central banks reflect an increase in the investment portfolio.
liquid securities carried in our asset liquidity include securities pledged without corresponding advances from the federal reserve bank of boston (frbb), the fhlb, and other non-u.s. central banks. state street bank is a member of the fhlb. this membership allows for advances of liquidity in varying terms against high-quality collateral, which helps facilitate asset-and-liability management. as of december 31, 2019, we had no outstanding borrowings from the fhlb. as of december 31, 2018, we had approximately $2 billion of outstanding borrowings from the fhlb.
access to primary, intra-day and contingent liquidity provided by these utilities is an important source of contingent liquidity with utilization subject to underlying conditions. as of december 31, 2019 and december 31, 2018, we had no outstanding primary credit borrowings from the frbb discount window or any other central bank facility.
in addition to the securities included in our asset liquidity, we have significant amounts of other unencumbered investment securities. these securities are available sources of liquidity, although not as rapidly deployed as those included in our asset liquidity.
the average fair value of total unencumbered securities was $76.94 billion for the quarter ended december 31, 2019, compared to $65.94 billion for the quarter ended december 31, 2018.
measures of liquidity include lcr and nsfr, which are described in "supervision and regulation" in business in this form 10-k.
uses of liquidity significant uses of our liquidity could result from the following: withdrawals of client deposits; draw-downs by our custody clients of lines of credit; advances to clients to settle securities transactions; or other permitted purposes. such circumstances would generally arise under stress conditions including deterioration in credit ratings. a recurring use of our liquidity involves our deployment of hqla from our investment portfolio to post collateral to financial institutions serving as sources of securities under our enhanced custody program.
we had unfunded commitments to extend credit with gross contractual amounts totaling $29.70 billion and $28.95 billion and standby letters of credit totaling $3.32 billion and $2.99 billion as of december 31, 2019
and december 31, 2018, respectively. these amounts do not reflect the value of any collateral. as of december 31, 2019, approximately 73% of our unfunded commitments to extend credit and 10% of our standby letters of credit expire within one year. since many of our commitments are expected to expire or renew without being drawn upon, the gross contractual amounts do not necessarily represent our future cash requirements.
information about our resolution planning and the impact actions under our resolution plans could have on our liquidity is provided in "supervision and regulation" in business in this form 10-k.
funding deposits we provide products and services including custody, accounting, administration, daily pricing, fx services, cash management, financial asset management, securities finance and investment advisory services. as a provider of these products and services, we generate client deposits, which have generally provided a stable, low-cost source of funds. as a global custodian, clients place deposits with our entities in various currencies. as of both december 31, 2019 and december 31, 2018, approximately 60% of our average total deposit balances were denominated in u.s. dollars, approximately 20% in eur, 10% in gbp and 10% in all other currencies.
short-term funding our on-balance sheet liquid assets are also an integral component of our liquidity management strategy. these assets provide liquidity through maturities of the assets, but more importantly, they provide us with the ability to raise funds by pledging the securities as collateral for borrowings or through outright sales. in addition, our access to the global capital markets gives us the ability to source incremental funding from wholesale investors. as discussed earlier under "asset liquidity," state street bank's membership in the fhlb allows for advances of liquidity with varying terms against high-quality collateral.
short-term secured funding also comes in the form of securities lent or sold under agreements to repurchase. these transactions are short-term in nature, generally overnight and are collateralized by high-quality investment securities. these balances were $1.10 billion and $1.08 billion as of december 31, 2019 and december 31, 2018, respectively.
management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations state street bank currently maintains a line of credit with a financial institution of cad $1.40 billion, or approximately $1.08 billion, as of december 31, 2019, to support its canadian securities processing operations. the line of credit has no stated termination date and is cancelable by either party with prior notice. as of both december 31, 2019 and december 31, 2018, there was no balance outstanding on this line of credit.
long-term funding we have the ability to issue debt and equity securities under our current universal shelf registration statement to meet current commitments and business needs, including accommodating the transaction and cash management needs of our clients. in addition, state street bank also has current authorization from the board to issue up to $5 billion in unsecured senior debt and an additional $500 million of subordinated debt.
on january 24, 2020, we issued $750 million aggregate principal amount of 2.400% senior notes due 2030 in a public offering.
agency credit ratings our ability to maintain consistent access to liquidity is fostered by the maintenance of high investment grade ratings as measured by the major independent credit rating agencies. factors essential to maintaining high credit ratings include:
•   relative market position;
•   strong risk management;
•   strong capital ratios;
•   diverse liquidity sources, including the global capital markets and client deposits;
•   preparedness for current or future regulatory developments.
•   increasing the potential market for our debt and improving our ability to offer products;
•   serving markets; and
a downgrade or reduction of our credit ratings could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity by restricting our ability to access the capital markets, which could increase the related cost of funds. in turn, this could cause the sudden and large-scale withdrawal of unsecured deposits by our clients, which could lead to draw-downs of unfunded commitments to extend credit or trigger requirements under securities purchase commitments; or require additional collateral or force terminations of certain trading derivative contracts.
a majority of our derivative contracts have been entered into under bilateral agreements with counterparties who may require us to post collateral or terminate the transactions based on changes in our credit ratings. we assess the impact of these arrangements by determining the collateral that would be required assuming a downgrade by all rating agencies. the additional collateral or termination payments related to our net derivative liabilities under these arrangements that could have been called by counterparties in the event of a downgrade in our credit ratings below levels specified in the agreements is provided in note 10 to the consolidated financial statements in this form 10-k. other funding sources, such as secured financing transactions and other margin requirements, for which there are no explicit triggers, could also be adversely affected.

operational risk management overview operational risk is the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, people and systems or from external events. operational risk encompasses fiduciary risk and legal risk. fiduciary risk is defined as the risk that we fail to properly exercise our fiduciary duties in our provision of products or services to clients. legal risk is the risk of loss resulting from failure to comply with laws and contractual obligations.
operational risk is inherent in the performance of investment servicing and investment management activities on behalf of our clients. whether it be fiduciary risk, risk associated with execution and processing or other types of operational risk, a consistent, transparent and effective operational risk framework is key to identifying, monitoring and managing operational risk.
management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations we have established an operational risk framework that is based on three major goals:
governance our board is responsible for the approval and oversight of our overall operational risk framework. it does so through its tops, which reviews our operational risk framework and approves our operational risk policy annually.
our operational risk policy establishes our approach to our management of operational risk across our business. the policy identifies the responsibilities of individuals and committees charged with oversight of the management of operational risk, and articulates a broad mandate that supports implementation of the operational risk framework.
erm and other control groups provide the oversight, validation and verification of the management and measurement of operational risk.
executive management actively manages and oversees our operational risk framework through membership on various risk management committees, including mrac, the bcrc, torc, the operational risk committee, the executive information security steering committee, business controls steering committee, compliance and ethics committee and the fiduciary review committee, all of which ultimately report to the appropriate committee of the board.
the operational risk committee, chaired by the global head of operational risk and co-chaired by the flod head of business controls, provides cross-business oversight of operational risk, operational risk programs and their implementation to identify, measure, manage and control operational risk in an effective and consistent manner and reviews and approves operational risk guidelines intended to maintain a consistent implementation of our corporate operational risk policy and framework.
ownership and accountability we have implemented our operational risk framework to support the broad mandate established by our operational risk policy. this framework represents an integrated set of processes and tools that assists us in the management and measurement of operational risk, including our calculation of required capital and rwa.
the framework takes a comprehensive view and integrates the methods and tools used to manage and measure operational risk. the framework utilizes aspects of the coso framework and other industry leading practices, and is designed foremost to address our risk management needs while complying with regulatory requirements. the operational risk framework is intended to provide a number of important benefits, including:
•   a common understanding of operational risk management and its supporting processes;
•   the clarification of responsibilities for the management of operational risk across our business;
•   the alignment of business priorities with risk management objectives;
•   the active management of risk and early identification of emerging risks;
•   the consistent application of policies and the collection of data for risk management and measurement; and
•   the estimation of our operational risk capital requirement.
the operational risk framework employs a distributed risk management infrastructure executed by erm groups aligned with the business units, which are responsible for the implementation of the operational risk framework at the business unit level.
as with other risks, senior business unit management is responsible for the day-to-day operational risk management of their respective businesses. it is business unit management's responsibility to provide oversight of the implementation and ongoing execution of the operational risk framework within their respective organizations, as well as coordination and communication with erm.
consistency and transparency a number of corporate control functions are directly responsible for implementing and assessing various aspects of our operational risk framework, with the overarching goal of consistency and transparency to meet the evolving needs of the business:
•   the global head of operational risk, a member of the cro's executive management team, leads erm's corporate orm group. orm is responsible for the strategy, evolution and consistent implementation of our operational risk guidelines, framework and supporting tools across our business. orm reviews and analyzes operational key risk information, events, metrics and indicators at the business unit and corporate level for purposes of risk management, reporting and escalation to the cro, senior management and governance committees;
•   erm's corporate risk analytics group develops and maintains operational risk capital estimation models, and orm's capital analysis group calculates our required capital for operational risk;
management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations
•   erm's mvg independently validates the quantitative models used to measure operational risk, and orm performs validation checks on the output of the model;
•   cis establishes the framework, policies and related programs to measure, monitor and report on information security risks, including the effectiveness of cyber-security program protections. cis defines and manages the enterprise-wide information security program. cis coordinates with information technology, control functions and business units to support the confidentiality, integrity and availability of corporate information assets. cis identifies and employs a risk-based methodology consistent with applicable regulatory cyber-security requirements and monitors the compliance of our systems with information security policies; and
•   corporate audit performs separate reviews of the application of operational risk management practices and methodologies utilized across our business.
our operational risk framework consists of five components, each described below, which provide a working structure that integrates distinct risk programs into a continuous process focused on managing and measuring operational risk in a coordinated and consistent manner.
risk identification and assessments the objective of risk identification and assessments is to understand business unit strategy, risk profile and potential exposures. it is achieved through a series of risk assessments across our business using techniques for the identification, assessment and measurement of risk across a spectrum of potential frequency and severity combinations. three primary risk assessment programs, which occur annually, augmented by other business-specific programs, are the core of this component:
•   the risk and control assessment program seeks to understand the risks associated with day-to-day activities, and the effectiveness of controls intended to manage potential exposures arising from these activities. these risks are typically frequent in nature but generally not severe in terms of exposure;
•   the material risk identification process utilizes a bottom-up approach to identify our most significant risk exposures across all on- and off-balance sheet risk-taking activities. the program is specifically designed to consider risks that could have a material impact irrespective of their likelihood or frequency. this can include risks that may have an impact on longer-term business objectives, such as significant change management activities or long-term strategic initiatives;
•   the scenario analysis program focuses on the set of risks with the highest severity and most relevance from a capital perspective. these are generally referred to as "tail risks," and serve as important benchmarks for our loss distribution approach model (see below); they also provide inputs into stress testing; and
•   business-specific programs to identify, assess and measure risk, including new business and product review and approval, new client screening, and, as deemed appropriate, targeted risk assessments.
capital analysis the primary measurement tool used is an internally developed loss distribution approach (lda) model. we use the lda model to quantify required operational risk capital, from which we calculate rwa related to operational risk. such required capital and rwa totaled $3.84 billion and $47.96 billion, respectively, as of december 31, 2019, compared to $3.68 billion and $46.06 billion, respectively, as of december 31, 2018; refer to the "capital" section in "financial condition," of this management's discussion and analysis.
the lda model incorporates the four required operational risk elements described below:
•   internal loss event data is collected from across our business in conformity with our operating loss policy that establishes the requirements for collecting and reporting individual loss events. we categorize the data into seven basel-defined event types and further subdivide the data by business unit, as deemed appropriate. each of these loss events are represented in a uom which is used to estimate a specific amount of capital required for the types of loss events that fall into each specific category. some uoms are measured at the corporate level because they are not "business specific," such as damage to physical assets, where the cause of an event is not primarily driven by the behavior of a single business unit. internal losses of $500 or greater are captured, analyzed and included in the modeling approach. loss event data is collected using a corporate-wide data collection tool, which stores the data in a loss event data repository (ledr) to support processes related to analysis, management reporting and the calculation of required capital. internal loss event data provides our frequency and severity information to our capital calculation process for historical loss events experienced by us.
management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations internal loss event data may be incorporated into our lda model in a future quarter following the realization of the losses, with the timing and categorization dependent on the processes for model updates and, if applicable, model revalidation and regulatory review and related supervisory processes. an individual loss event can have a significant effect on the output of our lda model and our operational risk rwa under the advanced approaches depending on the severity of the loss event, its categorization among the seven basel-defined uoms and the stability of the distributional approach for a particular uom;
•   external loss event data provides information with respect to loss event severity from other financial institutions to inform our capital estimation process of events in similar business units at other banking organizations. this information supplements the data pool available for use in our lda model. assessments of the sufficiency of internal data and the relevance of external data are completed before pooling the two data sources for use in our lda model;
•   scenario analysis workshops are conducted across our business to inform management of the less frequent but most severe, or "tail," risks that the organization faces. the workshops are attended by senior business unit managers, other support and control partners and business-aligned risk management staff. the workshops are designed to capture information about the significant risks and to estimate potential exposures for individual risks should a loss event occur. the results of these workshops are used to make a comparison to our lda model results to determine that our calculation of required capital considers relevant risk-related information; and
•   business environment and internal control factors are gathered as part of our scenario analysis program to inform the scenario analysis workshop participants of internal loss event data and business-relevant metrics, such as risk assessment program results, along with industry loss event data and case studies where appropriate. business environment and internal control factors are those characteristics of a bank's internal and external operating environment that bear an exposure to operational risk. the use of this information indirectly influences our calculation of required capital by providing additional relevant data to workshop participants when reviewing specific uom risks.
monitoring, reporting and analytics the objective of risk monitoring is to proactively monitor the changing business environment and corresponding operational risk exposure. it is achieved through a series of quantitative and qualitative monitoring tools that are designed to allow us to understand changes in the business environment, internal control factors, risk metrics, risk assessments, exposures and operating effectiveness, as well as details of loss events and progress on risk initiatives implemented to mitigate potential risk exposures.
operational risk reporting is intended to provide transparency, thereby enabling management to manage risk, provide oversight and escalate issues in a timely manner. it is designed to allow the business units, executive management, and the board's control functions and committees to gain insight into activities that may result in risks and potential exposures. reports are intended to identify business activities that are experiencing processing issues, whether or not they result in actual loss events. reporting includes results of monitoring activities, internal and external examinations, regulatory reviews and control assessments. these elements combine in a manner designed to provide a view of potential and emerging risks facing us and information that details its progress on managing risks.
effectiveness and testing the objective of effectiveness and testing is to verify that internal controls are designed appropriately, are consistent with corporate and regulatory standards, and are operating effectively. it is achieved through a series of assessments by both internal and external parties, including corporate audit, independent registered public accounting firms, business self-assessments and other control function reviews, such as a sox testing program.
consistent with our standard model validation process, the operational risk lda model is subject to a detailed review, overseen by the mrc. in addition, the model is subject to a rigorous internal governance process. all changes to the model or input parameters, and the deployment of model updates, are reviewed and approved by the operational risk committee, which has oversight responsibility for the model, with technical input from the mrc.
documentation and guidelines documentation and guidelines allow for consistency and repeatability of the various processes that support the operational risk framework across our business.
operational risk guidelines document our practices and describe the key elements in a business unit's operational risk management program. the purpose of the guidelines is to set forth and define key state street corporation |
management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations operational risk terms, provide further detail on our operational risk programs, and detail the business units' responsibilities to identify, assess, measure, monitor and report operational risk. the guideline supports our operational risk policy.
data standards have been established to maintain consistent data repositories and systems that are controlled, accurate and available on a timely basis to support operational risk management.
information technology risk management overview and principles we define technology risk as the risk associated with the use, ownership, operation, involvement, influence and adoption of information technology. technology risk includes risks potentially triggered by technology non-compliance with regulatory obligations, information security and privacy incidents, business disruption, technology internal control and process gaps, technology operational events and adoption of new business technologies.
the principal technology risks within our technology risk policy and risk appetite framework include:
•   third party vendor risk;
•   business disruption and technology resiliency risk;
•   cyber and information security risk;
•   technology asset and configuration risk; and
•   technology obsolescence risk.
governance our board is responsible for the approval and oversight of our overall technology risk framework and program. it does so through its tops, which reviews and approves our technology risk policy and appetite framework annually.
our technology risk policy establishes our approach to our management of technology risk across our business. the policy identifies the responsibilities of individuals and committees charged with oversight of the management of technology risk and articulates a broad mandate that supports implementation of the technology risk framework.
risk control functions in the business are responsible for adopting and executing the enterprise technology risk management (etrm), technology risk framework and reporting requirements. they do this, in part, by developing and maintaining an inventory of critical applications and supporting infrastructure, as well as identifying, assessing and measuring technology risk utilizing the etrm framework. they are also responsible for monitoring and evaluating risk on a continual basis using key risk indicators, risk reporting and adopting appropriate risk responses to risk issues.
the chief technology risk officer, a member of the cro's executive management team, leads the etrm. etrm is the separate risk function responsible for the technology risk strategy and appetite, and technology risk framework development and execution. etrm also performs overall technology risk monitoring and reporting to the board, and provides a separate view of the technology risk posture to executive leadership.
we manage technology risks by:
•   coordinating various risk assessment and risk management activities, including erm operational risk programs;
•   establishing, through torc and tops of the board, the enterprise level technology risk and cyber risk appetite and limits;
•   producing enterprise level risk reporting, aggregation, dashboards, profiles and risk appetite statements;
•   validating appropriateness of reporting of information technology risks and risk acceptance to senior management risk committees and the board;
•   promoting a strong technology risk culture through communication;
•   serving as an escalation and challenge point for technology risk policy guidance, expectations and clarifications;
•   assessing effectiveness of key enterprise information technology risk and internal control remediation programs; and
•   providing risk oversight, challenge and monitoring for the global continuity and third party vendor management program, including the collection of risk appetite, metrics and kris, and reviewing issue management processes and consistent program adoption.
cyber-security risk management cyber-security risk is managed as part of our overall information technology risk management as outlined above.
we recognize the significance of cyber-attacks and have taken steps to mitigate the risks associated with them. we have made significant investments in building a mature cyber-security program to leverage people, technology and processes to protect our systems and the data in our care. we have also implemented a program to help us better measure and manage the cyber-security risk we face when we engage with third parties for services.
all employees are required to adhere to our cyber-security policy and standards. our centralized information security group provides education and training. this training includes a required annual online state street corporation |
management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations training class for all employees, multiple simulated phishing attacks and regular information security awareness materials.
our business lines employ information security officers to help the business better understand and manage their information security risks, as well as to work with the centralized information security team to drive awareness and compliance throughout the business.
we use independent third parties to perform ethical hacks of key systems to help us better understand the effectiveness of our controls and to better implement more effective controls, and we engage with third parties to conduct reviews of our overall program to help us better align our cyber-security program with what is required of a large financial services organization.
we have an incident response program in place that is designed to enable a well-coordinated response to mitigate the impact of cyber-attacks, recover from the attack and to drive the appropriate level of communication to internal and external stakeholders.
the torc assesses and manages the effectiveness of our cyber-security program, which is overseen by the tops of our board. the tops receives regular cyber-security updates throughout the year and is responsible for reviewing and approving the program on an annual basis.
market risk management market risk is defined by u.s. banking regulators as the risk of loss that could result from broad market movements, such as changes in the general level of interest rates, credit spreads, foreign exchange rates or commodity prices. we are exposed to market risk in both our trading and certain of our non-trading, or asset-and-liability management, activities.
information about the market risk associated with our trading activities is provided below under "trading activities." information about the market risk associated with our non-trading activities, which consists primarily of interest rate risk, is provided below under "asset-and-liability management activities."
trading activities in the conduct of our trading activities, we assume market risk, the level of which is a function of our overall risk appetite, business objectives and liquidity needs, our clients' requirements and market volatility and our execution against those factors.
we engage in trading activities primarily to support our clients' needs and to contribute to our overall corporate earnings and liquidity. in connection with certain of these trading activities, we enter into a variety of derivative financial instruments to support our clients' needs and to manage our interest rate and currency risk. these activities are generally intended to generate foreign exchange trading services revenue and to manage potential earnings volatility. in addition, we provide services related to derivatives in our role as both a manager and a servicer of financial assets.
our clients use derivatives to manage the financial risks associated with their investment goals and business activities. with the growth of cross-border investing, our clients often enter into foreign exchange forward contracts to convert currency for international investments and to manage the currency risk in their international investment portfolios. as an active participant in the foreign exchange markets, we provide foreign exchange forward and option contracts in support of these client needs, and also act as a dealer in the currency markets.
as part of our trading activities, we assume positions in the foreign exchange and interest rate markets by buying and selling cash instruments and entering into derivative instruments, including foreign exchange forward contracts, foreign exchange and interest rate options and interest rate swaps, interest rate forward contracts and interest rate futures. as of december 31, 2019, the notional amount of these derivative contracts was $2.41 trillion, of which $2.38 trillion was composed of foreign exchange forward, swap and spot contracts. we seek to match positions closely with the objective of minimizing related currency and interest rate risk. all foreign exchange contracts are valued daily at current market rates.
governance our assumption of market risk in our trading activities is an integral part of our corporate risk appetite. our board reviews and oversees our management of market risk, including the approval of key market risk policies and the receipt and review of regular market risk reporting, as well as periodic updates on selected market risk topics.
the previously described tmrc (refer to "risk committees") oversees all market risk-taking activities across our business associated with trading. the tmrc, which reports to mrac, is composed of members of erm, our global markets business and our global treasury group, as well as our senior executives who manage our trading businesses and other members of management who possess specialized knowledge and expertise. the tmrc meets regularly to monitor the management of our trading market risk activities.
our business units identify, actively manage and are responsible for the market risks inherent in their businesses. a dedicated market risk management group within erm, and other groups within erm, work with those business units to assist them in the identification, assessment, monitoring, management and control of market risk, and assist business unit managers with their market risk management and state street corporation |
management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations measurement activities. erm provides an additional line of oversight, support and coordination designed to promote the consistent identification, measurement and management of market risk across business units, separate from those business units' discrete activities.
the erm market risk management group is responsible for the management of corporate-wide market risk, the monitoring of key market risks and the development and maintenance of market risk management policies, guidelines and standards aligned with our corporate risk appetite. this group also establishes and approves market risk tolerance limits and trading authorities based on, but not limited to, measures of notional amounts, sensitivity, var and stress. such limits and authorities are specified in our trading and market risk guidelines which govern our management of trading market risk.
corporate audit separately assesses the design and operating effectiveness of the market risk controls within our business units and erm. other related responsibilities of corporate audit include the periodic review of erm and business unit compliance with market risk policies, guidelines and corporate standards, as well as relevant regulatory requirements. we are subject to regular monitoring, reviews and supervisory exams of our market risk function by the federal reserve. in addition, we are regulated by, among others, the sec, the financial industry regulatory authority and the u.s. commodities futures trading commission.
risk appetite our corporate market risk appetite is specified in policy statements that outline the governance, responsibilities and requirements surrounding the identification, measurement, analysis, management and communication of market risk arising from our trading activities. these policy statements also set forth the market risk control framework to monitor, support, manage and control this portion of our risk appetite. all groups involved in the management and control of market risk associated with trading activities are required to comply with the qualitative and quantitative elements of these policy statements. our trading market risk control framework is composed of the following components:
•   a trading market risk management process led by erm, separate from the business units' discrete activities;
•   clearly defined responsibilities and authorities for the primary groups involved in trading market risk management;
•   a trading market risk measurement methodology that captures correlation effects and allows aggregation of market risk across risk types, markets and business lines;
•   daily monitoring, analysis and reporting of market risk exposures associated with trading activities against market risk limits;
•   a defined limit structure and escalation process in the event of a market risk limit excess;
•   use of var models to measure the one-day market risk exposure of trading positions;
•   use of var as a ten-day-based regulatory capital measure of the market risk exposure of trading positions;
•   use of non-var-based limits and other controls;
•   use of stressed-var models, stress-testing analysis and scenario analysis to support the trading market risk measurement and management process by assessing how portfolios and global business lines perform under extreme market conditions;
•   use of back-testing as a diagnostic tool to assess the accuracy of var models and other risk management techniques; and
•   a new product approval process that requires market risk teams to assess trading-related market risks and apply risk tolerance limits to proposed new products and business activities.
we use our cap to assess our overall capital and liquidity in relation to our risk profile and provide a comprehensive strategy for maintaining appropriate capital and liquidity levels. with respect to market risk associated with trading activities, our risk management and our calculations of regulatory capital are based primarily on our internal var models and stress testing analysis. as discussed in detail under "value-at-risk" below, var is measured daily by erm.
the tmrc oversees our market risk exposure in relation to limits established within our risk appetite framework. these limits define threshold levels for var- and stressed var-based measures and are applicable to all trading positions subject to regulatory capital requirements. these limits are designed to prevent any undue concentration of market risk exposure, in light of the primarily non-proprietary nature of our trading activities. the risk appetite framework and associated limits are reviewed and approved by the board's rc.
covered positions our trading positions are subject to regulatory market risk capital requirements if they meet the regulatory definition of a "covered position." a covered position is generally defined by u.s. banking regulators as an on- or off-balance sheet position associated with the organization's trading activities that is free of any restrictions on its tradability, but does not include intangible assets, certain credit derivatives recognized as guarantees and certain equity positions not publicly state street corporation |
management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations traded. all fx and commodity positions are considered covered positions, regardless of the accounting treatment they receive. the identification of covered positions for inclusion in our market risk capital framework is governed by our covered positions policy, which outlines the standards we use to determine whether a trading position is a covered position.
our covered positions consist primarily of the trading portfolios held by our global markets business. they also arise from certain positions held by our global treasury group. these trading positions include products such as foreign exchange spot, foreign exchange forwards, non-deliverable forwards, foreign exchange options, foreign exchange funding swaps, currency futures, financial futures and interest rate futures. new activities are analyzed to determine if the positions arising from such new activities meet the definition of a covered position and conform to our covered positions policy. this documented analysis, including any decisions with respect to market risk treatments, must receive approval from the tmrc.
we use spot rates, forward points, yield curves and discount factors imported from third-party sources to measure the value of our covered positions, and we use such values to mark our covered positions to market on a daily basis. these values are subject to separate validation by us in order to evaluate reasonableness and consistency with market experience. the mark-to-market gain or loss on spot transactions is calculated by applying the spot rate to the foreign currency principal and comparing the resultant base currency amount to the original transaction principal. the mark-to-market gain or loss on a forward foreign exchange contract or forward cash flow contract is determined as the difference between the life-to-date (historical) value of the cash flow and the value of the cash flow at the inception of the transaction. the mark-to-market gain or loss on interest rate swaps is determined by discounting the future cash flows from each leg of the swap transaction.
value-at-risk and stressed var we use a variety of risk measurement tools and methodologies, including var, which is an estimate of potential loss for a given period within a stated statistical confidence interval. we use a risk measurement methodology to measure trading-related var daily. we have adopted standards for measuring trading-related var, and we maintain regulatory capital for market risk associated with our trading activities in conformity with currently applicable bank regulatory market risk requirements.
we utilize an internal var model to calculate our regulatory market risk capital requirements. we use a historical simulation model to calculate daily var- and stressed var-based measures for our covered positions in conformity with regulatory requirements.
our var model seeks to capture identified material risk factors associated with our covered positions, including risks arising from market movements such as changes in foreign exchange rates, interest rates and option-implied volatilities.
we have adopted standards and guidelines to value our covered positions which govern our var- and stressed var-based measures. our regulatory var-based measure is calculated based on historical volatilities of market risk factors during a two-year observation period calibrated to a one-tail, 99% confidence interval and a ten-business-day holding period. we also use the same platform to calculate a one-tail, 99% confidence interval, one-business-day var for internal risk management purposes. a 99% one-tail confidence interval implies that daily trading losses are not expected to exceed the estimated var more than 1% of the time, or less than three business days out of a year.
our market risk models, including our var model, are subject to change in connection with the governance, validation and back-testing processes described below. these models can change as a result of changes in our business activities, our historical experiences, market forces and events, regulations and regulatory interpretations and other factors. in addition, the models are subject to continuing regulatory review and approval. changes in our models may result in changes in our measurements of our market risk exposures, including var, and related measures, including regulatory capital. these changes could result in material changes in those risk measurements and related measures as calculated and compared from period to period.
we calculate a stressed var-based measure using the same model we use to calculate var, but with model inputs calibrated to historical data from a range of continuous twelve-month periods that reflect significant financial stress. the stressed var model is designed to identify the second-worst outcome occurring in the worst continuous one-year rolling period since july 2007. this stressed var meets the regulatory requirement as the rolling ten-day period with an outcome that is worse than 99% of other outcomes during that twelve-month period of financial stress. for each portfolio, the stress period is determined algorithmically by seeking the one-year time horizon that produces the largest ten-business-day var from within the available historical data. this historical data set includes the financial crisis of 2008, the highly volatile period surrounding the eurozone sovereign debt crisis and the standard & poor's downgrade of u.s. treasury debt in august 2011. as the historical data set used to determine the stress period expands over time, future market stress events will be incorporated.
management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations value-at-risk measures var measures are based on the most recent two years of historical price movements for instruments and related risk factors to which we have exposure. the instruments in question are limited to foreign exchange spot, forward and options contracts and interest rate contracts, including futures and interest rate swaps. historically, these instruments have exhibited a higher degree of liquidity relative to other available capital markets instruments. as a result, the var measures shown reflect our ability to rapidly adjust exposures in highly dynamic markets. for this reason, risk inventory, in the form of net open positions, across all currencies is typically limited. in addition, long and short positions in major, as well as minor, currencies provide risk offsets that limit our potential downside exposure.
our var methodology uses a historical simulation approach based on market-observed changes in foreign exchange rates, u.s. and non-u.s. interest rates and implied volatilities, and incorporates the resulting diversification benefits provided from the mix of our trading positions. our var model incorporates approximately 5,000 risk factors and includes correlations among currency, interest rates and other market rates.
all var measures are subject to limitations and must be interpreted accordingly. some, but not all, of the limitations of our var methodology include the following:
•   compared to a shorter observation period, a two-year observation period is slower to reflect increases in market volatility (although temporary increases in market volatility will affect the calculation of var for a longer period); consequently, in periods of sudden increases in volatility or increasing volatility, in each case relative to the prior two-year period, the calculation of var may understate current risk;
•   compared to a longer observation period, a two-year observation period may not reflect as many past periods of volatility in the markets, because such past volatility is no longer in the observation period; consequently, historical market scenarios of high volatility, even if similar to current or likely future market circumstances, may fall outside the two-year observation period, resulting in a potential understatement of current risk;
•   the var-based measure is calibrated to a specified level of confidence and does not indicate the potential magnitude of losses beyond this confidence level;
•   in certain cases, var-based measures approximate the impact of changes in risk factors on the values of positions and portfolios; this may happen because the number of inputs included in the var model is necessarily limited; for example, yield curve risk factors do not exist for all future dates;
•   the use of historical market information may not be predictive of future events, particularly those that are extreme in nature; this "backward-looking" limitation can cause var to understate or overstate risk;
•   the effect of extreme and rare market movements is difficult to estimate; this may result from non-linear risk sensitivities as well as the potential for actual volatility and correlation levels to differ from assumptions implicit in the var calculations; and
•   intra-day risk is not captured.
stress testing we have a corporate-wide stress testing program in place that incorporates an array of techniques to measure the potential loss we could suffer in a hypothetical scenario of adverse economic and financial conditions. we also monitor concentrations of risk such as concentration by branch, risk component, and currency pairs. we conduct stress testing on a daily basis based on selected historical stress events that are relevant to our positions in order to estimate the potential impact to our current portfolio should similar market conditions recur, and we also perform stress testing as part of the federal reserve's ccar process. stress testing is conducted, analyzed and reported at the corporate, trading desk, division and risk-factor level (for example, exchange risk, interest rate risk and volatility risk).
stress testing results and limits are actively monitored on a daily basis by erm and reported to the tmrc. limit breaches are addressed by erm risk managers in conjunction with the business units, escalated as appropriate, and reviewed by the tmrc if material. in addition, we have established several action triggers that prompt immediate review by management and the implementation of a remediation plan.
we perform scenario analysis daily based on selected historical stress events that are relevant to our positions in order to estimate the potential impact to our current portfolio should similar market conditions recur. relevant scenarios are chosen from an inventory of historical financial stresses and applied to our current portfolio. these historical event scenarios involve spot foreign exchange, credit, equity, unforeseen geo-political events and natural disasters, and government and central bank intervention scenarios. examples of the specific historical scenarios we incorporate in our stress testing program may include the asian financial crisis of 1997, the september 11, 2001 terrorist attacks in the u.s. and the 2008 financial crisis. we continue to update our inventory of historical stress scenarios as new stress conditions emerge in the financial markets.
management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations as each of the historical stress events is associated with a different time horizon, we normalize results by scaling down the longer horizon events to a ten-day horizon and keeping the shorter horizon events (i.e., events that are shorter than ten days) at their original terms. we also conduct sensitivity analysis daily to calculate the impact of a large predefined shock in a specific risk factor or a group of risk factors on our current portfolio. these predefined shocks include parallel and non-parallel yield curve shifts and foreign exchange spot and volatility surface shifts. in a parallel shift scenario, we apply a constant factor shift across all yield curve tenors. in a non-parallel shift scenario, we apply different shock levels to different tenors of a yield curve, rather than shifting the entire curve by a constant amount. non-parallel shifts include steepening, flattening and butterflies.
validation and back-testing we perform frequent back-testing to assess the accuracy of our var-based model in estimating loss at the stated confidence level. this back-testing involves the comparison of estimated var model outputs to daily, actual profit-and-loss (p&l) outcomes observed from daily market movements. we back-test our var model using "clean" p&l, which excludes non-trading revenue such as fees, commissions and nii, as well as estimated revenue from intra-day trading.
our var definition of trading losses excludes items that are not specific to the price movement of the trading assets and liabilities themselves, such as fees, commissions, changes to reserves and gains or losses from intra-day activity.
we experienced two back-testing exceptions in 2019 and four back-testing exceptions in 2018. at 99% confidence interval, the statistical expectation for a var model is to witness one exception every hundred trading days (or two to three exceptions per year). the 2019 back-testing exceptions are therefore within statistical expectation. in 2018 heightened volatility followed a longer period of relatively benign market conditions that saw the volatility index routinely register as little as 10% or less. following such periods, it is quite common for var models calibrated to the most recent two years of data to underestimate the trading gains or losses that are experienced as volatility trends above levels that were seen more recently.
our model validation process also evaluates the integrity of our var models through the use of regular outcome analysis. this outcome analysis includes back-testing, which compares the var model's predictions to actual outcomes using out-of-sample information. consistent with regulatory guidance, the back-testing compared "clean" p&l, defined above, with the one-day var produced by the model. the back-testing was performed for a time period not used for model development. the number of occurrences where "clean" trading-book p&l exceeded the one-day var was within our expected var tolerance level.
market risk reporting our erm market risk management group is responsible for market risk monitoring and reporting. we use a variety of systems and controlled market feeds from third-party services to compile data for several daily, weekly and monthly management reports.
the following tables present var and stressed var associated with our trading activities for covered positions held during the years ended december 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, as measured by our var methodology. diversification effect in the tables below represents the difference between total var and the sum of the vars for each trading activity. this effect arises because the risks present in our trading activities are not perfectly correlated.

management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the average of our stressed var-based measure was approximately $35 million for the year ended december 31, 2019, compared to an average of approximately $32 million for the year ended december 31, 2018.
the average stressed var-based measure as of december 31, 2019 was relatively unchanged compared to december 31, 2018. our stressed var-based measure increased as of december 31, 2019 compared to december 31, 2018, primarily due to larger fx net open positions.
the var-based measures presented in the preceding tables are primarily a reflection of the overall level of market volatility and our appetite for taking market risk in our trading activities. overall levels of volatility have been low both on an absolute basis and relative to the historical information observed at the beginning of the period used for the calculations. both the ten-day var-based measures and the stressed var-based measures are based on historical changes observed during rolling ten-day periods for the portfolios as of the close of business each day over the past one-year period.
we may in the future modify and adjust our models and methodologies used to calculate var and stressed var, subject to regulatory review and approval, and these modifications and adjustments may result in changes in our var-based and stressed var-based measures.
the following tables present the var and stressed-var associated with our trading activities attributable to foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk and volatility risk as of december 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. the totals of the var-based and stressed var-based measures for the three attributes in total exceeded the related total var and total stressed var presented in the foregoing tables as of each period-end, primarily due to the benefits of diversification across risk types. diversification effect in the tables below represents the difference between total var and the sum of the vars for each trading activity. this effect arises because the risks present in our trading activities are not perfectly correlated.

(1) for purposes of risk attribution by component, foreign exchange refers only to the risk from market movements in period-end rates.  forwards, futures, options and swaps with maturities greater than period-end have embedded interest rate risk that is captured by the measures used for interest rate risk.  accordingly, the interest rate risk embedded in these foreign exchange instruments is included in the interest rate risk component.
(2) as of december 31, 2019, we had no ten-day var or ten-day stressed var associated with volatility risk.
asset and liability management activities the primary objective of asset and liability management is to provide sustainable nii under varying economic conditions, while protecting the economic value of the assets and liabilities carried on our consolidated statement of condition from the adverse effects of changes in interest rates. while many market factors affect the level of nii and the economic value of our assets and liabilities, one of the most significant factors is our exposure to movements in interest rates. most of our nii is earned from the investment of client deposits generated by our businesses. we invest these client deposits in assets that conform generally to the characteristics of our balance sheet liabilities, including the currency composition of our significant non-u.s. dollar denominated client liabilities.
we quantify nii sensitivity using an earnings simulation model that includes our expectations for new business growth, changes in balance sheet mix and investment portfolio positioning. this measure compares our baseline view of nii over a twelve-month horizon, based on our internal forecast of interest rates, to a wide range of rate shocks. table 38, key interest rates for baseline forecasts, presents the spot and 12-month forward rates used in our baseline forecasts at december 31, 2019 and december 31, 2018. our december 31, 2019 baseline forecast includes the expectation of one rate cut by the federal reserve over the next 12 months.
management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations table 38: key interest rates for baseline forecasts december 31, 2019                                                                        december 31, 2018
in table 39: net interest income sensitivity, we report the expected change in nii over the next twelve months from instantaneous shocks to various tenors on the yield curve, including the impacts from u.s. and non-u.s. rates. each scenario assumes no management action is taken to mitigate the adverse effects of interest rate changes on our financial performance. while investment securities balances can fluctuate with the level of rates as prepayment assumptions change, our deposit balances remain consistent with the baseline.
(in millions)                           u.s. dollar           all other currencies             total           u.s. dollar           all other currencies             total rate change:                                                                      benefit (exposure)                                                     benefit (exposure)
as of december 31, 2019, nii remains positioned to benefit from a parallel rise in interest rates and is exposed to a parallel decline in interest rates. compared to december 31, 2018, our nii is less sensitive to parallel rate increases and decreases, driven by changes to the composition of u.s. deposits and derivative hedging activity intended to reduce the impact of lower rates in the u.s.
u.s dollar nii sensitivity as of december 31, 2019 similarly remains poised to benefit from a parallel rise in interest rates and is exposed to a parallel decline in u.s. interest rates. compared to december 31, 2018, our u.s. dollar nii benefit to higher rates has declined, largely driven by the composition of u.s. deposits, higher deposit betas and derivative hedging activity. nii exposure to lower u.s. rates has remained stable since december 31, 2018 as reduced sensitivities to short-end rates is offset by increased exposure to long-end rates. the reduced nii sensitivity to lower short-end u.s. rates is driven by changes to the composition of u.s. deposits and cash flow hedging activity, while increased nii exposure to lower long-end u.s. rates is driven by higher levels of mortgage-backed securities in the investment portfolio.
we are still positioned to benefit from changes in non-u.s. interest rates, with the majority of our sensitivity derived from the short-end of the curve given deposit pricing expectations. compared to december 31, 2018, our non-u.s. benefit to higher rates has decreased, while the benefit to lower rates has increased. the decreased nii benefit to higher rates is driven by euro deposit pricing actions, in addition to the impact of changes to the treatment of excess reserves by the european central bank and swiss national bank. the increased benefit to lower rates is largely a result of the aforementioned change in treatment for excess reserves.
eve sensitivity is a discounted cash flow model designed to estimate the fair value of assets and liabilities under a series of interest rate shocks over a long-term horizon. in the following table, we report our eve sensitivity to 200 bps instantaneous rate shocks, relative to spot interest rates. management compares the change in eve sensitivity against our aggregate tier 1 and tier 2 risk-based capital, calculated in conformity with current applicable regulatory requirements. eve sensitivity is dependent on the timing of interest and principal cash flows. also, the measure only evaluates the spot balance sheet and does not include the impact of new business assumptions.
table 40: economic value of equity sensitivity as of december 31,
rate change:     benefit (exposure)
management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations as of december 31, 2019, eve sensitivity remains exposed to upward shifts in interest rates. compared to december 31, 2018, the change in the up and down 200 bps instantaneous shocks was primarily driven by purchases of fixed-rate investment portfolio securities, partially offset by lower long-end u.s. rates.
both nii sensitivity and eve sensitivity are routinely monitored as market conditions change.
model risk management the use of models is widespread throughout the financial services industry, with large and complex organizations relying on sophisticated models to support numerous aspects of their financial decision making. the models contemporaneously represent both a significant advancement in financial management and a source of risk. in large banking organizations like us, model results influence business decisions, and model failure could have a harmful effect on our financial performance. as a result, the mrm framework seeks to mitigate our model risk.
•   a model risk governance program that defines roles and responsibilities, including the authority to restrict model usage, provides policies and guidance, monitors compliance and reports regularly to the board on the overall degree of model risk across the corporation;
•   a model development process that focuses on sound design and computational accuracy, and includes activities designed to test for robustness, stability and sensitivity to assumptions; and
•   an independent model validation function designed to verify that models are conceptually sound, computationally accurate, are performing as expected, and are in line with their design objectives.
governance models used in the regulatory capital calculation can only be deployed for use after undergoing a model validation by erm's mrm group. the model validation results and/or a decision by the model risk committee must permit model usage or the model may not be used.
erm's mrm group is responsible for defining the corporate-wide model risk governance framework, maintaining policies that achieve the framework's objectives. the team is responsible for overall model risk governance capabilities, with particular emphasis in the areas of model validation, model risk reporting, model performance monitoring, tracking of new model development status and committee-level review and challenge.
mrc, which is composed of senior managers responsible for representing functional areas and business units with key models across the organization, reports to mrac, and provides guidance and oversight to the mrm function.
model development and usage models are developed under standards governing data sourcing, methodology selection and model integrity testing. model development includes a statement of purpose to align development with intended use. it also includes a comparison of alternative approaches to promote a sound modeling approach.
model developers conduct an assessment of data quality and relevance. the development teams conduct a variety of tests of the accuracy, robustness and stability of each model.
model validation mvg is part of mrm within erm and performs model validations and reviews. mvg is independent, as contemplated by applicable bank regulatory requirements, of both the developers and users of the models. mvg validates models through an evaluation process that assesses the appropriateness, accuracy, and suitability of data inputs, methodologies, documentation, assumptions, and processing code. model validation also encompasses an assessment of model performance, sensitivity, and robustness, as well as a model's potential limitations given its particular assumptions or deficiencies. based on the results of its review, mvg issues a model use decision and may require remedial actions and/or compensating controls on model use. mvg also maintains a model risk rating system, which assigns a risk rating to each model based on an assessment of a model's inherent and residual risks. these ratings aid in the understanding and reporting of model risk across the model portfolio, and enable the triaging of needs for remediation.
although model validation is the primary method of subjecting models to independent review and challenge, in practice, a multi-step governance process provides the opportunity for challenge by multiple parties. first, mvg conducts a model validation and issues a model use decision. mvg communicates their result as one of the following three outcomes: "approved", "approved with conditions", or "not approved".  there are two ways in which a model can be deemed "not approved for use" given a validation:  1) the aggregation of the model scoring within mrm's model risk rating system (mrrs) model is poor enough to result in a "high" rating, or 2) the scoring of one or more mrrs model element(s) is deemed "critical" resulting in an automatic "high" rating irrespective of the other elements as the "critical" element(s) undermines the model. second, these state street corporation |
management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations decisions may be reviewed, challenged, and confirmed by the mrc. finally, model use decisions, risk ratings, and overall levels of model risk may be reported to and reviewed by mrac. mrm also reports regularly on model risk issues to the board.
strategic risk management we define strategic risk as the current or prospective impact on earnings or capital arising from adverse business decisions, improper implementation of strategic initiatives, or lack of responsiveness to industry-wide changes. strategic risks are influenced by changes in the competitive environment; decline in market performance or changes in our business activities; and the potential secondary impacts of reputational risks, not already captured as market, interest rate, credit, operational, model or liquidity risks. we incorporate strategic risk into our assessment of our business plans and risk and capital management processes. active management of strategic risk is an integral component of all aspects of our business.
separating the effects of a potential material adverse event into operational and strategic risk is sometimes difficult. for instance, the direct financial impact of an unfavorable event in the form of fines or penalties would be classified as an operational risk loss, while the impact on our reputation and consequently the potential loss of clients and corresponding decline in revenue would be classified as a strategic risk loss. an additional example of strategic risk is the integration of a major acquisition. failure to successfully integrate the operations of an acquired business, and the resultant inability to retain clients and the associated revenue, would be classified as a loss due to strategic risk.
strategic risk is managed with a long-term focus. techniques for its assessment and management include the development of business plans, which are subject to robust review and challenge from senior management and the board of directors, as well as a formal review and approval process for all new business and product proposals. the potential impact of the various elements of strategic risk is difficult to quantify with any degree of precision. we use a combination of historical earnings volatility, scenario analysis, stress-testing and management judgment to help assess the potential effect on us attributable to strategic risk. management and control of strategic risks are generally the responsibility of the business units, with oversight from the control functions, as part of their overall strategic planning and internal risk management processes.
capital managing our capital involves evaluating whether our actual and projected levels of capital are commensurate with our risk profile, are in compliance with all applicable regulatory requirements and are sufficient to provide us with the financial flexibility to undertake future strategic business initiatives. we assess capital adequacy based on relevant regulatory capital requirements, as well as our own internal capital goals, targets and other relevant metrics.
framework our objective with respect to management of our capital is to maintain a strong capital base in order to provide financial flexibility for our business needs, including funding corporate growth and supporting clients' cash management needs, and to provide protection against loss to depositors and creditors. we strive to maintain an appropriate level of capital, commensurate with our risk profile, on which an attractive return to shareholders is expected to be realized over both the short and long-term, while protecting our obligations to depositors and creditors and complying with regulatory capital requirements.
our capital management focuses on our risk exposures, the regulatory requirements applicable to us with respect to multiple capital measures, the evaluations and resulting credit ratings of the major independent rating agencies, our return on capital at both the consolidated and line-of-business level and our capital position relative to our peers.
assessment of our overall capital adequacy includes the comparison of capital sources with capital uses, as well as the consideration of the quality and quantity of the various components of capital. the assessment seeks to determine the optimal level of capital and composition of capital instruments to satisfy all constituents of capital, with the lowest overall cost to shareholders. other factors considered in our assessment of capital adequacy are strategic and contingency planning, stress testing and planned capital actions.
capital adequacy process our primary federal banking regulator is the federal reserve. both we and state street bank are subject to the minimum regulatory capital requirements established by the federal reserve and defined in the federal deposit insurance corporation improvement act. state street bank must exceed the regulatory capital thresholds for "well capitalized" in order for our parent company to maintain its status as a financial holding company. accordingly, one of our primary objectives with respect to capital management is to exceed all applicable minimum regulatory capital requirements and to be "well-capitalized" under the pca guidelines established by the fdic. our capital management activities are conducted as part of our corporate-wide cap and associated capital policy and guidelines.
we consider capital adequacy to be a key element of our financial well-being, which affects our ability to attract and maintain client relationships; operate state street corporation |
management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations effectively in the global capital markets; and satisfy regulatory, security holders and shareholder needs. capital is one of several elements that affect our credit ratings and the ratings of our principal subsidiaries.
in conformity with our capital policy and guidelines, we strive to achieve and maintain specific internal capital levels, not just at a point in time, but over time and during periods of stress, to account for changes in our strategic direction, evolving economic conditions, and financial and market volatility. we have developed and implemented a corporate-wide cap to assess our overall capital in relation to our risk profile and to provide a comprehensive strategy for maintaining appropriate capital levels. the cap considers material risks under multiple scenarios, with an emphasis on stress scenarios, and encompasses existing processes and systems used to measure our capital adequacy.
capital contingency planning contingency planning is an integral component of capital management. the objective of contingency planning is to monitor current and forecast levels of select capital, liquidity and other measures that serve as early indicators of a potentially adverse capital or liquidity adequacy situation. these measures are one of the inputs used to set our internal capital adequacy level. we review these measures annually for appropriateness and relevance in relation to our financial budget and capital plan.
stress testing we administer a robust business-wide stress-testing program that executes multiple stress tests each year to assess the institution's capital adequacy and/or future performance under adverse conditions. our stress testing program is structured around what we determine to be the key risks inherent in our business, as assessed through a recurring material risk identification process. the material risk identification process represents a bottom-up approach to identifying the institution's most significant risk exposures across all on- and off-balance sheet risk-taking activities, including credit, market, liquidity, interest rate, operational, fiduciary, business, reputation and regulatory risks. these key risks serve as an organizing principle for much of our risk management framework, as well as reporting, including the "risk dashboard" provided to the board. over the past few years, stress scenarios have included a deep recession in the u.s., a break-up of the eurozone, a severe recession in china and an oil shock precipitated by turmoil in the middle east/north africa region.
in connection with the focus on our key risks, each stress test incorporates idiosyncratic loss events tailored to our unique risk profile and business activities. due to the nature of our business model and our consolidated statement of condition, our risks differ from those of a traditional commercial bank.
the federal reserve requires bank holding companies with total consolidated assets of $50 billion or more, which includes us, to submit a capital plan on an annual basis. the federal reserve uses its annual ccar process, which incorporates hypothetical financial and economic stress scenarios, to review those capital plans and assess whether banking organizations have capital planning processes that account for idiosyncratic risks and provide for sufficient capital to continue operations throughout times of economic and financial stress. as part of its ccar process, the federal reserve assesses each organization's capital adequacy, capital planning process and plans to distribute capital, such as dividend payments or stock purchase programs. management and board risk committees review, challenge and approve ccar results and assumptions before submission to the federal reserve.
through the evaluation of our capital adequacy and/or future performance under adverse conditions, the stress testing processes provide important insights for capital planning, risk management and strategic decision-making for us.
governance in order to support integrated decision making, we have identified three management elements to aid in the compatibility and coordination of our cap:
•   risk management - identification, measurement, monitoring and forecasting of different types of risk and their combined impact on capital adequacy;
•   capital management - determination of optimal capital levels; and
•   business management - strategic planning, budgeting, forecasting and performance management.
we have a hierarchical structure supporting appropriate committee review of relevant risk and capital information. the ongoing responsibility for capital management rests with our treasurer. the capital management group within global treasury is responsible for the capital policy and guidelines, development of the capital plan, the oversight of global capital management and optimization.
the mrac provides oversight of our capital management, our capital adequacy, our internal targets and the expectations of the major independent credit rating agencies. in addition, mrac approves our balance sheet strategy and related activities. the board's rc assists the board in fulfilling its oversight responsibilities related to the assessment and management of risk and capital. our capital policy is reviewed and approved annually by the board's rc.
management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations global systemically important bank we are one among a group of 30 institutions worldwide that have been identified by the financial stability board and the basel committee on banking supervision as g-sibs. our designation as a g-sib is based on a number of factors, as evaluated by banking regulators, and requires us to maintain an additional capital surcharge above the minimum capital ratios set forth in the basel iii rule.
we and our depositary institution subsidiaries are subject to the current basel iii minimum risk-based capital and leverage ratio guidelines.
additional information about g-sibs is provided under "regulatory capital adequacy and liquidity standards" in "supervision and regulation" in business in this form 10-k.
regulatory capital we and state street bank, as advanced approaches banking organizations, are subject to the u.s. basel iii framework. provisions of the basel iii rule became effective with full implementation on january 1, 2019. we are also subject to the final market risk capital rule issued by u.s. banking regulators effective as of january 2013.
the basel iii rule provides for two frameworks for monitoring capital adequacy: the "standardized" approach and the "advanced" approaches, applicable to advanced approaches banking organizations, like us. the standardized approach prescribes standardized calculations for credit rwa, including specified risk weights for certain on- and off-balance sheet exposures.
the advanced approaches consist of the advanced internal ratings-based approach used for the calculation of rwa related to credit risk, and the advanced measurement approach used for the calculation of rwa related to operational risk.
the market risk capital rule requires us to use internal models to calculate daily measures of var, which reflect general market risk for certain of our trading positions defined by the rule as "covered positions," as well as stressed-var measures to supplement the var measures. the rule also requires a public disclosure composed of qualitative and quantitative information about the market risk associated with our trading activities and our related var and stressed-var measures. the qualitative and quantitative information required by the rule is provided under "market risk" included in this management's discussion and analysis.
as required by the dodd-frank act, we and state street bank, as advanced approaches banking organizations, are subject to a permanent "capital floor," also referred to as the collins amendment, in the assessment of our regulatory capital adequacy, including the capital conservation buffer and countercyclical capital buffer. our risk-based capital ratios for regulatory assessment purposes are the lower of each ratio calculated under the standardized approach and the advanced approaches.
the requirement for the capital conservation buffer became effective with full implementation on january 1, 2019. specifically, the rule limits a banking organization's ability to make capital distributions and discretionary bonus payments to executive officers if it fails to maintain a cet1 capital conservation buffer of more than 2.5% of total rwa and, if deployed during periods of excessive credit growth, a cet1 countercyclical capital buffer of up to 2.5% of total rwa, above each of the minimum cet1, tier 1, and total risk-based capital ratios. the countercyclical capital buffer is currently set at zero by u.s. banking regulators. to maintain the status of the parent company as a financial holding company, we and our insured depository institution subsidiaries are required, among other requirements, to be "well capitalized" as defined by the prompt corrective action framework.
the specific calculation of our and state street bank's risk-based capital ratios changed as the provisions of the basel iii rule related to the numerator (capital) and denominator (rwa) were phased in, and as our rwa calculated using the advanced approaches changed due to changes in methodology. these methodological changes resulted in differences in our reported capital ratios from one reporting period to the next that are independent of applicable changes to our capital base, our asset composition, our off-balance sheet exposures or our risk profile.
the following table presents the regulatory capital structure and related regulatory capital ratios for us and state street bank as of the dates indicated. we are subject to the more stringent of the risk-based capital ratios calculated under the standardized approach and those calculated under the advanced approaches in the assessment of our capital adequacy under applicable bank regulatory standards.
as a result of changes in the methodologies used to calculate our regulatory capital ratios from period to period, as the provisions of the basel iii rule were phased in, the ratios presented in the table for each period are not directly comparable. refer to the footnotes following the table.

(1) under the applicable bank regulatory rules, we are not required to and, accordingly, did not revise previously-filed reported capital metrics and ratios following the change in accounting for low income housing tax credits (lihtc).
(2) other adjustments within cet1 capital primarily include the overfunded portion of our defined benefit pension plan obligation net of associated deferred tax liabilities, disallowed deferred tax assets, and other required credit risk based deductions.
(3) includes a cva which reflects the risk of potential fair value adjustments for credit risk reflected in our valuation of over-the-counter (otc) derivative contracts. we used a simple cva approach in conformity with the basel iii advanced approaches.
(4) under the current advanced approaches rules and regulatory guidance concerning operational risk models, rwa attributable to operational risk can vary substantially from period-to-period, without direct correlation to the effects of a particular loss event on our results of operations and financial condition and impacting dates and periods that may differ from the dates and periods as of and during which the loss event is reflected in our financial statements, with the timing and categorization dependent on the processes for model updates and, if applicable, model revalidation and regulatory review and related supervisory processes. an individual loss event can have a significant effect on the output of our operational rwa under the advanced approaches depending on the severity of the loss event and its categorization among the seven basel-defined uoms.
(5) 2019 minimum requirements including capital conservation buffer and g-sib surcharge.
(6) 2018 minimum requirements including capital conservation buffer and g-sib surcharge.
management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations our cet1 capital increased $0.63 billion as of december 31, 2019 compared to december 31, 2018, primarily driven by net income and accumulated other comprehensive income in the year ended december 31, 2019, partially offset by common stock repurchases and capital distributions from common and preferred stock dividends.
our tier 1 capital decreased $0.10 billion as of december 31, 2019 compared to december 31, 2018 under both the advanced approaches and standardized approach due to the redemption of all outstanding series e preferred stock and changes in our cet1 capital. total capital increased under the advanced approaches and standardized approach by $0.21 billion and $0.23 billion, respectively, due to the changes in our tier 1 and tier 2 capital.

management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following table presents a roll-forward of the basel iii advanced approaches and standardized approach rwa for the years ended december 31, 2019 and 2018.

net increase (decrease) in operational risk-weighted assets                               1,903                                                  238                                                          n/a                                                              n/a total risk-weighted assets, end of period                                              $104,364                                              $95,315                                                     $104,005                                                          $98,820
(1) standardized approach rwa as of the periods noted above were calculated using our estimates, based on our then current interpretation of the basel iii rule.
(2) includes assets not in a definable category, cleared transactions, non-material portfolio, other wholesale, cash and due from, and interest-bearing deposits with banks, equity exposures and 6% credit risk supervisory charge.
as of december 31, 2019, total advanced approaches rwa increased $9.05 billion compared to december 31, 2018, primarily due to increases in both credit rwa and operational risk rwa. the increase in credit rwa was primarily driven by an increase in investment securities rwa, primarily due to higher exposures to agency mbs and corporates. additionally, loans rwa increased primarily due to higher lending activity.
as of december 31, 2019, total standardized approach rwa increased $5.19 billion compared to december 31, 2018, primarily due to higher credit rwa. the main drivers of the credit rwa change were increased investment securities rwa, other rwa and loans rwa, partially offset by a reduction in derivative exposure rwa.
the regulatory capital ratios as of december 31, 2019, presented in table 41: regulatory capital structure and related regulatory capital ratios, are calculated under the standardized approach and advanced approaches in conformity with the basel iii rule. the advanced approaches based ratios reflect calculations and determinations with respect to our capital and related matters as of december 31, 2019, based on our and external data, quantitative formulae, statistical models, historical correlations and assumptions, collectively referred to as "advanced systems," in effect and used by us for those purposes as of the time we first reported such ratios in a quarterly report on form 10-q or an annual report on form 10-k. significant components of these advanced systems involve the exercise of judgment by us and our regulators, and our advanced systems may not, individually or collectively, precisely represent or calculate the scenarios, circumstances, outputs or other results for which they are designed or intended.
our advanced systems are subject to update and periodic revalidation in response to changes in our business activities and our historical experiences, forces and events experienced by the market broadly or by individual financial institutions, changes in regulations and regulatory interpretations and other factors, and are also subject to continuing regulatory review and approval. for example, a significant operational loss experienced by another financial institution, even if we do not experience a related loss, could result in a material change in the output of our advanced systems and a corresponding material change in our risk exposures, our total rwa and our capital ratios compared to prior periods. an operational loss that we experience could also result in a material change in our capital requirements for operational risk under the advanced approaches, depending on the severity of the loss event, its characterization among the seven basel-defined uom, and the stability of the distributional approach for a particular uom, and without direct correlation to the effects of the loss event, or the timing of such effects, on our results of operations.
due to the influence of changes in these advanced systems, whether resulting from changes in data inputs, regulation or regulatory supervision or interpretation, specific to us or market activities or experiences or other updates or factors, we expect that our advanced systems and our capital ratios calculated in conformity with the basel iii rule will change and may be volatile over time, and that those latter changes or volatility could be material as calculated and measured from period to period. the full effects of the basel iii rule on us and state street bank are therefore subject to further evaluation and also to further regulatory guidance, action or rule-making.
management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations tier 1 and supplementary leverage ratios the slr rule requires that, as of january 1, 2018, (i) state street bank maintains an slr of at least 6.0% to be well capitalized under the u.s. banking regulators' prompt corrective action framework and (ii) we maintain an slr of at least 5.0% to avoid limitations on capital distributions and discretionary bonus payments. in addition to the slr, we are subject to a well capitalized tier 1 leverage ratio requirement of 5.0%.

total loss-absorbing capacity (tlac)
we requested and received from the federal reserve, a one-year extension from january 1, 2019 to january 1, 2020, for compliance with the ltd slr requirements of the tlac final rule. in granting the extension request, the federal reserve noted that the economic growth, regulatory relief and consumer protection act (egrrcpa) was signed into law in may 2018. under this legislation, the federal reserve and the other u.s. federal banking agencies must promulgate rules to exclude certain central bank placements from the calculation of slr for custodial banks such as us. the federal reserve and the other u.s. federal banking agencies adopted that final rule in november 2019; the rule becomes effective on april 1, 2020. accordingly, we requested and received an additional three-month extension from january 1, 2020 to april 1, 2020, for compliance with the ltd slr requirements of the rule. this regulatory change is expected to reduce the ltd we are required to hold as calculated under the current requirements, and we estimate that, had those reduced ltd requirements been in effect, we would have been in compliance with the ltd slr at december 31, 2019.
the following table presents external ltd and external tlac as of december 31, 2019. on january 24, 2020 we issued $750 million aggregate principal amount of 2.400% senior notes due in 2030.

(1) we requested and received from the federal reserve, an extension from january 1, 2019 to april 1, 2020, for compliance with the ltd slr requirements of the rule.
additional information about tlac is provided under "total loss-absorbing capacity" in "supervision and regulation" in business in this form 10-k.
regulatory developments in april 2018, the federal reserve board (frb) issued a proposed rule which would replace the current 2.0% slr buffer for g-sibs, with a buffer equal to 50% of their g-sib surcharge. this proposal would also make conforming modifications to our tlac and eligible ltd requirements applicable to g-sibs.
in addition, the frb has issued a separate proposed rule replacing the current 2.5% capital conservation buffer with a firm specific buffer (referred to as the stress capital buffer (scb)), updated annually and tailored to reflect the results of the most recent federal reserve's ccar supervisory severely adverse scenario stress test. the proposal also introduces a stress leverage buffer (slb) applicable to the tier 1 leverage ratio. changes to the final rules, if and when proposed, may be material and the application of the proposed rule involves estimates which cannot reasonably be made at the present time. consequently, we have not estimated the impact of the proposed rule.
management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in november 2019, the federal reserve and the other u.s. federal banking agencies adopted a final rule that establishes a deduction for central bank deposits from a custodial banking organization's total leverage exposure equal to the lesser of (i) the total amount of funds the custodial banking organization and its consolidated subsidiaries have on deposit at qualifying central banks and (ii) the total amount of client funds on deposit at the custodial banking organization that are linked to fiduciary or custodial and safekeeping accounts. the rule becomes effective on april 1, 2020. in the quarter ended december 31, 2019, we estimated $48.87 billion of average balances held on deposit at central banks will be excluded from the slr denominator under our interpretation of the rule, which would impact the slr by approximately 150 bps. the tlac and ltd that state street is required to hold as calculated under the current requirements will also be reduced as a consequence of the rule.
also in november 2019, the federal reserve and other us federal banking agencies issued a final rule for the standardized approach to counterparty credit risk. this change would replace the current exposure method for calculating ead for over-the-counter derivatives with a new approach. our over-the-counter derivatives exposures would be subject to this new methodology. we have not estimated the impact of the final rule as its expected effective date is in 2022 and is expected to be accompanied by other revisions to the basel iii regime.

capital actions preferred stock the following table summarizes selected terms of each of the series of the preferred stock issued and outstanding as of december 31, 2019:
table 46: preferred stock issued and outstanding preferred stock(2):   issuance date        depositary shares issued           amount outstanding (in millions)       ownership interest per depositary share           liquidation preference per share            liquidation preference per depositary share                                                                                          per annum dividend rate       dividend payment frequency                               carrying value as of december 31, 2019       redemption date(1)
(1) on the redemption date, or any dividend payment date thereafter, the preferred stock and corresponding depositary shares may be redeemed by us, in whole or in part, at the liquidation price per share and liquidation price per depositary share plus any declared and unpaid dividends, without accumulation of any undeclared dividends.
(2) the preferred stock and corresponding depositary shares may be redeemed at our option in whole, but not in part, prior to the redemption date upon the occurrence of a regulatory capital treatment event, as defined in the certificate of designation, at a redemption price equal to the liquidation price per share and liquidation price per depositary share plus any declared and unpaid dividends, without accumulation of any undeclared dividends.
management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in the fourth quarter of 2019, we requested and received approval from the federal reserve to redeem our outstanding series e non-cumulative perpetual preferred stock. we redeemed all outstanding shares as of december 15, 2019 at a redemption price of $750 million ($100,000 per share equivalent to $25.00 per depositary share) plus accrued and unpaid dividends. the difference between the redemption value and the net carrying value of $22 million resulted in an eps impact of approximately ($0.06) per share in 2019.
on february 12, 2020, we announced that we will redeem all 5,000 of our outstanding shares of our non-cumulative perpetual preferred stock, series c, for cash at a redemption price of $100,000 per share (equivalent to $25.00 per depositary share) plus all declared and unpaid dividends. the redemption price will be payable on march 16, 2020, and this redemption will be reflected in our first quarter 2020 results of operations.
the following tables present the dividends declared for each of the series of preferred stock issued and outstanding for the periods indicated:
common stock in june 2019, the federal reserve issued a non-objection to our capital plan submitted as part of the 2019 ccar submission; and in connection with that capital plan, our board approved a common stock purchase program authorizing the purchase of up to $2.0 billion of our common stock from july 1, 2019 through june 30, 2020 (the 2019 program). we repurchased $500 million of our common stock in each of the third and fourth quarters of 2019 under the 2019 program.
in june 2018, the federal reserve issued a conditional non-objection to our 2018 capital plan; and in connection with that capital plan, our board approved a common stock purchase program authorizing the purchase of up to $1.2 billion of our common stock through june 30, 2019 (the 2018 program), under which we repurchased $300 million of our common stock in each of the first and second quarters of 2019.
the table below presents the activity under our common stock purchase program during the year ended december 31, 2019:
management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations federal and state banking regulations place certain restrictions on dividends paid by subsidiary banks to the parent holding company. in addition, banking regulators have the authority to prohibit bank holding companies from paying dividends. for information concerning limitations on dividends from our subsidiary banks, refer to "related stockholder matters" included under item 5, market for registrant's common equity, related stockholder matters and issuer purchases of equity securities, and to note 15 to the consolidated financial statements in this form 10-k. our common stock and preferred stock dividends, including the declaration, timing and amount thereof, are subject to consideration and approval by the board at the relevant times.
stock purchases may be made using various types of mechanisms, including open market purchases, accelerated share repurchases or transactions off market and may be made under rule 10b5-1 trading programs. the timing of stock purchases, types of transactions and number of shares purchased will depend on several factors, including, market conditions and our capital positions, financial performance and investment opportunities. the common stock purchase program does not have specific price targets and may be suspended at any time.
off-balance sheet arrangements on behalf of clients enrolled in our securities lending program, we lend securities to banks, broker/dealers and other institutions. in most circumstances, we indemnify our clients for the fair market value of those securities against a failure of the borrower to return such securities. though these transactions are collateralized, the substantial volume of these activities necessitates detailed credit-based underwriting and monitoring processes. the aggregate amount of indemnified securities on loan totaled $367.90 billion and $342.34 billion as of december 31, 2019 and december 31, 2018, respectively. we require the borrower to provide collateral in an amount in excess of 100% of the fair market value of the securities borrowed. we hold the collateral received in connection with these securities lending services as agent, and the collateral is not recorded in our consolidated statement of condition. we revalue the securities on loan and the collateral daily to determine if additional collateral is necessary or if excess collateral is required to be returned to the borrower. we held, as agent, cash and securities totaling $385.43 billion and $357.89 billion as collateral for indemnified securities on loan as of december 31, 2019 and december 31, 2018, respectively.
the cash collateral held by us as agent is invested on behalf of our clients. in certain cases, the cash collateral is invested in third-party repurchase agreements, for which we indemnify the client against loss of the principal invested. we require the counterparty to the indemnified repurchase agreement to provide collateral in an amount in excess of 100% of the amount of the repurchase agreement. in our role as agent, the indemnified repurchase agreements and the related collateral held by us are not recorded in our consolidated statement of condition. of the collateral of $385.43 billion and $357.89 billion, referenced above, $45.66 billion and $42.61 billion was invested in indemnified repurchase agreements as of december 31, 2019 and december 31, 2018, respectively. we or our agents held $48.89 billion and $45.06 billion as collateral for indemnified investments in repurchase agreements as of december 31, 2019 and december 31, 2018, respectively.
additional information about our securities finance activities and other off-balance sheet arrangements is provided in notes 10, 12 and 14 to the consolidated financial statements in this form 10-k.
significant accounting estimates our consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with u.s. gaap, and we apply accounting policies that affect the determination of amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements. additional information on our significant accounting policies, including references to applicable footnotes, is provided in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements in this form 10-k.
certain of our accounting policies, by their nature, require management to make judgments, involving significant estimates and assumptions, about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain. these estimates and assumptions are based on information available as of the date of the consolidated financial statements, and changes in this information over time could materially affect the amounts of assets, liabilities, equity, revenue and expenses reported in subsequent consolidated financial statements.
based on the sensitivity of reported financial statement amounts to the underlying estimates and assumptions, the more significant accounting policies applied by us have been identified by management as those associated with recurring fair value measurements, impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets, and contingencies. these accounting policies require the most subjective or complex judgments, and underlying estimates and assumptions could be most subject to revision as new information becomes available. an understanding of the judgments, estimates and assumptions underlying these accounting policies is essential in order to understand our reported consolidated results of operations and financial condition.
the following is a discussion of the above-mentioned significant accounting estimates.
management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations management has discussed these significant accounting estimates with the e&a committee of the board.
fair value measurements we carry certain of our financial assets and liabilities at fair value in our consolidated financial statements on a recurring basis, including trading account assets and liabilities, afs debt securities, certain equity securities and various types of derivative financial instruments.
changes in the fair value of these financial assets and liabilities are recorded either as components of our consolidated statement of income or as components of other comprehensive income within shareholders' equity in our consolidated statement of condition. in addition to those financial assets and liabilities that we carry at fair value in our consolidated financial statements on a recurring basis, we estimate the fair values of other financial assets and liabilities that we carry at amortized cost in our consolidated statement of condition, and we disclose these fair value estimates in the notes to our consolidated financial statements. we estimate the fair values of these financial assets and liabilities using the definition of fair value described below. additional information with respect to the assets and liabilities carried by us at fair value on a recurring basis is provided in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements in this form 10-k.
u.s. gaap defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in the principal or most advantageous market for an asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. when we measure fair value for our financial assets and liabilities, we consider the principal or the most advantageous market in which we would transact; we also consider assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability. when possible, we look to active and observable markets to measure the fair value of identical, or similar, financial assets and liabilities. when identical financial assets and liabilities are not traded in active markets, we look to market-observable data for similar assets and liabilities. in some instances, certain assets and liabilities are not actively traded in observable markets; as a result, we use alternate valuation techniques to measure their fair value.
we categorize the financial assets and liabilities that we carry at fair value in our consolidated statement of condition on a recurring basis based on u.s. gaap's prescribed three-level valuation hierarchy. the hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (level 1) and the lowest priority to valuation methods using significant unobservable inputs (level 3).
with respect to derivative instruments, we evaluated the fair value impact of the credit risk of our counterparties. we considered such factors as the market-based probability of default by our counterparties, and our current and expected potential future net exposures by remaining maturities, in determining the appropriate measurements of fair value.
goodwill and other intangible assets goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquisition over the fair value of the net tangible and other intangible assets acquired at the acquisition date. other intangible assets represent purchased long-lived intangible assets, primarily client relationships, core deposit intangible assets and technology that can be distinguished from goodwill because of contractual rights or because the asset can be exchanged on its own or in combination with a related contract, asset or liability. other intangible assets are initially measured at their acquisition date fair value, the determination of which requires management judgment. goodwill is not amortized, while other intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives.
management reviews goodwill for impairment annually or more frequently if circumstances arise or events occur that indicate an impairment of the carrying amount may exist. we begin our review by first assessing qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. events that may indicate impairment include: significant or adverse changes in the business, economic or political climate; an adverse action or assessment by a regulator; unanticipated competition; and a more-likely-than-not expectation that we will sell or otherwise dispose of a business to which the goodwill or other intangible assets relate. if we conclude from the qualitative assessment of goodwill impairment that it is more likely than not that a reporting unit's fair value is greater than its carrying amount, quantitative tests are not required. however, if we determine it is more likely than not that a reporting unit's fair value is less than its carrying amount, then we complete a quantitative assessment to determine if there is goodwill impairment. we may elect to bypass the qualitative assessment and complete a quantitative assessment in any given year.
in 2019, due to the passage of time since the last quantitative test, we elected to bypass the qualitative assessment and we assessed goodwill for impairment using a quantitative approach.  we determined there was no goodwill impairment in 2019.
other intangible assets are supported by the future cash flows that are directly associated with and expected to arise as a direct result of the use of the intangible asset, less any costs associated with the intangible asset's eventual disposition. we evaluate state street corporation | 116
management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations other intangible assets for impairment at the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows from other groups of assets using the following process.  first, we routinely assess whether impairment indicators are present. when impairment indicators are identified as being present, we compare the estimated future net undiscounted cash flows of the intangible asset with its carrying value. if the future net undiscounted cash flows are greater than the carrying value, then there is no impairment, but if the intangible asset's net undiscounted cash flows are less than its carrying value, we are required to calculate impairment. an impairment is recognized by writing the intangible asset down to its fair value.  we evaluate intangible assets for indicators of impairment on a quarterly basis. there were no impairments taken on other intangible assets in 2019.

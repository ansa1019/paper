management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (md&a)
presentation the consolidated financial statements of general electric company (the company) combine the industrial manufacturing and services businesses of general electric company (ge) with the financial services businesses of ge capital global holdings, llc (ge capital or financial services) and its predecessor, general electric capital corporation.
we believe that investors will gain a better understanding of our company if they understand how we measure and talk about our results. because of the diversity in our businesses, we present our financial statements in a three-column format, which allows investors to see our industrial operations separately from our financial services operations. we believe that this provides useful information to investors. when used in this report, unless otherwise indicated by the context, we use the terms to mean the following:
•   ge - the adding together of all affiliates except ge capital, whose continuing operations are presented on a one-line basis, giving effect to the elimination of transactions among such affiliates. as ge presents the continuing operations of ge capital on a one-line basis, certain intercompany profits resulting from transactions between ge and ge capital have been eliminated at the ge level. we present the results of ge in the center column of our consolidated statements of earnings, financial position and cash flows. an example of a ge metric is ge cash from operating activities (ge cfoa).
•   general electric capital corporation or gecc - predecessor to ge capital global holdings, llc.
•   ge capital global holdings, llc or gecgh - the adding together of all affiliates of gecgh, giving effect to the elimination of transactions among such affiliates.
•   ge capital or financial services - refers to gecgh, or its predecessor gecc, and is the adding together of all affiliates of ge capital giving effect to the elimination of transactions among such affiliates. we present the results of ge capital in the right-side column of our consolidated statements of earnings, financial position and cash flows.
•   ge consolidated - the adding together of ge and ge capital, giving effect to the elimination of transactions between the two. we present the results of ge consolidated in the left-side column of our consolidated statements of earnings, financial position and cash flows.
•   ge industrial - ge excluding the continuing operations of ge capital. we believe that this provides investors with a view as to the results of our industrial businesses and corporate items. an example of a ge industrial metric is ge industrial cfoa (non-gaap), as defined in other terms used by ge below.
•   industrial segment - the sum of our seven industrial reporting segments, without giving effect to the elimination of transactions among such segments and between these segments and our financial services segment. this provides investors with a view as to the results of our industrial segments, without inter-segment eliminations and corporate items. an example of an industrial segment metric is industrial segment revenue growth.
•   baker hughes, a ge company or bhge - following the combination of our oil &amp; gas business with baker hughes incorporated, our oil &amp; gas segment is comprised of our ownership interest of approximately 62.5% in the new company formed in the transaction, baker hughes, a ge company (bhge). we consolidate 100% of bhge's revenues and cash flows, while our oil &amp; gas segment profit and net income are derived net of minority interest of approximately 37.5% attributable to bhge's class a shareholders. references to "baker hughes" represent legacy baker hughes incorporated operating activities which, in certain cases, have been excluded from our results for comparative purposes.
•   total segment - the sum of our seven industrial segments and one financial services segment, without giving effect to the elimination of transactions between such segments. this provides investors with a view as to the results of all of our segments, without inter-segment eliminations and corporate items.
•   verticals or ge capital verticals - the adding together of ge capital businesses, principally its vertical financing businesses-ge capital aviation services (gecas), energy financial services (efs) and industrial finance (which includes healthcare equipment finance, working capital solutions and industrial financing solutions)-that relate to the company's core industrial domain and other operations, including our run-off insurance operations, and allocated corporate costs.
14 ge 2017 form 10-k md&amp;a we integrate acquisitions as quickly as possible. revenues and earnings from the date we complete the acquisition through the end of the fourth quarter following the acquisition are considered the acquisition effect of such businesses.
amounts reported in billions in graphs within this report are computed based on the amounts in millions. as a result, the sum of the components reported in billions may not equal the total amount reported in billions due to rounding.  certain columns and rows within the tables may not add due to the use of rounded numbers. percentages presented are calculated from the underlying numbers in millions.
the md&a should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes to the consolidated financial statements.

2017 significant developments
•   on january 10, 2017, we completed the acquisition of servicemax, a leader in cloud-based field service management (fsm) solutions, for $0.9 billion, net of cash acquired.
•   on april 20, 2017, we completed the acquisition of lm wind power, one of the world's largest wind turbine blade manufacturers for approximately $1.7 billion, net of cash acquired.
•   on july 3, 2017, we completed the transaction to create baker hughes, a ge company (bhge). we combined our oil &amp; gas business and baker hughes incorporated (baker hughes) to create a new company in which ge holds an ownership interest of approximately 62.5% and former baker hughes shareholders hold an ownership interest of approximately 37.5%. baker hughes shareholders also received a cash dividend funded by a $7.5 billion cash contribution from ge. effective july 3, 2017, the operations of baker hughes are reported in our oil &amp; gas segment.
•   on march 8, 2017, we signed an agreement to sell our water business within our power segment to suez environnement s.a. (suez). on september 30, 2017, we completed the sale for consideration of $3.1 billion, net of obligations assumed and cash transferred (including $0.1 billion from the sale of receivables originated in our water business and sold from ge capital to suez), and recognized a pre-tax gain of $1.9 billion in the third quarter of 2017.
•   in the first quarter of 2017, we classified our industrial solutions business within our power segment as held for sale. in september 2017, we announced an agreement to sell the business for approximately $2.6 billion to asea brown boveri (abb), a swiss-based engineering company. the deal is expected to close in mid-2018, subject to customary closing conditions and regulatory approval.
•   in the fourth quarter of 2017, we classified the substantial majority of our lighting segment and two nonstrategic aviation businesses as held for sale. in connection with this determination, we adjusted the carrying value of each business classified as held for sale to fair value, less cost to sell, which resulted in a pre-tax loss of $0.8 billion related to lighting and $0.6 billion related to aviation. these losses have been recorded at corporate. in february 2018, we entered into an agreement to sell our ge lighting business in europe, the middle east, africa and turkey and our global automotive lighting business to a company controlled by a former ge executive in the region. the proposed transaction is expected to close in mid-2018, subject to customary closing conditions and local agreements.
•   on december 22, 2017, the u.s. enacted the tax cuts and jobs act ("u.s. tax reform") that lowers the statutory tax rate on u.s. earnings, taxes historic foreign earnings at a reduced rate of tax, establishes a territorial tax system and enacts new taxes associated with global operations. as a result of the enactment of u.s. tax reform, we have recorded tax expense of $3.3 billion in 2017 to reflect our provisional estimate of both the transition tax on historic foreign earnings ($1.2 billion) and the revaluation of deferred taxes ($2.2 billion).
•   on january 16, 2018, ge reported the results of a review of premium deficiency assumptions related to ge capital's run-off insurance business. with the completion of that review and of the annual premium deficiency test, ge recorded an increase in future policy benefit reserves of $8.9 billion and $0.6 billion of related intangible asset write-off for the fourth quarter of 2017. this resulted in an after-tax charge of $6.2 billion to ge's earnings in the fourth quarter of 2017. in addition, ge capital will contribute approximately $15 billion of capital to its run-off insurance business over the next seven years. ge capital plans to make its first contribution of approximately $3.5 billion in the first quarter of 2018 and expects to make further contributions of approximately $2 billion per year in each of the six following years, subject to ongoing monitoring by the kansas insurance department, its primary regulator. ge capital plans to fund the capital contributions with its excess liquidity and other ge capital portfolio actions and does not expect to make a common share dividend distribution to ge for the foreseeable future.
•   ge also announced that it plans to take actions to make ge capital smaller and more focused, including a substantial reduction in the size of ge capital's energy financial services and industrial finance businesses over the next 24 months. those actions resulted in goodwill and other asset impairment charges of $1.8 billion on an after-tax basis in the fourth quarter of 2017.
summary of 2017 results overall, our consolidated results for the year were significantly below our expectations. after adjusting for incremental baker hughes revenues of $5.2 billion, the water gain of $1.9 billion, fair market value adjustments on businesses classified as held for sale of $1.4 billion and the 2016 gains on appliances and ge asset management of $3.1 billion and $0.4 billion, respectively, adjusted consolidated revenues*, which includes other income, were $116.3 billion, down $3.8 billion or 3%. this decrease was largely driven by the net effect of dispositions on industrial segment revenues of $3.3 billion, primarily attributable to appliances. industrial segment revenues increased $0.1 billion organically* driven principally by our aviation, renewable energy and healthcare segments. excluding our power and oil & gas segments, industrial segment revenues increased $1.7 billion, or 3%, organically*.
continuing earnings (loss) per share was $(0.68), and industrial operating plus verticals earnings per share* was $(0.45), driven by a 16% decrease in industrial segment profit as well as $1.49 of charges recognized in the fourth quarter as follows: ge capital insurance-related charges of $0.91 per share, including $0.71 related to the completion of ge capital's insurance premium deficiency review and $0.20 related to efs impairments; tax-reform related charges of $0.40 per share; industrial portfolio-related charges of $0.18 per share, including $0.15 per share related to fair market value adjustments on businesses classified as held for sale and $0.13 related to goodwill impairment in our power conversation business.
md&amp;a   consolidated results for the twelve months ended december 31, 2017, restructuring and other charges were $0.46 per share, including $0.05 per share related to bhge integration and synergy investment. in total, restructuring and other items were $5.3 billion before tax, with restructuring charges totaling about $2.7 billion and businesses development charges totaling $0.8 billion. subsequent to the baker hughes transaction and beginning in the third quarter of 2017, $0.5 billion of restructuring charges and $0.2 billion of business development charges related to bhge are reported under our oil & gas segment. restructuring charges were higher than originally planned, driven by the accelerated restructuring actions taken at corporate. additionally, within restructuring and other charges, we recognized two significant impairments in the year totaling $0.16 per share, which included non-cash pre-tax impairment charges of $1.2 billion related to goodwill in our power conversion business and $0.3 billion related to a power plant asset. see note 8 to the consolidated financial statements for further information.
for the twelve months ended december 31, 2017, ge industrial profit was $6.6 billion and ge industrial margins were 5.7%, down $6.5 billion, or 570 basis points, primarily driven by a reduction in industrial segment profit of $2.9 billion, or 16%, as well as increased non-cash charges recorded at corporate of $2.9 billion, including impairment charges and charges associated with businesses classified as held for sale, and lower gains of $1.5 billion from disposed businesses, partially offset by decreased restructuring and other charges of $0.5 billion and lower corporate costs of $0.5 billion. the decline in industrial segment profit was primarily due to lower results within our power and oil & gas segments, partially offset by the performance of our aviation and healthcare segments. in 2017, we exceeded our structural cost* reduction target for the year of $1.0 billion, delivering $1.7 billion of structural cost* reduction, excluding the effects of acquisition and disposition activity.
beginning in the third quarter of 2017, the energy connections business within the former energy connections & lighting segment was combined with the power segment and presented as one reporting segment called power. for the year ended december 31, 2017, the power segment experienced a revenue decline of 2% and a segment profit decline of 45% versus 2016. power revenues were $36.0 billion, with service revenues down 6% and equipment revenues up 2%.
the decline in power segment results was primarily driven by market demands that were softer than expected, resulting in 55 fewer shipments of aeroderivative units as well as 65 fewer advanced gas path upgrades when compared to the year ended december 31, 2016. in addition, we recorded pre-tax charges of $0.9 billion in the fourth quarter primarily related to slow moving and obsolete inventory across several businesses within power, a litigation settlement and a bankruptcy of a distributor.
in response to these conditions, in 2017, power focused on cost reduction actions, removing $0.8 billion of structural costs, excluding the effects of acquisition and disposition activity. refer to the power segment results section within this md&a for further information.
beginning in the third quarter of 2017, our oil & gas segment is comprised of our ownership interest of approximately 62.5% in the combined bhge entity. we consolidate 100% of bhge's revenues and cash flows while segment profit and net income are derived net of minority ownership interest of approximately 37.5% attributable to bhge's class a shareholders. also, the segment profit we report for our oil & gas segment is adjusted for ge reporting conventions, such as excluding restructuring and other charges. therefore, our segment profit of approximately 62.5% will differ from bhge's operating income as reported in its standalone financial statements.
for the year ended december 31, 2017, oil & gas reported revenues of $17.2 billion, an increase of 34% versus the year ended december 31, 2016, driven by the effects of the baker hughes transaction. adjusting for the baker hughes transaction, segment revenues* were $12.0 billion in the year, down 7% due to continued weakness in the oil and gas market. segment profit was $220 million, or $899 million after adjusting for restructuring and other charges reported in the segment*. the decline in segment profit (after adjusting for restructuring and other charges reported in the segment*) of 35% was primarily driven by longer cycle oilfield equipment business. refer to the oil & gas segment results section within this md&a for further information.
ge cfoa was $11.0 billion and $29.9 billion for the twelve months ended december 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. the decline in ge cfoa is primarily due to a $16.1 billion decrease in dividends from ge capital, reflecting a decrease in proceeds from disposals related to the ge capital exit plan. ge cfoa was also impacted by lower earnings from power and oil & gas, as well as lower cash generated from working capital compared to 2016. additionally, ge cfoa was negatively impacted by ge pension plan payments of $1.7 billion in 2017, compared to $0.3 billion in the prior year. ge did not receive a common share dividend distribution from ge capital in the second half of 2017, and it does not expect to receive such dividend distributions from ge capital for the foreseeable future. refer to the ge cash flows and critical accounting estimates sections within this md&a for further information.

(a)   included $1.6 billion, $4.0 billion, and $2.2 billion of other income primarily attributable to net gains on purchases and sales of business interests of $0.7 billion, $3.7 billion, and $1.0 billion in 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively. see note 17 to the consolidated financial statements for further information.
(b)   ge industrial refers to ge excluding the continuing operations of ge capital. industrial segment refers to the sum of our seven industrial reporting segments, without giving effect to corporate items or the elimination of transactions among such segments and between these segments and our financial services segment.
consolidated revenues decreased $1.6 billion, or 1%, primarily driven by decreased financial services revenues of $1.8 billion and decreased corporate revenues of $3.1 billion, partially offset by increased industrial segment revenues of $3.3 billion. the overall foreign currency impact on consolidated revenues was an increase of $0.6 billion. below are descriptions of the components:
•   ge industrial revenues remained flat for the year due to an increase in industrial segment revenues of $3.3 billion offset by a decrease in corporate revenues and industrial eliminations of $3.3 billion.
industrial segment revenues increased $3.3 billion, or 3%, as increases at oil & gas, renewable energy, aviation and healthcare were partially offset by decreases at power, transportation and lighting. this increase was driven by the net effects of acquisitions of $6.0 billion, primarily attributable to baker hughes, and the effects of a weaker u.s. dollar of $0.6 billion, partially offset by the net effects of dispositions of $3.4 billion, primarily attributable to appliances. excluding the effects of acquisitions, dispositions and translational currency exchange, industrial segment organic revenues* increased $0.1 billion.
corporate revenues and industrial eliminations decreased $3.3 billion primarily driven by lower gains on disposed businesses and higher non-cash held for sale charges. included in 2016 were gains of $3.1 billion from the sale of our appliances business and $0.4 billion from the sale of ge asset management, while 2017 included a gain of $1.9 billion from the sale of our water business as well as charges associated with businesses classified as held for sale including the substantial majority of our lighting segment for $0.8 billion and two nonstrategic aviation businesses for $0.6 billion.
•   financial services revenues decreased $1.8 billion, or 17%, primarily due to higher impairments and organic revenue declines.
consolidated revenues increased $6.3 billion, or 5%, primarily driven by increased industrial segment revenues of $4.2 billion, increased corporate revenues of $2.0 billion and increased financial services revenues of $0.1 billion. the overall foreign currency impact on consolidated revenues was a decrease of $1.3 billion. below are descriptions of the components:
•   ge industrial revenues increased $6.6 billion, or 6%, driven by increased industrial segment revenues of $4.2 billion and increased corporate revenues and industrial eliminations of $2.3 billion.
industrial segment revenues increased $4.2 billion, or 4%, as increases at power, renewable energy, aviation and healthcare were partially offset by decreases at oil & gas, transportation and lighting. this increase in industrial segment revenues was driven by the net effects of acquisitions of $11.2 billion, primarily attributable to alstom, offset by the net effects of dispositions of $5.6 billion, primarily attributable to appliances, and the effects of a stronger u.s. dollar of $0.8 billion. excluding the effects of acquisitions, dispositions and translational currency exchange, industrial segment organic revenues* decreased $0.5 billion.
corporate revenues and industrial eliminations increased $2.3 billion driven by higher gains of $1.9 billion. included in 2016 are gains of $3.1 billion from the sale of our appliances business and $0.4 billion from the sale of ge asset management, while 2015 included gains of $0.6 billion from the sale of our signaling business and $0.5 billion from a settlement related to the nbcu transaction.
•   financial services revenues increased $0.1 billion, or 1%, primarily due to lower impairments, higher gains and the effects of acquisitions, partially offset by organic revenue declines, the effects of dispositions and the effects of translational currency exchange.
in the below discussion, ge industrial refers to ge excluding the continuing operations of ge capital. industrial segment refers to the sum of our seven industrial reporting segments, without giving effect to corporate items or the elimination of transactions among such segments and between these segments and our financial services segment.
consolidated continuing earnings decreased $15.0 billion, driven by decreased ge industrial continuing earnings of $6.5 billion, increased financial services losses of $5.5 billion, increased ge industrial income taxes of $2.3 billion and increased interest and other financial charges of $0.7 billion.
•   ge industrial earnings decreased $6.5 billion, or 49%, driven by a decrease in corporate profit of $3.6 billion and a decrease in industrial segment profit of $2.9 billion.
corporate profit decreased $3.6 billion primarily attributable to increased non-cash charges of $2.9 billion including goodwill impairment of $1.2 billion, a power plant asset impairment of $0.3 billion, and charges associated with businesses classified as held for sale including the substantial majority of our lighting segment for $0.8 billion and two nonstrategic aviation businesses for $0.6 billion. in addition, corporate recorded lower gains of $1.5 billion. included in 2016 were gains of $3.1 billion from the sale of our appliances business and $0.4 billion from the disposition of ge asset management, while 2017 included a gain of $1.9 billion from the sale of our water business. pension costs were also $0.2 billion higher, partially offset by decreased restructuring and other costs of $0.5 billion and decreased adjusted corporate operating costs* of $0.5 billion.
industrial segment profit decreased $2.9 billion, or 16%, with decreases at power, oil & gas and transportation partially offset by higher earnings at aviation, healthcare, renewable energy and lighting. this decrease in industrial segment profit was primarily driven by restructuring costs related to baker hughes of $0.7 billion and the net effects of dispositions of $0.2 billion, largely associated with appliances, partially offset by the net effects of acquisitions $0.3 billion, largely associated with baker hughes. excluding these items, industrial segment organic profit* decreased $2.3 billion.
•   foreign exchange adversely affected industrial operating earnings by an insignificant amount in 2017.
•   financial services losses increased $5.5 billion, primarily due to a $6.2 billion after-tax charge related to the completion of ge capital's insurance premium deficiency review, as well as efs strategic actions resulting in $1.8 billion of after-tax charges in addition to higher impairments, partially offset by lower headquarters and treasury operation expenses associated with the ge capital exit plan, higher tax benefits including the effects of u.s. tax reform and lower preferred dividend expenses associated with the january 2016 preferred equity exchange.
consolidated continuing earnings increased $7.5 billion, driven by decreased financial services losses of $6.7 billion, increased ge industrial continuing earnings of $0.5 billion and decreased net ge industrial income taxes, interest and financial charges of $0.2 billion.
•   ge industrial earnings increased $0.5 billion due to an increase in corporate profit of $0.9 billion, partially offset by a decrease in industrial segment profit of $0.4 billion.
corporate profit increased $0.9 billion, or 17%, driven by higher gains of $1.9 billion. included in 2016 are gains of $3.1 billion from the sale of our appliances business and $0.4 billion from the sale of ge asset management, while 2015 included gains of $0.6 billion from the sale of our signaling business and $0.5 billion from a settlement related to the nbcu transaction. in addition, pension costs were $0.7 billion lower, partially offset by $1.8 billion of higher restructuring and other charges primarily related to alstom.
industrial segment profit decreased $0.4 billion, or 2%, with decreases at oil & gas, lighting, and transportation partially offset by increases at aviation, power, healthcare and renewable energy. this decrease in industrial segment profit was primarily driven by the net effects of dispositions of $0.5 billion, largely associated with appliances, offset by the net effect of acquisitions of $0.9 billion, largely associated with alstom. excluding these items, industrial segment organic profit* decreased $0.8 billion.
•   interest and other financial charges increased $0.3 billion, while ge industrial income taxes decreased $0.5 billion.
•   foreign exchange adversely affected industrial operating earnings by $0.3 billion in 2016.
•   financial services losses decreased $6.7 billion, or 84%, primarily due to the nonrecurrence of the 2015 charges associated with the ge capital exit plan.

24 ge 2017 form 10-k md&amp;a   consolidated results ge digital ge digital's activities are focused on assisting in the market development of our digital product offerings through software design, fulfillment and product management, while also interfacing with our customers. digital revenues include internally developed software and associated hardware, including predix and software solutions that improve our customers' asset performance. these revenues and associated costs are largely generated from our operating businesses and are included in their segment results.
revenues were $4.0 billion for the year ended december 31, 2017, an increase of $0.4 billion or 12% compared to revenues of $3.6 billion for the year ended december 31, 2016. these increases were principally driven by power, renewable energy and non-ge verticals. revenues were $3.6 billion for the year ended december 31, 2016, an increase of $0.5 billion or 16% compared to revenues of $3.1 billion for the year ended december 31, 2015. these increases were principally driven by power, oil & gas and non-ge verticals.
orders were $5.2 billion for the year ended december 31, 2017, an increase of $1.1 billion or 27% compared to orders of $4.1 billion for the year ended december 31, 2016. these increases were principally driven by oil & gas, non-ge verticals, power and renewable energy. orders were $4.1 billion for the year ended december 31, 2016, an increase of $0.7 billion or 22% compared to orders of $3.3 billion for the year ended december 31, 2015. these increases were principally driven by power, oil & gas, non-ge verticals and renewable energy.
segment operations revenues and profit segment revenues include revenues and other income related to the segment.
segment profit is determined based on internal performance measures used by the chief executive officer (ceo) to assess the performance of each business in a given period. in connection with that assessment, the ceo may exclude matters, such as charges for restructuring, rationalization and other similar expenses, acquisition costs and other related charges, technology and product development costs, certain gains and losses from acquisitions or dispositions, and litigation settlements or other charges, for which responsibility preceded the current management team. subsequent to the baker hughes transaction, restructuring and other charges are included in the determination of segment profit for our oil & gas segment. see the corporate items and eliminations section within this md&a for additional information about costs excluded from segment profit.
segment profit excludes results reported as discontinued operations and material accounting changes. segment profit also excludes the portion of earnings or loss attributable to noncontrolling interests of consolidated subsidiaries, and as such only includes the portion of earnings or loss attributable to our share of the consolidated earnings or loss of consolidated subsidiaries.
segment profit excludes or includes interest and other financial charges, income taxes, and preferred stock dividends according to how a particular segment's management is measured:
•   interest and other financial charges, income taxes and ge preferred stock dividends are excluded in determining segment profit (which we sometimes refer to as "operating profit") for the industrial segments.
•   interest and other financial charges, income taxes and ge capital preferred stock dividends are included in determining segment profit (which we sometimes refer to as "net earnings") for the capital segment.
certain corporate costs, such as shared services, employee benefits, and information technology, are allocated to our segments based on usage. a portion of the remaining corporate costs is allocated based on each segment's relative net cost of operations.
significant segment developments inclusion of energy connections in power reporting segment beginning in the third quarter of 2017, the energy connections business within the former energy connections & lighting segment was combined with the power segment and presented as one reporting segment called power. as a result of the combination, our ge lighting and current, powered by ge (current) businesses are now reported as a separate segment called lighting.
classification of the substantial majority of our lighting segment as held for sale in the fourth quarter of 2017, we classified the substantial majority of our lighting segment as held for sale. in connection with this determination, we adjusted the carrying value of each business classified as held for sale to fair value, less cost to sell, which resulted in a pre-tax loss of $0.8 billion. this loss has been recorded at corporate.

•   industrial segment revenues increased $3.3 billion, or 3%, driven by increases at oil &amp; gas primarily due to baker hughes, renewable energy, aviation and healthcare, partially offset by decreases at power, transportation and lighting.
•   industrial segment profit decreased $2.9 billion, or 16%, primarily due to lower earnings at power driven by negative variable cost productivity, oil &amp; gas primarily due to restructuring costs associated with baker hughes, and transportation driven by lower volume and negative variable cost productivity. these decreases were partially offset by higher earnings at aviation, healthcare, renewable energy and lighting.
•   industrial segment margin decreased 230 basis points to 13.3% in 2017 from 15.6% in 2016 driven by negative cost productivity, price pressure and business mix. the decrease in industrial segment margin reflects decreases at power, oil &amp; gas and transportation, offset by increases at aviation, renewable energy, healthcare and lighting.
•   industrial segment revenues increased $4.2 billion, or 4%, primarily driven by increases at power and renewable energy, mainly due to the effects of the alstom acquisition, as well as an organic* increase at renewable energy, partially offset by lower revenues at oil &amp; gas and transportation, including the effects of foreign currency exchange of $0.3 billion at oil &amp; gas.
•   industrial segment acquisition revenues, driven by alstom, were partially offset by the effects of disposition revenues related to the sale of appliances in the second quarter of 2016 and sales of meters, intelligent platforms embedded systems products and signaling businesses in 2015.
•   industrial segment profit decreased $0.4 billion, or 2%, mainly driven by lower earnings organically* at oil &amp; gas, lighting and transportation, as well as an unfavorable impact of foreign exchange, partially offset by higher earnings at aviation, power, healthcare and renewable energy.
•   industrial segment profit margin decreased 90 basis points to 15.6% in 2016 from 16.5% in 2015, primarily driven by the effects of alstom results. excluding alstom*, industrial segment profit margin was 16.8%, compared with 17.0% in 2015, reflecting core decreases at power, oil &amp; gas and lighting, that more than offset increases at aviation, healthcare and transportation.

28 ge 2017 form 10-k md&amp;a   segment operations | power significant trends &amp; developments
•   in june of 2017, we announced the merger of the ge power and ge energy connections businesses to create one power-focused business called ge power.
•   in june of 2017, steve bolze, former president &amp; ceo of legacy ge power, announced his retirement with russell stokes assuming the role of president &amp; ceo of the new ge power business unit.
•   we completed the sale of our water &amp; process technologies business to suez in october 2017.
•   we announced our plan to sell our industrial solutions business to abb with a planned completion in the first half of 2018, subject to customary closing conditions and regulatory approval.
•   the new, combined ge power business, will and has driven better customer focus, fewer redundancies and lower costs. however, to establish this new structure, we have had to execute significant restructuring actions.
•   the integration of alstom's thermal and grid businesses has continued to yield significant efficiencies in supply chain, service infrastructure, new product development and sg&amp;a costs.
•   digital offerings have been developed to further complement our equipment and services business and drive value and better outcomes for our customers.
•   the business has continued to invest in new product development, such as our ha-turbines, reciprocating engines, advanced upgrades, substation automation, connected controls, micro-grids, energy storage and digital solutions, to expand our equipment and services offerings.
•   subsequent to the large investment needed to develop our ha-turbines, we expect overall research and development costs to decrease going forward in order to better align with the economic realities of the end demand markets.
•   changing customer behaviors and shifts in demand to new regional markets are requiring offerings that can include extended scope and financing.
•   significant declines in the market have prompted a deeper analysis of inventory utilization and resulted in additional charges related to slow-moving and obsolete inventory in our power services, gas power systems and power conversion businesses.
•   power faces pressure in the market driven by a changing energy mix with more emphasis on renewables and lower demand for thermal generation affecting both new unit additions and installed base services.
•   macroeconomic and geopolitical environments, excess capacity in developed markets and continued pressure in oil and gas applications result in uncertainty for the industry and business.
•   we expect the overall market for new gas orders in 2018 to be less than 35 gigawatts, and we are executing restructuring efforts in 2018 to support a market that could be as low as 30 gigawatts next year. we expect restructuring efforts to continue into 2019.
•   in 2017, we reduced structural costs* by $0.8 billion, excluding the effects of acquisition and disposition activity, for the year and reduced our manufacturing and repair footprint by 15 sites.
•   we have made significant changes and are heavily focused on improving our operational and project execution across every business in power. we expect operations to stabilize in 2018, with improving execution, a refocused services strategy and strong execution on cost reduction.

segment profit down $2.3 billion (45%):
•   the power market continues to be challenged by the increasing penetration of renewable energy, fleet penetration for agps, lower capacity payments, utilization, and service outages which decreased 8% from the prior year. in addition, excess capacity in developed markets, continued pressure in oil and gas applications and macroeconomic and geopolitical environments have created uncertainty in the industry.
services revenues decreased primarily at power services due to 65 fewer agp upgrades. equipment revenues increased primarily at gas power systems due to higher balance of plant as well as 46 more heat recovery steam generator shipments, partially offset by two fewer gas turbine and 55 fewer aeroderivative units. revenues further decreased due to the disposition of the water business in september 2017 and price pressure, partially offset by the effects of a weaker u.s. dollar versus the euro and the brazilian real.
•   the decrease in profit was partially driven by $0.9 billion of charges in the fourth quarter primarily related to slow moving and obsolete inventory in power services, gas power systems, and power conversion, a litigation settlement and a bankruptcy of a distributor. profit further declined due to negative variable cost productivity, unfavorable business mix due to higher revenues from lower margin balance of plant volume and fewer higher margin aeroderivative units, and price pressure. these decreases were partially offset by positive base cost productivity.
segment profit up $0.3 billion (7%):
•   the alstom acquisition in november 2015 contributed $11.7 billion of inorganic revenue growth in 2016. core services revenue increased primarily at power services due to 40 more agp upgrades. core equipment revenues decreased primarily at gas power systems due to 42 fewer generators, 11 fewer gas steam turbines, and three fewer gas turbines, partially offset by nine more aeroderivative units shipped compared to the prior year.
•   the increase in profit was mainly driven by the effects of the alstom acquisition. core profit decreased due to negative variable cost productivity on lower volume and unfavorable business mix attributable to a shift to the newer h-class gas turbines as these units carry a lower margin rate than the more mature gas turbine products. these decreases were partially offset by direct material deflation.

•   onshore wind - provides technology and services for the onshore wind power industry by providing wind turbine platforms and hardware and software to optimize wind resources. wind services help customers improve availability and value of their assets over the lifetime of the fleet. digital wind farm is a site level solution, creating a dynamic, connected and adaptable ecosystem that improves our customers' fleet operations.
•   offshore wind - offers its high-yield offshore wind turbine, haliade 150-6mw, which is compatible with bottom fixed and floating foundations. it uses the innovative pure torque design and the advanced high density direct-drive permanent magnet generator. wind services support customers over the lifetime of their fleet.
•   hydro - provides a full range of solutions, products and services to serve the hydropower industry from initial design to final commissioning, from low head / medium / high head hydropower plants to pumped storage hydropower plants, small hydropower plants.
•   lm wind power - designs and manufactures blades for onshore and offshore wind turbines. lm became part of ge after a $1.7 billion acquisition in april 2017 and adds value for ge, as well as external customers worldwide, through advanced rotor solutions, improved blade efficiency, increased rotor swept-area, proven reliability and a global manufacturing footprint on or close to all major markets for wind.
competition &amp; regulation renewable energy is now mainstream and expected to be able to compete subsidy-free with other sources of power generation in time. while many factors, including government incentives and specific market rules, affect how renewable energy can deliver outcomes for customers in a given region, renewable energy is increasingly able to compete with fossil fuels in terms of levelized cost of electricity. however, continued competitive pressure from other wind turbine producers as well as from other energy sources, such as solar photovoltaic, reinforced by a general move to electricity auction mechanisms, increases price pressure and the need for innovation in the wind market. as a result, we are investing to keep renewable energy competitive through wind turbine product improvements, including larger rotors, taller towers and higher nameplate ratings that continue to drive down the cost of wind energy. as industry models continue to evolve, our digital strategy and investments in technical innovation will position us to add value for customers looking for clean, renewable energy.
32 ge 2017 form 10-k md&amp;a   segment operations | renewable energy significant trends &amp; developments
•   renewable energy has experienced a surge of development in the last decade. renewable energy capacity additions account for more than half of all power plant additions worldwide. in the u.s. and beyond, traditional utilities and large brands are increasingly choosing renewable energy options - including onshore and offshore wind - based on cost as well as environmental benefits.
•   consequently, the renewable energy market is highly competitive, particularly in onshore wind, resulting in significant pricing pressure.
•   visible brands like amazon, google and microsoft are increasingly contracting for output from wind and solar farms directly using power purchase agreements (ppas). ge's efs business has enabled several deals of this nature that use wind turbines from ge renewable energy's onshore wind unit.
•   the onshore wind market continues to see megawatt (mw) growth as customer preference has shifted from 1.x models to larger, more efficient units.
•   the market to "repower" existing wind turbines - i.e., upgrade units that have been in service for a number of years to increase their efficiency and performance - is growing in the u.s. as the existing onshore wind turbine fleet is aging. repowering allows customers to increase the annual energy output of their installed base, provide more competitively priced energy and extend the life of their assets.
•   new product introductions (npis) continue to be a key lever as our customers show a willingness to invest in new technology that decreases the levelized cost of energy. in september 2017, we introduced a new 4.8 mw turbine with 158 meter rotor diameter designed to reach the onshore industry's highest annual energy production rate, reducing the cost of energy for customers with low to medium wind speed sites.
•   in 2016, we introduced a new software applications suite for the digital wind farm that can reduce maintenance costs by up to ten percent and deliver one-to-three percent of additional revenue per site. the company announced in july 2017 that the 2,000 mw wind catcher project in oklahoma, which will be the largest wind farm in the u.s., will use digital wind farm solutions to support asset performance management and operations optimization.
•   while the uncertainty created by the u.s. tax reform debate resulted in certain orders being pushed to 2018, it had limited impact on our fourth quarter of 2017 performance. the final u.s. tax reform legislation preserved the production tax credit (ptc), a positive outcome for the wind industry. however, while the tax equity market continues to function, the legislation has created some near-term uncertainty around the amount of available tax equity financing as financial institutions fully evaluate the impacts of the new tax law.
•   pricing for our onshore wind business was down in 2017 due to the impact of auctions in many international markets and the competitive environment across all renewable sources.
•   looking ahead, with a high level of price pressure likely persisting in 2018, we are continuing to focus on taking cost out of our npi machines, including the 2.x, in-sourcing blade production and developing larger, more efficient turbines.
•   we believe that north america will continue to be a solid market in the near term with two main dynamics at play. first, we expect a ramp in 2019-2020 leading up to the expiration of the ptc at 100% value in 2020. second, we expect repower upgrades to complement a steadily growing renewable energy market.
•   outside of north america, there continues to be solid growth in india, east asia, australia and newer markets in latin america. europe continues to be stable; however, given our relatively smaller market position, we are investing to grow faster than the market in that region.

segment profit up $0.2 billion (26%):
•   the renewable energy market remains competitive, particularly in onshore wind. the onshore wind market continues to see megawatt growth as customer preference has shifted from 1.x models to larger, more efficient units. however, there is significant competitive pricing pressure driven by onshore turbines.
services volume increased due to 975 more repower units at onshore wind. equipment volume decreased due to 464 fewer wind turbine shipments on a unit basis, including the nonrecurrence of certain orders in europe and asean, or 3% fewer megawatts shipped than in the prior year. revenues also increased due to the acquisition of lm wind in april 2017 which contributed $0.3 billion of inorganic revenue growth in 2017, increased other income including a reduction in foreign exchange transactional losses, and the effects of a weaker u.s. dollar versus the brazilian real, partially offset by pricing pressure.
•   the increase in profit was due to positive variable cost productivity, material deflation and increased other income including a reduction in foreign exchange transactional losses. these increases were partially offset by negative base cost productivity and price pressure.
segment profit up $0.1 billion (34%):
•   the alstom acquisition in november 2015 contributed $1.2 billion of inorganic revenue growth in 2016. core equipment and services revenues increased due to higher volume at onshore wind as a result of increased repowering projects, 420 more wind turbines shipments and 32% more megawatts shipped than in the prior year. these increases were partially offset by decreased other income including foreign exchange transactional losses, the effects of a stronger u.s. dollar versus the brazilian real and lower prices due to competitive pressure from other wind turbine producers and other energy sources.
•   the increase in profit was due to higher volume in onshore wind and hydro due to the alstom acquisition, material deflation, and product cost-out actions. these increases were partially offset by increased npi spending on 2 and 3 megawatt units, price pressure and decreased other income including foreign exchange transactional losses.

•   on july 3, 2017, we completed the transaction to create baker hughes, a ge company (bhge). under the terms of the deal, we combined our oil &amp; gas business and baker hughes incorporated (baker hughes) to create a new company in which ge holds an ownership interest of approximately 62.5% and former baker hughes shareholders hold an ownership interest of approximately 37.5%. effective july 3, 2017, the operations of baker hughes are reported in our oil &amp; gas segment. the combined business is a leading equipment, technology and services provider in the oil and gas industry.
•   continuing market weakness including lower oil prices has led to reductions in customers' forecasted capital expenditures and lower convertible orders, creating industry challenges, the effects of which are uncertain. in addition, decreased u.s. rig count and lower drilling activity versus prior peaks in the early 2000s has reduced the need for new wells, rigs, and replacement equipment.
•   we are also impacted by volatility in foreign currency exchange rates mainly due to a high concentration of non-u.s. dollar denominated business as well as long-term contracts denominated in multiple currencies.
•   in 2017, we experienced several indicators of improvement in activity. demand for oil was higher than expected due to robust consumption in north american and revisions to chinese, russian and european demand growth expectations.
•   in 2017, total rig count increased 27% to an average of 2,030 from an average of 1,598 in 2016. this increase was driven by an increase in north american rig count from 642 in 2016 to 1,082 in 2017, primarily attributable to an increase in land rig count, partially offset by a decrease in offshore rig count.
•   oil prices reached a low early in 2016 due to the impending production increases in iran after economic sanctions were lifted. however, during the fourth quarter of 2017, opec announced extensions to agreed-upon production cuts, shifting brent oil prices higher towards the end of the year.
•   in north america, customer spending is highly driven by wti oil prices, which fluctuated significantly throughout the year. average wti oil prices increased to $50.80/bbl in 2017 from $43.29/bbl in 2016 and ranged from a low of $42.48/bbl in june 2017 to a high of $60.46/bbl in december 2017.
•   outside of north america, customer spending is influenced by brent oil prices, which also fluctuated significantly throughout the year. average brent oil prices increased to $54.12/bbl in 2017 from $43.64/bbl in 2016 and ranged from a low of $43.98/bbl in june 2017 to a high of $68.80/bbl in december 2017.
•   while we saw an increase in commodity prices during 2017, we have yet to see a sustained change in customer spending behavior, and we expect final investment decisions to continue to remain fluid due to continued oil price volatility.

segment profit down $1.2 billion (84%):
•   the oil and gas market remained challenging in 2017. despite some improvements in activity, there were no significant increases in customer capital commitments, and oil prices remained volatile for the majority of the year. while oil prices stabilized towards the end of 2017 and north american rig count increased, major equipment project awards continued to be pushed out in the oilfield equipment and tps businesses.
the baker hughes acquisition in july 2017 contributed $5.2 billion of inorganic revenue growth in 2017. core equipment revenues decreased due to lower volume primarily at oilfield equipment as a result of the market conditions and lower opening backlog. revenues further decreased due to lower oil prices, partially offset by the effects of a weaker u.s. dollar versus the euro and a reduction in foreign exchange transactional losses.
•   the decrease in profit was primarily driven by negative variable cost productivity, restructuring and other charges, lower prices and lower organic volume, partially offset by increased volume from baker hughes, deflation and increased other income including a reduction in foreign exchange transactional losses.
segment profit down $1.0 billion (43%):
•   the oil and gas market continued to be challenging in 2016, primarily due to uncertainty and volatility in oil and gas prices. while there were indications of positive trends, the industry continued to focus on cost rationalization and capital spending reductions to align its cost structure with economics conditions.
core equipment and services revenues decreased due to lower volume across most product lines, primarily in oilfield services and oilfield equipment, driven by difficult market conditions resulting in lower capital spending across the oil and gas industry. revenues further decreased due to lower oil prices and the effects of a stronger u.s. dollar versus the euro. the alstom acquisition in november 2015 contributed $0.1 billion of inorganic revenue growth in 2016.
•   the decrease in profit was primarily driven by continuing market weakness resulting in lower core volume across all sub-segments and lower oil prices, which, despite the effects of cost-out initiatives including restructuring actions, drove lower cost productivity. these decreases were partially offset by material deflation.

segment profit down $0.2 billion (23%):
•   the north american market continues to see overcapacity and spending budget cuts by the railroads limiting fleet expansion. however, carload volume increased 4.8% during the year driven by an increase in coal. with improving carload volume, the number of parked locomotives has decreased 18% from the prior year.
equipment volume decreased primarily driven by lower locomotive shipments in north america due to continuing challenging market conditions. services revenues increased as railroads are running their locomotives longer, and the recently unparked locomotives tend to be older units in higher need of servicing and replacements parts, driving an increase in services volume and parts shipped.
•   the decrease in profit was driven by lower equipment volume, partially offset by favorable business mix from a higher proportion of services volume including an increase in earnings in our long-term service contracts. additionally, cost reduction actions including restructuring, supply chain initiatives and work transfers to more cost-competitive locations continued during the year.

• vice president, ge and president &amp; ceo, current, powered by ge• over 30 years of service with general electric products &amp; services lighting includes the ge lighting business, which is primarily focused on consumer lighting applications in the u.s., and current, powered by ge (current), which is focused on providing energy efficiency and productivity solutions for commercial, industrial and municipal customers.
•   ge lighting - focused on driving innovation and growth in light emitting diode (led) and connected home technology. the business offers leds in a variety of shapes, sizes, wattages and color temperatures. it is also investing in the growing smart home category, building a suite of connected lighting products with simple connection points that offer new opportunities to do more at home.
•   current - delivers energy efficiency and productivity solutions for commercial, industrial and municipal customers. we combine infrastructure technology like led and solar with new sensor-enabled data networks and digital applications to help our customers reduce energy costs, better predict spend and gain business productivity insights. we partner with a wide variety of digital companies to help expand our application catalog, and we offer flexible financing solutions that help our customers achieve faster payback periods and better long-term value.
competition &amp; regulation lighting faces competition from businesses operating with global presence and with deep energy domain expertise. our products and services sold to end customers are often subject to a number of regulatory specification and performance standards under different federal, state, foreign and energy industry standards. the potential combination of energy technologies like lighting and solar with sensor-based data networks is unlocking new internet of things (iot) capabilities for the commercial, industrial and municipal markets in which current operates and introducing new competitors.
significant trends &amp; developments
•   in the last decade, the lighting industry has seen a major technology pivot away from traditional lighting products, including incandescent, halogen and specialty linear fluorescent lamps, to energy-saving leds primarily due to continued u.s. energy efficiency regulations. we estimate half of all residential sockets in the u.s. will convert to led by 2020. this shift aligns with our led focus.
•   the same led transition is also happening in the commercial and industrial markets, coupled with an increasing trend toward digitization in commercial, industrial and retail buildings, as well as growing investment in smart city technology and digital sensing capabilities for utilities and municipalities. this change is being driven by multiple benefits, including cost reductions associated with energy savings, space utilization, worker productivity and a longer led replacement cycle once installed.
•   the commercial, industrial and municipal markets are largely nascent, with point solution companies gathering data on the edge or developing specialized apps; no large-scale platform solution has yet emerged in the intelligent buildings and municipal space.
•   we classified the substantial majority of our lighting segment as held for sale in the fourth quarter of 2017. in connection with this determination, we adjusted the carrying value of each business classified as held for sale to fair value, less cost to sell, resulting in a pre-tax loss of $0.8 billion recorded at corporate. in february 2018, we entered into an agreement to sell our ge lighting business in europe, the middle east, africa and turkey and our global automotive lighting business to a company controlled by a former ge executive in the region. the proposed transaction is expected to close in mid-2018, subject to customary closing conditions and local agreements.

segment profit down $0.1 billion (53%):
•   the traditional lighting market continued to be challenging due to continued u.s. energy efficiency regulations and market shifts away from traditional lighting products in favor of more energy-efficient, cost-saving options.
the main driver of the decrease in revenues was the appliances disposition in june 2016. for the remaining lighting business, equipment revenues decreased due to lower traditional lighting product sales and led price pressure, partially offset by led and solar growth in current. in addition, revenues further decreased due to lighting regional exits outside of north america.
•   the decrease in profit was due to lower volume driven by the appliances disposition in june 2016. excluding this disposition, profit increased for the remaining lighting business driven by savings from restructuring, regional exits and decreased investment and controllable spending. these increases were partially offset by pressure in north america from declining traditional lighting product sales being only partially offset by increasing led sales.
segment profit down $0.5 billion (70%):
•   the main driver of the decrease in revenues was the appliances disposition in june 2016. for the remaining lighting business, equipment revenues decreased due to lower traditional lighting product sales and led price pressure, partially offset by led and solar growth in current.
•   the decrease in profit was due to lower volume driven by the appliances disposition in june 2016, increased investment in current to align with market shifts, and price pressure, partially offset by the cost savings effects of regional exits outside of north america.

•   during the fourth quarter of 2017, we completed the previously reported review of premium deficiency assumptions related to our run-off insurance operations (north america life and health (nalh)). with the completion of that review and nalh's annual premium deficiency test, we recorded an increase to future policy benefit reserves of $8.9 billion and impairments of $0.4 billion of deferred acquisition costs and $0.2 billion of present value of future profits. this resulted in an after-tax charge of $6.2 billion to earnings in the fourth quarter of 2017. refer to our critical accounting estimates and notes 1 and 11 to the consolidated financial statements for further information.
•   as a regulated insurance business, nalh is subject to a statutory accounting framework for establishing reserves that requires the modification of certain assumptions to reflect moderately adverse conditions and other differences from the reserve calculation under gaap. under that framework, we estimate that ge capital will need to contribute approximately $15 billion of capital to nalh over the next seven years. ge capital plans to make a first capital contribution of approximately $3.5 billion in the first quarter of 2018 and expects to make further contributions of approximately $2 billion per year from 2019 through 2024, subject to ongoing monitoring by nalh's primary regulator, the kansas insurance department. ge capital plans to fund the capital contributions with its excess liquidity and other ge capital portfolio actions and does not expect to make a common share dividend distribution to ge for the foreseeable future. ge is required to maintain specified capital levels at these insurance subsidiaries under capital maintenance agreements. refer to our financial resources and liquidity section for further information.
•   on january 16, 2018, we announced plans to take actions to make ge capital smaller and more focused, including a substantial reduction in the size of ge capital's energy financial services and industrial finance businesses over the next 24 months. those actions resulted in goodwill and other asset impairment charges of $1.8 billion on an after-tax basis in the fourth quarter of 2017. refer to note 8 to the consolidated financial statements for further information.

(b)   included non-operating pension cost* of $2.3 billion, $2.1 billion and $2.8 billion in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively, which includes expected return on plan assets, interest costs and non-cash amortization of actuarial gains and losses.
operating corporate costs* exclude non-service-related pension costs of our principal pension plans, which comprise interest costs, expected return on plan assets and amortization of actuarial gains/losses. service cost, prior service cost and curtailment loss components of our principal pension plans are included in operating corporate costs*. we believe that these components of pension cost better reflect the ongoing service-related costs of providing pension benefits to our employees. accordingly, we believe that our measure of operating corporate costs* (see reconciliation below) provides management and investors with a useful measure of the operational costs incurred outside of our businesses. we believe that this measure, considered along with the corresponding gaap measure, provides management and investors with additional information for comparison of our operating corporate costs* to the operating corporate costs of other companies.
we also believe that adjusting operating corporate costs* to exclude the effects of items that are not closely associated with ongoing corporate operations (see reconciliation below), such as earnings of previously divested businesses, gains and losses on disposed and held for sale businesses, restructuring and other charges provides management and investors with a meaningful measure that increases the period-to-period comparability of our ongoing corporate costs.

2017 - 2016 commentary revenues and other income decreased $3.1 billion, primarily a result of:
•   $1.5 billion of lower net gains from disposed businesses which included a $3.1 billion gain from the sale of our appliance business to haier in 2016 and a $0.4 billion gain from the sale of ge asset management to state street corporation in 2016, partially offset by a $1.9 billion gain from the sale of our water business to suez in 2017.
•   $1.4 billion of held for sale losses in 2017. this included $0.8 billion related to the substantial majority of our lighting segment and $0.6 billion related to two businesses within our aviation segment.

•   $1.4 billion of held for sale losses in 2017. this included $0.8 billion related to the substantial majority of our lighting segment and $0.6 billion related to two businesses within our aviation segment.
•   $1.0 billion of higher restructuring and other charges resulting from a charge of $1.2 billion for the impairment of power conversion goodwill and a charge of $0.3 billion for the impairment of a power plant asset, partially offset by a decrease of $0.5 billion of oil &amp; gas related charges recorded at corporate.
•   $0.2 billion of higher costs associated with our principal retirement plans including the effects of lower discount rates.
•   these increases were partially offset by $0.5 billion of lower costs resulting from restructuring and cost reduction actions.
2016 - 2015 commentary revenues and other income increased $2.0 billion, primarily a result of:

for 2017, restructuring and other charges were $5.3 billion of which approximately $2.4 billion was reported in cost of products/services, $1.6 billion was reported in selling, general and administrative expenses (sg&a), and $1.2 billion was reported in other costs and expenses. these activities were primarily at power, corporate and oil & gas. cash expenditures for restructuring and other charges were approximately $2.0 billion. subsequent to the baker hughes transaction and beginning in the third quarter of 2017, $0.8 billion of restructuring and other charges was recorded in the oil & gas segment. this amounted to $0.7 billion net of noncontrolling interest. prior to the baker hughes transaction, $0.2 billion of restructuring and other charges related to oil & gas was recorded at corporate.
for 2016, restructuring & other charges were $3.6 billion of which approximately $2.3 billion was reported in cost of products/services and $1.2 billion was reported in other costs and expenses (sg&a). these activities were primarily at power, oil and gas and healthcare. cash expenditures for restructuring were approximately $1.7 billion in 2016.
for 2015, restructuring and other charges were $1.7 billion of which approximately $1.0 billion was reported in cost of products/services and $0.6 billion was reported in other costs and expenses (sg&a). these activities were primarily at oil & gas, power and corporate. cash expenditures for restructuring were approximately $1.0 billion in 2015.

md&amp;a   other consolidated information other consolidated information interest and other financial charges interest and other financial charges amounted to $4.9 billion, $5.0 billion and $3.5 billion in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
ge interest and other financial charges (exclusive of interest on assumed debt) amounted to $2.8 billion, $2.0 billion and $1.7 billion in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. the increase in 2017 compared to 2016 was primarily due to higher interest and other financial charges primarily as a result of monetization programs with ge capital, as well as an increase in the average long-term debt balance, partially offset by lower rates on long-term debt.
ge capital interest and other financial charges (inclusive of interest on debt assumed by ge), was $3.1 billion, $3.8 billion and $2.3 billion in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. included in interest expense were an insignificant amount, $0.6 billion, and $0.2 billion of debt extinguishment costs in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. ge capital average borrowings were $103.8 billion, $145.0 billion and $216.8 billion in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. the ge capital average composite effective interest rate (including interest allocated to discontinued operations) was 3.1% in 2017, 3.0% in 2016 and 2.6% in 2015. excluding the effect of debt extinguishment costs, the ge capital average composite effective interest rate (including interest allocated to discontinued operations) was 3.1% in 2017, 2.6% in 2016 and 2.6% in 2015. the rate increase from 2016 to 2017 was primarily attributable to higher benchmark interest rates. see the liquidity and borrowings section within the md&a for a discussion of liquidity, borrowings and interest rate risk management.
it is our policy to allocate ge capital interest expense that is either directly attributable or related to discontinued operations. the allocation is based on a market based leverage ratio, taking into consideration the underlying characteristics of the assets for the specific discontinued operations. interest expense that is associated with debt that is not assumed by the buyer or required to be repaid as a result of the disposal transaction is reflected in other continuing operations after the disposal occurs.

•   postretirement benefit plans cost decreased $0.9 billion, primarily because of the effects of higher discount rates, lower service cost resulting from fewer active principal pension plans participants and lower loss amortization related to our principal pension plans.
•   we updated our mortality assumptions at december 31, 2016 based on guidance issued by the society of actuaries to reflect updated rates and methodology for future mortality improvements. the new mortality assumptions decreased our principal pension plans obligations by $0.6 billion at year-end 2016.

principal retiree benefit plans        (5.5   )        (5.7   )
•   the ge pension plan deficit decreased in 2017 primarily due to investment performance, employer contributions and changes in mortality and salary assumptions, partially offset by lower discount rates and the growth in pension liabilities.
•   the decrease in the deficit of our other pension plans was primarily attributable to investment performance and employer contributions, partially offset by liability growth.
•   the decrease in the principal retiree benefit plans deficit was primarily attributable to employer contributions, partially offset by the growth in retiree benefit liabilities.
the employee retirement income security act (erisa) determines minimum pension funding requirements in the u.s. we made $1.7 billion and $0.3 billion contributions to the ge pension plan in 2017 and 2016. on an erisa basis, our preliminary estimate is that the ge pension plan was approximately 94% funded at january 1, 2018. the erisa funded status is higher than the gaap funded status (74% funded) primarily because the erisa prescribed interest rate is calculated using an average interest rate. as a result, the erisa interest rate is higher than the year-end gaap discount rate. the higher erisa interest rate lowers pension liabilities for erisa funding purposes. our current plan is to fund approximately $6.0 billion of pension contributions to the ge pension plan in 2018. our projected 2018 contributions satisfy our minimum erisa funding requirement of $1.5 billion and the remaining $4.5 billion will be a voluntary contribution to the plan. we do not expect to make any contributions to the ge pension plan in 2019.
md&amp;a   other consolidated information we expect to contribute approximately $0.6 billion to our other pension plans in 2018, as compared to $0.9 billion in 2017 and $0.8 billion in 2016. ge capital is a member of certain ge pension plans. as a result of the ge capital exit plan, ge capital had additional funding obligations for these pension plans. these obligations did not relate to the verticals and were recognized as expense in ge capital's other continuing operations. the additional funding obligations recognized by ge capital were $0.2 billion and $0.6 billion for the years ended december 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. see the intercompany transactions between ge and ge capital section within the md&a for further information.
we also expect to contribute approximately $0.4 billion to our principal retiree benefit plans in 2018 similar to our actual contributions of $0.4 billion in both 2017 and 2016.
the funded status of our postretirement benefit plans and future effects on operating results depend on economic conditions, interest rates and investment performance. see the critical accounting estimates section within the md&a and note 12 to the consolidated financial statements for further information about our benefit plans and the effects of this activity on our financial statements.
income taxes ge pays the income taxes it owes in every country in which it does business. many factors impact our income tax expense and cash tax payments. the most significant factor is that we conduct business in over 180 countries and the majority of our revenue is earned outside the u.s., often in countries with lower tax rates than in the u.s. we reinvest most of our foreign earnings overseas to be able to fund our active non-u.s. business operations. our tax liability is also affected by u.s. and foreign tax incentives designed to encourage certain investments, like research and development; and by acquisitions, dispositions and tax law changes. on december 22, 2017, the u.s. enacted the tax cuts and jobs act ("u.s. tax reform") that lowers the statutory tax rate on our u.s. earnings, taxes historic foreign earnings at a reduced rate of tax, creates a territorial tax system and enacts new taxes associated with global operations. our provisional estimate of the transition tax on historic foreign earnings and the effect on our deferred taxes is described below. finally, our tax returns are routinely audited, and settlements of issues raised in these audits sometimes affect our tax rates.
ge and ge capital file a consolidated u.s. federal income tax return. this enables ge and ge capital to use tax deductions and credits of one member of the group to reduce the tax that otherwise would have been payable by another member of the group. the effective tax rate reflects the benefit of these tax reductions in the consolidated return. ge makes cash payments to ge capital for tax reductions and ge capital pays for tax increases at the time ge's tax payments are due.
provision (benefit) for income taxes       (3.0)       (0.5)        6.5
•   the consolidated income tax rate for 2017 was 34.6%. this effective tax rate reflects a tax benefit on a consolidated pre-tax loss.
•   the effective tax rate included a charge of $3.3 billion associated with the provisional estimate of the impact of the transition tax on historic foreign earnings ($1.2 billion) and the revaluation of deferred taxes ($2.2 billion) as a result of the enactment of u.s. tax reform.
•   as discussed in note 13 to the consolidated financial statements, the impact of u.s. tax reform on the revaluation of deferred taxes and the transition tax on historic earnings has been recorded on a provisional basis as the legislation provides for additional guidance to be issued by the u.s. department of the treasury on several provisions including the computation of the transition tax. guidance during 2018 could impact the information required for, and the calculation of, the transition tax charge and could affect decisions on timing of various u.s. and foreign items, which would further impact the final 2017 amounts included in the transition charge and the revaluation of deferred taxes. in addition, analysis performed and conclusions reached as part of the tax return filing process and additional guidance on accounting for u.s. tax reform could affect the provisional amount.
•   the consolidated tax rate excluding the effect of u.s. tax reform was 72.4%. this effective tax rate was also a tax benefit on a consolidated pre-tax loss. the tax benefit excluding the impact of tax reform was larger than 35% because of the benefit from lower-taxed international income compared to losses taxed at higher than the average rate and the benefit of the lower-taxed disposition of the water business.
•   the consolidated tax provision included $3.3 billion and $1.0 billion for ge (excluding ge capital) for 2017 and 2016, respectively.
64 ge 2017 form 10-k md&amp;a   other consolidated information
•   the consolidated income tax rate for 2016 was (5.1)%. the effective tax rate was negative largely because of increased tax benefits from global operations including benefits from the repatriation of ge non-u.s. earnings, benefits of integrating our existing services business with alstom's services business and foreign tax credit planning at ge capital to reduce the tax cost of anticipated repatriations of foreign cash.
•   the decrease in the consolidated provision for income tax was attributable to the increased benefit from global operations and the non-repeat of the 2015 charges associated with the ge capital exit plan.
•   as discussed in note 13 to the consolidated financial statements, in 2015 in conjunction with the ge capital exit plan, we incurred tax expense of $6.3 billion related to expected repatriation of foreign earnings and write-off of deferred tax assets.
•   the consolidated tax provision included $1.0 billion and $1.5 billion for ge (excluding ge capital) for 2016 and 2015, respectively.
benefits from global operations absent the effects of u.s. tax reform and the ge capital exit plan, our consolidated income tax provision is reduced because of the benefits of lower-taxed global operations. there is a benefit from global operations as non-u.s. income is subject to local country tax rates that are significantly below the historic 35% u.s. statutory rate. most of these earnings have been reinvested in active non-u.s. business operations and as of december 31, 2017, we have not decided to repatriate these earnings to the u.s. as a result of u.s. tax reform, substantially all of our prior unrepatriated tax earnings were subject to u.s. tax and accordingly we expect to have the ability to repatriate those earnings without additional u.s. federal tax cost and any foreign withholding taxes on a repatriation to the u.s. would potentially be partially offset by a u.s. foreign tax credit. we will update our analysis of investment of foreign earnings in 2018 as we consider the impact of u.s. tax reform.
the rate of tax on our indefinitely reinvested non-u.s. earnings is below the historic 35% u.s. statutory tax rate because we have significant business operations subject to tax in countries where the tax on that income is lower than the u.s. statutory rate and because ge funds certain non-u.s. operations through foreign companies that are subject to low foreign taxes.
a substantial portion of the benefit related to business operations subject to tax in countries where the tax on that income is lower than the u.s. statutory rate is derived from our gecas aircraft leasing operations located in ireland where the earnings are taxed at 12.5%, from our power operations located in switzerland and hungary where the earnings are taxed at between 9% and 18.6%, and our healthcare operations in europe where tax deductions are allowed for certain intangible assets and earnings are taxed below the historic u.s. statutory rate.
we expect our ability to benefit from non-u.s. income taxed at less than the u.s. rate to continue, subject to changes in u.s. or foreign law. because the u.s. tax rate has been reduced to 21% beginning in 2018 and because the u.s. has adopted a territorial tax system as part of u.s. tax reform, the overall tax benefit from non-u.s. operations compared to the u.s. statutory rate will be reduced or eliminated going forward.
as part of u.s. tax reform, the u.s. has enacted a tax on "base eroding" payments from the u.s. we are evaluating the impact of this new provision on our operations and intend to undertake restructuring actions to avoid a significant impact from this provision. the u.s. has also enacted a minimum tax on foreign earnings ("global intangible low-taxed income"). because we have tangible assets outside the u.s. and pay a rate of foreign tax above the minimum tax rate, we are not expecting a significant increase in tax liability from this new u.s. minimum tax. because aspects of the new law and the effect on our operations is uncertain and because aspects of the accounting rules associated with the tax on global intangible low-taxed income have not been resolved, we have not made an accrual for the deferred tax effects of this provision.

2017 - 2016 commentary the amounts reported above exclude the impact of u.s. tax reform which is reported as a separate line in the reconciliation of the u.s. federal statutory income tax rate to the actual tax rate in note 13. those impacts include $1.2 billion for the transition tax on historic foreign earnings and $1.4 billion to write-off deferred tax assets associated with investments in foreign subisidiaries.
md&amp;a   other consolidated information included in "other" was an increase in the benefit from 2016 to 2017 from planning at ge capital to reduce the tax cost of repatriations of foreign cash and to repatriate high-taxed foreign earnings at ge, partially offset by a decrease in the benefit from repatriation of ge non-u.s. earnings due to the non-repeat of the benefit of integrating our existing services business with alstom's services business.
2016 - 2015 commentary our benefit from lower-taxed global operations increased in 2016 because of the nonrecurrence of the 2015 tax expense associated with the ge capital exit plan and because of benefits from the repatriation of ge non-u.s. earnings, benefits of integrating our existing services business with alstom's services business and foreign tax credit planning at ge capital to reduce the tax cost of anticipated repatriations of foreign cash, all of which are included in "other" in the table above.
other information included in the total charge associated with u.s. tax reform for 2017 is a tax charge of $1.2 billion for the provisional estimate of the tax charge associated with the transition tax on historic foreign earnings under tax reform. as described above, we expect to finalize this amount as well as the impact of u.s. tax reform on deferred taxes during 2018. the provisional transition tax is computed on earnings as measured for u.s. tax purposes, that were reduced by netting of historic tax losses and by partial u.s. tax credit for foreign taxes paid on the historic earnings. the provisional tax charge is also reduced by $2.6 billion of u.s. tax accrued in prior years on foreign earnings. we expect the transition tax liability to be offset by accelerated use of deductions and tax credits.
included in 2015 is a tax expense of $6.1 billion related to the expected repatriation of foreign earnings and write-off of deferred tax assets in conjunction with the ge capital exit plan.
the tax benefit from non-u.s. income taxed at a local country rate rather than the u.s. statutory tax rate is reported in the caption "tax on global activities including exports" in the effective tax rate reconciliation in note 13 to the consolidated financial statements.
a more detailed analysis of differences between the u.s. federal statutory rate and the consolidated effective rate, as well as other information about our income tax provisions, is provided in the critical accounting estimates section within the md&a and note 13 to the consolidated financial statements. the nature of business activities and associated income taxes differ for ge and for ge capital; therefore, a separate analysis of each is presented in the paragraphs that follow.
ge effective tax rate (excluding ge capital earnings)
we believe that the ge effective tax rate and provision for income taxes are best analyzed in relation to ge earnings before income taxes excluding the ge capital net earnings from continuing operations, as ge tax expense does not include taxes on ge capital earnings. see the supplemental information section within the md&a, for further information on this calculation.
ge etr, excluding ge capital earnings*      84.8   %       8.7   %      13.8   %
•   the ge provision for income taxes increased in 2017 because of the $3.7 billion charge for the provisional estimate of the transition tax on historic foreign earnings ($2.9 billion) and effect of revaluing our deferred taxes ($0.8 billion).
•   excluding the charge associated with u.s. tax reform, the ge tax provision decreased by $1.4 billion. the decrease was due primarily to a decrease in pre-tax income, excluding non-deductible held-for-sale and impairment losses, which is taxed at above the average tax rate ($1.6 billion).
•   the ge provision for income taxes decreased in 2016 because of increased benefits from lower-taxed global operations ($0.3 billion), including benefits from the repatriation of ge non-u.s. earnings and benefits of integrating our existing services business with alstom's services business.
•   the ge provision for income taxes also decreased due to increases in the benefit from deductible stock losses ($0.4 billion).
•   partially offsetting these decreases was a lower benefit of audit resolutions ($0.1 billion) shown below.
*non-gaap financial measure
66 ge 2017 form 10-k md&amp;a   other consolidated information resolution of audit matters reduced the ge provision for income taxes by $0.1 billion, $0.2 billion and $0.3 billion in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. the effects of such resolutions are included in the following captions in note 13 to the consolidated financial statements.

ge capital provision (benefit) for income taxes     $(6.3   )     $(1.4   )        $5.0
•   the increase in the tax benefit at ge capital from a benefit of $1.4 billion in 2016 to a benefit of $6.3 billion is primarily due to the increase in the pre-tax loss with a tax benefit above the average tax rate including the one-time charge to revalue insurance reserves.
•   the ge capital tax provision included a benefit of $0.4 billion for the provisional estimate of the transition tax on historic foreign earnings ($1.8 billion benefit) partially offset by the effect of revaluing our deferred taxes ($1.4 billion charge).
•   the decrease in the income tax expense for ge capital from an expense of $5.0 billion to a benefit of $1.4 billion is primarily due to the nonrecurrence of the $6.3 billion tax expense, discussed in note 13 to the consolidated financial statements, related to the ge capital exit plan.
•   the ge capital tax expense also decreased in 2016 due to higher benefits from global operations including foreign tax credit planning to reduce the tax cost of anticipated repatriations of foreign cash.
discontinued operations discontinued operations primarily relate to our financial services businesses as a result of the ge capital exit plan and were previously reported in the capital segment. these discontinued operations primarily comprise residual assets and liabilities related to our exited u.s. mortgage business (wmc), as discussed in md&a legal proceedings and note 21 to the consolidated financial statements, as well as our mortgage portfolio in poland, indemnification liabilities associated with the sale of our ge capital businesses, and other litigation and tax matters.
the mortgage portfolio in poland comprises floating rate residential mortgages, of which approximately 85% are denominated in swiss francs and the remainder in local currency. at december 31, 2017, the portfolio had a carrying value of $3.1 billion with a 1.3% 90-day delinquency rate and an average loan to value ratio of 74%. the portfolio is recorded at fair value less cost to sell and includes a $0.3 billion impairment, which considered our best estimate of the effect of potential legislative relief to borrowers.
at december 31, 2017, we have provided specific indemnities to buyers of ge capital's assets that, in the aggregate, represent a maximum potential claim of $2.6 billion. the majority of these indemnifications relate to the sale of businesses and assets under the ge capital exit plan. we have recorded related liabilities of $0.3 billion, which incorporates our evaluation of risk and the likelihood of making payments under the indemnities. the recognized liabilities represent the estimated fair value of the indemnities when issued as adjusted for any subsequent probable and estimable losses. approximately 20% of these exposures are expected to expire within the next five years, while substantially all indemnifications are expected to expire within the next ten years.
also, in connection with the 2015 public offering and sale of synchrony financial, ge capital indemnified synchrony financial and its directors, officers, and employees against the liabilities of gecc's businesses other than historical liabilities of the businesses that are part of synchrony financial's ongoing operations.
md&amp;a   other consolidated information included within discontinued operations at december 31, 2017 are an estimated $1.5 billion of exposure related to tax audits and tax litigation matters for which we have recorded a reserve of $0.5 billion. additionally, ongoing lawsuits and other litigation matters represent exposures of $1.3 billion for which we have recorded reserves of $0.1 billion.
see notes 2 and 21 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information related to discontinued operations.
geographic information and exposures our global activities span all geographic regions and primarily encompass manufacturing for local and export markets, import and sale of products produced in other regions, leasing of aircraft, sourcing for our plants domiciled in other global regions and provision of financial services within these regional economies. thus, when countries or regions experience currency and/or economic stress, we often have increased exposure to certain risks, but also often have new opportunities that include, among other things, expansion of industrial activities through purchases of companies or assets at reduced prices and lower u.s. debt financing costs.
financial results of our non-u.s. activities reported in u.s. dollars are affected by currency exchange. we use a number of techniques to manage the effects of currency exchange, including selective borrowings in local currencies and selective hedging of significant cross-currency transactions. such principal currencies are the euro, the pound sterling, the brazilian real and the chinese renminbi.
revenues revenues are classified according to the region to which products and services are sold. for purposes of this analysis, the u.s. is presented separately from the remainder of the americas.

non-u.s. revenues and earnings the increase in non-u.s. revenues in 2017 was primarily due to increases of 12% in europe (primarily due to baker hughes), 10% in latin america, and 7% in the middle east and africa.
the increase in non-u.s. revenues in 2016 was primarily due to increases of 20% in europe (primarily due to alstom), as well as growth in asia of 11% and middle east and africa of 11%, partially offset by latin america down 10%.
the effects of currency fluctuations on reported results were as follows:
•   increased revenues by $0.6 billion in 2017, primarily driven by the euro ($0.4 billion), the brazilian real ($0.3 billion), and the indian rupee ($0.1 billion), partially offset by decreases in revenue driven by the pound sterling ($0.2 billion).
the effects of foreign currency fluctuations decreased earnings by an immaterial amount in 2017. the effects of foreign currency fluctuations decreased earnings in 2016 by $0.3 billion.

venezuela we have experienced delays in collecting payments on our receivables from our primary customer in venezuela, and while our outstanding receivables are not disputed, we recorded a pre-tax impairment charge of $201 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 to reflect the expected recoverable value of the trade receivables, financing receivables, contract assets and inventories related to our operations in venezuela to service this customer. as of december 31, 2017, our remaining net exposure to this customer was $32 million.
also during 2017, ge recorded write offs on other customer receivables of $62 million and an impairment of two buildings of $26 million.
statement of financial position because ge and ge capital share certain significant elements of their statements of financial position, the following discussion addresses significant captions in the consolidated statement. within the following discussions, however, we distinguish between ge and ge capital activities in order to permit meaningful analysis of each individual consolidating statement.
major changes in our financial position during 2017

see the statement of cash flows section of the md&a for further information.
md&amp;a   statement of financial position
•   investment securities decreased $5.6 billion, primarily due to maturities of liquidity portfolio investments at ge capital. see note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for further information.
•   inventories decreased $2.1 billion (excluding the impact of the baker hughes transaction), primarily due to the classification of businesses as held for sale, liquidations in excess of material inputs and inventory obsolescence write-offs. see note 5 to the consolidated financial statements for further information.
•   goodwill increased $0.2 billion (excluding the impact of the baker hughes transaction), primarily due to the effects of currency exchange of $1.9 billion, the acquisition of lm wind power in our renewable energy segment of $1.5 billion and the acquisition of servicemax in digital of $0.7 billion, partially offset by the classification of various businesses in our lighting, aviation, healthcare and power segments as held for sale of $1.6 billion, the impairment of the energy financial services business goodwill in our capital segment of $1.4 billion and an impairment of the power conversion business goodwill in our power segment of $1.2 billion. see note 8 to the consolidated financial statements for further information.
•   contract assets increased $3.7 billion. revenues in excess of billings increased $2.4 billion and $1.1 billion for our long-term service and equipment agreements, respectively. the remaining increase in contract assets of $0.2 billion is primarily due to an increase in deferred inventory costs partially offset by a decrease in nonrecurring engineering costs. see note 9 to the consolidated financial statements for further information.
•   deferred income taxes increased $4.4 billion, primarily due to the increase in reserves for ge capital's run-off insurance operations and planning at ge capital to reduce the tax cost of repatriations of foreign cash, partially offset by the impact of u.s. tax reform. see note 13 to the consolidated financial statements for further information.
•   assets of businesses held for sale increased $2.5 billion, primarily due to the classification of various businesses in our lighting, aviation, healthcare and power segments as held for sale in 2017, partially offset by the sale of our water business. see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for further information.
•   assets of discontinued operations decreased $8.9 billion, primarily due to the disposition of businesses at ge capital. see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for further information.

•   noncontrolling interests increased $16.1 billion, primarily due to the recognition of an approximate 37.5% noncontrolling interest attributable to bhge's class a shareholders in conjunction with the baker hughes transaction. see note 8 to the consolidated financial statements for further information.
70 ge 2017 form 10-k md&amp;a   financial resources and liquidity financial resources and liquidity liquidity and borrowings we maintain a strong focus on liquidity. at both ge and ge capital we manage our liquidity to help provide access to sufficient funding to meet our business needs and financial obligations throughout business cycles.
our liquidity and borrowing plans for ge and ge capital are established within the context of our financial and strategic planning processes. our liquidity and funding plans consider the liquidity necessary to fund our operating commitments, which include purchase obligations for inventory and equipment, payroll and general expenses (including pension funding). we also consider our capital allocation and growth objectives, including paying dividends, repurchasing shares, funding debt maturities and insurance obligations, investing in research and development and acquiring industrial businesses. we define our liquidity risk tolerance under stress based on liquidity sources, and our liquidity position is targeted to meet our obligations under both normal and stressed conditions.
ge cash and equivalents were $18.2 billion at december 31, 2017, including $7.0 billion at bhge. at ge, we rely primarily on free cash flows from our operating businesses and for 2018, proceeds from announced dispositions and planned debt issuances. cash generation can be subject to variability based on many factors, including seasonality, receipt of down payments on large equipment orders, timing of billings on long-term contracts, the effects of changes in end markets and our ability to execute dispositions. in 2018, our focus is on strengthening our cash position, with a balanced capital allocation plan including organic investments that generate strong returns, coupled with a competitive dividend payout ratio. we intend to maintain a disciplined financial policy targeting a strong credit profile.
in 2018, ge expects to incur up to $6.0 billion of incremental long-term debt, primarily to fund the ge pension plan. this incremental debt may consist of new unsecured term debt issued in the external debt markets or intercompany arrangements between ge and ge capital, utilizing ge capital's excess unsecured term debt.
our 2018 capital allocation plan also considers potential funding of alstom redemption rights related to certain consolidated joint ventures, which alstom has expressed an intent to exercise. see note 14 to the consolidated financial statements for further information.
ge has available a variety of liquidity management tools to fund its operations, including a commercial paper program, bank operating lines and short-term intercompany loans from ge capital which are typically repaid within the same quarter. at ge capital, we mainly rely on cash and short-term investments, cash generated from dispositions and cash flows from our businesses to fund our debt maturities, including the current portion of long-term debt ($14.1 billion at december 31, 2017), and our operating and interest costs.
based on asset and liability management actions we have taken, ge capital does not plan to issue any incremental ge capital senior unsecured term debt until 2020. ge capital expects to maintain an adequate liquidity position, primarily as a result of cash and short-term investments, cash generated from dispositions and cash flows from our businesses. during this period, we expect to continue to have excess interest costs as asset sales have outpaced our debt maturities. additionally, as previously communicated, ge capital expects to fund approximately $15.0 billion to our insurance subsidiaries over the next seven years, including approximately $3.5 billion in 2018, subject to ongoing monitoring by the kansas insurance department. ge is required to maintain specified capital levels at these insurance subsidiaries under capital maintenance agreements.
as of december 31, 2017, ge capital maintained liquidity sources of $30.9 billion that consisted of cash and equivalents of $25.1 billion, high-quality investments of $5.0 billion and cash and equivalents of $0.8 billion classified within discontinued operations. we also expect to generate incremental cash of approximately $15.0 billion from planned asset reduction actions over the next two years. additionally, while we maintain adequate liquidity levels, we may engage in liability management actions, such as buying back debt, based on market and economic conditions in order to reduce our excess interest costs.
as part of ge's previously formulated and communicated plan to incur new long-term debt primarily to fund acquisitions and to refinance existing debt, we incurred $15.9 billion of incremental long-term debt in 2017 (excluding bhge), comprising $8.6 billion equivalent of euro debt issued in the external debt markets and $7.3 billion through intercompany loans from two transactions with ge capital in the first and third quarters of 2017. the $8.6 billion equivalent of externally-issued debt consists of €1,750 million of 0.375% notes due 2022, €2,000 million of 0.875% notes due 2025, €2,250 million of 1.50% notes due 2029 and €2,000 million of 2.125% notes due 2037. in lieu of issuing the $7.3 billion of debt externally in the capital markets, ge effected the transactions through ge capital, utilizing a portion of its excess unsecured debt resulting from the ge capital exit plan. the loans from ge capital were priced at market terms and collectively have a weighted average interest rate and term of 3.5% and 15 years, respectively, and bear the right of offset against amounts owed by ge capital to ge under the assumed debt agreement, thereby reducing the intercompany payables and receivables between ge and ge capital by $7.3 billion.
during the fourth quarter of 2017, bhge completed the issuance of $4.0 billion of new senior unsecured debt, consisting of $1,250 million of 2.773% notes due 2022, $1,350 million of 3.337% notes due 2027, and $1,350 million of 4.080% notes due 2047.
md&amp;a   financial resources and liquidity in 2015, senior unsecured notes and commercial paper were assumed by ge upon its merger with ge capital resulting in an intercompany receivable and payable between ge and ge capital. on the ge statement of financial position, assumed debt is presented within borrowings with an offsetting receivable from ge capital and on the ge capital statement of financial position, this is reflected as an intercompany payable to ge within borrowings. at december 31, 2017, the outstanding assumed debt was $47.1 billion (see note 10 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information). the following table provides a reconciliation of total short-term and long-term borrowings as reported on the respective ge and ge capital statements of financial position to borrowings originally issued by ge and ge capital.

liquidity sources ge cash and equivalents were $18.2 billion at december 31, 2017, including $7.0 billion in bhge. ge capital maintained liquidity sources of $30.9 billion that consisted of cash and equivalents of $25.1 billion, high-quality investments of $5.0 billion and cash and equivalents of $0.8 billion classified as discontinued operations. additionally, at december 31, 2017, ge has $5.3 billion of committed 364-day bilateral operating lines extended by nine banks, which had no outstanding balance at december 31, 2017, as well as $20.0 billion of committed unused credit lines extended by 36 banks in a syndicated credit facility agreement expiring in 2021. in january and february 2018, ge entered into $15.0 billion of additional committed operating lines extended by six banks, expiring in 2019 and 2020. ge capital has the right to compel ge to borrow under certain of these credit lines and transfer the proceeds as loans to ge capital.

(a)   at december 31, 2017, $4.1 billion of ge cash and equivalents was held in countries with currency controls that may restrict the transfer of funds to the u.s. or limit our ability to transfer funds to the u.s. without incurring substantial costs. these funds are available to fund operations and growth in these countries and we do not currently anticipate a need to transfer these funds to the u.s. included in this amount was $1.2 billion of bhge cash and equivalents, which is subject to similar restrictions.
(b)   at december 31, 2017, ge capital cash and equivalents of about $0.6 billion were primarily in insurance entities and was subject to regulatory restrictions.
as a result of u.s. tax reform, approximately $10 billion of ge non-u.s. cash and equivalents at december 31, 2017 can be repatriated without incremental u.s. federal income tax. included in this amount was approximately $2 billion of bhge cash and equivalents.

maximum commercial paper borrowings outstanding during the fourth quarter of 2017      19.7                  7.0
ge capital's commercial paper maturities have historically been funded principally through new commercial paper issuances, and ge's are substantially repaid within the respective quarter.
we securitize financial assets as an alternative source of funding. during 2017, we completed $1.7 billion of non-recourse issuances and $0.2 billion of non-recourse borrowings matured. at december 31, 2017, consolidated non-recourse securitization borrowings were $2.0 billion.
exchange rate and interest rate risks exchange rate and interest rate risks are managed with a variety of techniques, including match funding and selective use of derivatives. we use derivatives to mitigate or eliminate certain financial and market risks because we conduct business in diverse markets around the world and local funding is not always efficient. in addition, we use derivatives to adjust the debt we are issuing to match the fixed or floating nature of the assets we are originating. we apply strict policies to manage each of these risks, including prohibitions on speculative activities. following is an analysis of the potential effects of changes in interest rates and currency exchange rates using so-called "shock" tests that seek to model the effects of shifts in rates. such tests are inherently limited based on the assumptions used (described further below) and should not be viewed as a forecast; actual effects would depend on many variables, including market factors and the composition of the company's assets and liabilities at that time.
•   it is our policy to minimize exposure to interest rate changes and their impact to interest and other financial charges. we fund our financial investments using debt or a combination of debt and hedging instruments so that the interest rates of our borrowings match the expected interest rate profile on our assets. to test the effectiveness of our hedging actions, we assumed that, on january 1, 2017, interest rates decreased by 100 basis points across the yield curve (a "parallel shift" in that curve) and further assumed that the decrease remained in place for the next 12 months. based on the year-end 2017 portfolio and holding all other assumptions constant, we estimated that our consolidated net earnings for the next 12 months, starting in january 2017, would decline by less than $0.1 billion as a result of this parallel shift in the yield curve.
•   it is our policy to minimize currency exposures and to conduct operations either within functional currencies or using the protection of hedge strategies. we analyzed year-end 2017 consolidated currency exposures, including derivatives designated and effective as hedges, to identify assets and liabilities denominated in other than their relevant functional currencies. for such assets and liabilities, we then evaluated the effects of a 10% shift in exchange rates between those currencies and the u.s. dollar, holding all other assumptions constant. this analysis indicated that our 2017 consolidated net earnings would decline by less than $0.1 billion as a result of such a shift in exchange rates. this analysis excludes any translation impact from changes in exchange rates on our financial results and any offsetting effect from the forecasted future transactions that are economically hedged.
foreign currency exposure as a result of our global operations, we generate and incur a significant portion of our revenues and expenses in currencies other than the u.s. dollar. such principal currencies are the euro, the pound sterling, the brazilian real and the chinese renminbi. the results of operating entities reported in currencies other than u.s. dollar are translated to the u.s. dollar at the applicable exchange rate for inclusion in the financial statements. we use a number of techniques to manage the effects of currency exchange, including selective borrowings in local currencies and selective hedging of significant cross-currency transactions. the foreign currency effect arising from operating activities outside of the u.s., including the remeasurement of derivatives, can result in significant transactional foreign currency fluctuations at points in time, but will generally be offset as the underlying hedged item is recognized in earnings. the effects of foreign currency fluctuations, excluding the earnings impact of the underlying hedged item, decreased net earnings for the year ended december 31, 2017 by less than $0.1 billion.
as of december 31, 2017, we held the u.s. dollar equivalent of $0.6 billion of cash in angolan kwanza. as there is no liquid derivatives market for this currency, we have used angolan kwanza to purchase $0.4 billion equivalent bonds issued by the central bank in angola (banco nacional de angola) with various maturities through 2020 to mitigate the related currency devaluation exposure risk. the bonds are denominated in angolan kwanza as u.s. dollar equivalents, so that, upon payment of periodic interest and principal upon maturity, payment is made in angolan kwanza, equivalent to the respective u.s. dollars at the then-current exchange rate.
see note 19 to the consolidated financial statements for further information about our risk exposures, our use of derivatives, and the effects of this activity on our financial statements.
md&amp;a   financial resources and liquidity debt and derivative instruments, guarantees and covenants credit ratings we have relied, and may continue to rely, on the short-term and long-term debt capital markets to fund, among other things, a significant portion of our operations and significant acquisitions. the cost and availability of debt financing is influenced by our credit ratings. moody's investors service (moody's), standard and poor's global ratings (s&p), and fitch ratings (fitch) currently issue ratings on ge and ge capital short- and long-term debt.
on december 4, 2017, s&p lowered the credit ratings of ge and ge capital short- and long-term unsecured debt to a-1 from a-1+ and to a from aa-, respectively, with a stable outlook. on november 28, 2017, fitch lowered the credit ratings of ge and ge capital short- and long-term unsecured debt to f1 from f1+ and to a+ from aa-, respectively, with a negative outlook. on november 16, 2017, moody's lowered the credit ratings of ge and ge capital long-term unsecured debt to a2 from a1, with a stable outlook. the p-1 short-term rating from moody's remained unchanged.
we are disclosing these updates and the ratings below to enhance understanding of our sources of liquidity and the effects of our ratings on our costs of funds. our ratings may be subject to a revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating organization, and each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating. for a description of some of the potential consequences of a reduction in our credit ratings, see "risk factors - financial risks - funding access/costs - failure to maintain our credit ratings, or conditions in the financial and credit markets, could adversely affect our access to capital markets, funding costs and related margins, liquidity and competitive position."
the credit ratings of ge and ge capital as of the date of this filing are set forth in the table below.
ge capital outlook      stable    stable    negative short term   p-1       a-1       f1
principal debt and derivative conditions certain of our derivative instruments can be terminated if specified credit ratings are not maintained and certain debt and derivatives agreements of other consolidated entities have provisions that are affected by these credit ratings.
fair values of our derivatives can change significantly from period to period based on, among other factors, market movements and changes in our positions. we manage counterparty credit risk (the risk that counterparties will default and not make payments to us according to the terms of our standard master agreements) on an individual counterparty basis. where we have agreed to netting of derivative exposures with a counterparty, we offset our exposures with that counterparty and apply the value of collateral posted to us to determine the net exposure. we actively monitor these net exposures against defined limits and take appropriate actions in response, including requiring additional collateral.
swap, forward and option contracts are executed under standard master agreements that typically contain mutual downgrade provisions that provide the ability of the counterparty to require termination if the long-term credit ratings of the applicable ge entity were to fall below a-/a3 or other ratings levels agreed upon with the counterparty. in certain of these master agreements, the counterparty also has the ability to require termination if the short-term ratings of the applicable ge entity were to fall below a-1/p-1. the net derivative liability after consideration of netting arrangements, outstanding interest payments and collateral posted by us under these master agreements was estimated to be $0.3 billion at december 31, 2017.

74 ge 2017 form 10-k md&amp;a   financial resources and liquidity statement of cash flows - overview from 2015 through 2017
we evaluate our cash flows performance by reviewing our industrial (non-ge capital) businesses and ge capital businesses separately. cash from operating activities (cfoa) is the principal source of cash generation for our industrial businesses.
all other operating activities reflect cash sources and uses as well as non-cash adjustments to net earnings (loss) including those related to taxes, pensions, contract assets, intangible amortization, restructuring and gains (losses) on principal business dispositions. see note 22 to the consolidated financial statements for further information regarding all other operating activities and all other investing activities for both ge and ge capital, and all other financing activities for ge capital.
ge cash flows with respect to ge cfoa, we believe that it is useful to supplement our ge statement of cash flows and to examine in a broader context the business activities that provide and require cash.
the most significant source of cash in ge cfoa is customer-related activities, the largest of which is collecting cash resulting from product or services sales. the most significant operating use of cash is to pay our suppliers, employees, tax authorities and others for a wide range of material and services. dividends from ge capital represent the distribution of a portion of ge capital retained earnings, and are distinct from cash from continuing operations within the ge capital businesses.
in the following discussion, net earnings for cash flows represents the adding together of net earnings (loss) attributable to the company, (earnings) loss from discontinued operations and (earnings) loss from continuing operations retained by ge capital, excluding ge capital dividends paid to ge.
see the intercompany transactions between ge and ge capital section within the md&a and notes 4 and 23 to the consolidated financial statements for further information regarding certain transactions affecting our consolidated statement of cash flows.
ge cash from operating activities decreased $18.9 billion primarily due to the following:
•   ge capital paid common dividends to ge totaling $4.0 billion in 2017 compared with $20.1 billion in 2016.
•   net earnings for cash flows plus depreciation and deferred income taxes of $4.2 billion in 2017 compared with $14.1 billion in 2016. net earnings for cash flows included pre-tax gains of $1.9 billion from the sale of water in 2017 and $3.1 billion from the sale of appliances and $0.4 billion from the sale of geam in 2016 which are not included in ge industrial cfoa* and are instead reflected as a component of total proceeds from principal business dispositions within cash from (used for) investing activities. net earnings for cash flows included non-cash pre-tax charges and impairments of $2.9 billion related to the classification of certain businesses in our lighting and aviation segments as held for sale, power conversion goodwill and a power plant asset in 2017 which are reflected as adjustments to cash provided from operating activities within all other operating activities. net earnings for cash flows also included current tax expense of $2.8 billion in 2017 compared with current tax benefit of $0.1 billion in 2016.
•   a decrease in cash generated from working capital of $1.2 billion in 2017 compared with 2016. this was primarily due to an increase in cash used for accounts payable of $2.1 billion, mainly in our power, aviation and renewable energy segments, a decrease in cash generated from current receivables of $0.6 billion, mainly in our oil &amp; gas segment (primarily due to the cessation of sales of current receivables to ge capital in the fourth quarter of 2017), and a decrease in progress collections of $0.6 billion, including the benefit from the timing of progress collections received in the fourth quarter of 2017 of approximately $0.7 billion. the decreases in working capital were partially offset by an increase in cash generated from inventories of $2.1 billion, mainly in our renewable energy, power and healthcare segments and in our appliances business, due to inventory build in the first half of 2016 which did not reoccur in 2017 as a result of the sale of the business in the second quarter of 2016.
•   cash used for contract assets was $4.0 billion in 2017 compared with $3.9 billion in 2016. cash used for contract assets in 2017 was primarily due to cumulative catch up adjustments driven by lower forecasted cost to complete the contracts as well as increased forecasted revenue on our long-term service agreements and the timing of revenue recognized relative to the timing of billings and collections on both our long-term service agreements and long-term equipment contracts.
•   ge pension plan contributions of $1.7 billion in 2017 compared with $0.3 billion in 2016.
•   higher taxes paid of $2.7 billion in 2017 compared with $2.6 billion in 2016.
md&amp;a   financial resources and liquidity ge cash used for investing activities increased $6.3 billion primarily due to the following:
•   business acquisition activities of $6.1 billion, primarily driven by the baker hughes transaction for $3.4 billion ($7.5 billion cash consideration, less $4.1 billion of cash assumed), lm wind power for $1.7 billion (net of cash acquired) and servicemax for $0.9 billion (net of cash acquired) in 2017, compared with business acquisitions of $2.3 billion in 2016, which included two european 3-d printing companies in our aviation segment for $1.1 billion (net of cash acquired).
•   business disposition proceeds of $3.1 billion, primarily driven by the sale of our water business for $2.9 billion (net of cash transferred) in 2017, compared with proceeds of $5.4 billion, primarily driven by the sale of our appliances business for $4.8 billion and the sale of geam for $0.4 billion in 2016.
•   net cash paid for settlements of derivative hedges of $1.1 billion in 2017.
•   net repurchases of ge treasury shares of $2.6 billion and $21.4 billion in 2017 and 2016, respectively.
•   a net increase in borrowings of $16.0 billion in 2017, mainly driven by the issuance of long-term debt of $12.5 billion, (including $4.0 billion at bhge) and long-term loans from ge capital to ge of $7.3 billion, partially offset by maturity of long-term debt of $4.0 billion and the settlement of the remaining portion of a 2016 short-term loan from ge capital to ge of $1.3 billion, compared with a net increase in borrowings of $2.7 billion in 2016, including a short-term loan from ge capital to ge of $1.3 billion.
ge cash from operating activities increased $13.6 billion, primarily due to the following:
•   ge capital paid common dividends totaling $20.1 billion and $4.3 billion to ge in 2016 and 2015, respectively.
•   net earnings for cash flows plus depreciation and deferred income taxes of $14.1 billion in 2016 compared with $10.3 billion in 2015. net earnings for cash flows included pre-tax gains of $3.1 billion from the sale of appliances and $0.4 billion from the sale of ge asset management in 2016 and $0.6 billion from the sale of signaling in 2015 which are not included in ge industrial cfoa* and are instead reflected as a component of total proceeds from principal business dispositions within cash from (used for) investing activities. net earnings for cash flows included restructuring charges of $3.6 billion and current tax benefit of $0.1 billion in 2016 compared with restructuring charges of $1.7 billion and current tax expense of $3.3 billion in 2015. net earnings for cash flows also included settlements related to the nbcu transaction of $0.5 billion and an electrolux break-up fee of $0.2 billion in 2015 which did not reoccur in 2016.
•   an improvement in working capital of $3.6 billion in 2016 compared with 2015. this was primarily due to an increase in progress collections of $2.9 billion, mainly in our power and renewable energy segments, and an improvement in accounts payable of $1.4 billion, mainly in our power segment, partially offset by an increase in inventory build of $1.1 billion, mainly in our power segment.
•   cash used for contract assets of $3.9 billion in 2016 compared with $1.9 billion in 2015, primarily due to cumulative catch up adjustments driven by lower forecasted cost to complete the contracts as well as increased forecasted revenue and the timing of revenue recognized relative to the timing of billings and collections on our long-term service agreements.
•   $1.0 billion increase in income tax payments, including $1.4 billion in taxes related to the 2016 sale of our appliances business to haier.
•   higher restructuring payments of $0.6 billion when compared to 2015.
•   $0.5 billion of 2016 incentive compensation payments due to long-term performance awards. no such payments were made in 2015.

•   higher proceeds from principal business dispositions of $3.6 billion, primarily driven by the sale of our appliances business to haier for proceeds of $4.8 billion and the sale of geam for proceeds of $0.4 billion in 2016, compared to $1.7 billion of total proceeds from principal business dispositions in 2015.
•   a decrease in business acquisition activity of $8.1 billion, primarily driven by the acquisition of alstom for $10.1 billion in 2015.
•   these decreases were partially offset by the funding of joint ventures of $0.4 billion in 2016, principally related to our aviation business (reflected in all other investing activities).
76 ge 2017 form 10-k md&amp;a   financial resources and liquidity ge cash used for financing activities increased $19.2 billion, primarily due to the following:
•   net purchases of ge treasury shares of $21.4 billion, including $11.4 billion paid under asr agreements compared to $1.1 billion in 2015.
•   this increase in cash usage was partially offset by the following decreases:
•   a net increase in borrowings of $0.8 billion, primarily driven by a short-term loan from ge capital to ge of $1.3 billion in 2016.
•   lower dividends paid to shareowners of $0.8 billion due to lower shares outstanding in 2016 as a result of repurchases of ge treasury shares.

•   long-term loans from ge capital to ge of $7.3 billion, partially offset by the settlement of the remaining portion of 2016 short-term loan from ge capital to ge of $1.3 billion in 2017, compared to the remaining portion of a short-term loan from ge capital to ge of $1.3 billion in 2016.
•   net cash paid for derivative settlements of an insignificant amount in 2017 compared to net cash received from derivative settlements of $0.4 billion in 2016.
•   these decreases were partially offset by the following increases:

•   liquidity investments of $11.5 billion purchased in 2016.
•   net cash received from derivative settlements of $0.4 billion compared to $4.4 billion in 2015.
•   an increase in net financing receivables of $1.5 billion, including $4.3 billion in additions, partially offset by $2.1 billion received from the refinancing of our receivables facility and proceeds from the sale of receivables purchased from our appliances business of $0.8 billion in 2016.
•   a short-term loan from ge capital to ge with remaining principal of $1.3 billion in 2016.
•   these decreases were partially offset by the following increases:
•   investment and maturity of $20.8 billion related to high quality interest bearing deposits reflecting an investment of $10.4 billion in 2015 that matured in 2016.
•   other investing activities of $3.9 billion, primarily due to a reduction in net additions to property, plant &amp; equipment of $1.6 billion and an increase in aircraft deposits received of $1.5 billion.

ge capital discontinued operations cash flows
ge capital cash used for operating activities-discontinued operations decreased $5.3 billion, primarily due to the following:
ge capital cash used for investing activities-discontinued operations decreased $11.9 billion, primarily due to the following:
•   the sale of bank deposits for $16.5 billion in net cash paid in conjunction with the sale of ge capital bank's u.s. online deposit platform during 2016.
•   the sale of bank deposits and other investments for $1.1 billion in net cash paid related to our consumer platform during 2016.
•   these decreases were partially offset by the following increases:
•   reduction of funding from continuing operations (primarily our treasury operations).
•   sale of bank deposits for $0.5 billion resulting in net cash paid related to our consumer platform during 2017.
ge capital cash from financing activities-discontinued operations increased $1.1 billion, primarily due to the following:

intercompany transactions between ge and ge capital over the last decade, ge has made significant strides in transforming its portfolio and focusing on its industrial leadership in the power, aviation and healthcare industries. ge has grown these infrastructure platforms with major portfolio transformation, investing in adjacencies and pursuing opportunities that are closely related to these core competencies. ge will continue to focus on these industries while leveraging evolving capabilities in digital, additive, and industrial research. ge will focus on strong end markets where we have competitive advantages, where there is opportunity for digital disruption, and where we can earn premium returns.
ge capital, the financial arm of ge, provides financial and intellectual capital to ge's industrial businesses and its customers. ge capital enables ge orders by either providing direct financing for a ge transaction or by bringing market participants together that result in industrial sales. on january 16, 2018, we announced plans to take actions to make ge capital smaller and more focused, including a substantial reduction in the size of ge capital's energy financial services and industrial finance businesses over the next 24 months. we will retain origination capabilities to support our industrial businesses, however, we will transition to more funding by the capital markets, including export credit agencies and financial institutions. the transactions where ge and ge capital are directly involved are made on arm's length terms and are reported in the ge and ge capital columns of our financial statements. these transactions include, but are not limited to, the following:
•   ge capital dividends to ge,
•   ge capital working capital solutions to optimize ge cash management,
•   ge capital enabled ge industrial orders, including related ge guarantees to ge capital,
•   ge capital financing of ge long-term receivables, and
•   aircraft engines, power equipment, renewable energy equipment and healthcare equipment manufactured by ge that are installed on ge capital investments, including leased equipment.
in addition to the above transactions that primarily enable growth for the ge businesses, there are routine related party transactions, which include, but are not limited to, the following:
•   buildings and equipment leased between ge and ge capital, including sale-leaseback transactions,
•   information technology (it) and other services sold to ge capital by ge,
•   settlements of tax liabilities, and
•   various investments, loans and allocations of ge corporate overhead costs.
cash flows ge capital paid $4.0 billion, $20.1 billion and $4.3 billion of common dividends to ge in the years ended december 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. ge did not receive a common share dividend distribution from ge capital in the second half of 2017 and it does not expect to for the foreseeable future.
in order to manage short-term liquidity and credit exposure, ge sells current receivables to ge capital and other third parties in part to fund the growth of our industrial businesses. during any given period, ge receives cash from the sale of receivables to ge capital and other third parties, and it therefore forgoes the future collections of cash on receivables sold, as ge capital collects the cash from the customer. ge also leverages ge capital for its expertise in receivables collection services and sales of receivables to ge capital are made on arm's length terms. these transactions can result in cash generation or cash use. the incremental amount of cash received from sales of receivables in excess of the cash ge would have otherwise collected had these receivables not been sold represents the cash generated or used in the period relating to this activity. the impact of current receivables sold to ge capital, including current receivables subsequently sold to third parties, decreased ge's cfoa by $2.0 billion in 2017 and increased ge's cfoa by $2.1 billion in both 2016 and 2015.
as of december 31, 2017, ge capital had approximately $10.4 billion recorded on its balance sheet related to current receivables purchased from ge. of these amounts, approximately 40% had been sold by ge to ge capital with recourse (i.e., the ge business retains the risk of default). the evaluation of whether recourse transactions qualify for accounting derecognition is based, in part, upon the legal jurisdiction of the sale; as such, the majority of recourse transactions outside the u.s. qualify for sale treatment. the effect on ge cfoa of claims by ge capital on receivables sold with recourse to ge has not been significant for the years ended december 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015.
md&amp;a   financial resources and liquidity in december 2016, ge capital entered into a receivables facility with members of a bank group, designed to provide extra liquidity to ge. the receivables facility allows us to sell eligible current receivables on a non-recourse basis for cash and a deferred purchase price to members of the bank group. the purchase commitment of the bank group increased from $3.0 billion to $3.8 billion in 2017. see note 4 to the consolidated financial statements for further information.
in certain circumstances, ge provides customers primarily within our power, renewable energy and aviation businesses with extended payment terms for the purchase of new equipment, purchases of significant upgrades and for fixed billings within our long-term service contracts. similar to current receivables, ge may sell these long-term receivables to ge capital to manage short-term liquidity and fund growth. these transactions are made on arm's length terms and any fair value adjustments, primarily related to time value of money, are recognized within the industrial business in the period these receivables are sold to ge capital. ge capital accretes interest and factoring fee income over the life of the receivables. factoring fee income is eliminated in our consolidated results. in addition, the long-term portion of any remaining outstanding receivables as of the end of the period are reflected in all other assets within our consolidated statement of financial position. ge capital had approximately $2.1 billion, $1.9 billion and $0.1 billion of financing receivables related to ge long-term customer receivables outstanding, net of deferred income of approximately $0.3 billion, $0.3 billion and an insignificant amount recorded in its balance sheet as of december 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. the effect of cash generated from the sale of these long-term receivables with ge capital increased ge's cfoa by $0.3 billion, $1.6 billion and $0.1 billion in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
enabled orders enabled orders represent the act of introducing, elevating and influencing customers and prospects that result in industrial sales, potentially coupled with captive financing or incremental products or services. during the years ended december 31, 2017 and 2016, ge capital enabled $14.4 billion and $13.4 billion of ge industrial orders, respectively. 2017 orders are primarily with our power ($5.9 billion), renewable energy ($4.6 billion), healthcare ($1.9 billion) and oil & gas ($0.7 billion) businesses. most of these enabled orders were financed by third-parties including export credit agencies and financial institutions.
aviation during the years ended december 31, 2017 and 2016, ge capital acquired 50 aircraft (list price totaling $6.6 billion) and 44 aircraft (list price totaling $6.5 billion), respectively, from third parties that will be leased to others, which are powered by engines that were manufactured by ge aviation and affiliates. additionally, ge capital had $1.2 billion and $1.5 billion of net book value of engines, originally manufactured by ge aviation and affiliates and subsequently leased back to ge aviation and affiliates at december 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.
pensions ge capital is a member of certain ge pension plans. as a result of the ge capital exit plan, ge capital will have additional funding obligations for these pension plans. these obligations do not relate to the verticals and are recognized as an expense in ge capital's other continuing operations when they become probable and estimable. the additional funding obligations recognized by ge capital were $0.2 billion, $0.6 billion and $0.2 billion for the years ended december 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
certain of this additional funding is recorded as a contra expense for ge, and ge's related future pension obligations will be paid by ge capital. for certain other pension plan funding obligations triggered by the ge capital exit plan, ge agreed to assume the funding obligation that would have been triggered by ge capital at the date of exit from the plan in exchange for an assumption fee that ge recorded as other income. the total cash transferred to ge for the assumption of these ge capital funding obligations were zero, $0.2 billion and $0.1 billion for the years ended december 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
on a consolidated basis, the additional required pension funding and any related assumption fees do not affect current period earnings. any additional required pension funding will be reflected as a reduction of the pension liability when paid.
ge guarantee of ge capital third-party transactions in certain instances, ge provides guarantees for ge capital transactions with third parties primarily in connection with enabled orders. in order to meet its underwriting criteria, ge capital may obtain a direct guarantee from ge related to the performance of the third party. ge guarantees can take many forms and may include, but not be limited to, direct performance or payment guarantees, return on investment guarantees, asset value guarantees and loss pool arrangements. as of december 31, 2017, ge had outstanding guarantees to ge capital on $2.1 billion of funded exposure and $0.8 billion of unfunded commitments. the recorded contingent liability for these guarantees was $0.2 billion as of december 31, 2017 and is based on individual transaction level defaults, losses and/or returns.
80 ge 2017 form 10-k md&amp;a   financial resources and liquidity ge guarantee of certain ge capital debt ge provides implicit and explicit support to ge capital through commitments, capital contributions and operating support. as previously discussed, ge debt assumed from ge capital in connection with the merger of ge capital into ge was $47.1 billion and ge guaranteed $44.0 billion of ge capital debt at december 31, 2017. see note 23 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information about the eliminations of intercompany transactions between ge and ge capital.
contractual obligations as defined by reporting regulations, our contractual obligations for estimated future payments as of december 31, 2017, follow.
operating lease obligations (note 25)                         5.3           1.1               1.7               1.2                 1.3

(a)   included all take-or-pay arrangements, capital expenditures, contractual commitments to purchase equipment that will be leased to others, software acquisition/license commitments, contractual minimum programming commitments and any contractually required cash payments for acquisitions.
(b)   excluded funding commitments entered into in the ordinary course of business. see notes 19 and 21 to the consolidated financial statements for further information on these commitments and other guarantees.
(c)   included all contracts associated with our run-off insurance operations and represents the present value of future policy benefit and claim reserves.
(d)   included an estimate of future expected funding requirements related to our postretirement benefit plans and included liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits. because their future cash outflows are uncertain, the following non-current liabilities are excluded from the table above: derivatives, deferred revenue and other sundry items. see notes 12, 13 and 19 to the consolidated financial statements for further information on certain of these items.
alstom holds redemption rights with respect to its interest in certain joint ventures, that would require us to purchase all of their interest, and alstom has expressed an intent to exercise those redemption rights. none of the amounts related to alstom's redemption rights are included in the above table. see note 14 to the consolidated financial statements for further information.
md&amp;a   critical accounting estimates critical accounting estimates accounting estimates and assumptions discussed in this section are those that we consider to be the most critical to an understanding of our financial statements because they involve significant judgments and uncertainties. many of these estimates include determining fair value. all of these estimates reflect our best judgment about current, and for some estimates future, economic and market conditions and their potential effects based on information available as of the date of these financial statements. if these conditions change from those expected, it is reasonably possible that the judgments and estimates described below could change, which may result in future impairments of investment securities, goodwill, intangibles and long-lived assets, revisions to estimated profitability on long-term product service agreements, incremental losses on financing receivables, increases in reserves for contingencies, establishment of valuation allowances on deferred tax assets and increased tax liabilities, among other effects. also see note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, which discusses our most significant accounting policies.
revenue recognition on long-term product services agreements we have long-term service agreements with our customers predominately within our power, aviation, transportation and oil and gas segments. these agreements require us to maintain the customers' assets over the contract term. contract terms are generally 5 to 25 years. however, contract modifications that extend or revise contracts are not uncommon.
we recognize revenue as we perform under the arrangements based upon costs incurred at the estimated margin rate of the contract. revenue recognition on long-term product services agreements requires estimates of both customer payments expected to be received over the contract term as well as the costs to perform required maintenance services.
customers generally pay us based on the utilization of the asset (per hour of usage for example) or upon the occurrence of a major event within the contract such as an overhaul. as a result, a significant estimate in determining expected revenues of a contract is estimating how customers will utilize their assets over the term of the agreement. the estimate of utilization will impact both the amount of customer payments we expect to receive and our estimate of costs to complete the agreement as asset utilization will influence the timing and extent of overhauls and other service events over the life of the contract. we generally use a combination of both historical utilization trends as well as forward-looking information such as market conditions and potential asset retirements in developing our revenue estimates.
to develop our cost estimates, we consider the timing and extent of future maintenance and overhaul events, including the amount and cost of labor, spare parts and other resources required to perform the services. in developing our cost estimates, we utilize a combination of our historical cost experience and expected cost improvements. cost improvements are only included in future cost estimates after savings have been observed in actual results or proven effective through an extensive regulatory or engineering approval process.
we routinely review estimates under product services agreements and regularly revise them to adjust for changes in outlook. these revisions are based on objectively verifiable information that is available at the time of the review. contract modifications to exercise purchase options, add work scope or extend the contract term are generally accounted for as revisions to our future revenues and expected costs estimates. certain contract modifications that significantly change the nature, timing and extent of remaining cash flows are effectively accounted for as a new contract.
the difference between the timing of our revenue recognition and cash received from our customers results in either a contract asset (revenue in excess of billings) or a contract liability (billing in excess of revenue). as of december 31, 2017, and 2016, we are in a net contract asset position of $15.2 billion and $12.8 billion, including contracts in liability position totaling $3.0 billion and $3.8 billion, respectively.
we regularly assess customer credit risk inherent in the carrying amounts of receivables and contract assets and estimated earnings, including the risk that contractual penalties may not be sufficient to offset our accumulated investment in the event of customer termination. we gain insight into future utilization and cost trends, as well as credit risk, through our knowledge of the installed base of equipment and the close interaction with our customers that comes with supplying critical services and parts over extended periods. revisions may affect a product services agreement's total estimated profitability resulting in an adjustment of earnings; such adjustments increased earnings by $2.1 billion, $2.2 billion and $1.4 billion in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. we provide for probable losses when they become evident.

investments we regularly review investment securities for impairment using both quantitative and qualitative criteria. for debt securities, if we do not intend to sell the security and it is not more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery of our amortized cost, we evaluate other qualitative criteria to determine whether a credit loss exists, such as the financial health of and specific prospects for the issuer, including whether the issuer is in compliance with the terms and covenants of the security. quantitative criteria include determining whether there has been an adverse change in expected future cash flows. for equity securities, our criteria include the length of time and magnitude of the amount that each security is in an unrealized loss position. our other-than-temporary impairment reviews involve our finance, risk and asset management functions as well as the portfolio management and research capabilities of our internal and third-party asset managers. see note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, which discusses the determination of fair value of investment securities.
see notes 1 and 3 to the consolidated financial statements for further information about actual and potential impairment losses.
long-lived assets we review long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the related carrying amounts may not be recoverable. determining whether an impairment has occurred typically requires various estimates and assumptions, including determining which undiscounted cash flows are directly related to the potentially impaired asset, the useful life over which cash flows will occur, their amount, and the asset's residual value, if any. in turn, measurement of an impairment loss requires a determination of fair value, which is based on the best information available. we derive the required undiscounted cash flow estimates from our historical experience and our internal business plans. to determine fair value, we use quoted market prices when available, our internal cash flow estimates discounted at an appropriate discount rate and independent appraisals, as appropriate.
our operating lease portfolio of commercial aircraft is a significant concentration of assets in capital, and is particularly subject to market fluctuations. therefore, we test recoverability of each aircraft in our operating lease portfolio at least annually. additionally, we perform quarterly evaluations in circumstances such as when aircraft are re-leased, current lease terms have changed or a specific lessee's credit standing changes. we consider market conditions, such as global demand for commercial aircraft. estimates of future rentals and residual values are based on historical experience and information received routinely from independent appraisers. estimated cash flows from future leases are reduced for expected downtime between leases and for estimated costs required to prepare aircraft to be redeployed. fair value used to measure impairment is based on management's best estimates which are benchmarked against third-party appraiser current market values for aircraft of similar type and age.
see notes 7 and 21 to the consolidated financial statements for further information on impairment losses and our exposure to the commercial aviation industry.
goodwill and other identified intangible assets we test goodwill for impairment annually in the third quarter of each year using data as of july 1. the impairment test consists of two steps: in step one, the carrying value of the reporting unit is compared with its fair value; in step two, which is applied when the carrying value is more than its fair value, the amount of goodwill impairment, if any, is derived by deducting the fair value of the reporting unit's assets and liabilities from the fair value of its equity, and comparing that amount with the carrying amount of goodwill. we determined fair values for each of the reporting units using the market approach, when available and appropriate, or the income approach, or a combination of both. we assess the valuation methodology based upon the relevance and availability of the data at the time we perform the valuation. if multiple valuation methodologies are used, the results are weighted appropriately.
valuations using the market approach are derived from metrics of publicly traded companies or historically completed transactions of comparable businesses. the selection of comparable businesses is based on the markets in which the reporting units operate giving consideration to risk profiles, size, geography, and diversity of products and services. a market approach is limited to reporting units for which there are publicly traded companies that have the characteristics similar to our businesses.
under the income approach, fair value is determined based on the present value of estimated future cash flows, discounted at an appropriate risk-adjusted rate. we use our internal forecasts to estimate future cash flows and include an estimate of long-term future growth rates based on our most recent views of the long-term outlook for each business. actual results may differ from those assumed in our forecasts. we derive our discount rates using a capital asset pricing model and analyzing published rates for industries relevant to our reporting units to estimate the cost of equity financing. we use discount rates that are commensurate with the risks and uncertainty inherent in the respective businesses and in our internally developed forecasts. discount rates used in our reporting unit valuations ranged from 9.0% to 18.0%.
md&amp;a   critical accounting estimates estimating the fair value of reporting units requires the use of estimates and significant judgments that are based on a number of factors including actual operating results. it is reasonably possible that the judgments and estimates described above could change in future periods.
during the third quarter of 2017, we performed our annual impairment test of goodwill for all of our reporting units. based on the results of our step one testing, the fair values of each of the ge reporting units exceeded their carrying values except for the power conversion reporting unit, within our power segment. therefore, we performed the second step of the impairment test and recognized a non-cash goodwill impairment loss of $947 million during the third quarter.
in the fourth quarter of 2017, we performed an interim impairment test at our power conversion reporting unit and energy financial services reporting unit, within our capital segment, which indicated that the carrying values for each of these reporting units were in excess of its fair value. we therefore performed the second step of the impairment test, which resulted in non-cash impairment losses of $217 million and $1,386 million at our power conversion and energy financial services reporting units, respectively.
we review identified intangible assets with defined useful lives and subject to amortization for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the related carrying amounts may not be recoverable. determining whether an impairment loss occurred requires comparing the carrying amount to the sum of undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. we test intangible assets with indefinite lives annually for impairment using a fair value method such as discounted cash flows.
see notes 1 and 8 to the consolidated financial statements for further information.
businesses and assets held for sale businesses and assets held for sale represent components that meet the accounting requirements to be classified as held for sale and are presented as single asset and liability amounts in our financial statements with a valuation allowance, if necessary, to recognize the net carrying amount at the lower of cost or fair value, less cost to sell. financing receivables that no longer qualify to be presented as held for investment must be classified as assets held for sale and recognized in our financial statements at the lower of cost or fair value, less cost to sell, with that amount representing a new cost basis at the date of transfer.
the determination of fair value for businesses and assets held for sale involves significant judgments and assumptions. development of estimates of fair values in this circumstance is complex and is dependent upon, among other factors, the nature of the potential sales transaction (for example, asset sale versus sale of legal entity), composition of assets and/or businesses in the disposal group, the comparability of the disposal group to market transactions, negotiations with third party purchasers, etc. such factors bear directly on the range of potential fair values and the selection of the best estimates. key assumptions are developed based on market observable data and, in the absence of such data, internal information that is consistent with what market participants would use in a hypothetical transaction.
we review all businesses and assets held for sale each reporting period to determine whether the existing carrying amounts are fully recoverable in comparison to estimated fair values.
pension assumptions pension assumptions are significant inputs to the actuarial models that measure pension benefit obligations and related effects on operations. two assumptions - discount rate and expected return on assets - are important elements of plan expense and asset/liability measurement. we evaluate these critical assumptions at least annually on a plan and country-specific basis. we periodically evaluate other assumptions involving demographic factors such as retirement age, mortality and turnover, and update them to reflect our experience and expectations for the future. actual results in any given year will often differ from actuarial assumptions because of economic and other factors.
projected benefit obligations are measured as the present value of expected payments. we discount those cash payments using the weighted average of market-observed yields for high-quality fixed-income securities with maturities that correspond to the payment of benefits. lower discount rates increase present values and subsequent-year pension expense; higher discount rates decrease present values and subsequent-year pension expense.
our discount rates for principal pension plans at december 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 were 3.64%, 4.11% and 4.38%, respectively, reflecting market interest rates.
84 ge 2017 form 10-k md&amp;a   critical accounting estimates to determine the expected long-term rate of return on pension plan assets, we consider current and target asset allocations, as well as historical and expected returns on various categories of plan assets. in developing future long-term return expectations for our principal benefit plans' assets, we formulate views on the future economic environment, both in the u.s. and abroad. we evaluate general market trends and historical relationships among a number of key variables that impact asset class returns such as expected earnings growth, inflation, valuations, yields and spreads, using both internal and external sources. we also take into account expected volatility by asset class and diversification across classes to determine expected overall portfolio results given current and target allocations. assets in our principal pension plans earned 13.8% in 2017, and had average annual returns of 8.2%, 4.0% and 8.3% per year in the 5-, 10- and 25-year periods ended december 31, 2017, respectively. the average historical 10- and 25- year returns were significantly affected by investment losses in 2008. based on our analysis of future expectations of asset performance, past return results, and our current and target asset allocations, including our previously announced $6.0 billion expected contribution to the ge pension plan in 2018, we have assumed a 6.75% long-term expected return on those assets for cost recognition in 2018 as compared to 7.5% in 2017, 2016 and 2015.
changes in key assumptions for our principal pension plans would have the following effects.
•   discount rate - a 25 basis point increase in discount rate would decrease pension cost in the following year by $0.2 billion and would decrease the pension benefit obligation at year-end by about $2.4 billion.
see other consolidated information - postretirement benefit plans section within the md&a and note 12 to the consolidated financial statements for further information on our pension plans.
income taxes our annual tax rate is based on our income, statutory tax rates and tax planning opportunities available to us in the various jurisdictions in which we operate. tax laws are complex and subject to different interpretations by the taxpayer and respective governmental taxing authorities. significant judgment is required in determining our tax expense and in evaluating our tax positions, including evaluating uncertainties. we review our tax positions quarterly and adjust the balances as new information becomes available. our income tax rate is significantly affected by the tax rate on our global operations. in addition to local country tax laws and regulations, this rate depends on the extent earnings are indefinitely reinvested outside the u.s. historically u.s. taxes were due upon repatriation of foreign earnings. due to the enactment of u.s. tax reform, repatriations of foreign earnings will generally be free of u.s. federal income tax but may incur withholding or state taxes. indefinite reinvestment is determined by management's judgment about and intentions concerning the future operations of the company. most of these earnings have been reinvested in active non-u.s. business operations. at december 31, 2017, we have not changed our indefinite reinvestment decision as a result of tax reform but will reassess this during the course of 2018 as we consider the impact of u.s. tax reform.
deferred income tax assets represent amounts available to reduce income taxes payable on taxable income in future years. such assets arise because of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, as well as from net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. we evaluate the recoverability of these future tax deductions and credits by assessing the adequacy of future expected taxable income from all sources, including reversal of taxable temporary differences, forecasted operating earnings and available tax planning strategies. these sources of income rely heavily on estimates. we use our historical experience and our short- and long-range business forecasts to provide insight. further, our global and diversified business portfolio gives us the opportunity to employ various prudent and feasible tax planning strategies to facilitate the recoverability of future deductions. amounts recorded for deferred tax assets related to non-u.s. net operating losses, net of valuation allowances, were $3.7 billion and $3.1 billion at december 31, 2017 and 2016, including $0.3 billion and $0.3 billion at december 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, of deferred tax assets, net of valuation allowances, associated with losses reported in discontinued operations, primarily related to our real estate and consumer businesses and our loss on the sale of ge money japan. such year-end 2017 amounts are expected to be fully recoverable within the applicable statutory expiration periods. to the extent we consider it more likely than not that a deferred tax asset will not be recovered, a valuation allowance is established.
the impact of u.s. tax reform has been recorded on a provisional basis as the legislation provides for additional guidance to be issued by the u.s. department of the treasury on several provisions including the computation of the transition tax on historic foreign earnings. guidance during 2018 could impact the information required for and the calculation of the transition tax charge and could affect decisions on timing of various u.s. and foreign items which would further impact the final 2017 amounts included in the transition charge and the revaluation of deferred taxes. in addition, analysis performed and conclusions reached as part of the tax return filing process and additional guidance on accounting for u.s. tax reform could affect the provisional amount.
md&amp;a   critical accounting estimates additionally, as part of u.s. tax reform, the u.s. has enacted a tax on "base eroding" payments from the u.s. we are evaluating the impact of this new provision on our operations and intend to restructure ongoing operations to avoid a significant impact from this provision. the u.s. has also enacted a minimum tax on foreign earnings ("global intangible low-taxed income"). because we have tangible assets outside the u.s. and pay a rate of foreign tax above the minimum tax rate, we are not expecting a significant increase in tax liability from this new u.s. minimum tax. because aspects of the new law and the effect on our operations is uncertain and because aspects of the accounting rules associated with the tax on global intangible low-taxed income have not been resolved, we have not made a provisional accrual for the deferred tax effects and consequently have not yet made an accounting policy election on the deferred tax treatment of this tax.
see other consolidated information - income taxes section within the md&a and note 13 to the consolidated financial statements for further information on income taxes.
derivatives and hedging we use derivatives to manage a variety of risks, including risks related to interest rates, foreign exchange and commodity prices. accounting for derivatives as hedges requires that, at inception and over the term of the arrangement, the hedged item and related derivative meet the requirements for hedge accounting. the rules and interpretations related to derivatives accounting are complex. failure to apply this complex guidance correctly will result in all changes in the fair value of the derivative being reported in earnings, without regard to the offsetting changes in the fair value of the hedged item.
in evaluating whether a particular relationship qualifies for hedge accounting, we test effectiveness at inception and each reporting period thereafter by determining whether changes in the fair value of the derivative offset, within a specified range, changes in the fair value of the hedged item. if fair value changes fail this test, we discontinue applying hedge accounting to that relationship prospectively. fair values of both the derivative instrument and the hedged item are calculated using internal valuation models incorporating market-based assumptions, subject to third-party confirmation, as applicable.
see notes 1, 10 and 19 to the consolidated financial statements for further information about our use of derivatives.
fair value measurements assets and liabilities measured at fair value every reporting period include investments in debt and equity securities and derivatives. other assets and liabilities are subject to fair value measurements only in certain circumstances, including purchase accounting applied to assets and liabilities acquired in a business combination, impaired loans that have been reduced based on the fair value of the underlying collateral, cost and equity method investments and long-lived assets that are written down to fair value when they are impaired. upon closing an acquisition, we estimate the fair values of assets and liabilities acquired and integrate the acquisition as soon as practicable. the size, scope and complexity of an acquisition will affect the time it takes to obtain the necessary information to record the acquired assets and liabilities at fair value. it may take up to one year to finalize the initial fair value estimates used in the preliminary purchase accounting. accordingly, it is reasonably likely that our initial estimates will be subsequently revised, which could affect carrying amounts of goodwill, intangibles and potentially other assets and liabilities in our financial statements. assets that are written down to fair value, less cost to sell when impaired are not subsequently adjusted to fair value unless further impairment occurs.
a fair value measurement is determined as the price we would receive to sell an asset or pay to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. in the absence of active markets for the identical assets or liabilities, such measurements involve developing assumptions based on market observable data and, in the absence of such data, internal information that is consistent with what market participants would use in a hypothetical transaction that occurs at the measurement date. the determination of fair value often involves significant judgments about assumptions such as determining an appropriate discount rate that factors in both risk and liquidity premiums, identifying the similarities and differences in market transactions, weighting those differences accordingly and then making the appropriate adjustments to those market transactions to reflect the risks specific to our asset being valued.
see notes 1, 3, 8, 18 and 19 to the consolidated financial statements for further information on fair value measurements and related matters.
other loss contingencies other loss contingencies are uncertain and unresolved matters that arise in the ordinary course of business and result from events or actions by others that have the potential to result in a future loss. such contingencies include, but are not limited to environmental obligations, litigation, regulatory proceedings, product quality and losses resulting from other events and developments.
86 ge 2017 form 10-k md&amp;a   critical accounting estimates when a loss is considered probable and reasonably estimable, we record a liability in the amount of our best estimate for the ultimate loss. when there appears to be a range of possible costs with equal likelihood, liabilities are based on the low-end of such range. however, the likelihood of a loss with respect to a particular contingency is often difficult to predict and determining a meaningful estimate of the loss or a range of loss may not be practicable based on the information available and the potential effect of future events and decisions by third parties that will determine the ultimate resolution of the contingency. moreover, it is not uncommon for such matters to be resolved over many years, during which time relevant developments and new information must be continuously evaluated to determine both the likelihood of potential loss and whether it is possible to reasonably estimate a range of possible loss. when a loss is probable but a reasonable estimate cannot be made, disclosure is provided.
disclosure also is provided when it is reasonably possible that a loss will be incurred or when it is reasonably possible that the amount of a loss will exceed the recorded provision. we regularly review all contingencies to determine whether the likelihood of loss has changed and to assess whether a reasonable estimate of the loss or range of loss can be made. as discussed above, development of a meaningful estimate of loss or a range of potential loss is complex when the outcome is directly dependent on negotiations with or decisions by third parties, such as regulatory agencies, the court system and other interested parties. such factors bear directly on whether it is possible to reasonably estimate a range of potential loss and boundaries of high and low estimates.
see note 21 to the consolidated financial statements for further information.
insurance and investment contract liabilities insurance and investment contract liabilities amounted to $38.1 billion and $26.1 billion at december 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. these primarily comprise a liability for future policy benefits for those claims not yet incurred and claim reserves for claims that have been incurred or are estimated to have been incurred but not yet reported.
future policy benefit reserves amounted to $30.6 billion and $18.7 billion primarily comprising $16.5 billion and $7.6 billion related to long-term care insurance contracts and $9.4 billion and $9.3 billion related to structured settlement annuities and other life and disability insurance products at december 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. long-term care insurance provides defined benefit levels of protection against the cost of long-term care services provided in the insured's home, in assisted living or nursing home facilities. structured settlement annuities typically provide fixed monthly or annual annuity payments through death of the policyholder (with some specifying a minimum duration of payments) while traditional life and disability insurance triggers a payment in the event of death or disability of the policyholder.
future policy benefit reserves represent the present value of future policy benefits less the present value of future net premiums and were first established based on actuarial assumptions at the time the policies were issued or acquired plus a margin for adverse deviation. these assumptions include, but are not limited to, interest rates, health care experience (including type and cost of care), morbidity, mortality, the length of time a policy will remain in force and anticipated future premium increases from future in-force rate actions. assumptions are locked-in throughout the life of a contract unless a premium deficiency develops. our annual premium deficiency testing assesses the adequacy of future policy benefit reserves, net of capitalized acquisition costs, using current assumptions. the results of historic premium deficiency testing were mostly driven by changes in assumptions, results from line of business experience studies and the impact from changes in estimated reinvestment rates on investment securities. we have not originated new policies since 2006.
during 2017, in response to elevated claim experience for a portion of our long-term care insurance contracts that was most pronounced for policyholders with higher attained ages, we initiated a comprehensive review of premium deficiency assumptions across all insurance products, which included reconstructing our future claim cost assumptions for long-term care contracts utilizing trends observed in our emerging experience for older claimant ages and later duration policies. certain of our long-term care policyholders only recently started to reach the prime claim paying period and our new claim cost assumptions considered the emerging credibility of this claim data. in addition to the adverse impact from the revised future claim cost assumptions over a long-term horizon, our premium deficiency assumptions considered mortality, length of time a policy will remain in force and both near-term and longer-term investment return expectations. future investment yields estimated in 2017 were lower than in previous premium deficiency tests, primarily due to the effect of near term yields on approximately $15 billion of future expected capital contributions. the test indicated a premium deficiency resulting in the unlocking of reserves and resetting of actuarial assumptions to current assumptions. this resulted in a $9.5 billion charge to earnings, which included a $0.4 billion impairment of deferred acquisition costs, a $0.2 billion impairment of present value of future profits, and an $8.9 billion increase in future policy benefit reserves. we commenced integrating these new assumptions into our systems and processes embedded in our framework of internal controls over financial reporting and expect to continue the integration in 2018.
we cede our insurance risk to third party reinsurers for a portion of our insurance contracts. as we are not relieved from primary obligation to policyholders or cedents, we record receivables that are estimated in a manner consistent with the future policy benefit reserves and claim reserves. reserves ceded to reinsurers, net of allowance, were $2.5 billion and $2.0 billion at december 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively and are included in the caption "other ge capital receivables" on our consolidated statement of financial position. in connection with our premium deficiency test in 2017, additions to reinsurance recoverables of $2.4 billion were largely offset by an allowance for losses of $2.2 billion based upon our assessment of collectability that would otherwise have reduced the earnings impact of the premium deficiency. the vast majority of our remaining net reinsurance recoverables are secured by assets held in a trust for which we are the beneficiary.
md&amp;a   critical accounting estimates a comprehensive review of premium deficiency assumptions is a complex process and depends on a number of factors, many of which are interdependent and require evaluation individually and in the aggregate across all insurance products. the vast majority of our run-off insurance operations comprises reinsurance from multiple ceding insurance entities with underlying treaties having unique terms and conditions. premium deficiency testing relies on claim and policy information provided by these ceding entities and considers each of the unique treaties. in order to utilize that information for purposes of completing experience studies covering all key assumptions, we perform detailed procedures to conform and validate the data received, including periodic evaluation of the operating environment at ceding entities. our long-term care business includes coverage where credible claim experience for higher attained ages is still emerging and to the extent that future experience deviates from current expectations, new projections of claim costs extending over the expected life of the policies may be required. significant uncertainties exist in making current projections for these long-duration insurance contracts that include consideration of a wide range of possible outcomes as well as actuarial peer reviews before a final determination can be made.
in response to the premium deficiency, our future policy benefit reserves at december 31, 2017 were unlocked and updated to reflect our most recent assumptions. the primary assumptions used in the premium deficiency tests include:
morbidity. morbidity assumptions used in estimating future policy benefit reserves are based on estimates of expected incidences of disability and claim costs, and include consideration of antiselection and estimates of expected future morbidity improvement. historical premium deficiency assumptions considered the risk of antiselection by including issue age adjustments to morbidity based on an actuarial assumption that long-term care policies issued to younger individuals have exhibited lower expected incidences and claim costs than those issued to older policyholders. recent claim experience and the development of reconstructed claim cost curves indicated minimal issue age adjustments impacting claim cost projections and accordingly, in 2017 issue age adjustments were no longer assumed in developing morbidity assumptions.
mortality. mortality assumptions used in estimating future policy benefit reserves are based on published mortality tables as adjusted for the results of our experience studies and estimates of expected future mortality improvement. for life insurance products, higher mortality increases our future policy benefit reserves, while for annuity and long-term care insurance contracts, higher mortality decreases our future policy benefit reserves.
discount rate. interest rate assumptions used in estimating future policy benefit reserves are based on expected investment yields, net of related investment expenses. in estimating future yields, we consider the actual yields on our current investment securities held by our run-off insurance operations, the future rates at which we expect to reinvest any proceeds from investment security maturities, and the average long-term yield we expect from the proceeds of estimated future capital contributions into our run-off insurance operations. such contribution may comprise cash that will be used to purchase investment securities or other qualifying investments from ge capital's portfolio. the adverse impact on our statutory reserves arising from our revised assumptions, including the collectability of reinsurance recoverables, is expected to require ge capital to contribute approximately $15 billion additional capital to its run-off insurance operations in 2018-2024, subject to ongoing monitoring by the kansas insurance department. ge is required to maintain specified capital levels at these insurance subsidiaries under a capital maintenance agreement. the cash component of the capital contribution will be invested at the current market yields at the time of contribution, which has the impact of lowering the average long-term investment yield used to calculate the discount rate and, as such, further adversely impacted the estimated premium deficiency. our discount rate assumptions for purposes of performing premium deficiency assessments ranged from 2.6% - 6.0% in 2017 with a weighted-average rate of 5.7% across different tenors and 5.3% - 6.7% in 2016 with a weighted-average rate of 6.2%.
future long-term care premium rate increases. we consider recent experience with rate increases in establishing our current expectations. as a reinsurer, we rely upon the primary insurers that underwrite the underlying policies to propose rate increases to the relevant state insurance regulator as we have no ability to institute premium rate increases on the policyholders themselves.
we perform premium deficiency testing at least annually. the results of this test are sensitive to the assumptions described above. any future adverse changes in our assumptions could result in an increase to future policy benefit reserves. for example, a hypothetical five percent increase in future claim costs, holding all other assumptions constant, would result in a $1.5 billion increase to our future policy benefit reserves. similarly, a hypothetical 25 basis point decline in expected investment yield, holding all other assumptions constant, would result in a $1.0 billion increase in future policy benefit reserves. any favorable changes to these assumptions could result in additional margin in our premium deficiency test and higher income over the remaining duration of the portfolio, including higher investment income.
claim reserves amounted to $5.1 billion and $4.6 billion of which $3.6 billion and $3.1 billion relates to long-term care insurance contracts as of december 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. claim reserves are established when a claim is incurred or is estimated to have been incurred and represents our best estimate of the ultimate obligations for future claim payments and claim adjustment expenses. key inputs include actual known facts about the claims, such as the benefits available and cause of disability of the claimant, as well as assumptions derived from our actual historical experience and expected future changes in experience factors. claim reserves are evaluated periodically for potential changes in loss estimates with the support of qualified actuaries and any changes are recorded in the period in which they are determined.

asu no. 2017-07, compensation-retirement benefits (topic 715): improving the presentation of net periodic pension cost and net periodic postretirement benefit cost in march 2017, the financial accounting standards board (fasb) issued asu no. 2017-07, compensation-retirement benefits (topic 715): improving the presentation of net periodic pension cost and net periodic postretirement benefit cost. the asu is effective for annual periods beginning after december 15, 2017, and requires the service cost component of the net periodic costs for pension and postretirement plans to be presented in the same line item in the statement of earnings as other employee related compensation costs, with the non-service related costs in a separate line outside of operating income. this change to the income statement will be reflected on a retrospective basis when adopted. in addition, the asu specifies that only the service cost component is eligible for inventory capitalization following the date of adoption, which is not expected to have a material effect to our financial statements.
asu no. 2016-18, statement of cash flows: restricted cash in november 2016, the fasb issued asu no. 2016-18, statement of cash flows: restricted cash. the new standard requires the changes in the total of cash and restricted cash to be presented in the statement of cash flows. in addition, when cash and restricted cash are presented on separate lines on the balance sheet, an entity is required to reconcile the totals in the statement of cash flows to the related line items in the balance sheet. we had $0.7 billion of restricted cash reported within the other assets line of our statement of financial position for the year ended december 31, 2017.
asu no. 2016-16, accounting for income taxes: intra-entity transfers of assets other than inventory in october 2016, the fasb issued asu no. 2016-16, accounting for income taxes: intra-entity asset transfers of assets other than inventory. the asu eliminates the deferral of the tax effects of intra-entity asset transfers other than inventory. as a result, the tax expense from the intercompany sale of assets, other than inventory, and associated changes to deferred taxes will be recognized when the sale occurs even though the pre-tax effects of the transaction have not been recognized. the new standard is effective for annual periods beginning after december 15, 2017, and interim periods within those annual periods. the effect of the adoption of the standard will depend on the nature and amount of future transactions but is currently expected as an increase to retained earnings of approximately $0.6 billion. future earnings will be reduced in total by this amount. the effect of the change on future transactions will depend on the nature of those transactions as it will affect the timing of recognition of both tax expense and tax benefits, with no change in associated cash flows.
asu no. 2016-15, statement of cash flows: classification of certain cash receipts and cash payments in august 2016, the fasb issued asu no. 2016-15, statement of cash flows: classification of certain cash receipts and cash payments. the new standard requires that cash receipts from payments on a transferor's beneficial interests in securitized trade receivables should be classified as cash inflows from investing activities. the new standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after december 15, 2017 and will be adopted on a retrospective basis. note 4 to the financial statements describes the deferred purchase price (dpp) created by the receivables facility. we currently report cash receipts from the purchasing entities to reduce their dpp obligation to the company as cash inflows from operating activities in the consolidated statement of cash flows.
md&amp;a   other items asu no. 2016-02, leases in february 2016, the fasb issued asu no. 2016-02, leases. the new standard establishes a right-of-use (rou) model that requires a lessee to record a rou asset and a lease liability on the balance sheet for all leases with terms longer than 12 months. leases will be classified as either finance or operating, with classification affecting the pattern of expense recognition. similarly, lessors will be required to classify leases as sales-type, finance or operating, with classification affecting the pattern of income recognition. classification for both lessees and lessors will be based on an assessment of whether risks and rewards as well as substantive control have been transferred through a lease contract. the new standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after december 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years, with early adoption permitted. a modified retrospective transition approach is required for leases existing at, or entered into after, the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented in the financial statements, with certain practical expedients available. while we continue to evaluate the effect of the standard on our ongoing financial reporting, we anticipate that the adoption of the asu may materially affect our statement of financial position.
asu no. 2014-09, revenue from contracts with customers background in may 2014, the fasb issued a new comprehensive set of revenue recognition principles (asu no. 2014-09, revenue from contracts with customers) that supersedes most existing u.s. gaap revenue recognition guidance (including asc 605-35, revenue recognition - construction-type and production-type contracts). the new standard will become effective for annual reporting periods beginning after december 15, 2017. we will adopt the standard on january 1, 2018, will apply it retrospectively to all periods presented and will elect the practical expedient for contract modifications.
change in timing and presentation, no impact to cash or economics the new standard requires companies to identify contractual performance obligations and determine whether revenue should be recognized at a point in time or over time based on when control of goods and services transfer to a customer. as a result, we expect significant changes in the presentation of our financial statements, including: (1) timing of revenue recognition, and (2) changes in classification between revenue and costs. the new standard will have no cash impact and, as such, does not affect the economics of our underlying customer contracts. the effect of applying the new guidance to our existing book of contracts will result in lower reported earnings in 2018 (and comparative periods previously reported) and in the early years after adoption. however, we expect to experience an increase in reported earnings, on that existing book of contracts, as they mature. the new standard will provide for a better alignment of cash and earnings for the affected long-term customer contracts and we expect that it will enhance comparability across industry peers.
specific effect on ge businesses power and aviation service agreements - for our long-term product service agreements, primarily in our power and aviation businesses, we expect to continue to recognize revenue based on costs incurred plus an estimated margin rate (over time model). however, the new standard provides prescriptive guidance tied to several factors for determining what constitutes the proper scope of a customer contract for accounting purposes. these factors include optional purchases, contract modifications, and termination clauses. for example, under the new standard contract modifications will be accounted for prospectively by recognizing the financial effect of the modification over the remaining life of the contract. under existing accounting guidance revisions to estimated margin rates resulting from modifications were reflected as cumulative effect adjustments to earnings in the current period.
aviation commercial engines - consistent with industry peers, the financial presentation of our aviation commercial engines business will be significantly affected as they will be accounted for as of a point in time, which is a change from our current long-term contract accounting process. our current process applies contract-specific estimated margin rates, which include the effect of estimated cost improvements, to costs incurred. this change is required because our commercial engine contracts do not transfer control to the customer during the manufacturing process. each install and spare engine will be accounted for as a separate performance obligation, reflecting the actual price and manufacturing costs of such engines. we expect that the most significant effect of this change will be reflected when we have new engine launches, where the cost of earlier production units is higher than the cost of later production units because of cost improvements.
all other large equipment - for the remainder of our equipment businesses, the new revenue standard requires emphasis on transfer of control rather than risks and rewards, which may accelerate timing of revenue recognition versus our current practices. for example, in our renewable energy business we wait for risk of loss to be assumed by the customer before recognizing revenue, which generally occurs later than when control is transferred.
90 ge 2017 form 10-k md&amp;a   other items current range of financial statement effect we will adopt the new standard as of january 1, 2018. when we report our 2018 results, the comparative results for 2017 and 2016 will be updated to reflect the application of the requirements of the new standard to these periods. based on our assessment and best estimates to date, we expect a non-cash charge to our january 1, 2016 retained earnings balance of approximately $4.2 billion. we estimate that the charge will comprise approximately $1.0 billion related to commercial aircraft engines and $3.3 billion related primarily to our services businesses (predominately in power and aviation). beyond those effects, we expect application of the new guidance will result in increases and decreases in revenue within our segments, which will largely offset overall and will be immaterial at a total company level. we estimate that our 2016 and 2017 restated earnings per share will be lower by approximately $0.13 and $0.16 (before any impact from u.s. tax reform), respectively, driven primarily by the required changes in accounting for long-term product service arrangements as described above. these estimates may be refined as we finalize the implementation effort required to adopt the standard. upon adoption in 2018, our books and records will only reflect the results as required under the new standard limiting our ability to estimate the effect of the standard on our earnings. given the inherent difficulty in this ongoing estimation of the effect of the standard on any future periods, we do not plan to continue to assess the effect on 2018.
to summarize, we will adopt the new standard in 2018, at which time we will update prior periods to be presented on a consistent basis. as discussed above, we anticipate a dilutive effect of the new standard in the year of adoption consistent with the effect to the restated 2016 and 2017 results and the effect will be less dilutive for years after initial adoption. however, this expectation is based on many variables, including underlying business performance, which are subject to change, making the effect of the standard on future periods difficult to estimate. importantly, application of the new guidance has no effect on the cash we expect to receive nor the economics of these contracts. rather, it will simply more closely align revenue with cash, which we believe will be helpful to our investors.

iran threat reduction and syria human rights act of 2012
under section 13(r) of the securities exchange act of 1934, enacted in 2012, ge is required to disclose in its periodic reports if it or any of its affiliates knowingly engaged in business activities relating to iran, even if those activities are conducted in accordance with authorizations subsequently issued by the u.s. government. reportable activities include investments that significantly enhance iran's ability to develop petroleum resources valued at $20 million or more in the aggregate during a twelve-month period. reporting is also required for transactions related to iran's domestic production of refined petroleum products or iran's ability to import refined petroleum products valued at $5 million or more in the aggregate during a twelve-month period.
in january 2016, the u.s. department of treasury's office of foreign assets control (ofac) issued general license h authorizing u.s.-owned or controlled foreign entities to engage in transactions with iran if these entities meet the requirements of the general license. pursuant to this authorization, a non-u.s. affiliate of ge's oil & gas business received seven purchase orders during the fourth quarter of 2017 for the sale of goods pursuant to general license h that could potentially enhance iran's ability to develop petroleum resources. the purchase orders cover the sale of valves and parts for industrial machinery and equipment used in gas plants, petrochemical plants and gas production projects in iran. these purchase orders are valued at less than €0.1 million ($0.1 million), less than €0.1 million ($0.1 million), less than €0.1 million ($0.1 million), €0.3 million ($0.3 million), €0.7 million ($0.8 million), €0.1 million ($0.1 million) and €0.8 million ($1.0 million). this non-u.s. affiliate also received a cancellation of a previously reported contract for the sale of spare parts for gas turbines. this purchase order cancellation reduces previously reported contract values by €12.3 million ($12.9 million). this non-u.s. affiliate attributed €6.8 million ($8.2 million) in gross revenues and €1.4 million ($1.7 million) in net profits against previously reported transactions during the quarter ending december 31, 2017.
a second non-u.s. affiliate of ge's oil & gas business received three purchase orders during the fourth quarter of 2017 for the sale of spares parts to support the development of offshore petroleum resources. the three purchase orders are individually valued at less than €0.1 million ($0.1 million), less than €0.1 million ($0.1 million), and less than €0.1 million ($0.1 million) each. this non-u.s. affiliate did not recognize any revenue or profit during the quarter ending december 31, 2017.
a third non-u.s. affiliate of ge's oil & gas business received a purchase order pursuant to general license h valued at €0.2 million ($0.2 million) during the fourth quarter of 2017. the non-u.s. affiliate also received a purchase order in the third quarter of 2017 valued at €0.3 million ($0.3 million). both purchase orders cover the sale of films to be used in inspection of pipelines in iran. this non-u.s. affiliate did not recognize any revenue or profit during the quarter ending december 31, 2017.
a non-u.s. affiliate of ge's power business incurred costs of €1.0 million ($1.2 million) during the fourth quarter of 2017 associated with previously reported transactions. this non-u.s. affiliate did not recognize any revenue associated with these transactions during the quarter ending december 31, 2017.
all of these non-u.s. affiliates intend to continue the activities described above, as permitted by all applicable laws and regulations.

environmental matters our operations, like operations of other companies engaged in similar businesses, involve the use, disposal and cleanup of substances regulated under environmental protection laws. we are involved in a number of remediation actions to clean up hazardous wastes as required by federal and state laws. such statutes require that responsible parties fund remediation actions regardless of fault, legality of original disposal or ownership of a disposal site. expenditures for site remediation actions amounted to approximately $0.2 billion, $0.2 billion, and $0.3 billion for the years ended december 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively. we presently expect that such remediation actions will require average annual expenditures of about $0.2 billion in 2018 and 2019, respectively.
as previously reported, in 2000, ge and the environmental protection agency (epa) entered into a consent decree relating to pcb cleanup of the housatonic river in massachusetts. following epa's release in september 2015 of an intended final remediation decision, ge and epa engaged in mediation and the first step of the dispute resolution process contemplated by the consent decree. in october 2016, the epa issued its final decision pursuant to the consent decree, which ge and several other interested parties appealed to epa's environmental appeals board (eab). the eab issued its decision on january 26, 2018, affirming parts of epa's decision and granting relief to ge on certain significant elements of its challenge. the eab remanded the decision back to epa to address those elements and reissue a revised final remedy. the revised final remedy may be appealed to the eab and ultimately the united states court of appeals for the first circuit. the full remedy will not be implemented until any appeals of the revised decision are resolved. as of december 31, 2017, and based on its assessment of current facts and circumstances and its defenses, ge believes that it has recorded adequate reserves to cover future obligations associated with an expected final remedy.

(a)   alstom was acquired in november 2015. this adjustment results in the inclusion of alstom revenues from november and december of both 2015 and 2016 in the adjusted organic revenue growth* measure as described below.
organic revenue growth measures revenue* growth excluding the effects of acquisitions, business dispositions and currency exchange rates. we believe that this measure provides management and investors with a more complete understanding of underlying operating results and trends of established, ongoing operations by excluding the effect of acquisitions, dispositions and currency exchange, which activities are subject to volatility and can obscure underlying trends. we also believe that presenting organic revenue growth* separately for our industrial businesses provides management and investors with useful information about the trends of our industrial businesses and enables a more direct comparison to other non-financial businesses and companies. management recognizes that the term "organic revenue growth" may be interpreted differently by other companies and under different circumstances. although this may have an effect on comparability of absolute percentage growth from company to company, we believe that these measures are useful in assessing trends of the respective businesses or companies and may therefore be a useful tool in assessing period-to-period performance trends.
when comparing revenue growth between periods excluding the effects of acquisitions, business dispositions and currency exchange rates, those effects are different when comparing results for different periods. revenues from acquisitions are considered inorganic from the date we complete an acquisition through the end of the fourth quarter following the acquisition and are therefore reflected as an adjustment to reported revenue to derive organic revenue for the period following the acquisition. in subsequent periods, the revenues from the acquisition become organic as these revenues are included for all periods presented. additionally, when comparing the calculation of industrial segment organic revenues* with 2017 in the first table, there is no adjustment to the 2016 gaap revenues for currency exchange rates while in the calculation of 2016 organic revenues* compared to 2015 in the second table there is an adjustment to 2016 reported revenues of $(808) million for currency exchange rates. this is the case because in the comparison of 2017 to 2016 we are adjusting the 2017 reported revenues to exclude the effect of currency exchange rates to provide a more direct comparison to the 2016 results. that is, we are adjusting 2017 reported revenues to eliminate the effects of changes in foreign currency had on 2017 revenues. additionally, when comparing 2016 to 2015, we adjust the 2016 revenue amount for the effects of currency exchange to enable a more direct comparison to 2015.

we believe that the ge effective tax rate, excluding ge capital earnings*, is best analyzed in relation to ge earnings before income taxes excluding the ge capital net earnings from continuing operations, as ge tax expense does not include taxes on ge capital earnings. management believes that in addition to the consolidated and ge capital tax rates shown in note 13 to the consolidated financial statements, this supplemental measure provides investors with useful information as it presents the ge effective tax rate that can be used in comparing the ge results to other non-financial services businesses.

operating earnings* excludes non-service-related pension costs of our principal pension plans comprising interest cost, expected return on plan assets and amortization of actuarial gains/losses. the service cost, prior service cost and curtailment loss components of our principal pension plans are included in operating earnings. we believe that these components of pension cost better reflect the ongoing service-related costs of providing pension benefits to our employees. as such, we believe that our measure of operating earnings provides management and investors with a useful measure of the operational results of our business. other components of gaap pension cost are mainly driven by capital allocation decisions and market performance, and we manage these separately from the operational performance of our businesses. neither gaap nor operating pension costs* are necessarily indicative of the current or future cash flow requirements related to our pension plans. we also believe that this measure, considered along with the corresponding gaap measure, provides management and investors with additional information for comparison of our operating results to the operating results of other companies. we believe that presenting operating earnings* separately for our industrial businesses also provides management and investors with useful information about the relative size of our industrial and financial services businesses in relation to the total company.

our ge industrial rotc* calculation excludes earnings (losses) of discontinued operations from the numerator because gaap requires us to display those earnings (losses) in the statement of earnings (loss). those earnings (losses) from discontinued operations include an allocation of interest expense either directly attributable or related to discontinued operations. net investment in discontinued operations is calculated as assets of discontinued operations less liabilities of discontinued operations, including an allocation of ge capital debt. our calculation of average ge shareowners' equity may not be directly comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. we believe that it is a clearer way to measure the ongoing trend in return on total capital for the continuing operations of our businesses given the extent that discontinued operations have affected our reported results. we believe that this results in a more relevant measure for management and investors to evaluate performance of our continuing operations, on a consistent basis, and to evaluate and compare the performance of our continuing operations with the ongoing operations of other businesses and companies.

(b)   includes average noncontrolling interests, calculated using a five-point average partially offset by the estimated value of assets held by ge to support ge capital.
our ge industrial rotc* calculation excludes earnings (losses) of discontinued operations from the numerator. we believe that this is a clearer way to measure the ongoing trend in return on ge industrial capital for the continuing operations of the business to the extent that discontinued operations have affected our reported results. our ge industrial shareowners' equity, excluding effects of discontinued operations* used in the denominator is adjusted for debt, redeemable noncontrolling interests and noncontrolling interests. we believe that these adjustments provide a more meaningful denominator in measuring the return on our industrial businesses. ge industrial rotc* was 2.7% in 2017 versus 15.4% in 2016 and 16.9% in 2015. in 2017, a 77.4% decrease in the adjusted ge industrial return was combined with a 26.8% increase in the adjusted ge industrial capital. this increase in capital was principally driven by increased debt and increases in minority interest due to our acquisition of baker hughes. our calculation of the adjusted return on ge industrial capital* may not be directly comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. we believe that the adjustments described above result in a more relevant measure for management and investors to evaluate performance of our industrial continuing operations, on a consistent basis, and to evaluate and compare the performance of our ge industrial continuing operations with the continuing operations of other businesses and companies.

we define ge industrial cfoa* as ge's cash from operating activities (continuing operations) less the amount of dividends received by ge from ge capital. this reflects the effects of intercompany transactions, which include, but are not limited to, the following: ge capital working capital solutions to optimize ge cash management; ge capital enabled ge industrial orders; ge capital financing of ge long-term receivables; aircraft engines, power equipment, renewable energy equipment and healthcare equipment manufactured by ge that are installed on ge capital investments, including leased equipment expenses related to parent-subsidiary pension plans; buildings and equipment leased between ge and ge capital, including sale leaseback transactions; information technology (it) and other services sold to ge capital by ge; and various investments, loans and allocations of ge corporate overhead costs.
we believe that investors may find it useful to compare ge's operating cash flows without the effect of ge capital dividends, since these dividends are not representative of the operating cash flows of our industrial businesses and can vary from period to period based upon the results of the financial services businesses. we also believe that investors may find it useful to compare ge industrial cfoa* and ge cfoa excluding the effects of taxes paid related to the 2017 baker hughes transaction, the sales of the water, appliances, signaling and nbcu llc businesses, contributions to our ge pension plan and the effects of oil & gas cfoa and including the effects of dividends received from bhge. management recognizes that these measures may not be comparable to cash flow results of companies which contain both industrial and financial services businesses, but believes that this comparison is aided by the provision of additional information about the amounts of dividends paid by our financial services business and the separate presentation in our financial statements of the ge capital cash flows. we believe that our measure of ge industrial cfoa* and adjusted ge industrial cfoa* provides management and investors with useful measures to compare the capacity of our industrial operations to generate operating cash flow with the operating cash flow of other non-financial businesses and companies and as such provides useful measures to supplement the reported gaap cfoa measure.
we define ge industrial free cash flow* as adjusted ge industrial cfoa* less ge additions to property, plant and equipment and additions to internal-use software, excluding oil & gas additions to property, plant and equipment and additions to internal-use software. we believe that ge industrial free cash flow* is a useful financial metric to assess our ability to pursue opportunities to enhance our growth and we believe that our measure of ge industrial free cash flow* provides investors with useful information about the company's actual performance against performance targets. management recognizes that the term free cash flow may be interpreted differently by other companies and under different circumstances. although this may have an effect on comparability of absolute percentage growth from company to company, we believe that these measures are useful in assessing trends of the respective businesses or companies and may therefore be a useful tool in assessing period-to-period performance trends.

1)   non-operating pension cost*. this amount is affected by, among other things, the timing of voluntary funding and associated asset allocation.
• the timing and magnitude of gains associated with dispositions; and
• the timing and magnitude of the costs associated with restructuring activities.
note: the company cannot provide an equivalent gaap guidance range without unreasonable effort because of the uncertainty of the amount and timing of events affecting earnings as we execute on the restructuring actions and business portfolio changes we have announced since john flannery became ceo.  although we have attempted to estimate the amount of gains and restructuring charges for the purpose of explaining the probable significance of this component, as described under number 2, this calculation involves a number of unknown variables, resulting in a gaap range that we believe is too large and variable to be meaningful.

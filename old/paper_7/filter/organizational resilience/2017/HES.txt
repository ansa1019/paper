item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations.
we do not always control decisions made under joint operating agreements and the parties under such agreements may fail to meet their obligations.  we conduct many of our e&p operations through joint operating agreements with other parties under which we may not control decisions, either because we do not have a controlling interest or are not operator under the agreement.  there is risk that these parties may at any time have economic, business, or legal interests or goals that
are inconsistent with ours, and therefore decisions may be made which are not what we believe is in our best interest.  moreover, parties to these agreements may be unable to meet their economic or other obligations and we may be required to fulfill those obligations alone.  in either case, the value of our investment may be adversely affected.
we are subject to changing laws and regulations and other governmental actions that can significantly and adversely affect our business.  federal, state, local, territorial and foreign laws and regulations relating to tax increases and retroactive tax claims, disallowance of tax credits and deductions, expropriation or nationalization of property, mandatory government participation, cancellation or amendment of contract rights, imposition of capital controls or blocking of funds, changes in import and export regulations, limitations on access to exploration and development opportunities, anti-bribery or anti-corruption laws, as well as other political developments may affect our operations.
we have substantial capital requirements, and we may not be able to obtain needed financing on satisfactory terms, if at all.  the exploration, development and production of crude oil and natural gas involves substantial costs, which may not be fully funded from operations.  for example, in 2017, we had a significant net loss and, unless commodity prices are considerably higher through 2018, we are forecasting a net loss for 2018.  two of the three major credit rating agencies that rate our debt have assigned an investment grade rating.  although, currently we do not have any borrowings under our long-term credit facility, a ratings downgrade, continued weakness in the oil and gas industry or negative outcomes within commodity and financial markets could adversely impact our access to capital markets by increasing the costs of financing, or by impacting our ability to obtain financing on satisfactory terms, or at all.  in addition, a ratings downgrade may require that we issue letters of credit or provide other forms of collateral under certain contractual requirements.  any inability to access capital markets could adversely impact our financial adaptability and our ability to execute our strategy and may also expose us to heightened exposure to credit risk.
political instability in areas where we operate can adversely affect our business.  some of the international areas in which we operate, and the partners with whom we operate, are politically less stable than other areas and partners and may be subject to civil unrest, conflict, insurgency, geographic territorial border disputes, corruption, security risks and labor unrest.  political and civil unrest in north africa and the middle east has affected and may affect our operations in these areas as well as oil and gas markets generally.  the threat of terrorism around the world also poses additional risks to the operations of the oil and gas industry.
our oil and gas operations are subject to environmental risks and environmental laws and regulations that can result in significant costs and liabilities.  our oil and gas operations, like those of the industry, are subject to environmental risks such as oil spills, produced water spills, gas leaks and ruptures and discharges of substances or gases that could expose us to substantial liability for pollution or other environmental damage.  our operations are also subject to numerous u.s. federal, state, local and foreign environmental laws and regulations.  non‐compliance with these laws and regulations may subject us to administrative, civil or criminal penalties, remedial clean-ups and natural resource damages or other liabilities.  in addition, increasingly stringent environmental regulations have resulted and will likely continue to result in higher capital expenditures and operating expenses for us and the oil and gas industry in general.  similarly, we have material legal obligations to dismantle, remove and abandon production facilities and wells that will occur many years in the future, in most cases.  these estimates may be impacted by future changes in regulations and other uncertainties.
concerns have been raised in certain jurisdictions where we have operations concerning the safety and environmental impact of the drilling and development of shale oil and gas resources, particularly hydraulic fracturing, water usage, flaring of associated natural gas and air emissions.  while we believe that these operations can be conducted safely and with minimal impact on the environment, regulatory bodies are responding to these concerns and may impose moratoriums and new regulations on such drilling operations that would likely have the effect of prohibiting or delaying such operations and increasing their cost.
climate change initiatives may result in significant operational changes and expenditures, reduced demand for our products and adversely affect our business.  we recognize that climate change is a global environmental concern.  continuing political and social attention to the issue of climate change has resulted in both existing and pending international agreements and national, regional or local legislation and regulatory measures to limit greenhouse gas emissions.  these agreements and measures may require, or could result in future legislation and regulatory measures that require, significant equipment modifications, operational changes, taxes, or purchase of emission credits to reduce emission of greenhouse gases from our operations, which may result in substantial capital expenditures and compliance, operating, maintenance and remediation costs.  in addition, our production is sold to third parties that produce petroleum fuels, which through normal end user consumption result in the emission of greenhouse gases.  regulatory initiatives to reduce the use of these fuels may reduce demand for crude oil and other hydrocarbons and have an adverse effect on our sales volumes, revenues and margins.  the imposition and enforcement of stringent greenhouse gas emissions reduction targets could severely and adversely impact the oil and gas industry and significantly reduce the value of our business.  furthermore, increasing attention to climate change risks has resulted in increased likelihood of governmental investigations and private litigation, which could increase
our costs or otherwise adversely affect our business.  for example, in 2017 certain municipalities in california separately filed lawsuits against over 30 fossil fuel producers, including us, for alleged damages purportedly caused by climate change.
our industry is highly competitive and many of our competitors are larger and have greater resources than we have.  the petroleum industry is highly competitive and very capital intensive.  we encounter competition from numerous companies in each of our activities, including acquiring rights to explore for crude oil and natural gas.  to a lesser extent, we are also in competition with producers of alternative fuels or other forms of energy, including wind, solar and electric power, and in the future could face increasing competition due to the development and adoption of new technologies.  many competitors, including national oil companies, are larger and have substantially greater resources.  increased competition for worldwide oil and gas assets could significantly increase the cost of acquiring oil and gas assets.  in addition, competition for drilling services, technical expertise and equipment may affect the availability of technical personnel and drilling rigs, resulting in increased capital and operating costs.
catastrophic events, whether naturally occurring or man‐made, may materially affect our operations and financial conditions.  our oil and gas operations are subject to unforeseen occurrences which have affected us from time to time and which may damage or destroy assets, interrupt operations and have other significant adverse effects.  examples of catastrophic risks include hurricanes, fires, explosions, blowouts, pipeline interruptions and ruptures, severe weather, geological events, labor disputes or cyber‐attacks.  we maintain insurance coverage against many, but not all, potential losses and liabilities in amounts we deem prudent, including for property and casualty losses.  there can be no assurance that such insurance will adequately protect us against liability from all potential consequences and damages.  moreover, some forms of insurance may be unavailable in the future or be available only on terms that are deemed economically unacceptable.
significant time delays between the estimated and actual occurrence of critical events associated with development projects may result in material negative economic consequences.  as part of our business, we are involved in large development projects, the completion of which may be delayed beyond what was originally planned.  such examples include, but are not limited to, delays in receiving necessary approvals from project members or regulatory agencies, timely access to necessary equipment, availability of necessary personnel, construction delays, unfavorable weather conditions and equipment failures.  this may lead to delays and differences between estimated and actual timing of critical events.  these delays could impact our future results of operations and cash flows.
departures of key members from our senior management team, and/or difficulty in recruiting and retaining adequate numbers of experienced technical personnel, could negatively impact our ability to deliver on our strategic goals.  our future success depends upon the continued service of key members of our senior management team, who play an important role in developing and implementing our strategy.  the departure of key members of senior management or an inability to recruit and retain adequate numbers of experienced technical and professional personnel in the necessary locations may prevent us from executing our strategy in full or, in part, which could negatively impact our business.
we are dependent on oilfield service companies for items including drilling rigs, equipment, supplies and skilled labor.  an inability or significant delay in securing these services, or a high cost thereof, may result in material negative economic consequences.  the availability and cost of drilling rigs, equipment, supplies and skilled labor will fluctuate over time given the cyclical nature of the e&p industry.  as a result, we may encounter difficulties in obtaining required services or could face an increase in cost.  these consequences may impact our ability to run our operations and to deliver projects on time with the potential for material negative economic consequences.
we manage commodity price and other risks through our risk management function but such activities may impede our ability to benefit from commodity price increases and can expose us to similar potential counterparty credit risk as impacts amounts due from the sale of hydrocarbons.  we may enter into additional commodity price hedging arrangements to protect us from commodity price declines.  these arrangements may, depending on the instruments used and the level of increases involved, limit any potential upside from commodity price increases.  as with accounts receivable we may be exposed to potential economic loss should a counterparty be unable or unwilling to perform their obligations under the terms of a hedging agreement.  in addition, we are exposed to risks related to changes in interest rates and foreign currency values, and may engage in hedging activities to mitigate related volatility.
one of our subsidiaries is the general partner of a publicly traded master limited partnership, hess midstream partners lp.  the responsibilities associated with being a general partner expose the us to a broader range of legal liabilities.  our control of hess midstream partners lp bestows upon us additional fiduciary duties including, but not limited to, the obligations associated with managing potential conflicts of interests, additional reporting requirements from the securities and exchange commission and the provision of tax information to unit holders of hess midstream partners lp.  these heightened duties expose us to additional potential for legal claims that may have a material negative economic impact on our shareholders.  moreover, these increased duties may lead to an increase in compliance costs and may divert management resource from our other operations.
disruption, failure or cyber security breaches affecting or targeting computer, telecommunications systems, and infrastructure used by the company may materially impact our business and operations.  computers and telecommunication systems are used to conduct our exploration, development and production activities and have become an integral part of our business.  we use these systems to analyze and store financial and operating data and to communicate within our company and with outside business partners.  technical system flaws, power loss, cyber security risks, including cyber or phishing-attacks, unauthorized access, malicious software, data privacy breaches by employees or others with authorized access, ransomware, and other cyber security issues could compromise our computer and telecommunications systems and result in disruptions to our business operations or the access, disclosure or loss of our data and proprietary information.  in addition, computers control oil and gas production, processing equipment, and distribution systems globally and are necessary to deliver our production to market.  a disruption, failure or a cyber breach of these operating systems, or of the networks and infrastructure on which they rely, could damage critical production, distribution and/or storage assets, delay or prevent delivery to markets, and make it difficult or impossible to accurately account for production and settle transactions.  as a result, a disruption, failure or a cyber breach of these operating systems, or of the networks and infrastructure on which they rely and any resulting investigation or remediation costs, litigation or regulatory action could have a material adverse impact on our cash flows and results of operations, reputation and competitiveness.  we routinely experience attempts by external parties to penetrate and attack our networks and systems.  although such attempts to date have not resulted in any material breaches, disruptions, or loss of business-critical information, our systems and procedures for protecting against such attacks and mitigating such risks may prove to be insufficient in the future and such attacks could have an adverse impact on our business and operations, including damage to our reputation and competitiveness, remediation costs, litigation or regulatory actions.  in addition, as technologies evolve and these cyber security attacks become more sophisticated, we may incur significant costs to upgrade or enhance our security measures to protect against such attacks and we may face difficulties in fully anticipating or implementing adequate preventive measures or mitigating potential harm.
item 7.  management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview hess corporation, incorporated in the state of delaware in 1920, is a global exploration and production (e&p) company engaged in exploration, development, production, transportation, purchase and sale of crude oil, natural gas liquids, and natural gas with production operations located primarily in the united states (u.s.), denmark, the malaysia/thailand joint development area (jda) and malaysia.  the corporation conducts exploration activities primarily offshore guyana, suriname, canada and in the gulf of mexico, including at the stabroek block, offshore guyana, where we have participated in six significant crude oil discoveries and sanctioned the first phase of a multi-phase development project at the liza field.  during 2017, we sold our interests in equatorial guinea, norway and our enhanced oil recovery assets in the permian basin, onshore u.s.  the 2017 asset sales of higher cost, mature assets will provide funds toward our future development projects in the stabroek block, offshore guyana.  in the fourth quarter of 2017, we announced that we would commence a process to sell our interests in denmark in 2018.  these actions reflect the execution of our strategy to grow our resource base in a capital disciplined manner and to be cash generative at a $50 per barrel brent oil price post 2020.
the corporation's midstream operating segment provides fee-based services, including gathering, compressing and processing natural gas and fractionating natural gas liquids (ngls); gathering, terminaling, loading and transporting crude oil and ngls; and storing and terminaling propane, primarily in the bakken and three forks shale plays in the williston basin area of north dakota.  beginning january 1, 2017, hess' midstream segment included our interest in a permian gas plant in west texas and related co2 assets, and water handling assets in north dakota as a result of organizational changes to the management of those assets.  prior period information has been recast to conform to the current period presentation.  see note 22, segment information in the notes to consolidated financial statements.  in the third quarter of 2017, we completed the sale of our midstream assets in the permian basin.  see note 2, dispositions in the notes to consolidated financial statements.
outlook the corporation and its partners have discovered significant crude oil and natural gas resources on the stabroek block, offshore guyana, which will require substantial capital and time to fully develop.  as a result of these discovered fields, which are expected to have a lower development cost than other assets in our portfolio, we have changed the priorities of our future investment plans, and have divested of higher cost, mature assets to provide funds toward future development of guyana.  in addition, we have announced plans to reduce debt and repurchase common stock.
we project our e&p capital and exploratory expenditures will be approximately $2.1 billion in 2018, up from $2.0 billion in 2017, reflecting increased activity at the liza field development project and a higher rig count in the bakken, partially offset by lower spend at the stampede field and north malay basin development projects.  capital expenditures, including equity investments, for our midstream operations are expected to be approximately $330 million.  oil and gas production in 2018 is forecast to be in the range of 245,000 boepd to 255,000 boepd excluding any contribution from libya and reflecting an estimated 15,000 boepd reduction due to the extended enchilada platform shutdown, up from 242,000 boepd in 2017, excluding libya and assets sold.
net cash provided by operating activities was $945 million in 2017, compared to $795 million in 2016, while capital expenditures for 2017 and 2016 were $1,973 million and $1,921 million, respectively.  based on current forward strip crude oil prices, we forecast a net operating cash flow deficit (including capital expenditures) in 2018.  the corporation expects to fund its 2018 net operating cash flow deficit (including capital expenditures), reduce debt by $500 million and repurchase $380 million of common stock with existing cash and cash equivalents, which was $4.5 billion at december 31, 2017, excluding midstream.
significant 2017 activities the following is an update of significant e&p activities during 2017:
•   in north dakota, net production from the bakken oil shale play averaged 105,000 boepd (2016: 105,000 boepd). during 2017, we operated an average of 3.5 rigs, drilled 85 wells, completed 68 wells, and brought on production 68 wells, bringing the total operated production wells to 1,315 at december 31, 2017. drilling and completion costs per operated well averaged $5.6 million in 2017, based on a change in our standard well design during the year to a 60-stage completion with proppant loadings of 140,000 pounds per stage compared to an average well cost of $4.8 million in 2016 using a 50-stage completion with proppant loadings of 70,000 pounds per stage. during 2018, we plan to increase our rig count in the second half of the year from four to six rigs, to drill approximately 120 wells and bring approximately 95 wells on production. in addition, our capital budget for 2018 will fund pad construction in preparation for 2019 drilling. we forecast net production for full year 2018 to be in the range of 115,000 boepd to 120,000 boepd.
•   in the gulf of mexico, net production averaged 54,000 boepd (2016: 61,000 boepd). the decrease in production was primarily due to a fire at the third-party operated enchilada platform and natural field decline, partially offset by higher production at the tubular bells field. prior to the shutdown of the enchilada platform in november, we were producing approximately 30,000 boepd from the llano, conger, baldpate and penn state fields through infrastructure associated with enchilada. at the penn state field, we competed one well in november 2017. in 2018, gulf of mexico production is forecast to average approximately 50,000 boepd, which reflects an estimated full year production impact of approximately 15,000 boepd associated with enchilada.
at the hess operated stampede development project in the green canyon area of the gulf of mexico, in 2017 we completed installation of the tension leg platform and subsea equipment, finished drilling and completing three production wells, and received regulatory approval for production operations at the end of the year.  in january 2018, we commenced production from the field, which is expected to ramp up over the next 18 months as we continue a drilling program of three additional production wells and four water injection wells.
•   in block a‐18 of the jda, net production averaged 223 mmcfd (2016: 206 mmcfd), including contribution from unitized acreage in malaysia, with the increase from prior-year primarily due to the planned shutdown in 2016 to commission the booster compressor project. production from the jda is forecast to average approximately 215 mmcfd in 2018.
•   in the north malay basin (nmb), production of natural gas commenced from the full-field development in july and net production averaged 66 mmcfd for the year (2016: 26 mmcfd). the field achieved the planned plateau rate of 165 mmcfd, and we forecast net production from nmb to average approximately 160 mmcfd in 2018. we plan to drill three production wells in 2018 and progress development activities related to future phases.
•   in the utica shale, net production decreased to 19,000 boepd (2016: 29,000 boepd) due to natural decline following the suspension of drilling activities in the first quarter of 2016. in 2018, we expect to complete and bring on production five previously drilled wells.
•   in libya, net production from the waha fields averaged approximately 10,000 boepd (2016: 1,000 boepd), with the increase from prior-year due to the lifting of force majeure by the national oil company of libya in september 2016.
•   we sold our interests in equatorial guinea and norway, and enhanced oil recovery assets in the permian basin. see note 2, dispositions in the notes to consolidated financial statements.
•   in guyana, at the esso exploration and production guyana limited operated offshore stabroek block (hess 30% participating interest), the partners sanctioned the first phase of the liza field development in 2017. this phase is expected to have a gross capital cost of approximately $3.2 billion for drilling and subsea infrastructure, of which we expect to incur $250 million net in 2018, with first production expected in march 2020. the development plan includes a leased floating production, storage and offloading (fpso) vessel that will have the capacity to process up to 120,000 barrels of oil per day from 17 wells, including eight producers, six water injectors and three gas injectors.
an application for an environmental permit to develop the second phase at liza has been submitted.  the concept for phase 2 involves the use of a larger fpso vessel and subsea systems that would have a production
capacity of approximately 220,000 bopd, with first production expected by mid-2022.  planning is also underway for a third phase of development with an fpso vessel at the payara field with first production planned for 2023 or 2024.  the size of the third ship will depend upon the results of future exploration and appraisal drilling.
payara-1:  the well, located approximately 10 miles northwest of the liza discovery, encountered 95 feet of high-quality, oil bearing sandstone reservoirs.
snoek-1: the well encountered more than 82 feet of high-quality, oil-bearing sandstone reservoirs and is located approximately 5 miles southeast of the liza-1 oil discovery.
liza-4: the well encountered more than 197 feet of high-quality, oil-bearing sandstone reservoirs.
payara-2: the well encountered 59 feet of high-quality, oil-bearing sandstone reservoirs and confirmed a second large oil field in addition to the liza field.  the well is located approximately 12 miles northwest from the liza phase 1 project.
turbot-1: the well encountered a reservoir of 75 feet of high-quality, oil-bearing sandstone in the primary objective.  the well is located approximately 30 miles to the southeast of the liza phase 1 project.
in january 2018, the operator announced a sixth oil discovery at the ranger prospect.  the ranger-1 well encountered approximately 230 feet of high-quality, oil-bearing carbonate reservoir, and is located approximately 60 miles to the northwest of the liza field.  in 2018, additional drilling is planned, including appraisal of the liza, turbot and ranger discoveries, as well as a wider exploration program that will target additional prospects and play types on the block.  drilling of the pacora prospect commenced in january.
•   in ghana, at the hess operated offshore deepwater tano/cape three points license (hess 50% license interest), management determined in the fourth quarter of 2017 that it would not develop the previously discovered fields. as a result, we recorded a charge of $280 million to write-off previously capitalized exploration wells and other lease costs. see capitalized exploratory well costs in note 5, property, plant and equipment, and note 24, subsequent events in the notes to consolidated financial statements.
the following is an update of significant midstream activities during 2017:
•   in the second quarter, hess midstream partners lp (the "partnership"), sold 16,997,000 common units representing limited partner interests at a price of $23 per unit in an initial public offering (ipo) for net proceeds of $365.5 million, of which $350 million was distributed 50/50 to hess corporation and gip. see item 1 and 2. business and properties.
•   in the fourth quarter, hip, issued $800 million of 5.625% senior notes, due in february 2026 and concurrently amended its senior unsecured credit facilities. hip used a portion of the proceeds from the note issuance to repay borrowings under hip's credit facilities and to fund a distribution to the partners. the remaining proceeds will be used for general partnership purposes of the joint venture. under the amended credit facilities, the 5-year term loan a facility was reduced to $200 million and the 5-year syndicated revolving credit facility increased to $600 million from $400 million previously, with the maturity of both facilities extended to november 2022. the credit facilities are secured by first-priority perfected liens on substantially all of hip's and certain of its wholly-owned subsidiaries' directly owned assets, including its equity interests in certain subsidiaries, subject to customary exclusions. the 5-year syndicated revolving credit facility is expected to continue to fund the joint venture's operating activities and capital expenditures.
during 2017, the midstream segment brought online key strategic projects, including safe and successful start-up of the hawkeye gas facility, the hawkeye oil facility and the johnson's corner header system.  these projects have increased the midstream segment's throughput volumes, customer optionality and system connectivity.  hess midstream has also recently executed a strategic gas processing joint venture with targa resources corp. that will further support the production growth in the bakken.
u.s. tax cuts and jobs act the enactment of u.s. federal tax reform, commonly referred to as the u.s. tax cuts and jobs act ("act"), provided for broad changes to the taxation of both domestic and foreign operations.  the provisions of the act, including its extensive transition rules, are complex and interpretive guidance continues to develop.  final application of the act to our operations and financial results may differ from that for which we have provisionally provided as of december 31, 2017.  changes could arise as regulatory and interpretive action continues to clarify aspects of the act and as changes are made to estimates that the corporation has utilized in calculating the transition impacts.
no u.s. federal tax has been accrued on the deemed repatriation of unremitted earnings of our foreign subsidiaries.  a decrease in the u.s. federal corporate tax rate to 21% from 35% resulted in a $1,476 million reduction to our u.s. federal net deferred tax asset as of december 31, 2017, with a corresponding reduction in the previously established u.s. valuation allowance.  a deferred tax liability of $110 million no longer meets the recognition criteria with the transition to a territorial regime for u.s. taxation of foreign earnings and has been derecognized, with a corresponding adjustment to the valuation allowance against the u.s. federal net deferred tax asset.  under the transition rules related to the repeal of the alternative minimum tax regime, an alternative minimum tax credit carryforward of $4 million will be refundable if not used to offset regular tax liability.  the previously established valuation allowance against this credit carryforward has been released.  consequently, these tax law changes resulted in a net $4 million increase to net deferred tax asset on the balance sheet and benefit to deferred tax expense.
liquidity and capital and exploratory expenditures in 2017, net cash provided by operating activities was $945 million (2016: $795 million; 2015: $1,981 million).  at december 31, 2017, consolidated cash and cash equivalents were $4,847 million (2016: $2,732 million), consolidated debt was $6,977 million (2016: $6,806 million), and our consolidated debt to capitalization ratio was 36.1% (2016: 30.4%).
capital and exploratory expenditures were as follows (in millions):

midstream capital expenditures midstream - capital expenditures          $121          $283          $300
in 2018, we plan to incur approximately $2.1 billion on e&p capital and exploratory expenditures, and approximately $330 million on midstream capital expenditures, including equity investments.
consolidated results of operations results including items affecting comparability of earnings between periods:
the after-tax income (loss) by major operating activity is summarized below:
(a)   calculated as net income (loss) attributable to hess corporation less preferred stock dividends, divided by weighted average number of diluted shares.
in the following discussion and elsewhere in this report, the financial effects of certain transactions are disclosed on an after-tax basis.  management reviews segment earnings on an after-tax basis and uses after-tax amounts in its review of variances in segment earnings.  management believes that after-tax amounts are a preferable method of explaining variances in earnings, since they show the entire effect of a transaction rather than only the pre-tax amount.  after-tax amounts are determined by applying the income tax rate in each tax jurisdiction to pre-tax amounts.
items affecting comparability of earnings between periods:
the following table summarizes items of income (expense) that are included in net income (loss) and affect comparability of earnings between periods.  the items in the table below are explained on pages 31 through 36.

adjusted net income (loss) attributable to hess corporation presented in this report is a non-gaap financial measure, which we define as reported net income (loss) attributable to hess corporation excluding items identified as affecting comparability of earnings between periods.  management uses adjusted net income (loss) to evaluate the corporation's operating performance and believes that investors' understanding of our performance is enhanced by disclosing this measure, which excludes certain items that management believes are not directly related to ongoing operations and are not indicative of future business trends and operations.  this measure is not, and should not be viewed as, a substitute for u.s. gaap net income (loss).

excluding the e&p items affecting comparability of earnings between periods in the table on page 31, the changes in e&p results are primarily attributable to changes in selling prices, production and sales volumes, marketing expenses, cash operating costs, midstream tariffs, depreciation, depletion and amortization, exploration expenses and income taxes, as discussed below.
selling prices: average worldwide realized crude oil selling prices, including hedging, were 26% higher in 2017 compared to the prior year, primarily due to the increase in brent and wti crude oil prices.  in addition, realized worldwide selling prices for natural gas liquids increased in 2017 by 84% and worldwide natural gas prices remained unchanged, compared to the prior year.  in total, higher realized selling prices improved 2017 financial results by approximately $350 million after income taxes compared with 2016.  our average selling prices were as follows:
offshore                                             47.34           37.47           46.21

during 2017, we purchased brent crude oil price collars to hedge 20,000 barrels of oil per day (bopd) with a weighted average contract life of 10.3 months in 2017.  the collars had a floor price of $55 per barrel and a ceiling price of $75 per barrel.  we also purchased west texas intermediate (wti) crude oil price collars to hedge 110,000 bopd with a weighted average contract life of 7.6 months in 2017 that had a floor price of $50 per barrel and an average ceiling price of $69 per barrel.  at december 31, 2017, we have open wti crude oil price collars with an average monthly floor price of $50 per barrel and an average monthly ceiling price of $65 per barrel with a notional amount of 115,000 bopd for full year 2018.  see note 23, financial risk management activities in the notes to consolidated financial statements.
realized and unrealized movements in crude oil price collars decreased sales and other operating revenues by $59 million ($59 million after income taxes) in 2017 and increased sales and other operating revenues by $126 million ($79 million after income taxes) in 2015.  there were no crude oil hedge contracts in 2016.

crude oil and natural gas liquids as a share of total production          72   %          73   %          74   %
in 2018, we expect net production, excluding libya and reflecting an estimated 15,000 boepd reduction due to the extended enchilada platform shutdown, to average between 245,000 boepd and 255,000 boepd, compared to full year pro forma 2017 net production, excluding libya and assets sold, of 242,000 boepd.
united states:  onshore crude oil production was lower in 2017, compared to 2016, primarily due to the sale of our permian assets in august 2017.  onshore natural gas production was lower in 2017 compared to 2016, primarily due to natural decline in the utica shale play.  total offshore production was lower in 2017 compared to 2016, due to production from several fields being shut-in following a fire at the third-party operated enchilada platform in november 2017 and natural field decline, partially offset by higher production from the tubular bells field.  onshore crude oil production was lower in 2016, compared to 2015, primarily due to reduced drilling activity in the bakken shale play in response to low oil prices, while the increase in natural gas liquids production was primarily due to greater processed volumes at the tioga gas plant.  onshore natural gas production was higher in 2016, compared to 2015, primarily due to a higher number of wells being on production in the utica shale play relative to the prior year.  total offshore production was lower in 2016, compared to 2015, primarily due to subsurface valve failures in three wells at the tubular bells field, a shut-in well to replace a subsurface valve at the conger field, extended planned shutdowns on third-party hosted production facilities at the tubular bells and conger fields, and natural field decline.  our interests in permian, which were sold in august, averaged net production of 4,000 boepd in 2017 (2016: 7,000 boepd; 2015: 9,000 boepd).
europe:  crude oil and natural gas production was lower in 2017, compared to 2016, primarily due to natural field decline.  crude oil production was lower in 2016, compared to 2015, primarily due to lower drilling activity, natural field decline and a planned shutdown at the valhall field, offshore norway.  our interests in norway, which were sold in december, averaged net production of 24,000 boepd in 2017 (2016: 28,000 boepd; 2015: 33,000 boepd).
africa:  crude oil production in 2017 was comparable to 2016, as lower volumes from equatorial guinea, which was sold in november 2017, was offset by higher production in libya.  crude oil production in africa was lower in 2016, compared to 2015, as a result of reduced drilling activity in equatorial guinea and the sale of our algeria asset in the fourth quarter of 2015.  our interests in equatorial guinea averaged net production of 25,000 boepd in 2017 (2016: 33,000 boepd; 2015: 43,000 boepd).
asia:  natural gas production was higher in 2017, compared to 2016, primarily due to first production at the north malay basin full-field development in july 2017.  natural gas production was lower in 2016, compared to 2015, primarily due to the planned shutdown of production facilities at the jda in 2016 to commission a booster compressor project and from lower production entitlement.
sales volumes:  the impact of lower sales volumes decreased after-tax results by approximately $190 million in 2017 compared to 2016.  worldwide sales volumes from hess net production, excluding purchased crude oil, natural gas liquids and natural gas, were as follows:
barrels of oil equivalent                       110,201               120,431               135,277
barrels of oil equivalent per day                   302                   329                   371
marketing, including purchased oil and gas:  this expense category is mainly comprised of costs to purchase crude oil, natural gas liquids and natural gas from our partners in hess operated wells or other third-parties, primarily in the u.s., and associated transportation costs for u.s. marketing activities.  the increase in 2017, compared to 2016 principally reflects the impact of higher benchmark crude oil prices on the cost of purchased volumes.  the decrease in 2016, compared to 2015, principally reflects the decline in crude oil prices and lower volumes purchased.
cash operating costs:  cash operating costs, consisting of operating costs and expenses, production and severance taxes and e&p general and administrative expenses, decreased by $401 million in 2017 compared with the prior year (2016: $197 million decrease versus 2015).  the decrease in 2017, compared to 2016, is due to lower workover expenses, lease operating and employee costs, partially offset by higher production taxes in the bakken.  the decrease in 2016 compared to 2015 is due to lower production and cost reduction efforts, and lower production taxes in the bakken.  operating costs in 2016 include higher workover costs to replace failed subsurface valves in the gulf of mexico.
midstream tariffs expense:  tariffs expense in 2017 increased, compared to 2016, primarily due to higher shortfall fees in 2017.  tariffs expense in 2016 increased, compared to 2015, primarily due to increased oil gathering tariffs and shortfall fees in 2016, partially offset by lower gas volumes processed through the tioga gas plant.  for 2018, we estimate midstream tariffs expense to be in the range of $625 million to $650 million.
unit costs:  unit cost per boe information is based on total e&p production volumes and excludes items affecting comparability of earnings as disclosed below.  actual and forecast unit costs are as follows:
cash operating costs                                    $14.30             $15.56             $15.43             $13.00 - $14.00
exploration expenses:  exploration expenses, including items affecting comparability of earnings described below, were as follows:
exploration lease and other impairment                                 44                 145               182
exploration expenses were lower in 2017, compared to 2016, primarily due to lower dry hole expense, leasehold impairment expense, geologic and seismic costs, and employee expenses.  exploration expenses were higher in 2016, compared to 2015, primarily due to higher dry hole expense partially offset by lower leasehold impairment expense, geologic and seismic costs, and employee expenses.  see items affecting comparability of earnings between periods described below.  for 2018, we estimate exploration expenses, excluding dry hole expense, to be in the range of $190 million to $210 million.
income taxes:  the e&p income tax provision was a benefit of $1,842 million in 2017 (2016:  $1,587 million expense; 2015: $1,117 million benefit).  excluding items affecting comparability between periods, the e&p income tax provision was an expense of $95 million in 2017 (2016: $948 million benefit; 2015: $731 million benefit).  the provision in 2017 reflects higher production from libya and lower deferred tax benefits on losses compared to the prior year.  commencing in 2017, we are generally not recognizing deferred tax benefit or expense in certain countries, primarily the u.s., denmark (hydrocarbon tax only), malaysia and guyana, while we maintain valuation allowances against net deferred tax assets in these jurisdictions in accordance with the requirements of u.s. accounting standards.  see e&p items affecting comparability of earnings below and critical accounting policies and estimates - income taxes on page 41.

•   gains (losses) on asset sales, net: we recognized a pre-tax gain of $486 million ($486 million after income taxes) related to the sale of our assets in equatorial guinea, and a pre-tax gain of $330 million ($314 million after income taxes) related to the sale of our enhanced oil recovery assets in the permian basin. we also incurred a pre-tax loss of $857 million ($857 million after income taxes) on the sale of our interests in norway. the loss included the recognition in earnings of $900 million for cumulative translation adjustments previously reflected within accumulated other comprehensive income. see note 2, dispositions in the notes to consolidated financial statements.
•   impairment: we recorded a noncash impairment charge related to our interests in norway totaling $2,503 million pre-tax ($550 million after income taxes) in the third quarter prior to the sale of our interests in the fourth quarter. in addition, we recognized pre-tax impairment charges to reduce the carrying value of our interests in the stampede field by $1,095 million ($1,095 million after income taxes), and the tubular bells field by $605 million ($605 million after income taxes) primarily as a result of a lower long-term crude oil price outlook. the stampede field had significant capitalized exploration and appraisal costs that were incurred on a 100% working interest basis on the pony discovery prior to unitizing into the stampede project. see note 3, impairment in the notes to consolidated financial statements.
•   dry hole, lease impairment and other exploration expenses: we recorded a pre-tax charge of $280 million ($280 million after income taxes) to fully impair the carrying value of our interest at the hess operated offshore deepwater tano/cape three points license, offshore ghana (hess 50% license interest) as a result of management's decision in the fourth quarter of 2017 to not develop the previously discovered fields. see note 24, subsequent events in the notes to consolidated financial statements.
•   noncash charges on de-designated crude oil collars: we recorded a pre-tax charge of $22 million ($22 million after income taxes) related to certain crude oil collars not designated as cash flow hedges. the de-designation was a result of production downtime caused by a fire at the third-party operated enchilada platform in the gulf of mexico during the fourth quarter.
•   dry hole, lease impairment and other exploration expenses: we recorded a pre-tax charge of $938 million ($693 million after income taxes) to write-off all previously capitalized wells and other project related costs for our equus natural gas project, offshore the north west shelf of australia, following the decision to defer further development of the project. in addition, we recorded a pre-tax charge of $83 million ($52 million after income taxes) to write-off the previously capitalized sicily-1 exploration well based on our decision not to pursue the project.
•   gains on asset sale, net: we recognized a pre-tax gain of $27 million ($17 million after income taxes) related to the sale of undeveloped onshore acreage in the u.s.
•   income taxes: we recorded a non-cash charge of $2,920 million to establish valuation allowances against net deferred tax assets as of december 31, 2016, as required under application of the accounting standards following a three-year cumulative loss. this deferred tax charge has no cash flow impact and the corporation's underlying tax position remains unchanged. in addition, we recorded a tax benefit of $51 million related to the resolution of certain international tax matters.
•   offshore rig cost: we recognized a pre-tax charge of $105 million ($66 million after income taxes) related to an offshore drilling rig.
•   inventory write-off: we incurred a pre-tax charge of $39 million ($19 million after income taxes) to write off surplus materials and supplies inventory.
•   exit costs and other: we recorded pre-tax exit and other costs of $26 million ($17 million after income taxes), which primarily relates to employee severance.
•   impairment: we recorded noncash goodwill impairment charges totaling $1,483 million pre-tax ($1,483 million after income taxes), representing all goodwill of our e&amp;p segment, due to the decline in crude oil prices. in addition, we recorded a pre-tax charge of $133 million ($83 million after income taxes) associated with our legacy conventional north dakota assets.
•   dry hole, lease impairment and other exploration expenses: we recognized a pre-tax charge of $190 million ($86 million after income taxes) to write-off an exploration well and other costs related to the dinarta block in the kurdistan region of iraq following the decision of the corporation and its partner to relinquish the block and exit operations in the region. in offshore ghana, we expensed previously capitalized well costs of $182 million ($117 million after income taxes) primarily associated with natural gas discoveries due to insufficient progress on appraisal negotiations with the regulator. in offshore australia, we expensed previously capitalized well costs of $62 million ($45 million after income taxes) associated with discovered resources that we determined would not be included in the development concept for the equus project. in addition, we recorded pre-tax charges totaling $84 million ($53 million after income taxes) primarily to impair exploration leases in the gulf of mexico.
•   gains (losses) on asset sales, net: we recognized a pre-tax gain of $49 million ($31 million after income taxes) related to the sale of approximately 13,000 acres of utica dry gas acreage. we also completed the sale of our producing assets in algeria in december 2015 and recognized a pre-tax loss of $21 million ($21 million after income taxes).
•   income taxes: in 2015, we recorded net tax benefits totaling $101 million, comprised primarily of $154 million to recognize a deferred tax benefit from a legal entity restructuring, $50 million benefit from receiving approval for an international investment incentive and a $112 million charge to recognize a partial valuation allowance against foreign deferred tax assets.

sales and other operating revenues in 2017 increased, compared to 2016, primarily due to higher shortfall fees earned, and higher tariff rates and throughput volumes, partially offset by lower rail export revenue associated with third-party rail charges and the sale of our permian assets in august 2017.  total revenues and non-operating income in 2016 decreased, compared to 2015, primarily as a result of lower rail export revenue associated with third-party rail charges, partially offset by recognition of shortfall fees earned.
operating costs and expenses were lower in 2017, compared to 2016, primarily due to lower third-party rail charges and the sale of our permian assets in august 2017.  operating costs and expenses were lower in 2016, compared to 2015, primarily due to a decrease in third-party rail charges.  dd&a expenses were higher in 2017, compared to 2016, primarily due to newly completed gathering pipelines and related facilities that were placed in service.  dd&a expenses were higher in 2016, compared to 2015, primarily due to capital expenditures on gathering assets and railcars that were placed in service.
for 2018, we estimate net income attributable to hess corporation from the midstream segment to be in the range of $105 million to $115 million.
items affecting comparability of earnings between periods:  we recognized a pre-tax loss of $57 million ($34 million after income taxes and noncontrolling interest) in 2017 related to the sale of our midstream assets in the permian basin.  midstream results in 2016 included a pre-tax charge of $67 million ($21 million after income taxes and noncontrolling interest) to impair older specification rail cars.

corporate and other expenses, excluding items affecting comparability, were higher in 2017, compared to 2016, primarily due to higher legal costs, increased pension settlement charges in 2017, and the recognition of a nonrecurring gain of $8 million in 2016.  corporate and other expenses were lower in 2016, compared to 2015, primarily due to reductions in employee costs, professional fees, and other general and administrative expenses, and the benefit of higher interest income and non-operating income.  in 2018, after-tax corporate and other expenses, excluding items affecting comparability of earnings between periods, are estimated to be in the range of $105 million to $115 million.
interest expense was higher in 2017, compared to 2016, primarily due to slightly higher average borrowings.  capitalized interest expense was higher in 2017, compared to 2016, due to increased activity at the hess operated stampede development project and sanction of the liza field phase 1 development project during 2017.  interest expense was higher in 2016, compared to 2015, but the increase in capitalized interest expense was greater over the same period with 2016 reflecting increased activity at the stampede development project.  in 2018 after-tax interest expense, net is estimated to be in the range of $345 million to $355 million as interest capitalization on the stampede development will cease upon first production.
the benefit for income taxes is lower in 2017, compared to 2016, due to us generally not recognizing deferred tax benefit or expense in the u.s. while we maintain valuation allowances against net deferred tax assets in accordance with the requirements of u.s. accounting standards.  this accounting treatment commenced on december 31, 2016.  see items affecting comparability of earnings below and critical accounting policies and estimates - income taxes on page 41.
items affecting comparability of earnings between periods:  corporate, interest and other results included the following items affecting comparability of income (expense) before and after income taxes:
•   exit costs and other: we recorded a pre-tax charge of $30 million ($30 million after income taxes) in connection with vacated office space, of which $11 million is included in general and administrative expenses and $19 million is included in depreciation, depletion and amortization in the statement of consolidated income.
•   income tax: we recorded a non-cash charge of $829 million to establish valuation allowances against net deferred tax assets as of december 31, 2016, as required under application of the accounting standards following a three-year cumulative loss. this deferred tax charge has no cash flow impact and the corporation's underlying tax position remains unchanged.
•   loss on debt extinguishment: we recorded a pre-tax charge of $148 million ($92 million after income taxes) related to the repurchase and redemption of notes to complete a debt refinancing. see note 10, debt, in the notes to consolidated financial statements.
•   exit costs and other: we recorded pre-tax exit and other costs of $3 million ($2 million after income taxes), which primarily relates to employee severance.
•   hovensa llc: we recorded a pre-tax charge of $76 million ($49 million after income taxes) associated with debtor-in-possession financing provided to hovensa llc and the estimated liability resulting from its bankruptcy resolution.
•   other: we recorded a pre-tax gain of $20 million ($13 million after income taxes) from the sale of land and incurred exit costs of $6 million pre-tax ($4 million after income taxes).
liquidity and capital resources the following table sets forth certain relevant measures of our liquidity and capital resources at december 31:
current maturities of long-term debt                 580                           112

(a)   includes $356 million of cash attributable to hess infrastructure partners (hip), our 50/50 midstream joint venture, at december 31, 2017 (2016: $2 million).
(b)   includes $980 million of debt outstanding from hip at december 31, 2017 (2016: $733 million) that is non-recourse to hess corporation.
(c)   total debt as a percentage of the sum of total debt plus equity.
cash flows the following table sets forth a summary of our cash flows:
cash flows from operating activities:
net cash provided by (used in) operating activities - continuing operations                  $945                  $795                 $2,016
net cash provided by (used in) operating activities - discontinued operations                   -                     -                    (35   )
net cash provided by (used in) operating activities                                           945                   795                  1,981
operating activities:
in 2017, net cash provided by operating activities was $945 million (2016: $795 million; 2015: $1,981 million).  in 2017, operating cash flows increased, compared to 2016, primarily due to higher benchmark crude oil prices and lower operating costs, partially offset by lower production volumes.  changes in working capital in 2017 were a use of cash of $780 million and primarily related to higher accounts receivable due to higher crude oil prices, abandonment expenditures, premiums on crude oil hedging contracts, pension contributions, contract termination payments for an offshore drilling rig, and crude oil delivered as line fill.  in 2016, operating cash flows decreased, compared to 2015, primarily due to declining benchmark crude oil prices and changes in production volumes.
in 2017, additions to property, plant and equipment were lower, compared to 2016, primarily due to lower development expenditures at north malay basin in the current year, partially offset by increased investments in bakken and guyana in 2017.  the decrease in additions to property, plant and equipment in 2016, compared to 2015, is primarily related to reduced drilling activity (bakken, utica, norway, denmark and equatorial guinea) and reduced development expenditures (tubular bells, north malay basin and the jda).
in 2017, proceeds from the sale of assets of $3,296 million (2016: $140 million; 2015: $50 million) related to the divestiture of our interests in equatorial guinea, norway, our enhanced oil recovery assets in the permian basin, and non-core acreage, onshore united states.
in 2017, hess midstream partners lp received proceeds of $365.5 million from the issuance of common units in an initial public offering, of which $350 million was distributed 50/50 to hess corporation and gip.  borrowings for debt with maturities in excess of 90 days were $800 million in 2017 (2016: $1,496 million; 2015: $600 million), while associated repayments of debt were $459 million (2016: $1,455 million; 2015: $67 million).  common and preferred stock dividends paid were $363 million in 2017 (2016: $350 million; 2015: $287 million) and we settled the repurchase of $110 million of common stock in 2017 (2016: $-; 2015: $142 million).  net outflows to noncontrolling interests were $243 million in 2017 (2016: $23 million net outflow; 2015:  $2,296 million net inflow).  in 2016, we issued 28,750,000 shares of common stock and depositary shares representing 575,000 shares of 8% series a mandatory convertible preferred stock for total net proceeds of $1.64 billion.
future capital requirements and resources at december 31, 2017, hess corporation, had $4.5 billion in cash and cash equivalents, excluding midstream, and total liquidity, including available committed credit facilities, of approximately $8.9 billion.  the corporation has no significant near-term debt maturities.
net production in 2018 is forecast to be in the range of 245,000 boepd to 255,000 boepd, excluding libya, and we expect our 2018 e&p capital and exploratory expenditures will be approximately $2.1 billion.  based on current forward strip crude oil prices, we forecast a net operating cash flow deficit (including capital expenditures) in 2018.  the corporation expects to fund its 2018 net operating cash flow deficit (including capital expenditures), reduce debt by $500 million and repurchase $380 million of common stock with existing cash and cash equivalents.
on february 15, 2018, hess corporation redeemed $350 million principal amount of 8.125% notes due 2019 for $370 million.
the table below summarizes the capacity, usage, and available capacity of our borrowing and letter of credit facilities at december 31, 2017:
letters of
expiration                                                credit                total             available date               capacity         borrowings            issued                used               capacity
(a)   in january 2020, the capacity reduces to $3.7 billion.
on december 1, 2017, the corporation amended its $4.0 billion syndicated revolving credit facility that expires in january 2020, by extending the facility for one year to january 2021, with a $3.7 billion commitment during the extension period.  borrowings on the facility will generally bear interest at 1.30% above the london interbank offered rate (libor).  the interest rate will be higher if our credit rating is lowered.  the facility contains a financial covenant that limits the amount of the total borrowings on the last day of each fiscal quarter to 60% of the corporation's total capitalization, defined as total debt plus stockholders' equity.  as of december 31, 2017, hess corporation had no outstanding borrowings under this facility and was in compliance with this financial covenant.
we had $246 million in letters of credit outstanding at december 31, 2017 (2016: $188 million), which primarily relate to our international operations.  see also note 23, financial risk management activities in the notes to consolidated financial statements.
we also have a shelf registration under which we may issue additional debt securities, warrants, common stock or preferred stock.
in november 2017, hip amended its senior unsecured syndicated credit facilities.  at december 31, 2017, hip has $800 million of senior secured syndicated credit facilities, consisting of a $600 million 5-year revolving credit facility and a drawn $200 million 5-year term loan a facility.  the revolving credit facility can be used for borrowings and letters of credit to
fund the joint venture's operating activities and capital expenditures.  borrowings under the 5-year term loan a facility will generally bear interest at libor plus an applicable margin ranging from 1.55% to 2.50%, while the applicable margin for the 5-year syndicated revolving credit facility ranges from 1.275% to 2.000%.  the interest rate is subject to adjustment based on hip's leverage ratio, which is calculated as total debt to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (ebitda).  if hip obtains an investment grade credit rating, as defined in the amended credit agreement, pricing levels will be based on the credit ratings in effect from time to time.  the credit facilities contain financial covenants that generally require a leverage ratio of no more than 5.0 to 1.0 for the prior four fiscal quarters and an interest coverage ratio, which is calculated as ebitda to cash interest expense, of no less than 2.25 to 1.0 for the prior four fiscal quarters.  the amended credit agreement includes a secured leverage ratio test not to exceed 3.75 to 1.00 for so long as the facilities remain secured.  hip is in compliance with these financial covenants at december 31, 2017.  outstanding borrowings under this credit facility are non-recourse to hess corporation.  at december 31, 2017, hip's revolving credit facility was undrawn and borrowings under the term loan a facility amounted to $200 million, excluding deferred issuance costs.  the credit facilities are secured by first-priority perfected liens on substantially all of hip's and certain of its wholly-owned subsidiaries' directly owned assets, including its equity interests in certain subsidiaries, subject to customary exclusions.
hess midstream partners lp (the "partnership") has a $300 million 4-year senior secured syndicated revolving credit facility that became available for utilization at completion of its initial public offering in april 2017.  the credit facility can be used for borrowings and letters of credit to fund operating activities and capital expenditures of the partnership and expires march 2021.  borrowings on the credit facility will generally bear interest at libor plus an applicable margin of 1.275%.  the interest rate is subject to adjustment based on the partnership's leverage ratio, which is calculated as total debt to ebitda.  if the partnership obtains credit ratings, pricing levels will be based on the credit ratings in effect from time to time.  the partnership is subject to customary covenants in the credit agreement, including financial covenants that generally require a leverage ratio of no more than 4.5 to 1.0 for the prior four fiscal quarters.  the credit facility is secured by first priority perfected liens on substantially all directly owned assets of the partnership and its wholly-owned subsidiaries, including equity interests in subsidiaries, subject to certain customary exclusions.  outstanding borrowings under this credit facility are non-recourse to hess corporation.  at december 31, 2017, this facility was undrawn.
credit ratings two of the three major credit rating agencies that rate the corporation's debt have assigned an investment grade rating.  at december 31, 2017, we have investment grade credit ratings with stable outlook from standard and poor's ratings services (bbb-) and fitch ratings (bbb-).  moody's investors service has rated our debt at ba1 with a stable outlook.
the consequence of lower credit ratings is an increase in interest rates and facility fees on our credit facilities and the potential for additional required collateral under operating agreements.  as of december 31, 2017, based on our current credit ratings, we may be required to issue additional collateral in the form of letters of credit up to approximately $135 million.  if fitch or s&p were to reduce their rating on our unsecured debt below investment grade, we estimate that we could be required to issue additional letters of credit up to approximately $240 million as of december 31, 2017.
in the fourth quarter of 2017, hip obtained it first credit ratings from ratings agencies.  at december 31, 2017, hip's senior unsecured debt is rated bb+ by standard and poor's ratings services, ba3 by moody's investors service, and bb by fitch ratings.
contractual obligations and contingencies the following table shows aggregate information about certain contractual obligations at december 31, 2017:
operating leases                             1,310              387                   506                   141                     276
capital expenditures                         1,260              563                   531                   166                       -
operating expenses                             412              230                   121                    39                      22
(a)   we anticipate cash payments for interest of $418 million for 2018, $800 million for 2019-2020, $765 million for 2021-2022, and $4,340 million thereafter for a total of $6,323 million. these interest payments reflect our contractual obligations as of december 31, 2017 and, therefore, do not reflect any benefits that may arise from the previously announced $500 million debt reduction program.
capital expenditures represent amounts that were contractually committed at december 31, 2017, including the portion of our planned capital expenditure program for 2018.  obligations for operating expenses include commitments for oil and gas production expenses, seismic purchases and other normal business expenses.  other liabilities reflect contractually committed obligations in the consolidated balance sheet at december 31, 2017, including pension plan liabilities and estimates for uncertain income tax positions.  the corporation and certain of its subsidiaries lease drilling rigs, office space and other assets for varying periods under leases accounted for as operating leases.
off-balance sheet arrangements at december 31, 2017, we had $31 million in letters of credit for which we are contingently liable.  see also note 21, guarantees, contingencies and commitments in the notes to consolidated financial statements.
foreign operations at december 31, 2017, we conducted e&p activities outside the u.s., principally in africa (libya), asia (joint development area of malaysia/thailand and malaysia), south america (guyana and suriname), denmark and canada.  therefore, we are subject to the risks associated with foreign operations, including political risk, tax law changes, currency risk, corruption, and acts of terrorism.  see item 1a. risk factors for further details.
critical accounting policies and estimates accounting policies and estimates affect the recognition of assets and liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet and revenues and expenses in the statement of consolidated income.  the accounting methods used can affect net income, equity and various financial statement ratios.  however, our accounting policies generally do not change cash flows or liquidity.
accounting for exploration and development costs:  e&p activities are accounted for using the successful efforts method.  costs of acquiring unproved and proved oil and gas leasehold acreage, including lease bonuses, brokers' fees and other related costs are capitalized.  annual lease rentals, exploration expenses and exploratory dry hole costs are expensed as incurred.  costs of drilling and equipping productive wells, including development dry holes, and related production facilities are capitalized.  in production operations, costs of injected co2 for tertiary recovery are expensed as incurred.
the costs of exploratory wells that find oil and gas reserves are capitalized pending determination of whether proved reserves have been found.  exploratory drilling costs remain capitalized after drilling is completed if (1) the well has found a sufficient quantity of reserves to justify completion as a producing well and (2) sufficient progress is being made in assessing the reserves and the economic and operational viability of the project.  if either of those criteria is not met, or if there is substantial doubt about the economic or operational viability of the project, the capitalized well costs are charged to expense. indicators of sufficient progress in assessing reserves, and the economic and operating viability of a project include: commitment of project personnel, active negotiations for sales contracts with customers, negotiations with governments, operators and contractors and firm plans for additional drilling and other factors.
crude oil and natural gas reserves:  the determination of estimated proved reserves is a significant element in arriving at the results of operations of e&p activities.  the estimates of proved reserves affect well capitalizations, the unit of production depreciation rates of proved properties and wells and equipment, as well as impairment testing of oil and gas assets and goodwill.
for reserves to be booked as proved they must be determined with reasonable certainty to be economically producible from known reservoirs under existing economic conditions, operating methods and government regulations.  in addition, government and project operator approvals must be obtained and, depending on the amount of the project cost, senior management or the board of directors must commit to fund the project.  we maintain our own internal reserve estimates that are calculated by technical staff that work directly with the oil and gas properties.  our technical staff updates reserve estimates throughout the year based on evaluations of new wells, performance reviews, new technical data and other studies.  to provide consistency throughout the corporation, standard reserve estimation guidelines, definitions, reporting reviews and approval practices are used.  the internal reserve estimates are subject to internal technical audits and senior management review.  we also engage an independent third-party consulting firm to audit approximately 80% of our total proved reserves each year.
proved reserves are calculated using the average price during the twelve-month period ending december 31 determined as an unweighted arithmetic average of the price on the first day of each month within the year, unless prices are defined by contractual agreements, excluding escalations based on future conditions.  as discussed in item 1a. risk factors, crude oil prices are volatile which can have an impact on our proved reserves.  if crude oil prices in 2018 are at levels below that used in determining 2017 proved reserves, we may recognize negative revisions to our december 31, 2017 proved undeveloped reserves.  in addition, we may recognize negative revisions to proved developed reserves, which can vary significantly by
asset due to differing operating cost structures.  conversely, price increases in 2018 above those used in determining 2017 proved reserves could result in positive revisions to proved developed and proved undeveloped reserves at december 31, 2018.  it is difficult to estimate the magnitude of any potential net negative or positive change in proved reserves as of december 31, 2018, due to a number of factors that are currently unknown, including 2018 crude oil prices, any revisions based on 2018 reservoir performance, and the levels to which industry costs will change in response to movements in commodity prices.  a 10% change in proved developed and proved undeveloped reserves at december 31, 2017 would result in an approximate $200 million pre-tax change in depreciation, depletion, and amortization expense for 2018.  see the supplementary oil and gas data on pages 81 through 91 in the accompanying financial statements for additional information on our oil and gas reserves.
midstream joint venture:  on july 1, 2015, we sold a 50% interest in hip to gip for net cash consideration of approximately $2.6 billion.  we consolidate the activities of hip, which qualifies as a variable interest entity (vie) under u.s. generally accepted accounting principles.  we have concluded that we are the primary beneficiary of the vie, as defined in the accounting standards, since we have the power through our 50% ownership to direct those activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of hip, and are obligated to absorb losses or have the right to receive benefits that could potentially be significant to hip.  this conclusion was based on a qualitative analysis that considered hip's governance structure, the commercial agreements between hip and us, and the voting rights established between the members, which provide us the ability to control the operations of hip.
impairment of long-lived assets:  we review long‐lived assets, including oil and gas fields, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts may not be recovered.  long‐lived assets are tested based on identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities.  if the carrying amounts of the long-lived assets are not expected to be recovered by estimated undiscounted future net cash flows, the assets are impaired and an impairment loss is recorded.  the amount of impairment is determined based on the estimated fair value of the assets generally determined by discounting anticipated future net cash flows, an income valuation approach, or by a market‐based valuation approach, which are level 3 fair value measurements.
in the case of oil and gas fields, the present value of future net cash flows is based on management's best estimate of future prices, which is determined with reference to recent historical prices and published forward prices, applied to projected production volumes and discounted at a risk-adjusted rate.  the projected production volumes represent reserves, including probable reserves, expected to be produced based on a stipulated amount of capital expenditures.  the production volumes, prices and timing of production are consistent with internal projections and other externally reported information.  oil and gas prices used for determining asset impairment will generally differ from those used in the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows, since the standardized measure requires the use of historical twelve-month average prices.
our impairment tests of long‐lived e&p producing assets are based on our best estimates of future production volumes (including recovery factors), selling prices, operating and capital costs, the timing of future production and other factors, which are updated each time an impairment test is performed.  we could have impairment if the projected production volumes from oil and gas fields decrease, crude oil and natural gas selling prices decline significantly for an extended period or future estimated capital and operating costs increase significantly.  as a result of the extended period of low crude oil prices, we tested our oil and gas properties for impairment.  see note 3, impairment in the notes to consolidated financial statements.
impairment of goodwill:  goodwill is tested for impairment annually on october 1st or when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the goodwill may not be recoverable based on a two-step process.  we conduct the goodwill test at a reporting unit level, which is defined in accounting standards as an operating segment or one level below an operating segment.  the reporting unit or units used in an evaluation and measurement of goodwill for impairment testing are determined from a number of factors, including the manner in which the business is managed.  at december 31, 2017, our midstream operating segment had goodwill of $360 million that resulted from an allocation from our e&p segment upon the formation of the midstream segment in 2015.  our e&p segment has no goodwill at december 31, 2017.
in step one of the impairment test, the fair value of a reporting unit is compared with its carrying amount, including goodwill.  if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, goodwill is not impaired.  if the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, we perform step two to determine possible impairment by comparing the implied fair value of goodwill with the carrying amount.  the implied fair value of goodwill is determined by assuming the reporting unit is purchased at fair value with assets and liabilities of the reporting unit being reflected at fair value in the same manner as the accounting prescribed for a business combination.  the resulting excess of fair value of the reporting unit over the amounts assigned to the reporting unit's assets and liabilities represents the implied fair value of goodwill.  if the implied fair value of goodwill were less than its carrying amount, an impairment loss would be recorded.  fair value for the midstream operating segment is based on a market approach using the exchange price of hess midstream partners, lp, which is a consolidated publicly traded master limited partnership that operates substantially all of our midstream segment assets.
income taxes:  judgments are required in the determination and recognition of income tax assets and liabilities in the financial statements.  these judgments include the requirement to only recognize the financial statement effect of a tax position when management believes that it is more likely than not, that based on the technical merits, the position will be sustained upon examination.
we have net operating loss carryforwards or credit carryforwards in multiple jurisdictions and have recorded deferred tax assets for those losses and credits.  additionally, we have deferred tax assets due to temporary differences between the book basis and tax basis of certain assets and liabilities.  regular assessments are made as to the likelihood of those deferred tax assets being realized.  if, when tested under the relevant accounting standards, it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized, a valuation allowance is recorded to reduce the deferred tax assets to the amount that is expected to be realized.
the accounting standards require the evaluation of all available positive and negative evidence giving weight based on the evidence's relative objectivity.  in evaluating potential sources of positive evidence, we consider the reversal of taxable temporary differences, taxable income in carryback and carryforward periods, the availability of tax planning strategies, the existence of appreciated assets, estimates of future taxable income, and other factors.  estimates of future taxable income are based on assumptions of oil and gas reserves, selling prices, and other subjective operating assumptions that are consistent with internal business forecasts.  in evaluating potential sources of negative evidence, we consider a cumulative loss in recent years, any history of operating losses or tax credit carryforwards expiring unused, losses expected in early future years, unsettled circumstances that, if unfavorably resolved, would adversely affect future operations and profit levels on a continuing basis in future years, and carryback or carryforward periods that are so brief that it would limit realization of tax benefits if a significant deductible temporary difference is expected to reverse in a single year.  due to a sustained low commodity price environment, we remained in a three-year cumulative consolidated loss position as of december 31, 2017.  a three-year cumulative consolidated loss constitutes objective negative evidence to which the accounting standards require we assign significant weight relative to subjective evidence such as our estimates of future taxable income.  we are generally not recognizing deferred tax benefit or expense in certain countries, primarily the u.s., denmark (hydrocarbon tax only), malaysia, and guyana, while we maintain valuation allowances against net deferred tax assets in these jurisdictions.
as of december 31, 2017, the consolidated balance sheet reflects a $5,199 million valuation allowance against the net deferred tax assets for multiple jurisdictions based on the evaluation of the accounting standards described above.  the amount of the deferred tax asset considered realizable, however, could be adjusted if estimates of future taxable income change or if objective negative evidence in the form of cumulative losses is no longer present and additional weight is given to subjective evidence such as expected future growth.
asset retirement obligations:  we have material legal obligations to remove and dismantle long‐lived assets and to restore land or seabed at certain e&p locations.  in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, we recognize a liability for the fair value of required asset retirement obligations.  in addition, the fair value of any legally required conditional asset retirement obligation is recorded if the liability can be reasonably estimated.  we capitalize such costs as a component of the carrying amount of the underlying assets in the period in which the liability is incurred.  in subsequent periods, the liability is accreted, and the asset is depreciated over the useful life of the related asset.  we estimate the fair value of these obligations by discounting projected future payments that will be required to satisfy the obligations.  in determining these estimates, we are required to make several assumptions and judgments related to the scope of dismantlement, timing of settlement, interpretation of legal requirements, inflationary factors and discount rate.  in addition, there are other external factors, which could significantly affect the ultimate settlement costs for these obligations including changes in environmental regulations and other statutory requirements, fluctuations in industry costs and foreign currency exchange rates and advances in technology.  as a result, our estimates of asset retirement obligations are subject to revision due to the factors described above.  changes in estimates prior to settlement result in adjustments to both the liability and related asset values.
retirement plans:  we have funded non-contributory defined benefit pension plans, an unfunded supplemental pension plan and an unfunded postretirement medical plan.  we recognize the net change in the funded status of the projected benefit obligation for these plans in the consolidated balance sheet.
the determination of the obligations and expenses related to these plans are based on several actuarial assumptions, the most significant of which relate to the discount rate for measuring the present value of future plan obligations; expected long‐term rates of return on plan assets; the rate of future increases in compensation levels, and participant mortality assumptions.  these assumptions represent estimates made by us, some of which can be affected by external factors.  for example, the discount rate used to estimate our projected benefit obligation is based on a portfolio of high‐quality, fixed income debt instruments with maturities that approximate the expected payment of plan obligations.  the expected return on plan assets is developed from the expected future returns for each asset category, weighted by the target allocation of pension assets to that asset category.  the future expected return assumptions for individual asset categories are largely based on
inputs from various investment experts regarding their future return expectations for particular asset categories.  changes in these assumptions can have a material impact on the amounts reported in our financial statements.
derivatives:  we utilize derivative instruments, including futures, forwards, options and swaps, individually or in combination to mitigate our exposure to fluctuations in the prices of crude oil and natural gas, as well as changes in interest and foreign currency exchange rates.  all derivative instruments are recorded at fair value in our consolidated balance sheet.  our policy for recognizing the changes in fair value of derivatives varies based on the designation of the derivative.  the changes in fair value of derivatives that are not designated as hedges are recognized currently in earnings.  derivatives may be designated as hedges of expected future cash flows or forecasted transactions (cash flow hedges) or hedges of firm commitments (fair value hedges).  the effective portion of changes in fair value of derivatives that are designated as cash flow hedges is recorded as a component of other comprehensive income (loss).  amounts included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) for cash flow hedges are reclassified into earnings in the same period that the hedged item is recognized in earnings.  the ineffective portion of changes in fair value of derivatives designated as cash flow hedges is recorded currently in earnings.  changes in fair value of derivatives designated as fair value hedges are recognized currently in earnings.  the change in fair value of the related hedged commitment is recorded as an adjustment to its carrying amount and recognized currently in earnings.
fair value measurements:  we use various valuation approaches in determining fair value for financial instruments, including the market and income approaches.  our fair value measurements also include non-performance risk and time value of money considerations.  counterparty credit is considered for receivable balances, and our credit is considered for accrued liabilities.
we also record certain nonfinancial assets and liabilities at fair value when required by generally accepted accounting principles.  these fair value measurements are recorded in connection with business combinations, qualifying non-monetary exchanges, the initial recognition of asset retirement obligations and any impairment of long-lived assets, equity method investments or goodwill.
we determine fair value in accordance with the fair value measurements accounting standard which established a hierarchy for the inputs used to measure fair value based on the source of the inputs, which generally range from quoted prices for identical instruments in a principal trading market (level 1) to estimates determined using related market data (level 3), including discounted cash flows and other unobservable data.  measurements derived indirectly from observable inputs or from quoted prices from markets that are less liquid are considered level 2.  when level 1 inputs are available within a particular market, those inputs are selected for determination of fair value over level 2 or 3 inputs in the same market.  multiple inputs may be used to measure fair value; however, the level of fair value for each physical derivative and financial asset or liability is based on the lowest significant input level within this fair value hierarchy.
environment, health and safety our long-term vision and values provide a foundation for how we do business and define our commitment to meeting high standards of corporate citizenship and creating a long lasting positive impact on the communities where we do business. our strategy is reflected in our environment, health, safety and social responsibility (ehs & sr) policies and by a management system framework that helps protect our workforce, customers and local communities.  our management systems are intended to promote internal consistency, adherence to policy objectives and continual improvement in ehs & sr performance.  improved performance may, in the short‐term, increase our operating costs and could also require increased capital expenditures to reduce potential risks to assets, reputation and license to operate.  in addition to enhanced ehs & sr performance, improved productivity and operational efficiencies may be realized from investments in ehs & sr.  we have programs in place to evaluate regulatory compliance, audit facilities, train employees, prevent and manage risks and emergencies and to generally meet corporate ehs & sr goals and objectives.
we recognize that climate change is a global environmental concern.  we assess, monitor and take measures to reduce our carbon footprint at existing and planned operations.  we are committed to complying with all greenhouse gas (ghg) emissions mandates and the responsible management of ghg emissions at our facilities.
we will have continuing expenditures for environmental assessment and remediation.  sites where corrective action may be necessary include onshore e&p facilities, sites from discontinued operations as to which we retained liability and, although not currently significant, "superfund" sites where we have been named a potentially responsible party.
we accrue for environmental assessment and remediation expenses when the future costs are probable and reasonably estimable.  at december 31, 2017, our reserve for estimated remediation liabilities was approximately $80 million.  we expect that existing reserves for environmental liabilities will adequately cover costs to assess and remediate known sites.  our remediation spending was approximately $15 million in 2017 (2016: $10 million; 2015: $13 million).  the level of other expenditures to comply with federal, state, local and foreign country environmental regulations is difficult to quantify as such costs are captured as mostly indistinguishable components of our capital expenditures and operating expenses.

acquisition of linear technology corporation on march 10, 2017 (acquisition date), we completed the acquisition of linear technology corporation (linear), a designer, manufacturer and marketer of high performance analog integrated circuits. the total consideration paid to acquire linear was approximately $15.8 billion, consisting of $11.1 billion in cash financed through existing cash on hand, net proceeds from bridge and term loan facilities and proceeds received from the issuance of senior unsecured notes, $4.6 billion from the issuance of our common stock and $0.1 billion of consideration related to the replacement of outstanding equity awards held by linear employees. the acquisition of linear is referred to as the acquisition. the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10-k include the financial results of linear prospectively from the acquisition date. see note 6, acquisitions and note 16, debt, of the notes to the consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k for further information.
revenue trends by end market the following table summarizes revenue by end market. the categorization of revenue by end market is determined using a variety of data points including the technical characteristics of the product, the "sold to" customer information, the "ship to" customer information and the end customer product or application into which our product will be incorporated. as data systems for capturing and tracking this data evolve and improve, the categorization of products by end market can vary over time. when this occurs, we reclassify revenue by end market for prior periods. such reclassifications typically do not materially change the sizing of, or the underlying trends of results within, each end market.

gross margin percentage in fiscal 2017 decreased by 520 basis points compared to fiscal 2016, primarily as a result of recording additional cost related to acquisition accounting adjustments, including $358.7 million related to the sale of acquired inventory written up to fair value, $83.0 million related to amortization of acquired developed technology intangible assets, and $22.9 million of depreciation related to the write up of fixed assets to fair value. the increases in cost of sales as a result of
acquisition accounting adjustments were partially offset by favorable factory variances as a result of increased utilization at our manufacturing facilities.
gross margin percentage in fiscal 2016 decreased by 70 basis points compared to fiscal 2015, primarily as a result of lower utilization rates in our manufacturing facilities, partially offset by a mix shift in favor of higher margin products being sold.

r&d expenses increased in fiscal 2017 as compared to fiscal 2016. approximately $205.2 million of the overall increase was a result of the acquisition. the remainder of the increase was primarily the result of an increase in variable compensation expense linked to our overall profitability and revenue growth and an increase in r&d employee and related benefit expenses and to a lesser extent an increase in operational spending.
r&d expenses increased in fiscal 2016 as compared to fiscal 2015 primarily as a result of increases in r&d employee and related benefit expenses and operational spending, partially offset by a decrease in variable compensation expense linked to our overall profitability and revenue growth.
r&d expenses as a percentage of revenue will fluctuate from year-to-year depending on the amount of revenue and the success of new product development efforts, which we view as critical to our future growth. we have hundreds of r&d projects underway, none of which we believe are material on an individual basis. we expect to continue the development of innovative technologies and processes for new products. we believe that a continued commitment to r&d is essential to maintain product leadership with our existing products as well as to provide innovative new product offerings, and therefore, we expect to continue to make significant r&d investments in the future.

amortization expenses increased in fiscal 2017 as compared to fiscal 2016 primarily as a result of the purchase of intangible assets as part of the acquisition and to a lesser extent, other acquisitions in fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2017.
amortization expenses decreased in fiscal 2016 as compared to fiscal 2015 as a result of certain intangible assets becoming fully amortized during fiscal 2015.
special charges we monitor global macroeconomic conditions on an ongoing basis, and continue to assess opportunities for improved operational effectiveness and efficiency and better alignment of expenses with revenues. as a result of these assessments, we have undertaken various restructuring actions over the past several years. the expense reductions relating to ongoing actions are described below.
early retirement offer action during the first quarter of fiscal 2017, we initiated an early retirement offer. this resulted in a special charge of approximately $41.3 million for severance, related benefits, and other costs in accordance with this program for 225 manufacturing, engineering and smg&a employees. as of october 28, 2017, we still employed 26 of the 225 employees included in this cost reduction action. these employees must continue to be employed by us until their employment is terminated in order to receive the severance benefits. we expect this action will result in estimated annual salary, variable compensation and employee benefit savings of approximately $28.4 million once fully implemented.
reduction of operating costs action during the first quarter of fiscal 2017, we recorded special charges of approximately $8.1 million for severance and fringe benefit costs in accordance with our ongoing benefit plan or statutory requirements at foreign locations for 177 manufacturing, engineering and smg&a employees. as of october 28, 2017, we still employed 10 of the 177 employees included in this cost reduction action. these employees must continue to be employed by us until their employment is terminated in order to receive the severance benefits. we expect this action will result in estimated annual salary, variable compensation and employee benefit savings of approximately $5.0 million once fully implemented.
during fiscal 2016, we recorded special charges of approximately $13.7 million for severance and fringe benefit costs in accordance with our ongoing benefit plan for 123 manufacturing, engineering and smg&a employees. as of october 28, 2017, we still employed 23 of the 123 employees included in these cost reduction actions. these employees must continue to be employed by us until their employment is terminated in order to receive the severance benefit.
we expect that annual cost savings resulting from these actions will be used to make additional investments in products that we expect will drive revenue growth in the future.
other operating expense during fiscal 2015, we converted the benefits provided to participants in our irish defined benefits pension plan to benefits provided under our irish defined contribution plan. retired pension plan participants received an annuity. as a result, in fiscal 2015 we recorded settlement charges, legal, accounting and other professional fees totaling $223.7 million to settle all existing and future irish pension plan liabilities.

the increase in nonoperating expense in fiscal 2017 as compared to fiscal 2016 was primarily the result of an increase in interest expense as a result of the issuance of $1.3 billion of senior unsecured notes in the first quarter of fiscal 2016 and, $2.1 billion of senior unsecured notes in the first quarter of fiscal 2017, and as a result of fees paid and financing commitments entered into in connection with the acquisition, including a 90-day bridge credit agreement in the principal amount of $4.1 billion, a 3-year unsecured term loan in the principal amount of $2.5 billion and a 5-year unsecured term loan in the principal amount of $2.5 billion. see note 16, debt, of the notes to our consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k for further information on the debt issuances and commitments related to the acquisition. the increase in nonoperating expense as a result of the increase in interest expense was partially offset by an increase in interest income due to higher interest rates earned on our investments, partially offset by lower cash balances in fiscal 2017 as compared to fiscal 2016.
the increase in nonoperating expense in fiscal 2016 as compared to fiscal 2015 was primarily the result of an increase in interest expense as a result of the issuance of senior unsecured notes in fiscal 2016, and as a result of fees related to financing commitments entered into in anticipation of the acquisition. these increases were partially offset by a decrease in interest expense as a result of the redemption of the $375.0 million aggregate principal amount of 3.0% senior unsecured notes (the 2016 notes) in fiscal 2016. see note 16, debt, of the notes to our consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k for further information for further information on the issuance and redemption of these notes. the increase in nonoperating expense as a result of the increase in interest expense in fiscal 2016 as compared to fiscal 2015 was partially offset by an increase in interest income due to higher interest rates earned on our investments and the investment of higher cash balances in fiscal 2016 as compared to fiscal 2015.

our effective tax rate reflects the applicable tax rate in effect in the various tax jurisdictions around the world where our income is earned. our effective income tax rate can also be impacted each year by discrete factors or events.
the tax rate for fiscal 2017 is below the u.s. federal statutory tax rate of 35% primarily due to lower statutory tax rates applicable to our operations in the foreign jurisdictions in which we earn income and a tax benefit of $50.5 million related to the reduction of reserves and related interest resulting from the u.s. tax court's favorable ruling, offset by approximately $98.2 million of tax expense incurred during the year as part of the post-acquisition integration. see note 14, income taxes, of the notes to our consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k for further information on the u.s. tax court ruling. the tax rate for all other periods presented was below the u.s. federal statutory tax rate of 35%, primarily due to lower statutory tax rates applicable to our operations in the foreign jurisdictions in which we earn income. for example, the company has a partial tax holiday in singapore through august 2019 and a partial tax holiday through july 2025 in malaysia. the impact on our provision for income taxes of income earned in foreign jurisdictions being taxed at rates different than the u.s. statutory rate was a foreign effective tax rate of approximately 7.8% in fiscal 2017 compared to a foreign effective tax rate of approximately 6.1% in fiscal 2016. additionally, our effective tax rate in fiscal 2017 also included a tax benefit of approximately $15.0 million for the release of a state tax credit valuation allowance as a result of the acquisition. our effective tax rate for the fiscal 2016 included a tax benefit of $7.5 million from the reinstatement of the u.s. federal research and development tax credit in december 2015 retroactive to january 1, 2015. our effective tax rate for fiscal 2015 was reduced as a result of $13.0 million recorded from the reversal of certain prior period tax liabilities, a tax benefit of $7.0 million from the reinstatement of the u.s. federal research and development tax credit in december 2014 retroactive to january 1, 2014 and a tax benefit of $3.8 million as a result of an acquisition accounting adjustment. in addition, our effective tax rate for fiscal 2015 included $2.0 million of discrete tax expense items associated with the u.s. provision to return adjustments.
non-u.s. jurisdictions accounted for approximately 77.3% of our total revenues in fiscal 2017, compared to approximately 77.7% of our total revenues for fiscal 2016 and 78.0% of our total revenues for fiscal 2015. this revenue generated outside of the u.s. results in a material portion of our pretax income being taxed outside the u.s., primarily in bermuda and ireland, at tax rates ranging from 0% to 35%. the impact on our effective tax rate related to income earned in foreign jurisdictions was reduced for fiscal 2017 as compared to fiscal 2016, as a result of increased depreciation, amortization and other expenses associated with linear operations which are within foreign jurisdictions and subject to lower tax rates.  a change in the mix of revenue and income earned in the u.s. and outside of the u.s. will have a direct impact on the overall effective tax rate in any given period.

the decrease in net income in fiscal 2017 as compared to fiscal 2016 was primarily a result of a $155.5 million increase in nonoperating expense and a $6.0 million increase in provision for income taxes, partially offset by a $27.0 million increase in operating income.
the increase in net income in fiscal 2016 as compared to fiscal 2015 was primarily a result of a $197.3 million increase in operating income and a $18.0 million decrease in provision for income taxes, partially offset by a $50.5 million increase in nonoperating expense.
the impact of inflation and foreign currency exchange rate movement on our results of operations during the past three fiscal years has not been significant.
liquidity and capital resources at october 28, 2017, our principal source of liquidity was $1.0 billion of cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments, of which approximately $379.2 million was held in the united states. the balance of our cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments was held outside the united states in various foreign subsidiaries. as we intend to reinvest substantially all of our foreign earnings indefinitely, the majority of cash held outside the united states is not available to meet certain aspects of our cash requirements in the united states, including cash dividends, and principal and interest payments. if these funds are needed for u.s. operations or can no longer be indefinitely reinvested outside the united states, under current tax law we would be required to accrue and pay u.s. taxes to repatriate these funds and such amounts could be material. our cash and cash equivalents consist of highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less, including money market funds. we maintain these balances with high credit quality counterparties, continually monitor the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer and diversify our investments in order to minimize our credit risk. in connection with the accounting for the acquisition, we recorded approximately $1.6 billion of cash and marketable securities from linear, which was remitted from foreign jurisdictions as part of our post-acquisition integration. also as part of the post-acquisition integration, we remitted legacy cash held outside of the united states of approximately $3.6 billion. the remittances resulted in approximately $98.2 million in net tax expense recorded in fiscal 2017. we currently intend to use significant amounts of our remaining cash and cash equivalents held outside of the united states to finance obligations and current operations of our foreign businesses. on the acquisition date, we entered into a 90-day bridge credit agreement that provided for unsecured loans in an aggregate principal amount of up to $4.1 billion and borrowed under a term loan agreement consisting of a 3-year unsecured term loan in the principal amount of $2.5 billion, due march 10, 2020 and a 5-year unsecured term loan in the principal amount of $2.5 billion, due march 10, 2022. in fiscal 2017, we repaid $550.0 million of principal on the 3-year unsecured term loan, repaid $400.0 million of principal on the 5-year unsecured term loan, and repaid all of the $4.1 billion of outstanding loans under the bridge credit agreement. in addition, in fiscal 2016, we amended and restated our existing revolving credit facility to allow for the increase in the amount of commitments from $750.0 million to $1.0 billion at the closing of the acquisition. see note 15, revolving credit facility and note 16, debt of the notes to our consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k for further information.
we believe that our existing sources of liquidity and cash expected to be generated from future operations, together with existing and anticipated available long-term financing, will be sufficient to fund operations, capital expenditures, research and development efforts and dividend payments (if any) in the immediate future and for at least the next twelve months.

at october 28, 2017, cash and cash equivalents totaled $1,047.8 million. the following changes contributed to the net increase in cash and cash equivalents of $126.7 million in fiscal 2017.
operating activities cash provided by operating activities is net income adjusted for certain non-cash items and changes in assets and liabilities.
the decrease in cash provided by operating activities during fiscal 2017, as compared to fiscal 2016, was primarily due to higher tax payments as a result of the post-acquisition integration, and other changes in working capital.
investing activities investing cash flows consist primarily of capital expenditures, investment purchases, maturities and sales of available-for-sale securities, as well as cash used for acquisitions.
the increase in cash used for investing activities during fiscal 2017 as compared to fiscal 2016, was primarily the result of cash payments made for the acquisition, partially offset by a decrease in maturities of available for sale securities.
the increase in cash used for investing activities during fiscal 2016 as compared to fiscal 2015 was primarily due to an increase in the net purchases of available-for-sale securities and an increase in payments for acquisitions, partially offset by a decrease in property, plant and equipment additions.
financing activities financing cash flows consist primarily of payments of dividends to stockholders, repurchases of common stock, issuance and repayment of long-term debt, and proceeds from the sale of shares of common stock pursuant to employee equity incentive plans.
the increase in cash provided by financing activities during fiscal 2017, as compared to fiscal 2016, was primarily due to an increase in net debt proceeds of $9.9 billion received from the issuance of senior unsecured notes, financing commitments entered into in connection with the acquisition, consisting of a 90-day bridge credit agreement and a term loan agreement, and a decrease in stock repurchases of $323.5 million due to the temporary suspension of our share repurchase program in connection with the acquisition. these decreases were partially offset by payments of $5.1 billion related to financing commitments entered into in connection with the acquisition consisting of repayments of $550.0 million of principal on the 3-year unsecured term loan, repayments of $400.0 million of principal on the 5-year unsecured term loan, and repayment of the $4.1 billion of outstanding loans under the bridge credit agreement.the decrease in cash used for financing activities during fiscal 2016 as compared to fiscal 2015 was primarily due to net proceeds of $1.2 billion received from the issuance of the 2025 notes and 2045 notes, partially offset by $378.2 million of payments for the redemption of our 2016 notes, an increase in stock repurchases of $143.1 million, a decrease in proceeds from the sale of shares of common stock pursuant to employee equity incentive plans of $61.1 million, payments of $33.4 million related to derivative instruments, payments of $26.6 million in deferred financing fees related to the acquisition of linear and an increase in dividend payments to shareholders of $22.1 million.

* we use the average of the current year and prior year ending net accounts receivable and ending inventory balance in our calculation of days sales outstanding and days cost of sales in inventory, respectively. cost of sales amounts used in the calculation of days cost of sales in inventory for fiscal 2017 include acquisition accounting adjustments related to the sale of acquired inventory written up to fair value, amortization of developed technology intangible assets acquired and depreciation related to the write up of fixed assets to fair value.
the increase in accounts receivable in dollars was primarily the result of the acquisition and to a lesser extent higher product shipments in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 as compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016.
the increase in inventory in dollars was primarily the result of the acquisition and our efforts to balance manufacturing production, demand and inventory levels.
current liabilities increased to $1.6 billion at october 28, 2017 from $782.9 million recorded at the end of fiscal 2016. the increase was primarily due to an increase in the current portion of our debt, an increase in accrued liabilities as a result of the acquisition, increases in accrued interest and accrued special charges, an increase in accounts payable resulting from higher production volumes and the acquisition and an increase in deferred income on shipments made to distributors as more fully described below.
as of october 28, 2017 and october 29, 2016, we had gross deferred revenue of $589.5 million and $432.3 million, respectively, and gross deferred cost of sales of $115.5 million and $80.8 million, respectively. deferred income on shipments to distributors increased in fiscal 2017 primarily as a result of the acquisition and higher demand for products sold into the channel. sales to certain distributors are made under agreements that allow distributors to receive price-adjustment credits and to return qualifying products for credit, as determined by us, in order to reduce the amounts of slow-moving, discontinued or obsolete product from their inventory. given the uncertainties associated with the levels of price-adjustment credits to be granted to certain distributors, the sales price to the distributors is not fixed or determinable until the distributors resell the products to their customers. therefore, we defer revenue recognition from sales to certain distributors until such distributors
have sold the products to their customers. the amount of price-adjustments is dependent on future overall market conditions, and therefore the levels of these adjustments could fluctuate significantly from period to period. to the extent that we experience a significant increase in the amount of credits we issue to our distributors, there could be a material impact on the ultimate revenue and gross margin recognized relating to these transactions.
debt as of october 28, 2017, we had $7.9 billion of carrying value outstanding on our long-term debt. the difference in the carrying value of the debt and the principal is due to the unamortized discount and issuance fees on these instruments that will accrete to the face value over the term of the debt. our debt obligations consist of the following:
$500.0 million aggregate principal amount of 2.875% senior unsecured notes (2023 notes)
on june 3, 2013, we issued the 2023 notes with semi-annual fixed interest payments due on june 1 and december 1 of each year, commencing december 1, 2013.
$850.0 million aggregate principal amount of 3.9% senior unsecured notes (2025 notes) and $400.0 million aggregate principal amount of 5.3% senior unsecured notes (2045 notes)
on december 14, 2015, we issued the 2025 notes and the 2045 notes with semi-annual fixed interest payments due on june 15 and december 15 of each year, commencing june 15, 2016.
$400 million aggregate principal amount of 2.5% senior unsecured notes (2021 notes), $550 million aggregate principal amount of 3.125% senior unsecured notes (december 2023 notes), $900 million aggregate principal amount of 3.5% senior unsecured notes (2026 notes) and $250 million aggregate principal amount of 4.5% senior unsecured notes (2036 notes)
on december 5, 2016, we issued the 2021 notes, the december 2023 notes, the 2026 notes and the 2036 notes with semi-annual fixed interest payments due on june 5 and december 5 of each year, commencing june 5, 2017.
the indentures governing the 2021 notes, 2023 notes, december 2023 notes, 2025 notes, 2026 notes, 2036 notes and 2045 notes contain covenants that may limit our ability to: incur, create, assume or guarantee any debt for borrowed money secured by a lien upon a principal property; enter into sale and lease-back transactions with respect to a principal property; and consolidate with or merge into, or transfer or lease all or substantially all of our assets to, any other party. as of october 28, 2017, we were compliant with these covenants. see note 16, debt, of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k for further information on our outstanding debt.
$5.0 billion aggregate principal term loans on the acquisition date, we drew down on a 3-year unsecured term loan in the principal amount of $2.5 billion, due march 10, 2020 and a 5-year unsecured term loan in the principal amount of $2.5 billion, due march 10, 2022. in fiscal 2017, we repaid $550.0 million of principal on the 3-year unsecured term loan and repaid $400.0 million of principal on the 5-year unsecured term loan.
revolving credit facility we have a senior unsecured revolving credit facility with certain institutional lenders (the credit agreement) that expires on july 10, 2020. the credit agreement provides that we may borrow up to $1.0 billion. to date, we have not borrowed under this credit facility, but we may borrow in the future and use the proceeds for repayment of existing indebtedness, stock repurchases, acquisitions, capital expenditures, working capital and other lawful corporate purposes. the terms of the credit agreement impose restrictions on our ability to undertake certain transactions, to create certain liens on assets and to incur certain subsidiary indebtedness. in addition, the credit agreement contains a consolidated leverage ratio covenant of total consolidated funded debt to consolidated earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (ebitda) of not greater than 5.0 to 1.0. the debt covenant will be reduced over time to 3.0 to 1.0 starting in may 2018. as of october 28, 2017, we were compliant with these covenants. see note 15, revolving credit facility, of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k for further information on our revolving credit facility.
stock repurchase program our common stock repurchase program has been in place since august 2004. in the aggregate, our board of directors has authorized us to repurchase $6.2 billion of our common stock under the program. under the program, we may repurchase outstanding shares of our common stock from time to time in the open market and through privately negotiated transactions. unless terminated earlier by resolution of our board of directors, the repurchase program will expire when we have
repurchased all shares authorized under the program. as of october 28, 2017, we had repurchased a total of approximately 147.0 million shares of our common stock for approximately $5.4 billion under this program. as of october 28, 2017, an additional $792.5 million remains available for repurchase under the current authorized program. the repurchased shares are held as authorized but unissued shares of common stock. in connection with the acquisition, we have temporarily suspended our share repurchase program. while we do not plan to resume share repurchases in the near term, we expect to continue repurchasing our common stock over the long-term. we also from time to time repurchase shares in settlement of employee minimum tax withholding obligations due upon the vesting of restricted stock units.
capital expenditures net additions to property, plant and equipment were $204.1 million in fiscal 2017 and were funded with a combination of cash on hand and cash generated from operations. we expect capital expenditures for the fiscal year ending november 3, 2018 (fiscal 2018) to be in the range of $230.0 million to $270.0 million. these capital expenditures will be funded with a combination of cash on hand and cash generated from operations.
dividends on november 20, 2017, our board of directors declared a cash dividend of $0.45 per outstanding share of common stock. the dividend will be paid on december 12, 2017 to all shareholders of record at the close of business on december 1, 2017 and is expected to total approximately $166 million. we currently expect quarterly dividends to continue at $0.45 per share, although they remain subject to determination and declaration by our board of directors. the payment of future dividends, if any, will be based on several factors, including our financial performance, outlook and liquidity.
contractual obligations the table below summarizes our contractual obligations and the amounts we owe under these contracts in specified periods as of october 28, 2017:
operating leases (a)                                      $142,913               $41,795                   $41,142                   $22,398                   $37,578
(a)   certain of our operating lease obligations include escalation clauses. these escalating payment requirements are reflected in the table.
(b)   on november 10, 2017 we pre-paid $300.0 million of principal on the 3-year unsecured term loan. this amount was not contractually due under the terms of the loan. as such this amount is classified as current debt as of october 28, 2017.
(c)   these payments relate to obligations under our deferred compensation plan. the deferred compensation plan allows certain members of management and other highly-compensated employees and non-employee directors to defer receipt of all or any portion of their compensation. the amount in the "more than 5 years" column of the table represents the remaining total balance under the deferred compensation plan to be paid to participants who have not terminated employment. since we cannot reasonably estimate the timing of withdrawals for participants who have not yet terminated employment, we have included the future obligation to these participants in the "more than 5 years" column of the table.
(d)   our funding policy for our foreign defined benefit plans is consistent with the local requirements of each country. the payment obligations in the table are estimates of our expected contributions to these plans for fiscal year 2018. the actual future payments may differ from the amounts presented in the table and reasonable estimates of payments beyond one year are not practical because of potential future changes in variables, such as plan asset performance, interest rates and the rate of increase in compensation levels.
certain of our acquisitions involve the potential payment of contingent consideration. the table above does not reflect any such obligations, which could be up to $8.5 million, as the timing and amounts are uncertain.
as of october 28, 2017, our total liabilities associated with uncertain tax positions was $49.6 million, which are included in "other non-current liabilities" in our consolidated balance sheet contained in item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k. due to the complexity associated with our deferred taxes and tax uncertainties, we cannot make a reasonably reliable estimate of the period in which we expect to settle the non-current liabilities associated with these deferred taxes and uncertain tax positions. therefore, we have not included these deferred taxes and uncertain tax positions in the above contractual obligations table.
the expected timing of payments and the amounts of the obligations discussed above are estimated based on current information available as of october 28, 2017.
off-balance sheet arrangements as of october 28, 2017, we had no off-balance sheet financing arrangements.
new accounting pronouncements from time to time, new accounting pronouncements are issued by the financial accounting standards board (fasb) and are adopted by us as of the specified effective date. unless otherwise discussed, management believes that the impact of recently issued standards will not have a material impact on our future financial condition and results of operations. see note 2t, new accounting pronouncements, of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k for a description of recently issued and adopted accounting pronouncements, including the dates of adoption and impact on our historical financial condition and results of operations.
revenue recognition in may 2014, the fasb issued accounting standards update (asu) 2014-09, revenue from contracts with customers (asu 2014-09), which supersedes nearly all existing revenue recognition guidance under generally accepted accounting principles in the united states (u.s. gaap). the core principle of asu 2014-09 is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. additionally, the guidance requires improved disclosures to help users of financial statements better understand the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers. the fasb has issued several amendments and updates to the new revenue standard, including guidance related to when an entity should recognize revenue gross as a principal or net as an agent and how an entity should identify performance obligations.  as amended, asu 2014-09 is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after december 15, 2017, which is our first quarter of the fiscal year ending november 2, 2019 (fiscal 2019). early adoption is permitted for all entities only as of annual reporting periods beginning after december 15, 2016, including interim reporting periods within that reporting period. we have developed a project plan for the implementation of the guidance, including a review of all revenue streams to identify any differences in the timing, measurement or presentation of revenue recognition. we have reviewed our revenue streams and are nearing completion in assessing all potential impacts of the standard, including any impacts from recently issued amendments, and retrospectively adjusting financial information for prior fiscal years under the full retrospective transition method. we have also made progress on our impact assessment of the acquisition.  while we are still in the process of completing our evaluation of the standard, we currently believe the most significant impact will be related to the timing of recognition of sales to certain distributors. as described in note 2n, revenue recognition, of the notes to the consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k, we currently defer revenue and the related cost of sales on shipments to certain distributors until the distributors resell the products to their customers. upon adoption of asu 2014-09, we will no longer be permitted to defer revenue until sale by the distributor to the end customer, but rather, will be required to estimate the effects of returns and allowances provided to distributors and record revenue at the time of sale to the distributor. we are continuing to evaluate the future impact and method of adoption of asu 2014-09 and related amendments on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. we will adopt asu 2014-09, using the full retrospective method, upon its effective date for us which is our first quarter of fiscal 2019.
critical accounting policies and estimates management's discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations is based upon the consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with u.s. gaap. the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience, knowledge of current conditions and beliefs of what could occur in the future based on available information. we consider the following accounting policies to be both those most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and those that require the most subjective judgment. if actual results differ significantly from management's estimates and projections, there could be a
material effect on our financial statements. we also have other policies that we consider key accounting policies, such as our policy for revenue recognition, including the deferral of revenue on sales to distributors until the products are sold to the end user; however, the application of these policies does not require us to make significant estimates or judgments that are difficult or subjective.
revenue recognition revenue from product sales to customers is generally recognized when title passes, which is upon shipment in the u.s. and in certain foreign counties. revenue from product sales to other foreign countries is recognized subsequent to product shipment. title for these shipments to these other foreign countries ordinarily passes within a week of shipment. accordingly, we defer the revenue recognized relating to these other foreign countries until title has passed. for multiple element arrangements, we allocate arrangement consideration among the elements based on the relative fair values of those elements as determined using vendor-specific objective evidence or third-party evidence. we use our best estimate of selling price to allocate arrangement consideration between the deliverables in cases where neither vendor-specific objective evidence nor third-party evidence is available. a reserve for sales returns and allowances for customers is recorded based on historical experience or specific identification of an event necessitating a reserve.
revenue from contracts with the united states government, government prime contractors and some commercial customers is generally recorded on a percentage of completion basis, using either units delivered or costs incurred as the measurement basis for progress toward completion. the output measure is used to measure results directly and is generally the best measure of progress toward completion in circumstances in which a reliable measure of output can be established. estimated revenue in excess of amounts billed is reported as unbilled receivables. contract accounting requires judgment in estimating costs and assumptions related to technical issues and delivery schedule. contract costs include material, subcontract costs, labor and an allocation of indirect costs. the estimation of costs at completion of a contract is subject to numerous variables involving contract costs and estimates as to the length of time to complete the contract. changes in contract performance, estimated gross margin, including the impact of final contract settlements, and estimated losses are recognized in the period in which the changes or losses are determined.
revenue from product sales to certain international distributors are made under agreements that permit limited stock return privileges but not sales price rebates. revenue on these sales is recognized upon shipment at which time title passes.
we defer revenue and the related cost of sales on shipments to u.s. distributors and certain international distributors until the distributors resell the products to their customers. as a result, our revenue fully reflects end customer purchases and is not impacted by distributor inventory levels. sales to certain of these distributors are made under agreements that allow such distributors to receive price-adjustment credits and to return qualifying products for credit, as determined by us, in order to reduce the amounts of slow-moving, discontinued or obsolete product from their inventory. these agreements limit such returns to a certain percentage of the value of our shipments to that distributor during the prior quarter. in addition, such distributors are allowed to return unsold products if the company terminates the relationship with the distributor. given the uncertainties associated with the levels of price-adjustment credits to be granted to certain distributors, the sales price to the distributor is not fixed or determinable until the distributor resells the products to their customers. therefore, we defer revenue recognition from sales to certain distributors until such distributors have sold the products to their customers.
inventory valuation we value inventories at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out method) or market. because of the cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry, changes in inventory levels, obsolescence of technology, and product life cycles, we write down inventories to net realizable value. we employ a variety of methodologies to determine the net realizable value of inventory. while a portion of the calculation is determined via reference to the age of inventory and lower of cost or market calculations, an element of the calculation is subject to significant judgments made by us about future demand for our inventory. if actual demand for our products is less than our estimates, additional adjustments to existing inventories may need to be recorded in future periods. to date, our actual results have not been materially different than our estimates, and we do not expect them to be materially different in the future.
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts, when appropriate, for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments. if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate, our actual losses may exceed our estimates, and additional allowances would be required. to date, our actual results have not been materially different than our estimates, and we do not expect them to be materially different in the future.
long-lived assets we review property, plant, and equipment and finite lived intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of assets may not be recoverable. recoverability of these assets is determined by comparison of their carrying value to the estimated future undiscounted cash flows that the assets are expected to generate over their remaining estimated lives. if such assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized in earnings equals the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds their fair value determined by either a quoted market price, if any, or a value determined by utilizing a discounted cash flow technique. although we have recognized no material impairment adjustments related to our property, plant, and equipment and identified intangible assets during the past three fiscal years, except those made in conjunction with restructuring actions, deterioration in our business in the future could lead to such impairment adjustments in future periods. evaluation of impairment of long-lived assets requires estimates of future operating results that are used in the preparation of the expected future undiscounted cash flows. actual future operating results and the remaining economic lives of our long-lived assets could differ from the estimates used in assessing the recoverability of these assets. these differences could result in impairment charges, which could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. in addition, in certain instances, assets may not be impaired but their estimated useful lives may have decreased. in these situations, we amortize the remaining net book values over the revised useful lives. we review indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment annually, on the first day of the fourth quarter (on or about august 1) or more frequently if indicators of impairment exist. we perform a qualitative assessment on our indefinite-lived intangible assets to determine whether it is more likely-than not that the indefinite-lived intangible asset is impaired. if it is determined that the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset is less than the carrying value, we would compare the fair value of the intangible asset with its carrying amount and recognize an impairment equal to any amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds the fair value.
goodwill goodwill is subject to annual impairment tests or more frequently if indicators of potential impairment exist and suggest that the carrying value of goodwill may not be recoverable from estimated discounted future cash flows. we test goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level (operating segment or one level below an operating segment) on an annual basis in the fourth quarter (on or about august 1) or more frequently if we believe indicators of impairment exist. for our latest annual impairment assessment that occurred as of july 30, 2017, we identified our reporting units to be our eight operating segments. the goodwill impairment test requires an entity to compare the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount. if fair value is determined to be less than carrying value, an impairment loss is recognized for the amount of the carrying value that exceeds the amount of the reporting unit's fair value, not to exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit. additionally, we consider income tax effects from any tax deductible goodwill on the carrying amount of the reporting unit when measuring the goodwill impairment loss, if applicable. we determine the fair value of our reporting units using a weighting of the income and market approaches. under the income approach, we use a discounted cash flow methodology which requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions related to forecasted revenues, gross profit margins, operating income margins, working capital cash flow, perpetual growth rates, and long-term discount rates, among others. for the market approach, we use the guideline public company method. under this method we utilize information from comparable publicly traded companies with similar operating and investment characteristics as the reporting units, to create valuation multiples that are applied to the operating performance of the reporting unit being tested, in order to obtain their respective fair values. in order to assess the reasonableness of the calculated reporting unit fair values, we reconcile the aggregate fair values of our reporting units determined, as described above, to its current market capitalization, allowing for a reasonable control premium.
business combinations under the acquisition method of accounting, we recognize tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values. we record the excess of the fair value of the purchase consideration over the value of the net assets acquired as goodwill. the accounting for business combinations requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions, especially with respect to intangible assets and the fair value of contingent payment obligations. critical estimates in valuing purchased technology, customer lists and other identifiable intangible assets include future cash flows that we expect to generate from the acquired assets. if the subsequent actual results and updated projections of the underlying business activity change compared with the assumptions and projections used to develop these values, we could experience impairment charges which could be material. in addition, we have estimated the economic lives of certain acquired assets and these lives are used to calculate depreciation and amortization expense. if our estimates of the economic lives change, depreciation or amortization expenses could be accelerated or slowed.
we record contingent consideration resulting from a business combination at its fair value on the acquisition date. we generally determine the fair value of the contingent consideration using the income approach methodology of valuation. each reporting period thereafter, we revalue these obligations and record increases or decreases in their fair value as an adjustment to
operating expenses within the consolidated statement of income. changes in the fair value of the contingent consideration can result from changes in assumed discount periods and rates, and from changes pertaining to the achievement of the defined milestones. significant judgment is employed in determining the appropriateness of these assumptions as of the acquisition date and for each subsequent period. accordingly, future business and economic conditions, as well as changes in any of the assumptions described above, can materially impact the amount of contingent consideration expense we record in any given period.
accounting for income taxes we must make certain estimates and judgments in determining income tax expense for financial statement purposes. these estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of tax credits, benefits, and deductions, and in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities, which arise from differences in the timing of the recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purposes, as well as the interest and penalties relating to these uncertain tax positions. we assessed the likelihood of the realization of deferred tax assets and concluded that a valuation allowance is needed to reserve the amount of the deferred tax assets that may not be realized due to the uncertainty of the timing and amount of the realization of certain state credit carryovers. in reaching our conclusion, we evaluated certain relevant criteria including the existence of deferred tax liabilities that can be used to realize deferred tax assets, the taxable income in prior carryback years in the impacted state jurisdictions that can be used to absorb net operating losses and taxable income in future years. our judgments regarding future profitability may change due to future market conditions, changes in u.s. or international tax laws and other factors. these changes, if any, may require material adjustments to these deferred tax assets, resulting in a reduction in net income or an increase in net loss in the period when such determinations are made, which in turn, may result in an increase or decrease to our tax provision in a subsequent period.
we account for uncertain tax positions by determining if it is "more likely than not" that a tax position will be sustained by the appropriate taxing authorities prior to recording any benefit in the financial statements. an uncertain income tax position is not recognized if it has less than a 50% likelihood of being sustained. for those tax positions where it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained, we have recorded the largest amount of tax benefit with a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information. for those income tax positions where it is not more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained, no tax benefit has been recognized in the financial statements. we reevaluate these uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis. this evaluation is based on factors including, but not limited to, changes in known facts or circumstances, changes in tax law, effectively settled issues under audit, and new audit activity. a change in these factors would result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision.
in the ordinary course of global business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain. some of these uncertainties arise as a consequence of cost reimbursement and royalty arrangements among related entities. although we believe our estimates are reasonable, no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different than that which is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals. in the event our assumptions are incorrect, the differences could have a material impact on our income tax provision and operating results in the period in which such determination is made. in addition to the factors described above, our current and expected effective tax rate is based on then-current tax law. significant changes during the year in enacted tax law could affect these estimates.
stock-based compensation stock-based compensation expense associated with stock options and related awards is recognized in the consolidated statements of income. determining the amount of stock-based compensation to be recorded requires us to develop estimates to be used in calculating the grant-date fair value of stock options and market-based restricted stock units. we calculate the grant-date fair values of stock options using the black-scholes valuation model. the use of valuation models requires us to make estimates of key assumptions such as expected option term and stock price volatility to determine the fair value of a stock option. the estimate of these key assumptions is based on historical information and judgment regarding market factors and trends. as it relates to our market-based restricted stock units, we utilize the monte carlo simulation valuation model to value these awards. the monte carlo simulation model utilizes multiple input variables that determine the probability of satisfying the performance conditions stipulated in the award grant and calculates the fair market value for the market-based restricted stock units granted. the monte carlo simulation model also uses stock price volatility and other variables to estimate the probability of satisfying the performance conditions, including the possibility that the market condition may not be satisfied, and the resulting fair value of the award. we recognize the expense related to these on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, which is generally five years for stock options and three years for restricted stock units. see note 3, stock-based compensation and shareholders' equity, of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k for more information related to stock based compensation.
contingencies from time to time, in the ordinary course of business, various claims, charges and litigation are asserted or commenced against us arising from, or related to, contractual matters, patents, trademarks, personal injury, environmental matters, product liability, insurance coverage and personnel and employment disputes. we periodically assess each matter to determine if a contingent liability should be recorded. in making this determination, we may, depending on the nature of the matter, consult with internal and external legal counsel and technical experts. based on the information we obtain, combined with our judgment regarding all the facts and circumstances of each matter, we determine whether it is probable that a contingent loss may be incurred and whether the amount of such loss can be reasonably estimated. if a loss is probable and reasonably estimable, we record a contingent loss. in determining the amount of a contingent loss, we consider advice received from experts in the specific matter, current status of legal proceedings, settlement negotiations that may be ongoing, prior case history and other factors. if the judgments and estimates made by us are incorrect, we may need to record additional contingent losses that could materially adversely impact our results of operations.

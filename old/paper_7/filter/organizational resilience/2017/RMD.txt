item 7   managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations
overview managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is intended to help the reader understand the results of operations and financial condition of resmed inc. and subsidiaries. it is provided as a supplement to, and should be read together with the selected financial data and consolidated financial statements and notes included elsewhere in this report.
we are a leading developer, manufacturer and distributor of medical equipment for treating, diagnosing, and managing sdb and other respiratory disorders. during the fiscal year, we continued our efforts to build awareness of the consequences of untreated sdb and to grow our business in this market. in our efforts, we have attempted to raise awareness through market and clinical initiatives and by highlighting the increasing link between the potential effects sdb can have on co-morbidities such as cardiac disease, diabetes, hypertension and obesity.
we are committed to ongoing investment in research and development and product enhancements. during fiscal year 2017, we invested approximately $144.5 million on research and development activities, which represents approximately 7.0% of net revenues. since the development of cpap, we have developed a number of innovative products for the treatment of sdb and other respiratory disorders including devices, informatics solutions, diagnostic products, mask systems, headgear and other accessories. during fiscal year 2017, we released new products including the airmini pap device, airfit mask range and airtouch masks. we also introduced a number of new software solutions including our resmed resupply, goscripts and new features and enhancements within our cloud-based software offerings. through our acquisition of brightree in 2016, we also acquired a suite of software-as-a-service solutions for u.s. based distributors and home health and hospice customers. these products, our cloud-based remote monitoring and therapy management system, and a robust product pipeline, should continue to provide us with a strong platform for future growth.
net revenue in fiscal year 2017 increased to $2,066.7 million, an increase of 12% compared to fiscal year 2016. gross profit increased for the year ended june 30, 2017 to $1,201.7 million, from $1,066.5 million for the year ended june 30, 2016, an increase of $135.2 million or 13%. our net income for the year ended june 30, 2017 was $342.3 million or $2.40 per diluted share compared to net income of $352.4 million or $2.49 per diluted share for the year ended june 30, 2016.
total operating cash flow for fiscal year 2017 was $414.1 million and at june 30, 2017, our cash and cash equivalents totaled $821.9 million. at june 30, 2017, our total assets were $3.5 billion and our stockholders equity was $2.0 billion. we temporarily suspended our share repurchase program due to the acquisitions completed in fiscal year 2016. accordingly, we did not purchase any shares during fiscal year 2017. during fiscal year 2016, we repurchased 1.9 million shares at a cost of $102.1 million under our share repurchase program. we paid a quarterly dividend of $0.33 per share during fiscal 2017 with a total amount of $186.3 million paid to stockholders.
in order to provide a framework for assessing how our underlying businesses performed, excluding the effect of foreign currency fluctuations, we provide certain financial information on a constant currency basis, which is in addition to the actual financial information presented. in order to calculate our constant currency information, we translate the current period financial information using the foreign currency exchange rates that were in effect during the previous comparable period. however, constant currency measures should not be considered in isolation or as an alternative to u.s. dollar measures that reflect current period exchange rates, or to other financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles.
net revenues.    net revenue for the year ended june 30, 2017 increased to $2,066.7 million from $1,838.7 million for the year ended june 30, 2016, an increase of $228.0 million or 12% (a 13% increase on a constant currency basis). net revenue for the year ended june 30, 2017 includes revenue of $138.1 million from our brightrees operations. excluding revenue attributable to brightree, net revenue for the year ended june 30, 2017 was $1,928.7 million, an increase of $118.9 million or 7% compared to the year ended june 30, 2016 (an 8% increase on a constant currency basis). the increase in net revenue was attributable to an increase in unit sales of our devices, masks and accessories, partially offset by a decline in average selling prices. movements in international currencies against the u.s. dollar negatively impacted net revenues by approximately $17.2 million for the year ended june 30, 2017.
net revenue in north and latin america for the year ended june 30, 2017 increased to $1,310.1 million from $1,130.4 million for the year ended june 30, 2016, an increase of $179.7 million or 16%. excluding revenue attributable to brightree, net revenue in north and latin america increased for the year ended june 30, 2017 to $1,172.1 million, an increase of $70.5 million or 6%. the increase in net revenue in north and latin america, excluding revenue attributable to brightree, is primarily due to an increase in unit sales of our devices, masks and accessories, partially offset by a decline in average selling prices.
net revenue in markets outside north and latin america increased for the year ended june 30, 2017 to $756.6 million from $708.3 million for the year ended june 30, 2016, an increase of $48.3 million or 7% (a 9% increase on a constant currency basis). the constant currency increase in sales outside north and latin america predominantly reflects an increase in unit sales of our devices, masks and accessories, partially offset by a decline in average selling prices.
net revenue from devices for the year ended june 30, 2017 increased to $1,161.0 million from $1,064.2 million for the year ended june 30, 2016, an increase of $96.8 million or 9%, including an increase of 9% in north and latin america and an increase of 10% outside north and latin america (a 12% increase on a constant currency basis). net revenue from masks and other accessories for the year ended june 30, 2017 increased to $767.7 million from $745.6 million for the year ended june 30, 2016, an increase of 3%, including an increase of 4% in north and latin america and an increase of 1% outside north and latin america (a 4% increase on a constant currency basis). excluding the impact of foreign currency movements, device sales for the year ended june 30, 2017 increased by 10%, and masks and accessories sales increased by 4%, compared to the year ended june 30, 2016.
the following table summarizes the percentage movements in our net revenue, excluding revenue attributable to brightree following the closing of our acquisition, for the year ended june 30, 2017 compared to the year ended june 30, 2016:
north and latin         markets outside         total         markets outside               total america               north and                             north and           (constant latin america                         latin america          currency)*

gross profit.    gross profit increased for the year ended june 30, 2017 to $1,201.7 million from $1,066.5 million for the year ended june 30, 2016, an increase of $135.2 million or 13%. gross profit as a percentage of net revenue was 58.1% for the year ended june 30, 2017, compared with the 58.0% for the year ended june 30, 2016. the increase in gross margin was due primarily to manufacturing and procurement efficiencies, and an incremental contribution from the brightree acquisition, partly offset by declines in our average selling prices and unfavorable product mix as sales of our lower margin products represented a higher proportion of our sales.
selling, general and administrative expenses.    selling, general and administrative expenses increased for the year ended june 30, 2017 to $554.0 million from $488.1 million for the year ended june 30, 2016, an increase of $65.9 million or 14%. the selling, general and administrative expenses, as reported in u.s. dollars, were favorably impacted by the movement of international currencies against the u.s. dollar, which decreased our expenses by approximately $1.2 million. excluding the impact of foreign currency movements, selling, general and administrative expenses for the year ended june 30, 2017 increased by 14% compared to the year ended june 30, 2016. as a percentage of net revenue, selling, general and administrative expenses for the year ended june 30, 2017 were 26.8%, compared to 26.5% for the year ended june 30, 2016.
the increase in selling, general and administrative expenses was primarily due to additional personnel to support our commercial activities, increased legal expenses, increased professional fees and additional expenses associated with the consolidation of recent acquisitions.
research and development expenses.    research and development expenses increased for the year ended june 30, 2017 to $144.5 million from $118.7 million for the year ended june 30, 2016, an increase of $25.8 million or 22%. the research and development expenses were unfavorably impacted by the appreciation of the australian dollar against the u.s. dollar, which increased our expenses by approximately $3.7 million, as reported in u.s. dollars. excluding the impact of foreign currency movements, research and development expenses for the year ended june 30, 2017 increased by 19% compared to the year ended june 30, 2016. as a percentage of net revenue, research and development expenses were 7.0% for the year ended june 30, 2017 compared to 6.5% for the year ended june 30, 2016.
the increase in research and development expenses in constant currency terms was primarily due to an increase in the number of research and development personnel, an increase in materials and tooling costs incurred to facilitate development of new products and additional expenses associated with the consolidation of recent acquisitions.
restructuring expenses.    during the year ended june 30, 2017, we incurred restructuring expenses of $12.4 million associated with the reorganization of our paris manufacturing activities and german research and development activities. the restructuring expenses consisted primarily of severance payments to employees in our german and paris facilities, site closure costs and associated project cancellation costs. we recorded the full amount of $12.4 million during the year ended june 30, 2017, within our operating expenses and separately disclosed the amount as restructuring expenses and had $6.5 million remaining in our employee related costs accrual at year end. during the year ended june 30, 2016, we incurred restructuring expenses of $6.9 million associated with the rationalizing our european research and development operations and manufacturing facilities. the restructuring expenses consisted primarily of severance payments and an asset write-down of a legacy manufacturing facility.
amortization of acquired intangible assets.    amortization of acquired intangible assets for the year ended june 30, 2017 totaled $46.6 million compared to $23.9 million for the year ended june 30, 2016. the increase in amortization expense was attributable to our acquisitions from the prior year, in particular brightree, curative medical and inova labs.
total other income (loss), net.    total other income (loss), net for the year ended june 30, 2017 was a loss of $7.1 million, compared with an income of $10.6 million for the year ended june 30, 2016. the change was due primarily to an increase in interest expense due to higher borrowings.
income taxes.    our effective income tax rate decreased to 18.3% for the year ended june 30, 2017 from 19.8% for the year ended june 30, 2016. our effective income tax rate is affected by the geographic mix of our taxable income, including lower taxes associated with our singapore and malaysia manufacturing operations. our singapore and malaysia operations operate under certain tax holidays and tax incentive programs which will expire in whole or in part at various dates through june 30, 2020. as of june 30, 2017, we have not provided for u.s. income taxes for the undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries. we intend for these earnings to be permanently reinvested outside the united states.
net income and earnings per share.    as a result of the factors above, our net income for the year ended june 30, 2017 was $342.3 million compared to net income of $352.4 million for the year ended june 30, 2016. our earnings per diluted share for the year ended june 30, 2017 was $2.40 compared to $2.49 for the year ended june 30, 2016, a decrease of 4%.
net revenues.    net revenue for the year ended june 30, 2016 increased to $1,838.7 million from $1,678.9 million for the year ended june 30, 2015, an increase of $159.8 million or 10% (a 13% increase on a constant currency basis). net revenue for the year ended june 30, 2016 includes revenue of $28.9 million from brightrees operations since the closing of our acquisition of brightree. excluding revenue attributable to brightree, net revenue for the year ended june 30, 2016 was $1,809.8 million, an increase of $130.9 million or 8% compared to the year ended june 30, 2015 (an 11% increase on a constant currency basis). the increase in net revenue was attributable to an increase in unit sales of our devices, masks and accessories, partially offset by a decline in average selling prices. movements in international currencies against the u.s. dollar negatively impacted net revenues by approximately $55.6 million for the year ended june 30, 2016.
net revenue in north and latin america for the year ended june 30, 2016 increased to $1,130.4 million from $962.7 million for the year ended june 30, 2015, an increase of $167.7 million or 17%. excluding revenue attributable to brightree, net revenue in north and latin america increased for the year ended june 30, 2016 to $1,101.5 million, an increase of $138.8 million or 14%. the increase in net revenue in north and latin america, excluding revenue attributable to brightree, is primarily due to an increase in unit sales of our devices, masks and accessories, partially offset by a decline in average selling prices.

selling, general and administrative expenses.    selling, general and administrative expenses increased for the year ended june 30, 2016 to $488.1 million from $478.6 million for the year ended june 30, 2015, an increase of $9.4 million or 2%. the selling, general and administrative expenses, as reported in u.s. dollars, were favorably impacted by the movement of international currencies against the u.s. dollar, which decreased our expenses by approximately $25.6 million. excluding the impact of foreign currency movements, selling, general and administrative expenses for the year ended june 30, 2016 increased by 7% compared to the year ended june 30, 2015. as a percentage of net revenue, selling, general and administrative expenses for the year ended june 30, 2016 was 26.5%, compared to 28.5% for the year ended june 30, 2015.
the increase in selling, general and administrative expenses was primarily due to additional personnel to support our commercial activities, increased legal expenses, acquisition expenses and incremental expenses due to the inclusion of our recent business acquisitions.
research and development expenses.    research and development expenses increased for the year ended june 30, 2016 to $118.7 million from $114.9 million for the year ended june 30, 2015, an increase of $3.8 million or 3%. the research and development expenses were favorably impacted by the depreciation of the australian dollar and euro against the u.s. dollar, which decreased our expenses by approximately $13.9 million, as reported in u.s. dollars. excluding the impact of foreign currency movements, research and development expenses for the year ended june 30, 2016 increased by 15% compared to the year ended june 30, 2015. as a percentage of net revenue, research and development expenses were 6.5% for the year ended june 30, 2016 compared to 6.8% for the year ended june 30, 2015.

total other income, net.    total other income, net for the year ended june 30, 2016 was $10.6 million, compared with $26.7 million for the year ended june 30, 2015. the decrease in total other income, net, was due primarily to lower interest income resulting from lower interest rates on cash balances held, an increase in interest expense due to higher borrowings and reduced foreign currency hedging gains due to the depreciation of the australian dollar against the u.s. dollar and euro.
income taxes.    our effective income tax rate increased to 19.8% for the year ended june 30, 2016 from 19.0% for the year ended june 30, 2015. during the year ended june 30, 2016, we adopted the new accounting standard, asu 2016-09 improvements to employee share-based payment accounting. as a result of adopting this standard, we recognized a tax benefit of $11.2 million. the impact of this tax benefit was offset by an additional tax expense relating to an increase in our foreign cash repatriation to the u.s. our effective income tax rate is affected by the geographic mix of our taxable income, including lower taxes associated with our singapore and malaysia manufacturing operations. our singapore and malaysia operations operate under certain tax holidays and tax incentive programs which will expire in whole or in part at various dates through june 30, 2020. as of june 30, 2016, we have not provided for u.s. income taxes for the undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries. we intend for these earnings to be permanently reinvested outside the united states.
net income and earnings per share.    as a result of the factors above, our net income for the year ended june 30, 2016 was $352.4 million compared to net income of $352.9 million for the year ended june 30, 2015. as a result of lower share count due to our stock repurchases during the year ended june 30, 2016, our earnings per share for the year ended june 30, 2016 was $2.49 per diluted share compared to $2.47 per diluted share for the year ended june 30, 2015, an increase of 1% over the year ended june 30, 2015.
liquidity and capital resources as of june 30, 2017 and june 30, 2016, we had cash and cash equivalents of $821.9 million and $731.4 million, respectively. working capital was $1.3 billion and $0.8 billion, at june 30, 2017 and june 30, 2016, respectively. as of june 30, 2017, we had $1.1 billion of borrowings under our revolving credit facility agreement.
as of june 30, 2017 and june 30, 2016, our cash and cash equivalent balances held within the united states amounted to $23.2 million and $40.9 million, respectively. our remaining cash and cash equivalent balances at june 30, 2017 and june 30, 2016, of $798.7 million and $690.5 million, respectively, were held by our non-u.s. subsidiaries, indefinitely invested outside the united states. our cash and cash equivalent balances are held at highly rated financial institutions.
as of june 30, 2017, the cumulative amount of undistributed earnings from our foreign subsidiaries was approximately $1.5 billion, and those undistributed earnings are considered permanently reinvested. we intend to reinvest the cash and cash equivalents of those entities whose undistributed earnings are permanently reinvested in our international operations. we reassess our reinvestment intentions each reporting period and currently believe that we have sufficient sources of liquidity to support our assertion that the undistributed earnings held by foreign subsidiaries may be considered to be reinvested permanently. if these earnings had not been permanently reinvested, deferred taxes of approximately $358 million would have been recognized in our consolidated financial statements.
we repatriated $215 million and $190 million to the u.s. in fiscal years 2017 and 2016, respectively, from earnings generated in each of those years. the amount of the current year foreign earnings that we have repatriated to the u.s. in the past has been determined, and the amount that we expect to repatriate during fiscal year 2018 will be determined, based on a variety of factors, including current year earnings of our foreign subsidiaries, foreign investment needs and the cash flow needs we have in the u.s., such as for the repayment of debt, dividend distributions, and other domestic obligations. the majority of our repatriation of foreign subsidiaries earnings to the u.s. has historically occurred at year-end, although we may repatriate funds earlier in the year based on our business needs, as we did during the year ended june 30, 2017. when we repatriate funds to the u.s., we are required to pay taxes in the u.s. on these amounts based on applicable u.s. tax rates, net of any foreign tax that would be allowed to be deducted or taken as a credit against u.s. income tax. we paid $24.6 million and $34.2 million in additional u.s. federal income taxes in fiscal years 2017 and 2016, respectively, as a result of repatriation of foreign earnings generated in those years.
inventories at june 30, 2017 increased by $43.9 million or 20% to $268.3 million compared to june 30, 2016 inventories of $224.5 million. the increase in inventories was required to support our revenue growth and new product introductions.
accounts receivable, net of allowance for doubtful accounts, at june 30, 2017 were $450.5 million, an increase of $68.4 million or 18% over the june 30, 2016 accounts receivable balance of $382.1 million. accounts receivable days sales outstanding of 68 days at june 30, 2017 increased by 5 days compared to 63 days at june 30, 2016. our allowance for doubtful accounts as a percentage of total accounts receivable at june 30, 2017 and 2016 was 2.4% and 3.2%, respectively. we believe the credit quality of our customers remains broadly consistent with our past experience.
during the year ended june 30, 2017, we generated cash of $414.1 million from operations. this was lower than the cash generated from operations for the year ended june 30, 2016 of $547.9 million, which was primarily due to the increase in accounts receivable and corporate income tax payments. movements in foreign currency exchange rates during the year ended june 30, 2017 had the effect of increasing our cash and cash equivalents by $21.2 million, as reported in u.s. dollars. during fiscal year 2016, we temporarily suspended our share repurchase program due to acquisitions. accordingly, we did not purchase any shares during fiscal year 2017. during fiscal year 2016, we repurchased 1.9 million shares at a cost of $102.1 million. during fiscal years 2017 and 2016, we also paid dividends totaling $186.3 million and $168.1 million, respectively.

refer to note 19 legal actions and contingencies of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for details of our contingent obligations under recourse provisions.
segment information we have determined that we predominantly operate in a single operating segment, which is the sleep and respiratory disorders sector of the medical device industry. due to the acquisition of brightree llc in april 2016, our operations now include the supply of business management software and services to medical equipment and home health providers. however, these operations, both in terms of revenue and profit, are not material to our global operations and therefore have not been separately reported as a segment. see note 15  segment information of the notes to financial statements (part ii, item 8) for financial information regarding segment reporting. financial information about our revenues from and assets located in foreign countries is also included in the notes to our consolidated financial statements.
credit facility on october 31, 2013, we entered into a revolving credit agreement, as borrower, with lenders, including union bank, n.a., as administrative agent, joint lead arranger, swing line lender and letters of credit issuer, and hsbc bank usa, national association, as syndication agent and joint lead arranger, providing for a revolving credit facility of $700 million, with an uncommitted option to increase the revolving credit facility by an additional $300 million. on april 4, 2016, in connection with our acquisition of brightree llc (brightree), we entered into a first amendment to the revolving credit agreement to increase the size of the revolving credit facility from $700 million to $1 billion, with an uncommitted option to increase the revolving credit facility by an additional $300 million, and to make other modifications to provide for the acquisition of brightree. on january 9, 2017, we entered into a second amendment to our agreement with our existing lenders, including mufg union bank, n.a. as successor in interest to union bank, n.a., as administrative agent, joint lead arranger, swing line lender and l/c issuer; and hsbc bank usa, national association, as syndication agent and joint lead arranger. the second amendment, among other things, increases the size of our senior unsecured revolving credit facility from $1.0 billion to $1.3 billion, with an uncommitted option to increase the revolving credit facility by an additional $300 million. the credit facility terminates on october 31, 2018, when all unpaid principal and interest under the loans must be repaid. the outstanding principal amount due under the credit facility will bear interest at a rate equal to libor plus 1.0% to 2.0% (depending on the then-applicable leverage ratio). at june 30, 2017, the interest rate that was being charged on the outstanding principal amount was 2.7%. a commitment fee of 0.15% to 0.25% (depending on the then-applicable leverage ratio) applies on the unused portion of the credit facility. the credit facility also includes a $25 million sublimit for letters of credit.
our obligations under the revolving credit agreement (as amended) are unsecured but are guaranteed by certain of our direct and indirect u. s. subsidiaries, including resmed corp.; resmed motor technologies inc.; birdie inc.; inova labs, inc.; brightree llc; brightree services llc; brightree home health & hospice llc; and strategic ar llc, under an unconditional guaranty. the credit agreement contains customary covenants, including certain financial covenants and an obligation that we maintain certain financial ratios, including a maximum leverage ratio of funded debt to ebitda (as defined in the credit agreement) and an interest coverage ratio.
at june 30, 2017, we were in compliance with our debt covenants and there was $1,080.0 million outstanding under the revolving credit facility.
we expect to satisfy all of our liquidity and long-term debt requirements through a combination of cash on hand, cash generated from operations and debt facilities.
term loan on april 4, 2016, in connection with the brightree acquisition, we also entered into a credit agreement, or the term loan credit agreement, providing a $300 million senior unsecured one-year term loan credit facility. the proceeds from the funding of the term loan credit facility were used to pay a portion of the acquisition consideration for the brightree acquisition, as well as to pay fees and expenses in connection with the acquisition, the amendment to the revolving credit agreement and the term loan credit agreement. on march 30, 2017 we drew down $300 million from the revolving credit facility to pay off all outstanding amounts under the term loan credit facility, in advance of the scheduled termination of the term loan credit facility on april 3, 2017.
tax expense our income tax rate is governed by the laws of the jurisdictions where our income is recognized. to date, a substantial portion of our income has been subject to income tax in australia where the statutory rate was 30% in fiscal years june 30, 2017, 2016 and 2015. during fiscal years june 30, 2017, 2016 and 2015, our consolidated effective tax rate has fluctuated between 18% and 20%. these and future effective tax rate fluctuations resulted from and depend on numerous factors including the level of foreign earnings repatriated to the u.s.; the geographic mix of taxable income and other tax credits and benefits available to us under applicable tax laws, including the lower statutory tax rates and incentives associated with our singapore and malaysia manufacturing operations, and any future changes to tax laws in the jurisdictions in which we operate.
critical accounting principles and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect our reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. we evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis, including those estimates related to allowance for doubtful accounts, inventory adjustments, warranty obligations, goodwill, impaired assets, intangible assets, income taxes, deferred tax valuation allowances and stock-based compensation costs.
we state these accounting policies in the notes to the consolidated financial statements and at relevant sections in this discussion and analysis. the estimates are based on the information that is currently available to us and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. actual results could vary from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
we believe that the following critical accounting policies affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements:
(1)    allowance for doubtful accounts. we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments, which results in bad debt expense. we determine the adequacy of this allowance by periodically evaluating individual customer receivables, considering a customers financial condition, credit history and current economic conditions. if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate, resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments, additional allowances may be required.
(2)    inventory adjustments. inventories are stated at lower of cost or market and are determined by the first-in, first-out method. we review the components of inventory on a regular basis for excess, obsolete and impaired inventory based on estimated future usage and sales. the likelihood of any material inventory write-downs depends on changes in competitive conditions, new product introductions by us or our competitors, or rapid changes in customer demand.
(3)    valuation of goodwill, intangible and other long-lived assets. we make assumptions in establishing the carrying value, fair value and estimated lives of our goodwill, intangibles and other long-lived assets. our goodwill impairment tests are performed at our reporting unit level which is one level below our operating segment. the criteria used for these evaluations include managements estimate of the assets continuing ability to generate positive income from operations and positive cash flow in future periods compared to the carrying value of the asset, as well as the strategic significance of any identifiable intangible asset in our business objectives. if assets are considered to be impaired, we recognize as impairment the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds their fair value. we base useful lives and related amortization or depreciation expense on our estimate of the period that the assets will generate revenues or otherwise be used by us. factors that would influence the likelihood of a material change in our reported results include significant changes in the assets ability to generate positive cash flow, loss of legal ownership or title to the asset, a significant decline in the economic and competitive environment on which the asset depends, significant changes in our strategic business objectives, utilization of the asset, and a significant change in the economic and/or political conditions in certain countries.
we conducted our annual review for goodwill impairment during the final quarter of fiscal 2017, which indicated that no impaired goodwill exists as the fair value for each reporting unit exceeded its carrying value.
(4)    income tax. we assess our income tax positions and record tax benefits for all years subject to audit based upon managements evaluation of the facts, circumstances and information available at the reporting date. if we determine that it is not more likely than not that we would be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets in the future, an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would be charged to income tax expense in the period such determination is made. alternatively, if we determine that it is more likely than not that the net deferred tax assets would be realized, any previously provided valuation allowance is reversed. these changes to the valuation allowance and resulting increases or decreases in income tax expense may have a material effect on our operating results.
our income tax returns are based on calculations and assumptions subject to audit by various tax authorities. in addition, the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws. although currently immaterial, we recognize liabilities for uncertain tax positions based on a two-step process. the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, if any. the second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50% likely of being realized upon settlement. while we believe we have appropriate support for the positions taken on our tax returns, we regularly assess the potential outcomes of examinations by tax authorities in determining the adequacy of our provision for income taxes. based on our regular assessment, we may adjust the income tax provision, income taxes payable and deferred taxes in the period in which the facts that give rise to a revision become known.
(5)    provision for warranty. we provide for the estimated cost of product warranties at the time the related revenue is recognized. we determine the amount of this provision by using a financial model, which takes into consideration actual historical expenses and potential risks associated with our different products. we use this financial model to calculate the future probable expenses related to warranty and the required level of the warranty provision. although we engage in product improvement programs and processes, our warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates and costs incurred to correct those product failures. should actual product failure rates or estimated costs to repair those product failures differ from our estimates, we would be required to revise our estimated warranty provision.
(6)    revenue recognition. we generally record revenue on product sales at the time of shipment, which is when title transfers to the customer. we initially defer service revenue received in advance from service contracts and recognize that deferred revenue ratably over the life of the service contract. we initially defer revenue we receive in advance from rental unit contracts and recognize that deferred revenue ratably over the life of the rental contract. otherwise, we recognize revenue from rental unit contracts ratably over the life of the rental contract. we include in revenue freight charges we bill to customers. we charge all freight-related expenses to cost of sales. taxes assessed by government authorities that are imposed on and concurrent with revenue-producing transactions, such as sales and value added taxes, are excluded from revenue.
we do not normally offer a right of return or other recourse with respect to the sale of our products, other than returns for product defects or other warranty claims. we do not recognize revenues if we offer a right of return or variable sale prices for subsequent events or activities. however, as part of our sales processes we may provide upfront discounts for large orders, one-time special pricing to support new product introductions, sales rebates for centralized purchasing entities or price-breaks for regular order volumes. we record the costs of all such programs as an adjustment to revenue at the time the related revenue is recognized. our products are predominantly therapy-based equipment and require no installation. therefore, we have no significant installation obligations. for multiple-element arrangements, we allocate arrangement consideration to the deliverables by use of the relative selling price method. the selling price used for each deliverable is based on vendor-specific objective evidence.
we also generate revenue from time-based licensing of our software and associated services. in most instances, revenue is generated under sales agreements with multiple elements comprising subscription fees and professional services, which typically have contract terms of one to three years. we evaluate each element in these multiple-element arrangements to determine whether they represent a separate unit of accounting and recognize each element as the services are performed.
(7)    stock-based compensation. we measure the compensation cost of all stock-based awards at fair value on the date of grant. we recognize that value as compensation expense over the service period, net of estimated forfeitures. we estimate the fair value of employee stock options and purchase rights granted using a black-scholes valuation model. the fair value of an award is affected by our stock price on the date of grant as well as other assumptions including the estimated volatility of our stock price over the term of the awards, the expected dividend per share and the expected life of the awards. the risk-free interest rate assumption we use is based upon the u.s. treasury yield curve at the time of grant appropriate for the expected life of the awards. expected volatilities are based on a combination of historical volatilities of our stock and the implied volatilities from tradeable options of our stock corresponding to the expected term of the options. we use a combination of the historic and implied volatilities as the addition of the implied volatility is more representative of our future stock price trends. while there is a tradeable market of options on our common stock, less emphasis is placed on the implied volatility of these options due to the relative low volumes of these traded options and the difference in the terms compared to our employee options. in order to determine the estimated period of time that we expect employees to hold their stock options, we use historical rates by employee groups. the estimation of stock awards that will ultimately vest requires judgment, and to the extent actual results differ from our estimates, such amounts will be recorded as a cumulative adjustment in the period estimates are revised. the aforementioned inputs entered into the black-scholes valuation model we use to fair value our stock awards are subjective estimates and changes to these estimates will cause the fair value of our stock awards and related stock-based compensation expense we record to vary.
we estimate the fair value of restricted stock units based on the market value of the underlying shares as determined at the grant date less the fair value of dividends that holders are not entitled to, during the vesting period. we estimate the weighted average grant date fair value of performance restricted stock units, or prsus, which contain a market condition, using a monte-carlo simulation valuation model.

on december 2, 2016, the company publicly announced that it will pursue the conversion of aflac japan from a branch structure to a subsidiary structure, with the subsidiary incorporated as a "kabushiki kaisha." while the branch structure remains an acceptable legal form, the subsidiary structure has emerged as the more prevalent structure for both domestic and foreign companies operating in japan. in addition, emerging global regulatory standards generally favor the subsidiary structure for foreign insurance and financial service companies. the adoption of this new organizational framework is expected to be tax-neutral and not to have a material impact on the daily operations of either aflac japan or aflac u.s. as a result of this conversion. in addition, the company expects to obtain enhanced flexibility in capital management and business development as a result of the conversion. the company anticipates completion of the conversion as early as april 1, 2018. as an interim step, effective january 1, 2018, investments of aflac u.s. as well as certain sub-advised assets of aflac japan, are managed by the company's u.s. asset management subsidiary, aflac asset management llc (aam), and investments of aflac japan are managed pursuant to an investment advisory agreement between aflac japan and the company's asset management subsidiary in japan, aflac asset management ltd. (aamj). aamj is licensed as a discretionary asset manager under the japan financial instruments and exchange act and is subject to rules of the japan investment advisors association, a self-regulatory organization with mandatory membership for japan investment managers. aam and aamj will be reported in the "other business segments" category; however, the assets that they manage will be reported in the respective aflac japan and aflac u.s. business segments.

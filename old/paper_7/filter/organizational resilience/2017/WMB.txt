selling, general, and administrative expenses (sg&a) decreased primarily due to the absence of certain project development costs associated with the canadian pdh facility that were expensed in 2016, lower labor-related costs resulting from our workforce reductions that occurred late in first-quarter 2016, ongoing cost containment efforts, lower strategic development costs, and the absence of costs associated with our former canadian and gulf coast operations. these decreases were partially offset by higher severance and organizational realignment costs in 2017 (see note 6 - other income and expenses of notes to consolidated financial statements) and a settlement charge from a pension early payout program.
â€¢   $37 million increase for severance and related costs associated with workforce reductions incurred in the first quarter of 2016 and the organizational realignment in the fourth quarter of 2016;
distributions from equity-method investees the organizational documents of entities in which we have an equity-method investment generally require distribution of their available cash to their members on a quarterly basis. in each case, available cash is reduced, in part, by reserves appropriate for operating their respective businesses. (see note 5 - investing activities of notes to consolidated financial statements for our more significant equity-method investees.)

overview the company develops, manufactures and sells a broad range of products that are sold worldwide. the company expands the product lines and services it offers by developing and commercializing its own technologies and by making strategic acquisitions of complementary businesses. the company's continuing operations fall into four business segments (see note 3): life sciences solutions, analytical instruments, specialty diagnostics and laboratory products and services.
recent acquisitions and divestitures the company's strategy is to augment internal growth at existing businesses with complementary acquisitions. the company's principal recent acquisitions are described below.
in february 2015, the company acquired, within the life sciences solutions segment, advanced scientifics, inc., a north america-based global provider of single-use systems and process equipment for bioprocess production, for approximately $289 million. the acquisition expanded the company's bioprocessing offerings. revenues of advanced scientifics were approximately $80 million in 2014.
on september 30, 2015, the company acquired, within the laboratory products and services segment, alfa aesar, a u.k.-based global manufacturer of research chemicals from johnson matthey plc, for £257 million ($393 million) in cash. the acquisition expanded the company's existing portfolio of chemicals, solvents and reagents. revenues of alfa aesar were approximately £78 million in 2014.
on march 31, 2016, the company acquired, primarily within the life sciences solutions segment, affymetrix, inc., a north america-based provider of cellular and genetic analysis products, for a total purchase price of $1.34 billion, net of cash acquired, including the assumption of $254 million of debt. the acquisition expanded the company's existing portfolio of antibodies and assays for flow cytometry and single-cell biology applications. additionally, the acquisition expanded the company's genetic analysis portfolio through the addition of microarrays. revenues of affymetrix were $360 million in 2015.
on september 19, 2016, the company acquired, within the analytical instruments segment, fei company, a north america-based provider of high-performance electron microscopy, for a total purchase price of $4.08 billion, net of cash acquired. the acquisition strengthened the company's analytical instrument portfolio with the addition of high-end electron microscopes. revenues of fei were $930 million in 2015.
on february 14, 2017, the company acquired, within the life sciences solutions segment, finesse solutions, inc., a north america-based developer of scalable control automation systems and software for bioproduction, for a total purchase price of $221 million, net of cash acquired. the acquisition expanded the company's bioproduction offerings. revenues of finesse solutions were approximately $50 million in 2016.
on march 2, 2017, the company acquired, within the analytical instruments segment, core informatics, a north america-based provider of cloud-based platforms supporting scientific data management, for a total purchase price of $94 million, net of cash acquired. the acquisition enhanced the company's existing informatics solutions. revenues of core informatics were approximately $10 million in 2016.
on august 29, 2017, the company acquired, within the laboratory products and services segment, substantially all of the issued and outstanding shares of patheon n.v., a leading global provider of high-quality drug development and delivery solutions to the pharmaceutical and biopharma sectors, for $35.00 per share in cash, or $7.36 billion, including the assumption of net debt. the company financed the purchase price, including the repayment of indebtedness of patheon, with issuances of debt and equity.
patheon provides comprehensive, integrated and highly customizable solutions as well as the expertise to help biopharmaceutical companies of all sizes satisfy complex development and manufacturing needs. the acquisition provided entry into the pharmaceutical contract development and manufacturing organization market and added a complementary service to the company's existing pharmaceutical services portfolio. patheon's revenues totaled $1.87 billion for the year ended october 31, 2016.
management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview of results of operations and liquidity
laboratory products and services          7,825            37.4    %          6,724            36.8    %
sales in 2017 were $20.92 billion, an increase of $2.64 billion from 2016. sales increased $1.63 billion due to acquisitions. the favorable effects of currency translation resulted in an increase in revenues of $70 million in 2017. aside from the effects of acquisitions and currency translation, revenues increased $949 million (5%) primarily due to increased demand. sales to customers in each of the company's primary end markets grew. sales growth was moderate in north america and europe and particularly strong in asia.
in 2017, total company operating income and operating income margin were $2.97 billion and 14.2%, respectively, compared with $2.45 billion and 13.4%, respectively, in 2016. the increase in operating income was primarily due to profit on higher sales in local currencies, the effects of acquisitions and productivity improvements, net of inflationary cost increases, offset in part by an increase in amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, due to recent acquisitions, and strategic growth investments. the company's references to strategic growth investments generally refer to targeted spending for enhancing commercial capabilities, including expansion of geographic sales reach and e-commerce platforms, marketing initiatives, focused research projects and other expenditures to enhance the customer experience. the company's references throughout this discussion to productivity improvements generally refer to improved cost efficiencies from its practical process improvement (ppi) business system, reduced costs resulting from global sourcing initiatives, a lower cost structure following restructuring actions, including headcount reductions and consolidation of facilities, and low cost region manufacturing.
the increase in our effective tax rate in 2017 was principally due to a net provision of $204 million from the effects of the tax cuts and jobs act of 2017 (the tax act), consisting primarily of a one-time transition tax on deemed repatriated earnings and profits of foreign subsidiaries, net of a benefit from adjusting the deferred tax balances for the u.s. statutory tax rate reduction. although the net $204 million charge represents what the company believes is a reasonable estimate of the impact of the tax act, the components of the net charge are provisional and may change as discussed in note 7. in 2017, the company refinanced certain long term inter-company debt which resulted in an income tax benefit of $237 million related to a foreign exchange loss recognized for income tax purposes. in addition, in 2017 the company recorded a $65 million favorable adjustment to deferred tax balances due to extension of a tax holiday agreement in singapore and $65 million of benefit associated with new required accounting for tax benefits from equity awards, as discussed in note 1. the company continued to implement tax planning initiatives related to non-u.s. subsidiaries in 2017. these non-u.s. subsidiaries incurred foreign tax obligations, and made cash and deemed distributions to the company's u.s. operations which resulted in no net tax cost. as a result of these distributions, the company benefitted from u.s. foreign tax credits of $86 million, offset in part by additional u.s. income taxes of $53 million on the related foreign income (which reduced the benefit from the foreign rate differential in 2017) for a net benefit of $33 million. the foreign tax credits are the result of foreign earnings and profits remitted or deemed remitted to the u.s. during the reporting year and the u.s. treatment of taxes paid in the foreign jurisdictions in the years those profits were originally earned. the company intends to make similar types of distributions from non-u.s. subsidiaries when they can be made at no net tax cost. the ability of the company to make distributions in future periods of similar type and magnitude will depend on the level of earnings and cash flow in various foreign jurisdictions and on the applicable tax laws in effect at that time. accordingly, the impact of foreign tax credits on the company's effective tax rate in future periods is likely to vary. the company also implemented foreign tax credit planning in sweden which resulted in $20 million of foreign tax credits, with no related incremental u.s. income tax expense.
the company recorded a benefit from income taxes in 2016. in 2016, the company continued to implement tax planning initiatives related to non-u.s. subsidiaries. these non-u.s. subsidiaries incurred foreign tax obligations, and made cash and deemed distributions to the company's u.s. operations which resulted in no net tax cost. as a result of these distributions, the company benefitted from u.s. foreign tax credits of $91 million, offset in part by additional u.s. taxes of $37 million on the related foreign income (which reduced the benefit from the foreign rate differential in 2016) for a net benefit of $54 million.
management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview of results of operations and liquidity (continued)
the company also implemented foreign tax credit planning in sweden which resulted in $100 million of foreign tax credits, with no related incremental u.s. income tax expense. in addition, the company recorded discrete benefits in 2016 totaling $39 million related to prior year tax filings and net charges of $12 million related to tax audits.
the effective tax rate in both 2017 and 2016 was also affected by relatively significant earnings in lower tax jurisdictions. due primarily to the non-deductibility of intangible asset amortization for tax purposes, the company's cash payments for income taxes were higher than its income tax expense for financial reporting purposes and totaled $479 million and $663 million in 2017 and 2016, respectively.
the company expects its effective tax rate in 2018 will be between 6% and 9% based on currently forecasted rates of profitability in the countries in which the company conducts business and expected generation of foreign tax credits. the effective tax rate can vary significantly from period to period as a result of discrete income tax factors and events.
income from continuing operations increased to $2.23 billion in 2017, from $2.03 billion in 2016. the increase in operating income in 2017 (discussed above) was offset in part by an increase in interest expense of $123 million primarily due to increases in outstanding debt to fund acquisitions and the increase in the tax provision in 2017 (discussed above).
during 2017, the company's cash flow from operations totaled $4.01 billion compared with $3.26 billion for 2016. the increase primarily resulted from higher income before amortization and depreciation in the 2017 period and lower investment in working capital in 2017.
as of december 31, 2017, the company's short-term debt totaled $2.14 billion, including $0.96 billion of commercial paper obligations and $1.17 billion of senior notes due within the next twelve months. the company has a revolving credit facility with a bank group that provides up to $2.50 billion of unsecured multi-currency revolving credit. if the company borrows under this facility, it intends to leave undrawn an amount equivalent to outstanding commercial paper to provide a source of funds in the event that commercial paper markets are not available. as of december 31, 2017, no borrowings were outstanding under the company's revolving credit facility, although available capacity was reduced by approximately $77 million as a result of outstanding letters of credit.
the company believes that its existing cash and cash equivalents of $1.34 billion as of december 31, 2017 and its future cash flow from operations together with available borrowing capacity under its revolving credit agreement will be sufficient to meet the cash requirements of its existing businesses for the foreseeable future, including at least the next 24 months.
critical accounting policies and estimates the company's discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations is based upon its financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america. the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses and related disclosure of contingent liabilities. on an on-going basis, management evaluates its estimates, including those related to bad debts, inventories, business combinations, intangible assets and goodwill, sales returns, income taxes, contingencies and litigation, and pension costs. management believes the most complex and sensitive judgments, because of their significance to the consolidated financial statements, result primarily from the need to make estimates about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain. management bases its estimates on historical experience, current market and economic conditions and other assumptions that management believes are reasonable. the results of these estimates form the basis for judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities where the values are not readily apparent from other sources. actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
the company believes the following represent its critical accounting policies and estimates used in the preparation of its financial statements:
(a)   intangible assets and goodwill the company uses assumptions and estimates in determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination. the determination of the fair value of intangible assets, which represent a significant portion of the purchase price in many of the company's acquisitions, requires the use of significant judgment with regard to (i) the fair value; and (ii) whether such intangibles are amortizable or non-amortizable and, if the former, the period and the method by which the intangible asset will be amortized. the company estimates the fair value of acquisition-related intangible assets principally based on projections of cash flows that will arise from identifiable intangible assets of acquired businesses. the projected cash flows are discounted to determine the present value of the assets at
management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies and estimates (continued)
the dates of acquisition. definite-lived intangible assets totaled $15.41 billion at december 31, 2017. the company reviews definite-lived intangible assets for impairment when indication of potential impairment exists, such as a significant reduction in cash flows associated with the assets. actual cash flows arising from a particular intangible asset could vary from projected cash flows which could imply different carrying values from those established at the dates of acquisition and which could result in impairment of such asset.
the company evaluates goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment annually and when events occur or circumstances change that would more-likely-than-not reduce the fair value of the asset below its carrying amount. events or circumstances that might require an interim evaluation include unexpected adverse business conditions, economic factors, unanticipated technological changes or competitive activities, loss of key personnel and acts by governments and courts. goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets totaled $25.29 billion and $1.27 billion, respectively, at december 31, 2017. estimates of future cash flows require assumptions related to revenue and operating income growth, asset-related expenditures, working capital levels and other factors. different assumptions from those made in the company's analysis could materially affect projected cash flows and the company's evaluation of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment.
for reporting units where the company performed the quantitative goodwill impairment test, indications of fair value based on projections of profitability for 2018 and thereafter and on peer revenues and earnings trading multiples were sufficient to conclude that no impairment of goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible assets existed at the end of the tenth fiscal month of 2017, the date of the company's impairment testing. there can be no assurance, however, that an economic downturn will not materially adversely affect peer trading multiples and the company's businesses such that they do not achieve their forecasted profitability and these assets become impaired. should the fair value of the company's goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible assets decline because of reduced operating performance, market declines, or other indicators of impairment, or as a result of changes in the discount rate, charges for impairment may be necessary.
with the completion of the patheon acquisition in august 2017, the company established a new reporting unit which solely consists of the legacy patheon business, the book carrying value of which equaled its fair value as of the acquisition date. during its annual 2017 goodwill impairment assessment, the company performed a qualitative assessment of this reporting unit and determined that no events had occurred and no circumstances had changed that would more-likely-than-not reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying amount. as a result, the company did not perform the quantitative goodwill impairment test for this reporting unit. given that the fair value of the reporting unit was not substantially in excess of its carrying value as of the annual 2017 assessment date, relatively small decreases in future cash flows from anticipated results could result in impairment of goodwill. the key variables that will drive the cash flows of the reporting unit will be levels of profitability and terminal value growth rate assumptions, as well as the weighted average cost of capital rate applied. the business unit consisting of the legacy patheon business had $3.25 billion of goodwill, and an overall carrying value of $7.33 billion as of december 31, 2017.
(b)   income taxes in the ordinary course of business there is inherent uncertainty in quantifying the company's income tax positions. the company assesses income tax positions and records tax benefits for all years subject to examination based upon management's evaluation of the facts, circumstances and information available at the reporting date. for those tax positions where it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained, the company has recorded the largest amount of tax benefit with a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information. for those income tax positions where it is not more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained, no tax benefit has been recognized in the financial statements. should tax return positions that the company expects are sustainable not be sustained upon audit, the company could be required to record an incremental tax provision for such taxes. the company's reserve for these matters totaled $1.41 billion at december 31, 2017.
the company operates in numerous countries under many legal forms and, as a result, is subject to the jurisdiction of numerous domestic and non-u.s. tax authorities, as well as to tax agreements and treaties among these governments. determination of taxable income in any jurisdiction requires the interpretation of the related tax laws and regulations and the use of estimates and assumptions regarding significant future events, such as the amount, timing and character of deductions, permissible revenue recognition methods under the tax law and the sources and character of income and tax credits. changes in tax laws, regulations, agreements and treaties, currency exchange restrictions or the company's
management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies and estimates (continued)
level of operations or profitability in each taxing jurisdiction could have an impact upon the amount of current and deferred tax balances and hence the company's net income.
the company estimates the degree to which tax assets and loss carryforwards will result in a benefit, after consideration of all positive and negative evidence, and provides a valuation allowance for tax assets and loss carryforwards that it believes will more likely than not go unused. in situations in which the company has been able to conclude that its deferred tax assets will be realized, it has generally relied on future reversals of taxable temporary differences, expected future taxable income where such estimates have historically been reliable, and other factors. if it becomes more likely than not that a tax asset or loss carryforward will be used, the company reverses the related valuation allowance. any such reversals are recorded as a reduction of the company's tax provision. the company's tax valuation allowance totaled $256 million at december 31, 2017. should the company's actual future taxable income by tax jurisdiction vary from estimates, additional allowances or reversals thereof may be necessary.
the company has not provided state income or foreign withholding taxes on certain of its non-u.s. subsidiaries' undistributed earnings, as such amounts are intended to be reinvested outside the united states indefinitely in the respective jurisdictions based on specific business plans and tax strategies. these business plans and tax strategies consider: short-term and long-term forecasts and budgets of the u.s. parent and non-u.s. subsidiaries; working capital and other needs in locations where earnings are generated; the company's past practices regarding non-u.s. subsidiary dividends; sources of financing by the u.s. parent, such as issuing debt or equity; and uses of cash by the u.s. parent that are more discretionary in nature, such as business combinations and share repurchase programs. however, should the company change its business plans and tax strategies in the future and decide to repatriate a portion of these earnings to one of its u.s. subsidiaries, including cash maintained by these non-u.s. subsidiaries, the company would recognize additional u.s. tax liabilities. it is not practicable to estimate the amount of additional state and foreign withholding tax liabilities that the company would incur.
(c)   contingencies and litigation the company records accruals for various contingencies, including legal proceedings, environmental, workers' compensation, product, general and auto liabilities, and other claims that arise in the normal course of business. the accruals are based on management's judgment, historical claims experience, the probability of losses and, where applicable, the consideration of opinions of internal and or external legal counsel and actuarial estimates. accruals of acquired businesses, including product liability and environmental accruals, were initially recorded at fair value and discounted to their net present value. additionally, the company records receivables from third-party insurers when recovery has been determined to be probable.
(d)   pension and other retiree benefits several of the company's u.s. and non-u.s. subsidiaries sponsor defined benefit pension and other retiree benefit plans. the cost and obligations of these arrangements are calculated using many assumptions to estimate the benefits that the employee earns while working, the amount of which cannot be completely determined until the benefit payments cease. major assumptions used in the accounting for these employee benefit plans include the discount rate, expected return on plan assets and rate of increase in employee compensation levels. assumptions are determined based on company data and appropriate market indicators in consultation with third-party actuaries, and are evaluated each year as of the plans' measurement date. net periodic pension costs for the company's pension and other postretirement benefit plans totaled $25 million in 2017. the company's unfunded benefit obligation totaled $486 million at year-end 2017 compared with $610 million at year-end 2016. should any of these assumptions change, they would have an effect on net periodic pension costs and the unfunded benefit obligation. for example, a 10% decrease in the discount rate would result in an annual increase in pension and other postretirement benefit expense of approximately $2 million and an increase in the benefit obligation of approximately $95 million.
as of december 31, 2017, the company expects to contribute between $35 and $65 million to its existing defined benefit pension plans in 2018.

sales in 2017 were $20.92 billion, an increase of $2.64 billion from 2016. sales increased $1.63 billion due to acquisitions. the favorable effects of currency translation resulted in an increase in revenues of $70 million in 2017. aside from the effects of acquisitions and currency translation, revenues increased $949 million (5%) primarily due to increased demand. sales to customers in each of the company's primary end markets grew. sales growth was moderate in north america and europe and particularly strong in asia.
in 2017, total company operating income and operating income margin were $2.97 billion and 14.2%, respectively, compared with $2.45 billion and 13.4%, respectively, in 2016. the increase in operating income was primarily due to profit on higher sales in local currencies, the effects of acquisitions and productivity improvements, net of inflationary cost increases, offset in part by an increase in amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, due to recent acquisitions, and strategic growth investments.
in 2017, the company recorded restructuring and other costs, net, of $298 million, including $123 million of charges to cost of revenues primarily for the sale of inventories revalued at the date of acquisition, and, to a lesser extent, to conform the accounting policies of patheon to the company's accounting policies. the company recorded $78 million of charges to selling, general and administrative expenses, primarily for third-party transaction and integration costs associated with recent acquisitions and changes in estimates of acquisition contingent consideration. in addition, the company recorded $97 million of cash restructuring costs, primarily to achieve acquisition synergies, including severance and abandoned facilities costs associated with the closure and consolidation of facilities in the u.s and europe. the company's other businesses incurred costs for continued headcount reductions and facility consolidations in an effort to streamline operations including severance at several businesses and abandoned facility expenses at businesses that have been or are being consolidated in the u.s., europe and asia. the company also recorded $27 million of net credits for litigation-related matters, which were mostly offset by compensation due at patheon on the date of the acquisition, hurricane response/impairment costs, and net charges for the settlement/curtailment of retirement plans (see note 14).
in 2016, the company recorded restructuring and other costs, net, of $395 million, including $102 million of charges to cost of revenues for the sale of inventories revalued at the date of acquisition and to conform the accounting policies of fei and affymetrix to the company's accounting policies; $104 million of charges to selling, general and administrative expenses primarily for third-party transaction and integration costs related to the acquisitions of fei and affymetrix. in addition, the company recorded $164 million of cash restructuring costs, primarily to achieve acquisition synergies, including severance and abandoned facilities costs associated with the closure and consolidation of facilities in the u.s. the company's other businesses incurred costs for continued headcount reductions and facility consolidations in an effort to streamline operations, including severance at several businesses and abandoned facility expenses at businesses that have been or are being consolidated in the u.s., europe and asia. the company also recorded charges for litigation and environmental remediation matters. these costs were partially offset by gains on the sales of real estate.
as of february 28, 2018, the company has identified restructuring actions that will result in additional charges of approximately $105 million, primarily in 2018, and expects to identify additional actions during 2018 which will be recorded when specified criteria are met, such as communication of benefit arrangements and abandonment of leased facilities. approximately 35% of the additional charges will be incurred in the life sciences solutions segment, 25% in the analytical
management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations (continued)
instruments segment, 30% in the laboratory products and services segment, and 10% in the specialty diagnostics segment. the restructuring projects for which charges were incurred in 2017 are expected to result in annual cost savings of approximately $90 million beginning in part in 2017 and, to a greater extent, in 2018, including $50 million in the life sciences solutions segment, $20 million in the analytical instruments segment, $10 million in the specialty diagnostics segment and $10 million in the laboratory products and services segment. the restructuring actions for which charges were incurred in 2016 resulted in annual cost savings of approximately $100 million beginning in part in 2016 and to a greater extent in 2017, including $60 million in the life sciences solutions segment, $25 million in the analytical instruments segment, $5 million in the specialty diagnostics segment and $10 million in the laboratory products and services segment.
segment results the company's management evaluates segment operating performance using operating income before certain charges/credits to cost of revenues and selling, general and administrative expenses, principally associated with acquisition-related activities; restructuring and other costs/income including costs arising from facility consolidations such as severance and abandoned lease expense and gains and losses from the sale of real estate and product lines; and amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets. the company uses this measure because it helps management understand and evaluate the segments' core operating results and facilitate comparison of performance for determining compensation (note 3). accordingly, the following segment data is reported on this basis.

operating income margin            33.1   %            30.0   %      3.1 pt sales in the life sciences solutions segment increased $411 million to $5.73 billion in 2017. sales increased $300 million (6%) due to higher revenues at existing businesses, $99 million due to acquisitions and $12 million due to the favorable effects of currency translation. the increase in revenue at existing businesses was primarily due to increased demand for biosciences products and, to a lesser extent, bioprocess production products as well as genetic sciences products.
operating income margin was 33.1% in 2017 compared to 30.0% in 2016. the increase in operating margin resulted primarily from productivity improvements, net of inflationary cost increases, and, to a lesser extent, profit on higher sales in local currencies and price increases. these increases were offset in part by strategic growth investments and acquisition dilution.

operating income margin was 12.9% in 2017 compared to 14.4% in 2016. the decrease was primarily due to unfavorable sales mix and strategic growth investments offset in part by profit on higher sales in local currencies and, to a lesser extent, the effect of acquisitions.
other expense, net the company reported other expense, net, of $539 million and $425 million in 2017 and 2016, respectively (note 4). interest expense increased $123 million primarily due to an increase in outstanding debt.
provision for income taxes the increase in our effective tax rate in 2017 was principally due to a net provision of $204 million from the effects of the tax cuts and jobs act of 2017, consisting primarily of a one-time transition tax on deemed repatriated earnings and profits of foreign subsidiaries, net of a benefit from adjusting the deferred tax balances for the u.s. statutory tax rate reduction. although the net $204 million charge represents what the company believes is a reasonable estimate of the impact of the tax act, the components of the net charge are provisional and may change as discussed in note 7. in 2017, the company refinanced certain long term inter-company debt which resulted in an income tax benefit of $237 million related to a foreign exchange loss recognized for income tax purposes. in addition, in 2017 the company recorded a $65 million favorable adjustment to deferred tax balances due to extension of a tax holiday agreement in singapore and $65 million of benefit associated with new required accounting for tax benefits from equity awards, as discussed in note 1. the company continued to implement tax planning initiatives related to non-u.s. subsidiaries in 2017. these non-u.s. subsidiaries incurred foreign tax obligations, and made cash and deemed distributions to the company's u.s. operations which resulted in no net tax cost. as a result of these distributions, the company benefitted from u.s. foreign tax credits of $86 million, offset in part by additional u.s. income taxes of $53 million on the related foreign income (which reduced the benefit from the foreign rate differential in 2017) for a net benefit of $33 million. the foreign tax credits are the result of foreign earnings and profits remitted or deemed remitted to the u.s. during the reporting year and the u.s. treatment of taxes paid in the foreign jurisdictions in the years those profits were originally earned. the company intends to make similar types of distributions from non-u.s. subsidiaries when they can be made at no net tax cost. the ability of the company to make distributions in future periods of similar type and magnitude will depend on the level of earnings and cash flow in various foreign jurisdictions and on the applicable tax laws in effect at that time. accordingly, the impact of foreign tax credits on the company's effective tax rate in future periods is likely to vary. the company also implemented foreign tax credit planning in sweden which resulted in $20 million of foreign tax credits, with no related incremental u.s. income tax expense.
the company recorded a benefit from income taxes in 2016. in 2016, the company continued to implement tax planning initiatives related to non-u.s. subsidiaries. these non-u.s. subsidiaries incurred foreign tax obligations, and made cash and deemed distributions to the company's u.s. operations which resulted in no net tax cost. as a result of these distributions, the company benefitted from u.s. foreign tax credits of $91 million, offset in part by additional u.s. taxes of $37 million on the related foreign income (which reduced the benefit from the foreign rate differential in 2016) for a net benefit of $54 million. the company also implemented foreign tax credit planning in sweden which resulted in $100 million of foreign tax credits, with no related incremental u.s. income tax expense. in addition, the company recorded discrete benefits in 2016 totaling $39 million related to prior year tax filings and net charges of $12 million related to tax audits.
the effective tax rate in both 2017 and 2016 was also affected by relatively significant earnings in lower tax jurisdictions. due primarily to the non-deductibility of intangible asset amortization for tax purposes, the company's cash payments for
management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations (continued)
income taxes were higher than its income tax expense for financial reporting purposes and totaled $479 million and $663 million in 2017 and 2016, respectively.
the company expects its effective tax rate in 2018 will be between 6% and 9% based on currently forecasted rates of profitability in the countries in which the company conducts business and expected generation of foreign tax credits. the effective tax rate can vary significantly from period to period as a result of discrete income tax factors and events.
the company has operations and a taxable presence in approximately 50 countries outside the u.s. some of these countries have lower tax rates than the u.s. the company's ability to obtain a benefit from lower tax rates outside the u.s. is dependent on its relative levels of income in countries outside the u.s. and on the statutory tax rates in those countries. based on the dispersion of the company's non-u.s. income tax provision among many countries, the company believes that a change in the statutory tax rate in any individual country is not likely to materially affect the company's income tax provision or net income, aside from any resulting one-time adjustment to the company's deferred tax balances to reflect a new rate.

sales in 2016 were $18.27 billion, an increase of $1.31 billion from 2015. the unfavorable effects of currency translation resulted in a decrease in revenues of $145 million in 2016. sales increased $733 million due to acquisitions. aside from the effects of currency translation and acquisitions, revenues increased $721 million (4%) primarily due to increased demand. sales to customers in the company's primary end markets grew. demand from customers in pharmaceutical and biotech industries was particularly strong. sales growth was strong in asia, moderate in europe and modest in north america.
in 2016, total company operating income and operating income margin were $2.45 billion and 13.4%, respectively, compared with $2.34 billion and 13.8%, respectively, in 2015. the increase in operating income was primarily due to profit on higher sales in local currencies, productivity improvements, net of inflationary cost increases, and, to a lesser extent, acquisitions. these increases were offset in part by higher restructuring and acquisition-related charges in the 2016 period, strategic growth investments and unfavorable sales mix.
in 2016, the company recorded restructuring and other costs, net, of $395 million, including $102 million of charges to cost of revenues for the sale of inventories revalued at the date of acquisition and to conform the accounting policies of fei and affymetrix to the company's accounting policies; $104 million of charges to selling, general and administrative expenses primarily for third-party transaction and integration costs related to the acquisitions of fei and affymetrix. in addition, the company recorded $164 million of cash restructuring costs, primarily to achieve acquisition synergies, including severance and

abandoned facilities costs associated with the closure and consolidation of facilities in the u.s. the company's other businesses incurred costs for continued headcount reductions and facility consolidations in an effort to streamline operations, including severance at several businesses and abandoned facility expenses at businesses that have been or are being consolidated in the u.s., europe and asia (see note 14). the company also recorded charges for litigation and environmental remediation matters. these costs were partially offset by gains on the sales of real estate.
in 2015, the company recorded restructuring and other costs, net, of $171 million, including $9 million of charges to cost of revenues for the sale of inventories revalued at the date of acquisition and, to a lesser extent, accelerated depreciation at facilities closing due to real estate consolidation; $46 million of charges to selling, general and administrative expenses primarily for charges associated with product liability litigation, third-party transaction and integration costs primarily related to the acquisitions of life technologies and alfa aesar, and accelerated depreciation at facilities closing due to real estate consolidation. in addition, the company recorded $82 million of cash restructuring costs primarily for actions to achieve synergies from the life technologies acquisition and for abandoned facilities costs associated with a manufacturing facility in the u.s. the company's other businesses incurred costs for continued headcount reductions and facility consolidations in an effort to streamline operations, including severance at several businesses and abandoned facility expenses at businesses that have been or are being consolidated, including the consolidation of operations within several facilities in the u.s., europe and asia. the company also recorded charges for litigation-related matters associated with acquired businesses and impairment of acquired technology in development. these costs were partially offset by gains on the sale of a small product line and real estate.
the restructuring actions for which charges were incurred in 2015 resulted in annual cost savings of approximately $100 million beginning in part in 2015 and to a greater extent in 2016, including $50 million in the life sciences solutions segment, $25 million in the analytical instruments segment, $10 million in the specialty diagnostics segment and $15 million in the laboratory products and services segment.

other expense, net the company reported other expense, net, of $425 million and $400 million in 2016 and 2015, respectively (note 4). interest expense increased $55 million primarily due to an increase in outstanding debt. in 2016, other items, net includes $22 million of charges related to the amortization of fees paid to obtain bridge financing commitments for the acquisition of fei and $9 million of losses on the early extinguishment of debt, offset in part by $12.5 million of gains on investments. in 2015, other items, net includes losses of $12 million on the early extinguishment of debt and costs of $7.5 million associated with entering into interest rate swap arrangements.
provision for income taxes the company recorded a benefit from income taxes in 2016. in 2016, the company continued to implement tax planning initiatives related to non-u.s. subsidiaries. these non-u.s. subsidiaries incurred foreign tax obligations, and made cash and deemed distributions to the company's u.s. operations which resulted in no net tax cost. as a result of these distributions, the company benefitted from u.s. foreign tax credits of $91 million, offset in part by additional u.s. taxes of $37 million on the related foreign income (which reduced the benefit from the foreign rate differential in 2016) for a net benefit of $54 million. the company also implemented foreign tax credit planning in sweden which resulted in $100 million of foreign tax credits, with no related incremental u.s. income tax expense. in addition, the company recorded discrete benefits in 2016 totaling $39 million related to prior year tax filings and net charges of $12 million related to tax audits.
the company recorded a benefit from income taxes in 2015. in 2015, the company implemented tax planning initiatives related to non-u.s. subsidiaries. these non-u.s. subsidiaries incurred foreign tax obligations, and made cash and deemed distributions to the company's u.s. operations which resulted in no net tax cost. as a result of these distributions, the company benefitted from u.s. foreign tax credits of $111 million, offset in part by additional u.s. taxes of $46 million on the related foreign income (which reduced the benefit from the foreign rate differential in 2015) for a net benefit of $66 million. the foreign tax credits are the result of foreign earnings and profits remitted or deemed remitted to the u.s. during the reporting year and the u.s. treatment of taxes paid in the foreign jurisdictions in the years those profits were originally earned. the company also implemented foreign tax credit planning in sweden which resulted in $80 million of foreign tax credits, with no related incremental u.s. income tax expense. in addition, the company recorded discrete benefits totaling $54 million related to additional prior year foreign tax and other credits as well as restructuring and other costs associated with the 2014 acquisition of life technologies. the tax provision in the 2015 period was favorably affected by $37 million as a result of adjustments to deferred tax balances due to changes in tax rates. the effective tax rate in both 2016 and 2015 was also affected by relatively significant earnings in lower tax jurisdictions. due primarily to the non-deductibility of intangible asset amortization for tax purposes, the company's cash payments for income taxes were higher than its income tax expense for financial reporting purposes and totaled $663 million and $477 million in 2016 and 2015, respectively.
management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources consolidated working capital was $2.37 billion at december 31, 2017, compared with $2.16 billion at december 31, 2016. included in working capital were cash and cash equivalents of $1.34 billion at december 31, 2017 and $786 million at december 31, 2016.
cash provided by operating activities was $4.01 billion during 2017. an increase in other liabilities provided cash of $1.02 billion primarily due to the tax act's one-time transition tax on deemed repatriated earnings and profits of foreign subsidiaries. given the availability of foreign tax credits, the company does not expect the transition tax to result in significant cash requirements. an increase in accounts payable provided cash of $274 million due to the timing of payments. increases in accounts receivable and inventories used cash of $362 million and $81 million, respectively, primarily to support growth in sales in local currencies. an increase in other assets used cash of $153 million primarily due to the timing of income tax refunds. cash payments for income taxes decreased to $479 million during 2017, compared with $663 million in 2016. the company made cash contributions to its pension and postretirement benefit plans totaling $200 million during 2017. payments for restructuring actions, principally severance costs and lease and other expenses of real estate consolidation, used cash of $93 million during 2017.
during 2017, the company's investing activities used $7.73 billion of cash. acquisitions used cash of $7.23 billion. the company's investing activities also included the purchase of $508 million of property, plant and equipment.
the company's financing activities provided $3.85 billion of cash during 2017. issuance of senior notes and borrowings under a term loan provided cash of $6.46 billion. the company also issued 10 million shares of its common stock for net proceeds of $1.69 billion. repayment of senior notes and term loans used cash of $3.30 billion and a net decrease in commercial paper obligations used cash of $134 million. the company's financing activities also included the repurchase of $750 million of the company's common stock and the payment of $237 million in cash dividends, offset in part by $128 million of net proceeds from employee stock option exercises. on july 7, 2016, the board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to $1.50 billion of the company's common stock. at february 28, 2018, $500 million was available for future repurchases of the company's common stock under this authorization. in january 2018, the company issued additional commercial paper obligations and used the proceeds and cash on hand to repay the $450 million principal balance of the 2.15% senior notes due 2018.
as of december 31, 2017, the company's short-term debt totaled $2.14 billion, including $960 million of commercial paper obligations and $1.17 billion of senior notes due within the next twelve months. the company has a revolving credit facility with a bank group that provides up to $2.50 billion of unsecured multi-currency revolving credit. if the company borrows under this facility, it intends to leave undrawn an amount equivalent to outstanding commercial paper to provide a source of funds in the event that commercial paper markets are not available. as of december 31, 2017, no borrowings were outstanding under the company's revolving credit facility, although available capacity was reduced by approximately $77 million as a result of outstanding letters of credit.
approximately half of the company's cash balances and cash flows from operations are from outside the u.s. a portion of these foreign cash balances are associated with earnings that are permanently reinvested and which the company plans to use to support continued growth plans outside of the u.s. through funding operations and other investment and growth opportunities. the majority of these funds are only available for use by the company's u.s. operations if they are repatriated into the u.s. the funds repatriated would be subject to additional state and foreign withholding taxes upon repatriation; however, it is not practicable to estimate the amount of additional tax liabilities that would be incurred. the company currently has no plans to repatriate these funds held by its non-u.s. subsidiaries.
the company believes that its existing cash and cash equivalents of $1.34 billion as of december 31, 2017 and its future cash flow from operations together with available borrowing capacity under its revolving credit agreement will be sufficient to meet the cash requirements of its existing businesses for the foreseeable future, including at least the next 24 months.
cash provided by operating activities was $3.26 billion during 2016. an increase in accounts receivable used cash of $352 million primarily to support growth in sales in local currencies and due to the mid-month timing of the acquisition of fei when receivables are commonly lower than at quarter-end. inventories provided cash of $98 million due to a reduction associated with fourth quarter 2016 sales. an increase in other assets used cash of $153 million primarily due to the timing of payments. an increase in other liabilities provided cash of $216 million primarily due to the timing of payments for income taxes and

(b)   unconditional purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods, services or fixed assets that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. purchase obligations exclude agreements that are cancelable at any time without penalty.
reserves for unrecognized tax benefits of $1.41 billion have not been included in the above table due to the inability to predict the timing of tax audit resolutions.
the company has no material commitments for purchases of property, plant and equipment, other than those included in the above table, but expects that for 2018, such expenditures will be between $700 and $730 million.
guarantees of residual value under lease arrangements for three facilities have not been included in the above table due to the inability to predict if and when the guarantees may require payment (see note 10). the residual value guarantees become operative at the end of the leases for up to a maximum of $155 million. the initial terms of these leases end in 2019, 2020 and 2022, although renewal options exist for each.
a guarantee of pension plan obligations of a divested business has not been included in the preceding table due to the inability to predict if and when the guarantee may require payment. the purchaser of the divested business has agreed to pay for the pension benefits, however the company was required to guarantee payment of these pension benefits should the purchaser fail to do so. the amount of the guarantee at december 31, 2017 was $43 million.
in disposing of assets or businesses, the company often provides representations, warranties and/or indemnities to cover various risks including, for example, unknown damage to the assets, environmental risks involved in the sale of real estate, liability to investigate and remediate environmental contamination at waste facilities, and unidentified tax liabilities and related legal fees. the company does not have the ability to estimate the potential liability from such indemnities because they relate to unknown conditions. however, the company has no reason to believe that these uncertainties would have a material adverse effect on its financial position, annual results of operations or cash flows.
management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources (continued)
the company has recorded liabilities for known indemnifications included as part of environmental liabilities. see item 1. business - environmental matters for a discussion of these liabilities.

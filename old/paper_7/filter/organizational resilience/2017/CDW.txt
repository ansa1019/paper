item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations unless otherwise indicated or the context otherwise requires, as used in this "management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations," the terms "we," "us," "the company," "our," "cdw" and similar terms refer to cdw corporation and its subsidiaries. "management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations" should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this report. this discussion contains forward-looking statements that are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties. actual results may differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements. see "forward-looking statements" above.
overview cdw corporation is a fortune 500 company and a leading provider of integrated it solutions to small, medium and large business, and government, education and healthcare customers in the us, the uk and canada. our broad array of offerings ranges from discrete hardware and software products to integrated it solutions such as mobility, security, data center optimization, cloud computing, virtualization and collaboration.
we are technology "agnostic," with a product portfolio including more than 100,000 products and services from more than 1,000 leading and emerging brands. our solutions are delivered in physical, virtual and cloud-based environments through over 6,000 customer-facing coworkers, including sellers, highly-skilled technology specialists and advanced service delivery engineers. we are a leading sales channel partner for many original equipment manufacturers ("oems"), software publishers and cloud providers (collectively, our "vendor partners"), whose products we sell or include in the solutions we offer. we provide our vendor partners with a cost-effective way to reach customers and deliver a consistent brand experience through our established end-market coverage, technical expertise and extensive customer access.
in august 2015, we acquired cdw uk, which enhanced our ability to provide it solutions to us based customers with multinational locations. it also extended our footprint into the united kingdom. financial results of cdw uk are included in our consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition.
we have three reportable segments, corporate, small business and public. our corporate segment primarily serves private sector business customers with more than 250 employees. our small business segment primarily serves private sector business customers with up to 250 employees. our public segment is comprised of government agencies and education and healthcare institutions in the us. we also have two other operating segments: canada and cdw uk, each of which do not meet the reportable segment quantitative thresholds and, accordingly, are included in an all other category ("other").
we may sell all or only select products that our vendor partners offer. each vendor partner agreement provides for specific terms and conditions, which may include one or more of the following: product return privileges, price protection policies, purchase discounts and vendor incentive programs, such as purchase or sales rebates and cooperative advertising reimbursements. we also resell software for major software publishers. our agreements with software publishers allow the end-user customer to acquire
software or licensed products and services. in addition to helping our customers determine the best software solutions for their needs, we help them manage their software agreements, including warranties and renewals. a significant portion of our advertising and marketing expenses is reimbursed through cooperative advertising programs with our vendor partners. these programs are at the discretion of our vendor partners and are typically tied to sales or other commitments to be met by us within a specified period of time.
trends and key factors affecting our financial performance we believe the following trends and key factors may have an important impact on our financial performance:
•   general economic conditions are a key factor affecting our ability to generate sales and achieve our targeted operating results as they impact our customers' willingness to spend on information technology. this is particularly the case for business customers, as their purchases tend to reflect confidence in their business prospects, which are driven by their perceptions of business conditions. purchasing behavior may be different between our corporate customers and small business customers due to their perception of business conditions.
•   changes in spending policies, budget priorities and revenue levels are a key factor influencing government purchasing levels. our government results also reflect increased interest in meeting public safety needs through technology solutions by state and local customers, as well as our ability to address strategic changes made by the federal government toward a more programmatic technology strategy.
•   customer focus on security has been, and we expect will continue to be, an ongoing trend. customers are seeking solutions to protect their internal systems against threats and are implementing solutions that provide enterprise-wide visibility, detection expertise and investigation workflows. they are also implementing endpoint security, firewall segmentation and user authentication tools.
•   the healthcare industry continues to experience uncertainty given recent proposed legislative action and concerns related to funding, which is impacting healthcare spending as customers seek more clarity.
•   our education sales channel performance continues to benefit from the creation of new learning environments for students. it has also been positively affected by the implementation of networking projects related to the us federal communications commission e-rate program. within the higher education market, networking projects continue to be a key priority across campuses. while technology is an opportunity to create cost savings and improve productivity, funding is a key determinant of technology spending in education.
•   there continues to be substantial uncertainty regarding the impact of the referendum on the united kingdom's ("uk") membership of the european union ("eu"), advising for the exit of the uk from the eu (referred to as "brexit"). potential adverse consequences of brexit such as global market uncertainty, volatility in currency exchange rates, greater restrictions on imports and exports between uk and eu countries and increased regulatory complexities could have a negative impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. to date, cdw uk is not seeing significant changes in the buying behavior of its customers even with the uncertainty related to the timing and terms of brexit.
•   technology trends drive customer purchase behaviors and we are seeing continuing evolution in the market. innovation influences customer purchases across all of our customer end-markets. key trends in technology include increasing adoption of cloud-based solutions for certain key workloads, including backup and recovery, collaboration and security, as well as adoption of hyper-converged appliances to deliver greater flexibility and efficiency. in addition, hybrid it solutions are being adopted, along with software being embedded into solutions.
key business metrics we monitor a number of financial and non-financial measures and ratios on a regular basis in order to track the progress of our business and make adjustments as necessary. we believe that the most important of these measures and ratios include average daily sales, gross margin, operating margin, net income, non-gaap income before income taxes, non-gaap net income, net income per common share, non-gaap net income per diluted share, ebitda, adjusted ebitda, adjusted ebitda margin, free cash flow, return on working capital, cash and cash equivalents, net working capital, cash conversion cycle (defined to be days of sales outstanding in accounts receivable plus days of supply in inventory minus days of purchases outstanding in accounts payable, based on a rolling three-month average), debt levels including available credit and leverage ratios, sales per coworker and coworker turnover. these measures and ratios are compared to standards or objectives set by management, so that actions can be taken, as necessary, in order to achieve the standards and objectives.
in this form 10-k, we discuss non-gaap income before income taxes, non-gaap net income, non-gaap net income per diluted share, ebitda, adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda margin, which are non-gaap financial measures.
we believe these measures provide analysts, investors and management with helpful information regarding the underlying operating performance of our business, as they remove the impact of items that management believes are not reflective of underlying operating performance. management uses these measures to evaluate period-over-period performance as management believes they provide a more comparable measure of the underlying business. additionally, adjusted ebitda is a measure in the credit agreement governing our senior secured term loan facility ("term loan"), which is used to evaluate our ability to make certain investments, incur additional debt, and make restricted payments, such as dividends and share repurchases, as well as whether we are required to make additional principal prepayments on the term loan beyond the quarterly amortization payments. for further details regarding the term loan, see long-term debt and financing arrangements within management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and note 10 (long-term debt) to the accompanying consolidated financial statements. for the definitions of non-gaap income before income taxes, non-gaap net income and adjusted ebitda and reconciliations to net income, see "results of operations".
the results of certain key business metrics are as follows:
gross profit                             2,449.9                 2,327.2                 2,115.8
(2)   cash conversion cycle is defined as days of sales outstanding in accounts receivable and certain receivables due from vendors plus days of supply in merchandise inventory minus days of purchases outstanding in accounts payable and accounts payable-inventory financing, based on a rolling three-month average.

total net sales in 2017 increased $1,210 million, or 8.7%, to $15,192 million, compared to $13,982 million for the year ended december 31, 2016. net sales on a constant currency basis, which excludes the impact of currency translation, for the year ended december 31, 2017 increased $1,238 million, or 8.9%, to $15,192 million, compared to $13,954 million for the year ended december 31, 2016.
for the year ended december 31, 2017, sales growth was driven by gains in all our customer markets except healthcare, which saw a net sales decline year over year. during the year, and in contrast to 2016, we saw an acceleration of hardware sales, driven by strong growth within client device sales due to customer refresh, which impacted categories such as notebooks, mobile devices and desktops. additionally, we saw growth in several other categories, including video and networking. we also saw ongoing customer focus on designing it securely, which led to strong sales growth across our entire security portfolio and the adoption of more efficient architectures, which drove strong growth in hyper-converged infrastructure and solutions delivered via the cloud, as well as the continuing trend of greater integration of software into solutions.
corporate segment net sales in 2017 increased $457 million, or 7.8%, compared to 2016, as customer confidence improved throughout the year. growth was primarily driven by customer refresh of client devices and networking.
small business segment net sales in 2017 increased by $106 million, or 9.3%, compared to 2016. sales growth was primarily driven by customer refresh of client devices and video.
public segment net sales in 2017 increased $448 million, or 8.0%, compared to 2016. the growth was primarily driven by government and education customers. net sales to federal government customers reflected a focus on spending existing budgets on planned projects and ongoing successful alignment with strategic programs, as well as success meeting the department of defense mandated move to new client devices with stronger security features. strong net sales to our state and local government customers was driven by a continued focus on public safety and the on-going success executing against recently added contracts. net sales to our higher education customers were driven by networking and software as we continued to see the benefit from "connected campus" strategies to ensure network infrastructures can handle multiple devices used by students, faculty and visitors across the entire campus. k-12 growth was driven by success in delivering collaborative learning environments and networking. net sales to healthcare customers decreased 2.9%, reflecting continued customer uncertainty related to reimbursements and funding.
net sales in other for 2017 increased $198 million, or 14.5%, compared to 2016. other is comprised of results from our canadian and uk operations. both operations had strong growth in local currency as we continued to take share in the local markets, as well as the benefit from increased sales for referrals from us customers to the uk. the impact of foreign currency exchange decreased other sales growth by approximately 250 basis points, due to the impact resulting from the british pound to us dollar translation, partially offset by favorable translation of the canadian to us dollar.
gross profit gross profit increased $123 million, or 5.3%, to $2,450 million in 2017, compared to $2,327 million in 2016. as a percentage of net sales, gross profit decreased 50 basis points to 16.1% in 2017, down from 16.6% in 2016. although there was an increase in gross profit due to higher sales volumes, we experienced a decline in our gross profit margin. this decline was primarily driven by product margin compression due to increased hardware sales, which generally have lower profit margins, and an ongoing competitive marketplace.
gross profit margin may fluctuate based on various factors, including vendor incentive and inventory price protection programs, cooperative advertising funds classified as a reduction of cost of sales, product mix, net service contract revenue, commission revenue, pricing strategies, market conditions and other factors.
selling and administrative expenses selling and administrative expenses increased $65 million, or 4.8%, to $1,410 million in 2017, compared to $1,345 million in 2016. this was driven by higher sales payroll costs, including sales commissions, year over year, primarily due to higher gross profit, as well as higher coworker costs between years consistent with increased coworker count. total coworker count was 8,726 at december 31, 2017, up 210 from 8,516 at december 31, 2016. additionally, equity-based compensation expense and the associated payroll taxes increased $8 million, or 19.8%, during 2017 compared to 2016, primarily due to the impact of annual equity awards granted under our long-term incentive plan and the vesting of an equity grant made at the time of our initial public offering. also during 2017, a retroactive illinois state law change was enacted which required the reinstatement of unclaimed property balances, resulting in an additional $4 million of expenses. these increases were partially offset by lower senior management incentive compensation.
as a percentage of total net sales, selling and administrative expenses decreased 30 basis points to 9.3% in 2017, down from 9.6% in 2016.
income from operations income from operations by segment, in dollars and as a percentage of net sales, and the year-over-year percentage change was as follows:

(1)   segment income from operations includes the segment's direct operating income, allocations for certain headquarters' costs, allocations for income and expenses from logistics services, certain inventory adjustments and volume rebates and cooperative advertising from vendors.
(2)   amounts have been recast for 2016 to present small business as its own operating and reportable segment.
(3)   includes the financial results for our other operating segments, cdw canada and cdw uk, which do not meet the reportable segment quantitative thresholds.
income from operations was $866 million in 2017, an increase of $47 million, or 5.7%, compared to $819 million in 2016. although income from operations increased, total operating margin percentage decreased 20 basis points to 5.7% in 2017, from 5.9% in 2016. the decrease was primarily due to gross profit margin compression from higher hardware sales and an ongoing competitive marketplace. also contributing to lower operating margin percentage was the reinstatement of prior year unclaimed property balances in 2017 and the non-recurrence of the settlement payments received from the dynamic random access memory class action lawsuits in 2016. partially offsetting these decreases were lower sales payroll, consistent with our variable compensation cost structure, lower senior management incentive compensation and a decline in intangible asset amortization expense as a percentage of net sales.
corporate segment income from operations was $487 million in 2017, an increase of $33 million, or 7.4%, compared to $454 million in 2016. corporate segment operating margin remained flat at 7.7% for 2017 and 2016. although income from operations increased, primarily due to an increase in sales volume, corporate segment operating margin percentage remained flat. the flat operating margin percentage reflects higher hardware sales and an ongoing competitive marketplace, which were fully offset by lower sales payroll expenses.
small business segment income from operations was $74 million in 2017, an increase of $5 million, or 8.0%, compared to $69 million in 2016. income from operations increased due to an increase in sales volume, while operating margin remained flat at 6.0% for 2017 and 2016. the flat operating margin percentage reflects higher hardware sales and an ongoing competitive marketplace, which were fully offset by lower sales payroll expenses.
public segment income from operations was $374 million in 2017, an increase of $6 million, or 1.6%, compared to $368 million in 2016. public segment operating margin decreased 40 basis points to 6.2% in 2017, from 6.6% in 2016. this decrease in operating margin percentage was primarily driven by higher hardware sales, which were partially offset by lower sales payroll expenses.
other income from operations was $58 million in 2017, an increase of $14 million, or 32.8%, compared to $44 million in 2016. other income from operations increased primarily due to higher sales volumes and gross profit as we continue to take share in the local markets. other operating margin percentage increased 50 basis points to 3.7% in 2017, from 3.2% in 2016. this increase was primarily driven by a decline in intangible asset amortization expense as a percentage of net sales.
interest expense, net net interest expense in 2017 was $151 million, an increase of $4 million, compared to $147 million in 2016. this increase was primarily driven by mark-to-market gains recognized on our interest rate cap agreements in 2016, with no comparable activity in 2017 due to the election of hedge accounting in february 2017 and by a rising interest rate environment which resulted in higher interest expense on the term loan. this was partially offset by a reduced coupon rate due to the refinancing activity that occurred during 2017.
net loss on extinguishments of long-term debt for information regarding our debt, see note 10 (long-term debt) to the accompanying consolidated financial statements. during 2017, we recorded a net loss on extinguishments of long-term debt of $57 million compared to $2 million in 2016.
net loss on extinguishments of long-term debt are as follows:
month of extinguishment   debt instrument                                                 (in millions)
(1)   we repaid all of the remaining aggregate principal amount outstanding. the loss recognized represents the difference between the aggregate principal amount and the net carrying amount of the purchased debt, adjusted for the remaining unamortized deferred financing costs and premium.
income tax expense on december 22, 2017, the tax cuts and jobs act was enacted into law. the tax cuts and jobs act changes several aspects of us federal tax law including: reducing the us corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% beginning on january 1, 2018; establishing a territorial tax system, which includes a one-time tax on the deemed mandatory repatriation of our international operations' unremitted earnings which have not been subject to us tax; imposing a minimum us tax on foreign earnings; providing for the immediate expensing of certain qualified property; and changing the tax treatment of performance based executive compensation and certain employee fringe benefits. gaap requires the income tax effects of the tax cuts and jobs act to be accounted for in the period of enactment.
the sec issued staff accounting bulletin 118 allowing for provisional amounts to be recorded during a measurement period not to exceed one year. we recorded provisional amounts for the impact of revaluing deferred tax assets and liabilities, the deemed mandatory repatriation tax of our international operations' unremitted earnings and the state income tax effects from the change in federal tax law. we continue to analyze the income tax effects of the tax cuts and jobs act, as well as monitor guidance from the internal revenue service and the us treasury department. any additional income tax effects of the tax cuts and jobs act are expected to be recorded within the measurement period.
income tax expense was $137 million in 2017, compared to $248 million in 2016. the effective income tax rate, expressed by calculating income tax expense as a percentage of income before income taxes, was 20.8% and 36.9% for 2017 and 2016, respectively. we expect to have an effective tax rate of between 24% and 25% in 2018. the 2018 effective tax rate may change due to various factors including: adjustments we make to the estimates of the impact of the tax cuts and jobs act that were recorded as of december 31, 2017, as well as additional guidance that the internal revenue service, us treasury department and state taxing authorities may issue, changes in the estimated excess tax benefits due to the changes in the market value of our common stock and changes in the number of awards vesting and changes in state tax laws.
for 2017, the effective tax rate differed from the us federal statutory rate primarily due to a one-time benefit of $96 million to reflect the revaluation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, excess tax benefits on equity compensation and lower corporate tax rates on our international income, partially offset by state income taxes and a one-time charge of $20 million for the mandatory repatriation tax. for 2016, the effective tax rate differed from the us federal statutory rate primarily due to state income taxes and non-deductible meals and entertainment expenses, which were partially offset by lower corporate tax rates on our international income, a deferred tax benefit as a result of a tax rate reduction in the uk and excess tax benefits on equity-based compensation as a result of adopting asu 2016-09, compensation - stock compensation. the lower effective tax rate for 2017 as compared to 2016 was primarily attributable to the impact of revaluing deferred tax assets and liabilities, and excess tax benefits on equity compensation, offset by a one-time charge for the mandatory repatriation tax.
non-gaap financial measure reconciliations we have included reconciliations of non-gaap income before income taxes, non-gaap net income, ebitda, adjusted ebitda, adjusted ebitda margin and consolidated net sales growth on a constant currency basis for the years ended december 31, 2017 and 2016 below.
non-gaap income before income taxes and non-gaap net income exclude, among other things, charges related to the amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, equity-based compensation and associated taxes, gains and losses from the extinguishment of debt and integration expenses. ebitda is defined as consolidated net income before interest expense, net, income tax expense, depreciation and amortization. adjusted ebitda, which is a measure defined in our credit agreements, means ebitda adjusted for certain items which are described in the table below. adjusted ebitda margin is defined as adjusted ebitda as a percentage of net sales. consolidated net sales growth on a constant currency basis is defined as consolidated net sales growth excluding the impact of foreign currency translation on net sales compared to the prior period.
non-gaap income before income taxes, non-gaap net income, ebitda, adjusted ebitda, adjusted ebitda margin and consolidated net sales growth on a constant currency basis are considered non-gaap financial measures. generally, a non-gaap financial measure is a numerical measure of a company's performance or financial position that either excludes or includes amounts that are not normally included or excluded in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with gaap. non-gaap measures used by management may differ from similar measures used by other companies, even when similar terms are used to identify such measures.
we believe these measures provide analysts, investors and management with helpful information regarding the underlying operating performance of our business, as they remove the impact of items that management believes are not reflective of underlying operating performance. management uses these measures to evaluate period-over-period performance as management believes they provide a more comparable measure of the underlying business. additionally, adjusted ebitda is a measure in the credit agreement governing our term loan used to evaluate our ability to make certain investments, incur additional debt and make restricted payments, such as dividends and share repurchases, as well as whether we are required to make additional principal prepayments on the term loan beyond the quarterly amortization payments. for further details regarding the term loan, see note 10 (long-term debt) to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.
non-gaap income before income taxes and non-gaap net income non-gaap net income was $606 million for the year ended december 31, 2017, an increase of $37 million, or 6.5%, compared to $569 million for the year ended december 31, 2016.

total net sales in 2016 increased $993 million, or 7.6%, to $13,982 million, compared to $12,989 million in 2015, reflecting both solid organic increases and the inclusion of seven months of incremental cdw uk sales. total net sales increased 8.3% on a constant currency basis. there were five key trends that impacted our net sales growth. first, customers were seeking to optimize their infrastructure by extending asset lives or adding capacity, which led to increases in warranties and virtualization software. second, customer focus on designing it securely continued to be a major area of interest for customers, and we saw excellent increases across our entire security portfolio, including security software. we also saw our customers seeking architectures to increase the flexibility and efficiency of their it infrastructure, which drove increased adoption of cloud solutions for certain workloads, including security, as well as increased sales of hyper-converged infrastructure. fourth, we saw the on-going trend where a greater proportion of solutions are being delivered via software. with software becoming more "mission critical," customers continued to turn to software assurance to protect their investment. finally, customer demand for digital signage and video screens, as well as notebook/mobile devices, drove growth across all of our customer end-markets.
corporate segment net sales in 2016 increased $11 million, or 0.2%, year over year, as customer demand for longer tail purchases, including data center and networking solutions, was impacted by slow economic growth and market trends. corporate had strong sales performance in notebook/mobile devices and software products.
economic conditions had less of an impact on small business results, as net sales to small business customers increased by $51 million, or 4.6%, between periods, driven by growth in notebooks/mobile devices, desktops and video projection hardware.
public segment net sales in 2016 increased $406 million, or 7.8%, between years. net sales to government customers increased $163 million, or 9.6%. state and local government customers continued to focus on public safety and we benefited from new contracts. our federal channel saw low single-digit growth as the success we had meeting new strategic programs was partially offset by the impact of several large client device purchase orders that were delayed into 2017. net sales to education customers increased $199 million, or 11.0%, year over year, driven by continued success providing client devices to support digital testing and curriculums, as well as desktops and video projection hardware to support new learning environments for students. healthcare growth was 2.6% or $43 million, driven by notebooks/mobile devices, desktops, and software. patient data security continues to be a top concern. we continued to see some of our larger customers shifting priorities to reducing costs due to industry consolidation.
net sales in other, which is comprised of our canadian and cdw uk operations, increased $526 million, or 62.8%, compared to 2015. the increase in net sales was primarily driven by the impact of consolidating twelve months of cdw uk net sales in 2016 compared to consolidating five months of cdw uk results in 2015. both our canadian and uk businesses grew
high-single digits in local currency in 2016. currency was impacted by canadian dollar to us dollar translation in the first half of the year and british pound to us dollar translation in the second half.
gross profit gross profit increased $211 million, or 10.0%, to $2,327 million in 2016, compared to $2,116 million in 2015. as a percentage of net sales, gross profit increased 30 basis points to 16.6% in 2016, from 16.3% in 2015.
gross profit margin was positively impacted by a higher mix of net service contract revenue as customers looked to extend the life of equipment through warranties, protect their software investments through software assurance and adopt cloud solutions to deliver certain workloads. all of these solutions grew faster than our overall net sales. in addition, vendor partner funding positively impacted gross margin. these increases helped offset the impact from unfavorable product margin.
gross profit margin may fluctuate based on various factors, including vendor incentive and inventory price protection programs, cooperative advertising funds classified as a reduction of cost of sales, product mix, net service contract revenue, commission revenue, pricing strategies, market conditions and other factors.
selling and administrative expenses selling and administrative expenses increased $119 million, or 9.7%, to $1,345 million in 2016, compared to $1,226 million in 2015. as a percentage of total net sales, selling and administrative expenses increased 20 basis points to 9.6% in 2016, up from 9.4% in 2015. payroll costs increased $65 million, or 11.7%, year over year, primarily due to incremental coworker hires at the end of 2015, higher compensation costs consistent with increased gross profit and the inclusion of twelve months of cdw uk payroll costs in 2016 compared to five months in 2015. total coworker count was 8,516 at december 31, 2016, up 51 from 8,465 at december 31, 2015. amortization expense related to intangibles increased $18 million, or 8.8%, during 2016 compared to 2015, primarily due to incremental amortization expense related to the intangible assets arising from our acquisition of cdw uk. non-cash equity-based compensation expense increased $8 million, or 25.8%, during 2016 compared to 2015, primarily due to annual equity awards granted under our 2013 long-term incentive plan, performance against long-term incentive program targets and equity awards granted in connection with our acquisition of cdw uk.

corporate segment income from operations was $454 million in 2016, an increase of $21 million, or 4.9%, compared to $433 million in 2015. corporate segment operating margin increased 30 basis points to 7.7% in 2016, from 7.4% in 2015. this increase was primarily due to an increase in gross profit driven by a higher mix of net service contract revenue, as well as higher volume rebates, partially offset by an increase in selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales, due to higher sales payroll costs.
small business segment income from operations was $69 million in 2016, an increase of $1 million, or 0.9%, compared to 2015. small business operating margin decreased by 30 basis points to 6.0% in 2016, from 6.3% in 2015. the decrease in operating margin was primarily due to an increase in selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales, due to higher sales payroll costs.
public segment income from operations was $368 million in 2016, an increase of $39 million, or 12.0%, compared to $329 million in 2015. public segment operating margin increased 30 basis points to 6.6% in 2016, from 6.3% in 2015. this decrease was driven primarily due to an increase in net sales and gross profit driven by a higher mix of net service contract revenue, as well as higher volume rebates, partially offset by an increase in selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales, due to higher sales payroll costs.
other income from operations was $44 million in 2016, an increase of $17 million, or 60.9%, compared to $27 million in 2015. this was primarily due to the inclusion of an additional seven months of cdw uk income from operations. other operating margin percentage remained flat at 3.2% in both 2016 and 2015.
interest expense, net at december 31, 2016, our outstanding long-term debt totaled $3,234 million, compared to $3,260 million at december 31, 2015, a decrease of $26 million primarily due to principal payments on the loans. net interest expense in 2016 was $147 million, a decrease of $13 million, compared to $160 million in 2015. this decrease was primarily due to the lower effective interest rates and the lower principal loan balances for 2016 compared to 2015 as a result of redemptions and refinancing activities completed during 2016 and 2015, and the impact in 2016 of mark-to-market gains associated with our interest rate cap agreements.

gain on remeasurement of equity investment on august 1, 2015, we completed the acquisition of cdw uk by purchasing the remaining 65% of its outstanding common stock which increased our ownership interest from 35% to 100%, and provided us control. as a result, our previously held 35% equity investment was remeasured to fair value, resulting in a gain of $98 million recorded in gain on remeasurement of equity investment in the consolidated statements of operations.
income tax expense income tax expense was $248 million in 2016, compared to $244 million in 2015. the effective income tax rate, expressed by calculating income tax expense or benefit as a percentage of income before income taxes, was 36.9% and 37.7% for 2016 and 2015, respectively.
for 2016, the effective tax rate differed from the us federal statutory rate primarily due to state income taxes and non-deductible meals and entertainment expenses, which were partially offset by lower corporate tax rates on our international income, a deferred tax benefit as a result of a tax rate reduction in the uk and excess tax benefits on equity compensation as a result of adopting asu 2016-09. for 2015, the effective tax rate differed from the us federal statutory rate primarily due to state income taxes and withholding tax expense on the earnings of our canadian business as a result of no longer asserting permanent reinvestment, which was partially offset by a deferred tax benefit as a result of a tax rate reduction in the uk. the lower effective tax rate for 2016 as compared to 2015 was primarily attributable to a larger benefit in 2016 related to our international income, which is taxed at lower tax rates than our us income, excess tax benefits on equity compensation as a result of adopting asu 2016-09 in 2016 and less canadian withholding tax expense in 2016 than in 2015, partially offset by a greater deferred tax benefit related to uk tax rate reductions in 2015 than in 2016.

seasonality while we have not historically experienced significant seasonality throughout the year, sales in our corporate segment, which primarily serves private sector business customers with more than 250 employees, are typically higher in the fourth quarter than in other quarters due to customers spending their remaining technology budget dollars at the end of the year. additionally, sales in our public segment have historically been higher in the third quarter than in other quarters primarily due to the buying patterns of the federal government and education customers.
liquidity and capital resources overview we finance our operations and capital expenditures with internally generated cash from operations. we also have $996 million of availability for borrowings under our senior secured asset-based revolving credit facility and an additional £50 million ($68 million at december 31, 2017) under the cdw uk revolving credit facility. our liquidity and borrowing plans are established to align with our financial and strategic planning processes and ensure we have the necessary funding to meet our operating commitments, which primarily include the purchase of inventory, payroll and general expenses. we also take into consideration our overall capital allocation strategy, which includes investment for future growth, dividend payments, acquisitions and stock repurchases. we believe we have adequate sources of liquidity and funding available for at least the next year, however, there are a number of factors that may negatively impact our available sources of funds. the amount of cash generated from operations will be dependent upon factors such as the successful execution of our business plan and general economic conditions.
long-term debt activities on march 31, 2017, we amended, extended and increased our revolving loan to a five-year, $1.5 billion senior secured asset-based revolving credit facility, with the facility being available to us for borrowings, issuance of letters of credit and floorplan financing. in connection with the amendment of the previous facility, we recorded a loss on extinguishment of long-term debt of $1 million in the consolidated statement of operations during 2017, representing a write-off of a portion of unamortized deferred financing costs. fees of $4 million related to the revolving loan were capitalized as deferred financing costs and are being amortized over the five-year term of the facility on a straight-line basis. these deferred financing costs are recorded in other assets on the consolidated balance sheets.
on march 2, 2017, the proceeds from the issuance of the 2025 senior notes, along with cash on hand and proceeds from revolving loan borrowings, were deposited with the trustee to redeem all of the remaining $600 million aggregate principal amount of the 2022 senior notes at a redemption price of 106.182% of the principal amount redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest through the date of redemption. the redemption date was april 2, 2017. on the same date, the indenture governing the 2022 senior notes was satisfied and discharged. in connection with this redemption, we recorded a loss on extinguishment of long-term debt of $43 million in the consolidated statement of operations for 2017. this loss represents $37 million in redemption premium and $6 million for the write-off of the remaining deferred financing costs related to the 2022 senior notes.
on february 28, 2017, we amended the term loan to reprice the facility, reducing interest rate margins by 25 basis points. the term loan replaced the prior senior secured term loan facility (the "prior term loan facility") that had an outstanding aggregate principal amount of $1.5 billion. we are required to pay quarterly principal installments equal to 0.25% of the original principal amount of the prior term loan facility, with the remaining principal amount payable on the maturity date of august 17, 2023, which was retained from the prior term loan facility. in connection with this refinancing, we recorded a loss on extinguishment of long-term debt of $14 million in the consolidated statement of operations for the year ended december 31, 2017. this loss represented the write-off of a portion of the unamortized deferred financing costs of $5 million and unamortized discount related to the prior term loan facility of $9 million. in connection with the issuance of the term loan, we incurred and recorded $2 million in deferred financing fees, which are recorded as a reduction to the debt as of december 31, 2017.

share repurchase program during 2017, we repurchased 9 million shares of our common stock for $534 million under the previously announced $750 million share repurchase program. on august 3, 2017, we announced that our board of directors authorized a $750 million increase to our share repurchase program under which we may repurchase shares of our common stock in the open market or through privately negotiated or other transactions, depending on share price, market conditions and other factors. as of
december 31, 2017, we have $858 million remaining under this program. for more information on our share repurchase program, see item 5, "market for registrant's common equity, related stockholder matters and issuer purchases of equity securities."

dividends a summary of 2017 dividend activity for our common stock is as follows:
on february 7, 2018, we announced that our board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend on our common stock of $0.21 per share. the dividend will be paid on march 12, 2018 to all stockholders of record as of the close of business on february 26, 2018.
the payment of any future dividends will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend upon our results of operations, financial condition, business prospects, capital requirements, contractual restrictions, any potential indebtedness we may incur, restrictions imposed by applicable law, tax considerations and other factors that our board of directors deems relevant. in addition, our ability to pay dividends on our common stock will be limited by restrictions on our ability to pay dividends or make distributions to our stockholders and on the ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends or make distributions to us, in each case, under the terms of our current and any future agreements governing our indebtedness.

(1)   includes items such as deferred income taxes, depreciation and amortization, equity-based compensation expense, gain on remeasurement of equity method investment, loss from equity method investment and net loss on extinguishments of long-term debt.
(2)   the change in cash flows reflected stronger operating results driven by net sales growth and the impact of consolidating a full year of cdw uk financial results in 2016, compared to five months in 2015.
(3)   the change in cash flows was primarily due to an increase in collections during 2016 due to the higher accounts receivable balance as of december 31, 2015 driven by higher sales in our public segment where customers generally take longer to pay than customers in our corporate and small business segments. in addition, the lower accounts receivable balances as of december 31, 2014, driven by early payments from certain customers, resulted in lower cash flows in the prior year period.
(4)   the increase in cash flows was primarily due to the timing of inventory purchases and longer payment terms with certain vendors.
in order to manage our working capital and operating cash needs, we monitor our cash conversion cycle, defined as days of sales outstanding in accounts receivable plus days of supply in inventory minus days of purchases outstanding in accounts payable, based on a rolling three-month average. components of our cash conversion cycle are as follows:
days of sales outstanding (dso)(1)        52             51            48
days of supply in inventory (dio)(2)      12             12            13
days of purchases outstanding (dpo)(3)   (45   )        (44   )       (40   )
(1)   represents the rolling three-month average of the balance of accounts receivable, net at the end of the period, divided by average daily net sales for the same three-month period. also incorporates components of other miscellaneous receivables.
(2)   represents the rolling three-month average of the balance of merchandise inventory at the end of the period divided by average daily cost of sales for the same three-month period.
(3)   represents the rolling three-month average of the combined balance of accounts payable-trade, excluding cash overdrafts, and accounts payable-inventory financing at the end of the period divided by average daily cost of sales for the same three-month period.
the cash conversion cycle was 19 days at december 31, 2017 and 2016. the increase in dso was primarily driven by higher net sales and related accounts receivable for third-party services such as saas, software assurance and warranties. these services have an unfavorable impact on dso as the receivable is recognized on the consolidated balance sheet on a gross basis while the corresponding sales amount in the consolidated statement of operations is recorded on a net basis. this also results in a favorable impact on dpo as the payable is recognized on the consolidated balance sheet without a corresponding cost of sales in the statement of operations because the cost paid to the vendor or third-party service provider is recorded as a reduction to net sales. in addition, dpo also increased due to the mix of payables with certain vendors that have longer payment terms.

investing activities net cash used in investing activities increased $15 million in 2017 compared to 2016. capital expenditures increased $17 million to $81 million from $64 million for 2017 and 2016, respectively, primarily related to improvements to our information technology systems.
net cash used in investing activities decreased $289 million in 2016 compared to 2015. the decrease in cash used was primarily due to the completion of the acquisition of cdw uk in 2015. additionally, capital expenditures decreased $26 million to $64 million from $90 million for 2016 and 2015, respectively, primarily due to spending for our new office location in 2015.
financing activities net cash used in financing activities increased $514 million in 2017 compared to 2016. the increase was primarily driven by changes in accounts payable-inventory financing, which resulted in an increase in cash used for financing activities of $228 million and by share repurchases during 2017, which resulted in an increase in cash used for financing activities of $167 million. for more information on our share repurchase program, see part ii, item 5, "market for registrant's common equity, related stockholder matters and issuer purchases of equity securities." the increase in cash used for accounts payable-inventory financing was primarily driven by the termination of one of our inventory financing agreements in the fourth quarter of 2016, with amounts
owed subsequently reported as accounts payable - trade on the consolidated balance sheet, which reduced cash flows reported as financing activities during 2017. in addition, an increase in incentive compensation plan tax withholdings paid of $50 million, coupled with an increase in dividends paid of $28 million, contributed to the increase in cash used in financing activities.
net cash used in financing activities increased $78 million in 2016 compared to 2015. the increase was primarily driven by higher share repurchases during the year ended december 31, 2016, which resulted in an increase in cash used for financing activities of $126 million. the increase was partially offset by the changes in accounts payable-inventory financing, which resulted in an increase in cash provided for financing activities of $48 million. the increase in cash provided by accounts payable-inventory financing was primarily due to a new vendor added to our previously existing inventory financing agreement. for a description of the inventory financing transactions impacting each period, see note 7 (inventory financing agreements) to the accompanying consolidated financial statements. for more information on our share repurchase program, see item 5, "market for registrant's common equity, related stockholder matters and issuer purchases of equity securities."
long-term debt and financing arrangements as of december 31, 2017, we had total indebtedness of $3.2 billion, of which $1.5 billion was secured indebtedness. at december 31, 2017, we were in compliance with the covenants under our various credit agreements and indentures. the amount of cdw's restricted payment capacity under the senior secured term loan facility was $1.2 billion at december 31, 2017. the amount of restricted payment capacity for the cdw uk term loan was $98 million.
for additional details regarding our debt and refinancing activities, refer to note 10 (long-term debt) to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.
inventory financing agreements we have entered into agreements with certain financial intermediaries to facilitate the purchase of inventory from various suppliers under certain terms and conditions. these amounts are classified separately as accounts payable-inventory financing on the consolidated balance sheets. we do not incur any interest expense associated with these agreements as balances are paid when they are due. for further details, see note 7 (inventory financing agreements) to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.
contractual obligations we have future obligations under various contracts relating to debt and interest payments, operating leases and payment obligations under the tax cuts and jobs act. our estimated future payments, based on undiscounted amounts, under these obligations that existed as of december 31, 2017, are as follows:
operating leases(3)                   131.8                22.1                42.8                  23.5                          43.4
(1)   includes future principal and cash interest payments on long-term borrowings through scheduled maturity dates. interest payments for variable rate debt were calculated using interest rates as of december 31, 2017. excluded from these amounts are the amortization of debt issuance and other costs related to indebtedness.
(2)   includes future principal and cash interest payments on long-term borrowings through scheduled maturity dates. interest on the senior notes is calculated using the stated interest rates. excluded from these amounts are the amortization of debt issuance and other costs related to indebtedness.
(3)   includes the minimum lease payments for non-cancelable operating leases of properties and equipment used in our operations. capital leases included in property and equipment are not material.
(4)   represents future cash tax payments for the deemed mandatory repatriation of our international operations unremitted earnings, as required by the tax cuts and jobs act.
off-balance sheet arrangements we have no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a material current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.
inflation inflation has not had a material impact on our operating results. we generally have been able to pass along price increases to our customers, though certain economic factors and technological advances in recent years have tended to place downward pressure on pricing. we also have been able to generally offset the effects of inflation on operating costs by continuing to emphasize productivity improvements and by accelerating our overall cash conversion cycle. there can be no assurances, however, that inflation would not have a material impact on our sales or operating costs in the future.
commitments and contingencies the information set forth in note 16 (commitments and contingencies) to the accompanying consolidated financial statements included in part ii, item 8 of this form 10-k is incorporated herein by reference.
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with gaap requires management to make use of certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reported periods. we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. these estimates have not historically required significant management judgment. our actual results have not differed materially from our estimates, nor have we historically made significant changes to the methods for determining these estimates. we do not believe it is reasonably likely that the estimates and related assumptions will change materially in the foreseeable future however actual results could differ from those estimates.
in note 1 (description of business and summary of significant accounting policies) to the accompanying consolidated financial statements, we include a discussion of the significant accounting policies used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. we believe the following are the most critical accounting policies and estimates that include significant judgments used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements. we consider an accounting policy or estimate to be critical if it requires assumptions to be made that were uncertain at the time they were made, and if changes in these assumptions could have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations.
revenue recognition we are a primary distribution channel for a large group of vendors and suppliers, including oems, software publishers and wholesale distributors. we record revenue from sales transactions when title and risk of loss are passed to our customer, there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement for sale, delivery has occurred and/or services have been rendered, the sales price is fixed or determinable, and collectability is reasonably assured. our shipping terms typically specify f.o.b. destination, at which time title and risk of loss have passed to the customer.
revenues from the sales of hardware products and software products and licenses are generally recognized on a gross basis with the selling price to the customer recorded as sales and the acquisition cost of the product recorded as cost of sales. these items can be delivered to customers in a variety of ways, including (i) as physical product shipped from our warehouse, (ii) via drop-shipment by the vendor or supplier, or (iii) via electronic delivery for software licenses. at the time of sale, we record an estimate for sales returns and allowances based on historical experience. our vendor partners warrant most of the products we sell.
we leverage drop-shipment arrangements with many of our vendors and suppliers to deliver products to our customers without having to physically hold the inventory at our warehouses, thereby increasing efficiency and reducing costs. we recognize revenue for drop-shipment arrangements on a gross basis upon delivery to the customer with contract terms that typically specify f.o.b. destination. we recognize revenue on a gross basis as the principal in the transaction because we are the primary obligor in the arrangement, we assume inventory risk if the product is returned by the customer, we set the price of the product charged to the customer, we assume credit risk for the amounts invoiced, and we work closely with our customers to determine their
hardware and software specifications. these arrangements represent approximately 50% of total net sales, of which approximately 25% relate to electronic delivery for software licenses.
revenue from professional services is recognized in either of two ways: services as an hourly rate (recognized using a percentage of completion model) or a fixed fee (recognized using a proportional performance model for the fixed fee). revenues for cloud computing solutions including saas and iaas arrangements with one time invoicing to the customer are recognized at the time of invoice. revenues for data center services such as managed and remote managed services, server co-location, internet connectivity, data backup and storage, and saas and iaas arrangements where the customer is invoiced over time are recognized over the period service is provided.
we also sell certain products for which we act as an agent. products in this category include the sale of third-party services, warranties, software assurance ("sa") and third-party hosted saas and iaas arrangements. sa is a product that allows customers to upgrade, at no additional cost, to the latest technology if new applications are introduced during the period that the sa is in effect. these sales do not meet the criteria for gross sales recognition, and thus are recognized on a net basis at the time of sale. under net sales recognition, the cost paid to the vendor or third-party service provider is recorded as a reduction to sales, resulting in net sales being equal to the gross profit on the transaction.
our larger customers are offered the opportunity by certain of our vendors to purchase software licenses and sa under enterprise agreements ("eas"). under eas, customers are considered to be compliant with applicable license requirements for the ensuing year, regardless of changes to their employee base. customers are charged an annual true-up fee for changes in the number of users over the year. with most eas, our vendors will transfer the license and bill the customer directly, paying resellers such as us an agency fee or commission on these sales. we record these fees as a component of net sales as earned and there is no corresponding cost of sales amount. in certain instances, we bill the customer directly under an ea and account for the individual items sold based on the nature of the item. our vendors typically dictate how the ea will be sold to the customer.
we also sell some of our products and services as part of bundled contract arrangements containing multiple deliverables, which may include a combination of the products and services. for each deliverable that represents a separate unit of accounting, total arrangement consideration is allocated based upon the relative selling prices of each element. the allocated arrangement consideration is recognized as revenue in accordance with the principles described above. selling prices are determined by using vendor specific objective evidence ("vsoe") if it exists. otherwise, selling prices are determined using third party evidence ("tpe"). if neither vsoe or tpe is available, we use our best estimate of selling prices.
we record freight billed to our customers as net sales and the related freight costs as a cost of sales.
deferred revenue includes (1) payments received from customers in advance of providing the product or performing services, and (2) amounts deferred if other conditions of revenue recognition have not been met.
we perform an analysis of the estimated number of days of sales in-transit to customers at the end of each period based on a weighted-average analysis of commercial delivery terms that includes drop-shipment arrangements. this analysis is the basis upon which we estimate the amount of sales in-transit at the end of the period and adjust revenue and the related costs to reflect only what has been received by the customer. changes in delivery patterns may result in a different number of business days used in making this adjustment and could have a material impact on our revenue recognition for the period.
vendor programs we receive incentives from certain of our vendors related to cooperative advertising allowances, volume rebates, bid programs, price protection and other programs. these incentives generally relate to written agreements with specified performance requirements with the vendors and are recorded as adjustments to cost of sales or inventory, depending on the nature of the incentive. vendors may change the terms of some or all of these programs, which could have an impact on our results of operations.
we record receivables from vendors related to these programs when the amounts are probable and reasonably estimable. some programs are based on the achievement of specific targets, and we base our estimates on information provided by our vendors and internal information to assess our progress toward achieving those targets. if actual performance does not match our estimates, we may be required to adjust our receivables. we record reserves for vendor receivables for estimated losses due to vendors' inability to pay or rejections by vendors of claims; however, if actual collections differ from our estimates, we may incur additional losses that could have a material impact on gross profit and income from operations.
goodwill goodwill is not amortized but is subject to periodic testing for impairment at the reporting unit level. we perform an evaluation of goodwill, utilizing either a quantitative or qualitative impairment test. a qualitative assessment is performed on at least an annual basis to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying
value. we perform a quantitative impairment test for each reporting unit every three years, or more frequently if circumstances indicate a potential impairment. the annual test for impairment is conducted as of december 1. our reporting units used to assess potential goodwill impairment are the same as our operating segments.
under a quantitative assessment, goodwill impairment is identified by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying amount, including goodwill. if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, goodwill is considered impaired and an impairment charge is recognized in an amount equal to that excess, not to exceed the carrying amount of goodwill. fair value of a reporting unit is determined by using a weighted combination of an income approach (75%) and a market approach (25%), as this combination is considered the most indicative of our fair value in an orderly transaction between market participants.
under the income approach, we determine fair value based on estimated future cash flows of a reporting unit, discounted by an estimated weighted-average cost of capital, which reflects the overall level of inherent risk of a reporting unit and the rate of return an outside investor would expect to earn. the estimated future cash flows of each reporting unit are based on internally generated forecasts for the remainder of the respective reporting period and the next five years. we use a range of 2.0-3.5% long-term assumed consolidated annual net sales growth rate for periods after the terminal year.
under the market approach, we utilize valuation multiples derived from publicly available information for guideline companies to provide an indication of how much a knowledgeable investor in the marketplace would be willing to pay for a company. the valuation multiples are applied to the reporting units.
determining the fair value of a reporting unit is judgmental in nature and requires the use of significant estimates and assumptions, including net sales growth rates, gross margins, operating margins, discount rates and future market conditions, among others. any changes in the judgments, estimates or assumptions used could produce significantly different results.
under a qualitative assessment, the most recent quantitative assessment is the starting point to determine if it is more likely than not that the reporting unit's fair value is less than its carrying value. as part of this qualitative assessment, we assess relevant events and circumstances including macroeconomic conditions, industry and market conditions, cost factors, overall financial performance, changes in share price and entity-specific events.
2017 impairment analysis we completed our annual impairment analysis as of december 1, 2017. for the corporate, small business and uk reporting units, we performed a qualitative analysis. we determined that it was more-likely-than-not that the individual fair values of the corporate, small business and uk reporting units exceeded the individual carrying values and therefore a quantitative impairment analysis was deemed unnecessary. although uncertainty regarding the impact of brexit still exists in the current year, we do not believe there to be any additional risk that would indicate the quantitative analysis performed in the prior year to have different results. therefore a qualitative analysis was deemed appropriate for the uk reporting unit. we performed a quantitative analysis of the public and canada reporting units. based on the results of the quantitative analysis, we determined that the fair value of the public and canada reporting units exceeded their carrying values by 179% and 153%, respectively, and no impairment existed. we identified that the most sensitive assumptions used in the quantitative analysis were net sales growth and ebitda margin and, although we believe our assumptions are reasonable based on current market conditions, actual results may vary significantly and could expose us to impairment charges in the future.
with the establishment of small business as its own reporting unit, we performed a quantitative analysis in order to allocate goodwill between corporate and small business. based on the results of the quantitative analysis performed as of january 1, 2017, we determined that the fair values of corporate and small business reporting units exceeded their carrying values by 227% and 308%, respectively, and no impairment existed.
2016 impairment analysis we completed our annual impairment analysis as of december 1, 2016. for the corporate (which, as of december 1, 2016, included small business), public and canada reporting units, we performed a qualitative analysis. we determined that it was more-likely-than-not that the individual fair values of the corporate, public and canada reporting units exceeded the individual carrying values and therefore a quantitative impairment analysis was deemed unnecessary. due to the substantial uncertainty regarding the impact of brexit, we performed a quantitative analysis of the cdw uk reporting unit. based on the results of the quantitative analysis, we determined that the fair value of the cdw uk reporting unit exceeded its carrying value by 16% and no impairment existed. we identified that the most sensitive assumptions used in the quantitative analysis were net sales growth and ebitda margin and, although we believe our assumptions are reasonable based on current market conditions, actual results may vary significantly and could expose us to impairment charges in the future.
intangible assets intangible assets include customer relationships, trade names, internally developed software and other intangibles. intangible assets with finite lives are amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets. the cost of software developed or obtained for internal use is capitalized and amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life. these intangible assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. determination of recoverability is based on an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows resulting from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition. if the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future undiscounted cash flows, an impairment loss is recorded for the excess of the asset's carrying amount over its fair value. in addition, each quarter, we evaluate whether events and circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining estimated useful life of each of these intangible assets. if we were to determine that a change to the remaining estimated useful life of an intangible asset was necessary, then the remaining carrying amount of the intangible asset would be amortized prospectively over that revised remaining useful life.
during the years ended december 31, 2017 and 2016, we concluded our intangible assets with finite lives were not impaired and no changes to the remaining useful lives were necessary.
income taxes deferred income taxes are provided to reflect the differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in the consolidated financial statements using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. we perform an evaluation of the realizability of our deferred tax assets on a quarterly basis. this evaluation requires us to use estimates and make assumptions and considers all positive and negative evidence and factors, such as the scheduled reversal of temporary differences, the mix of earnings in the jurisdictions in which we operate, and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies.
we account for unrecognized tax benefits based upon our assessment of whether a tax benefit is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by tax authorities. we report a liability for unrecognized tax benefits resulting from unrecognized tax benefits taken or expected to be taken in a tax return and recognize interest and penalties, if any, related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense.
the tax cuts and jobs act contains a provision which subjects a us parent of a foreign subsidiary to current us tax on its global intangible low-tax income ("gilti"). the gilti income is eligible for a deduction, which lowers the effective tax rate to 10.5% for taxable years 2018 through 2025 and 13.125% after 2025. as we continue to evaluate our accounting policy with respect to gilti, the provisional estimates were reported on the basis that gilti will be accounted for as a period cost when incurred. accordingly, we are not providing deferred taxes for basis differences expected to reverse as gilti.

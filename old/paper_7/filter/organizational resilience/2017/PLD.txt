item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements included in item 8. financial statements and supplementary data of this report and the matters described under item 1a. risk factors.
management's overview summary of 2017
during the year ended december 31, 2017, operating fundamentals remained strong for our owned and managed portfolio and we ended the year with occupancy of 97.2%. see below for the results of our two business segments and details of operating activity of our owned and managed portfolio.
in 2017, we completed the following significant activities as further described in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements:
o   in january, we sold our investment in europe logistics venture 1 ("elv") to our venture partner for $84 million and elv contributed its properties to prologis targeted europe logistics fund ("ptelf") in exchange for equity interests.
o   in february, we formed uklv, in which we have a 15.0% ownership interest. this unconsolidated co-investment venture was formed for investment in the u.k. and currently holds stabilized properties, properties under development and land.
o   in march, we acquired our remaining partner's interest in prologis north american industrial fund ("naif"), a consolidated co-investment venture, for $710 million. in july, we contributed 190 operating properties owned by naif to uslf. we received cash proceeds and additional units, which increased our ownership interest to 27.1%, and uslf assumed secured debt.
o   in march, we purchased our venture partner's interest in the prologis brazil logistics partners fund i ("brazil fund"), a consolidated co-investment venture, for $80 million to own 100% of the venture. in august, we acquired our partner's interest in certain unconsolidated joint ventures in brazil for an aggregate price of r$1.2 billion ($382 million). as a result of these transactions, we consolidate the majority of our investments in brazil.
o   in october, the assets and related liabilities of ptelf were contributed to prologis european properties fund ii ("pepf ii") in exchange for units, and pepf ii was renamed pelf. in connection with the transaction, we exchanged our units in ptelf for new units in pelf resulting in our ownership interest decreasing to 25.6%, however, our economic investment did not substantially change.
o   as a result of these activities, we had eight unconsolidated co-investment ventures at december 31, 2017.
o   in addition to the transactions discussed above, we also contributed properties to existing co-investment ventures in europe, japan and mexico and we disposed of non-strategic operating properties to third parties, primarily in the u.s.
o   these transactions generated proceeds of $4.5 billion and realized net gains of $1.2 billion.
•   in february, we amended our japanese yen revolver and increased the total borrowing capacity to ¥50.0 billion ($444 million at december 31, 2017).
•   in june, we issued £500 million ($645 million) of senior notes with an effective interest rate of 2.3%, maturing in june 2029, at 99.9% of par value. following the issuance, we used the cash proceeds to redeem $618 million of previously issued senior notes, maturing in 2019, with an average coupon rate of 5.4%.
results of operations we evaluate our business operations based on the noi of our two operating segments: real estate operations and strategic capital. noi by segment is a non-gaap financial measure that is calculated using revenues and expenses directly from our financial statements. we consider noi by segment to be an appropriate supplemental measure of our performance because it helps management and investors understand the core operations of our real estate assets.
below is a reconciliation of our noi by segment to operating income per the consolidated financial statements (in millions). each segment's noi is reconciled to a line item in the consolidated financial statements in the respective segment discussion below.
strategic capital - noi                             219                  175                  109
operating income                                   $771                 $668                 $380
see note 18 to the consolidated financial statements for more information on our segments and a reconciliation of each business segment's noi to operating income and earnings before income taxes.
real estate operations this operating segment principally includes rental revenues, rental recoveries and rental expenses recognized from our consolidated properties. we allocate the costs of our property management functions to the real estate operations segment through rental expenses and the strategic capital segment through strategic capital expenses based on the square footage of the relative portfolios as compared to our total owned and managed portfolio. the operating fundamentals in the markets in which we operate continue to be strong, which has driven rents higher, kept occupancies high and has fueled development activity. this segment is impacted by our development, acquisition and disposition activities.
below are the components of real estate operations revenues, expenses and noi (in millions), derived directly from line items in the consolidated financial statements.
development management and other revenues               19                    8                    6
the change in real estate operations noi during these periods were impacted by the following items (in millions of dollars):
(1)   the impact from acquisitions in 2016 from 2015 was primarily due to the acquisition of the real estate assets and operating platform of ktr capital partners and its affiliates ("ktr") in may 2015, which generated an additional $152 million of net revenues, including a decrease of $25 million in acquisition costs, in 2016. approximately 45% of ktr activity is offset in net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests for our venture partner's share. see note 3 in the consolidated financial statements for further detail on the ktr transaction.
(2)   during these periods, we experienced increased occupancy and positive rent rate growth. rent rate growth (or rent change) is a combination of the rollover of existing leases and increases in certain rental rates from contractual rent increases on existing leases. if a lease has a contractual rent increase that is not known at the time the lease is signed, such as the consumer price index or a similar metric, the rent increase is not included in rent leveling and therefore, would impact the rental revenues we recognize. see below for key metrics on occupancy and rent change on rollover for the consolidated operating portfolio.
(3)   a developed property moves into the operating portfolio when it meets stabilization. the property is considered stabilized when a development project has been completed for one year or at least 90% occupied, whichever occurs first. during these periods, noi increased as developments stabilized. see below for key metrics on our development stabilizations for our consolidated properties.
(4)   contribution and disposition activity increased in 2017, compared to 2016, primarily due to the contribution of the naif operating properties to uslf.
(5)   other items include property tax expense recoveries, noncash adjustments for the amortization of above or below market leases, non-recoverable expenses, termination fees and changes in foreign currency exchange rates.
below are key operating metrics of our consolidated operating portfolio over the last three years:
development start activity the following table summarizes consolidated development starts (dollars and square feet in millions):
number of new development projects during the period            74                  73                  62
percentage of build-to-suits based on tei                     48.5   %            42.2   %            47.2   %
(1)   we expect our properties under development at december 31, 2017, to be completed before july 2019.
development stabilization activity the following table summarizes consolidated development stabilization activity (dollars and square feet in millions):
number of development projects stabilized during the period              76                  75                  63
for information on our development portfolio at december 31, 2017, see item 2. properties.
capital expenditures we capitalize costs incurred in renovating, rehabilitating and improving our operating properties as part of the investment basis. the following graph summarizes our capital expenditures on operating properties within our consolidated operating portfolio (in millions):
strategic capital this operating segment includes revenues from asset and property management and other fees for services performed, as well as promotes earned from the unconsolidated co-investment ventures. revenues associated with the strategic capital segment fluctuate because of the size of co-investment ventures under management, the transactional activity in the ventures and the timing of promotes. these revenues are reduced generally by the direct costs associated with the asset and property-level management expenses for the properties owned by these ventures. we allocate the costs of our property management functions to the strategic capital segment through strategic capital expenses and to the real estate operations segment through rental expenses based on the square footage of the relative portfolios as compared to our total owned and managed portfolio.
below are the components of strategic capital revenues, expenses and noi, derived directly from the line items in the consolidated financial statements (in millions):
strategic capital revenues            $374                $304                $217
strategic capital expenses            (155   )            (129   )            (108   )
strategic capital - noi               $219                $175                $109
below is additional detail of our strategic capital revenues, expenses and noi (in millions):
strategic capital revenues ($)
strategic capital expense ($)            (70   )           (41   )           (41   )           (12   )           (10   )           (9   )           (39   )           (43   )           (27   )           (34   )           (35   )           (31   )           (155   )           (129   )           (108   )
strategic capital - noi ($)              107                (2   )            (2   )            17                13               13                68               144                86                27                20                12                219                175                109
(1)   this includes compensation and personnel costs for employees who were located in the u.s. but also support other regions.
(2)   recurring fees include asset and property management fees.
(4)   the promote revenues represent the third-party partners' share based on the venture's cumulative returns to investors over a certain time-period, generally three years. approximately 40% of promote revenues are paid to our employees as a combination of cash and stock awards pursuant to the terms of the prologis promote plan and expensed through strategic capital expenses, as vested.
operating properties             552                369                391             205                 213                 205              707                  700                  688              95                 85                 66            1,559               1,367               1,350
(1)   we acquired our partner's interest in naif, a consolidated co-investment venture, and contributed 190 operating properties owned by naif to uslf in 2017.
(3)   in 2017, we had the following activity in europe: (i) sold our investment in elv to our venture partner and elv contributed its properties to ptelf; (ii) the assets and related liabilities of ptelf were contributed to pepf ii in exchange for units; and pepf ii was renamed pelf; and (iii) we formed the co-investment venture uklv.
see note 5 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on our unconsolidated co-investment ventures.
we capitalize certain costs directly related to our development and leasing activities. capitalized g&a expenses included salaries and related costs, as well as other g&a costs. the following table summarizes capitalized g&a amounts (in millions):
building and land development activities                                                          $63               $61               $63
operating building improvements and other                                                          15                16                16
total capitalized g&amp;a expenses                                                               $102              $101              $100
capitalized salaries and related costs as a percent of total salaries and related costs          24.4   %          26.0   %          27.6   %
(1)   due to a new accounting standard effective january 1, 2019, we expect a change in capitalized leasing activities. see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.
depreciation and amortization expenses the following table highlights the key changes in depreciation and amortization expenses during these periods (in millions of dollars):
(2)   the decrease in depreciation and amortization expense in 2017 from 2016 was primarily due to the contribution of the naif operating properties to uslf in 2017.
our owned and managed properties we manage our business on an owned and managed basis, which includes properties wholly owned by us or owned by one of our co-investment ventures. we review our operating fundamentals on an owned and managed basis. we believe reviewing these fundamentals this way allows management to understand the entire impact to the financial statements, as it will affect both the real estate operations and strategic capital segments, as well as the net earnings we recognize from our unconsolidated co-investment ventures based on our ownership share. we do not control the unconsolidated co-investment ventures for purposes of gaap and the presentation of the ventures' operating information does not represent a legal claim to such items.
our owned and managed operating portfolio does not include value-added properties or properties held for sale to third parties and was as follows at december 31 (square feet in millions):
number of properties               square           percentage occupied          number of properties               square           percentage occupied          number of properties               square           percentage occupied feet                                                                             feet                                                                             feet consolidated                       1,532               297                          97.3   %                        1,777               332                          97.0   %                        1,872               334                          97.1   %
operating activity below is information summarizing the leasing activity of our owned and managed operating portfolio over the last three years:
(1)   we retained more than 75% of our customers, based on the total square feet of leases signed, for each year during the three-year period ended december 31, 2017.
(2)   turnover costs are defined as leasing commissions and tenant improvements and represent the obligations incurred in connection with the signing of a lease.
same store analysis we evaluate the operating performance of the operating properties we own and manage using a "same store" analysis because the population of properties in this analysis is consistent from period to period, which eliminates the effects of changes in the composition of the portfolio. we have defined the same store portfolio, for the three months ended december 31, 2017, as those owned and managed properties that were in operation at january 1, 2016, and have been in operation throughout the same three-month periods in both 2017 and 2016 (including development properties that have been completed and available for lease). we have removed all properties that were disposed of to a third party or were classified as held for sale to a third party from the population for both periods. we believe the factors that affect rental revenues, rental recoveries, rental expenses and noi in the same store portfolio are generally the same as for the total operating portfolio. to derive an appropriate measure of period-to-period operating performance, we remove the effects of foreign currency exchange rate movements by using the recent period end exchange rate to translate from local currency into the u.s. dollar, for both periods.
same store is a commonly used measure in the real estate industry. our same store measures are non-gaap financial measures that are calculated beginning with rental revenues, rental recoveries and rental expenses from the financial statements prepared in accordance with gaap. as our same store measures are non-gaap financial measures, they have certain limitations as analytical tools and may vary among real estate companies. as a result, we provide a reconciliation from our financial statements prepared in accordance with gaap to same store property noi with explanations of how these metrics are calculated.
we evaluate the results of our same store portfolio on a quarterly basis. the following is a reconciliation of our consolidated rental revenues, rental recoveries, rental expenses and property noi for each quarter in 2017 and 2016 to the full year, as included in the consolidated statements of income and within note 20 to the consolidated financial statements and to the respective amounts in our same store portfolio analysis for the three months ended december 31 (dollars in millions):

rental revenues (per the quarterly information table above)                               $434                    $436
rental recoveries (per the quarterly information table above)                              117                     125
consolidated adjustments to derive same store results:
rental revenues and recoveries of properties not in the same store portfolio -             (74   )                 (66   )
properties developed, acquired and sold to third parties during the period and land subject to ground leases effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and other                              (9   )                   -

consolidated adjustments to derive same store results:
rental expenses of properties not in the same store portfolio - properties                 (32   )                 (22   )
developed, acquired and sold to third parties during the period and land subject to ground leases effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and other                              18                      13
property noi (per the quarterly information table above)                                  $411                    $420
consolidated adjustments to derive same store results:
property noi of properties not in the same store portfolio - properties                    (42   )                 (44   )
developed, acquired and sold to third parties during the period and land subject to ground leases effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and other                             (27   )                 (13   )
(1)   we include 100% of the same store noi from the properties in our same store portfolio. during the periods presented, certain properties owned by us were contributed to a co-investment venture and are included in the same store portfolio. neither our consolidated results nor those of the co-investment ventures, when viewed individually, would be comparable on a same store basis because of the changes in composition of the respective portfolios from period to period (e.g. the results of a contributed property are included in our consolidated results through the contribution date and in the results of the unconsolidated entities subsequent to the contribution date).
(2)   we exclude the net termination and renegotiation fees from our same store rental revenues to allow us to evaluate the growth or decline in each property's rental revenues without regard to one-time items that are not indicative of the property's recurring
operating performance. net termination and renegotiation fees represent the gross fee negotiated to allow a customer to terminate or renegotiate their lease, offset by the write-off of the asset recorded due to the adjustment to straight-line rents over the lease term. the adjustments to remove these items are included in "effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and other" in this table.
(3)   rental expenses include the direct operating expenses of the property such as property taxes, insurance and utilities. in addition, we include an allocation of the property management expenses for our direct-owned properties based on the property management services provided to each property (generally, based on a percentage of revenues). on consolidation, these amounts are eliminated and the actual costs of providing property management services are recognized as part of our consolidated rental expenses. these expenses fluctuate based on the level of properties included in the same store portfolio and any adjustment is included as "effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and other" in this table.
other components of income (expense)
earnings from unconsolidated entities, net we recognized net earnings from unconsolidated entities, which are accounted for using the equity method, of $249 million, $206 million and $159 million during 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. the earnings we recognize can be impacted by: (i) variances in revenues and expenses of each venture; (ii) the size and occupancy rate of the portfolio of properties owned by each venture; (iii) gains or losses from the dispositions of properties and extinguishment of debt; (iv) our ownership interest in each venture; and (v) fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates used to translate our share of net earnings to u.s. dollars.
see the discussion of our co-investment ventures above in the strategic capital segment discussion and in note 5 to the consolidated financial statements for a further breakdown of our share of net earnings recognized.
amortization of discount (premium) and debt issuance costs, net              1                (15   )            (32   )
capitalized amounts                                                        (55   )            (65   )            (61   )
our overall debt decreased by $1.2 billion from december 31, 2016 to december 31, 2017, primarily from uslf assuming secured debt in conjunction with our contribution of real estate properties. gross interest expense decreased in 2017, compared to the same period in 2016, principally due to decreased secured debt as a result of the uslf contribution and pay downs, and lower interest rates due to the change in the composition of our senior notes. gross interest expense decreased in 2016, compared with 2015, principally from lower outstanding debt balances from the repayment of the senior term loan related to the ktr acquisition and lower borrowing costs during 2016.
see note 9 to the consolidated financial statements for a further breakdown of gross interest expense, amortization and capitalized amounts included in net interest expense. see the liquidity and capital resources section for further discussion of our debt and borrowing costs.
gains on dispositions of investments in real estate and revaluation of equity investments upon acquisition of a controlling interest, net during 2017, 2016 and 2015, we recognized gains on dispositions of investments in real estate and revaluation of equity investments upon acquisition of a controlling interest, net of $1.2 billion, $757 million, and $759 million. we utilized the proceeds from both contributions and dispositions to fund our capital investments.
over the last three years, we contributed properties, generally that we developed, to our co-investment ventures in europe, japan and mexico. in 2017, we also contributed a significant portfolio of operating properties to uslf. we have also sold properties to third parties, primarily from our operating portfolio in the u.s. these dispositions have supported our strategic objective of owning a portfolio of high-quality properties in the most active centers of commerce. we expect to continue to develop and contribute properties to these ventures, depending on market conditions and other factors.
for the three-year period ended december 31, 2017, we recognized a gain in connection with contributions to the extent of the third-party ownership in the venture acquiring the property. beginning in 2018, we will recognize the entire gain under the new revenue recognition standard, as discussed in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements.
see note 4 and 5 to the consolidated financial statements for further information on the gains we recognized.
gains on the settlement of unhedged derivative transactions                               $13               $3               $15
losses on the settlement of transactions                                                   (2   )           (3   )            (4   )
gains (losses) on the change in fair value of unhedged derivative transactions            (74   )           10                16
gains (losses) on remeasurement of certain assets and liabilities (1)                       5               (2   )           (20   )
(1)   these gains or losses were primarily related to the remeasurement of assets and liabilities that are denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the entity, such as short-term intercompany loans between the u.s. parent and certain foreign consolidated subsidiaries, debt and tax receivables and payables.
see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for more information about our foreign currency and derivative policies and note 16 to the consolidated financial statements for more information about our derivative transactions.
gains (losses) on early extinguishment of debt, net we repurchased and redeemed portions of several series of senior notes, term loans and secured mortgage debt that resulted in the recognition of losses of $68 million and $86 million in 2017 and 2015, respectively, and a gain of $2 million in 2016. as a result of these transactions, we reduced our effective interest rate and lengthened the maturities of our debt. see note 9 to the consolidated financial statements for more information regarding our debt repurchases.
income tax expense we recognize income tax expense related to our taxable reit subsidiaries and the local, state and foreign jurisdictions in which we operate. our current income tax expense fluctuates from period to period based primarily on the timing of our taxable income. deferred income tax expense (benefit) is generally a function of the period's temporary differences and the utilization of net operating losses generated in prior years that had been previously recognized as deferred income tax assets in taxable subsidiaries operating in the u.s. or in foreign jurisdictions.

net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests this amount represents the third-party investors' share of the earnings generated from consolidated entities in which we do not own 100% of the equity, reduced by the third-party share of fees or promotes payable to us and earned during the period.
(1)   the third-party share of the promote earned from uslv is included in 2016.
see note 12 to the consolidated financial statements for further information on our noncontrolling interests.
we recorded net gains of $63 million in 2017 and net losses of $136 million and $209 million in 2016 and 2015, respectively, in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income related to the foreign currency translation of our foreign subsidiaries into u.s. dollars upon consolidation and translation of our derivative and nonderivative net investment hedges. these net gains and losses were primarily due to the strengthening and weakening of the currencies in which we operate to the u.s. dollar.
during 2017, we recorded unrealized gains of $23 million and during 2016 and 2015, we recorded unrealized losses of $1 million and $17 million, respectively, in our consolidated statements of comprehensive income, related to the change in fair value of our cash flow hedges and our share of derivatives in our unconsolidated co-investment ventures.
see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for more information about our foreign currency and derivative policies and note 16 to the consolidated financial statements for more information about our derivative transactions and other comprehensive income (loss).

liquidity and capital resources overview we consider our ability to generate cash from operating activities, distributions from our co-investment ventures, contributions and dispositions of properties and available financing sources to be adequate to meet our anticipated future development, acquisition, operating, debt service, dividend and distribution requirements.
near-term principal cash sources and uses in addition to dividends to the common and preferred stockholders of prologis, inc. and distributions to the holders of limited partnership units of prologis, l.p. and our partner in our consolidated co-investment venture, we expect our primary cash needs will consist of the following:
•   completion of the development and leasing of the properties in our consolidated development portfolio (at december 31, 2017, 85 properties in our development portfolio were 59.8% leased with a current investment of $1.6 billion and a tei of $2.8 billion when completed and leased, leaving $1.2 billion of additional required funding);
•   development of new properties for long-term investment, including the acquisition of land in certain markets;
•   capital expenditures and leasing costs on properties in our operating portfolio;
•   repayment of debt and scheduled principal payments of $169 million in 2018;
•   additional investments in current unconsolidated entities or new investments in future unconsolidated entities;
•   acquisition of operating properties or portfolios of operating properties (depending on market and other conditions) for direct, long-term investment in our consolidated portfolio (this might include acquisitions from our co-investment ventures); and
•   repurchase of our outstanding debt or equity securities (depending on prevailing market conditions, our liquidity, contractual restrictions and other factors) through cash purchases, open-market purchases, privately negotiated transactions, tender offers or otherwise.
we expect to fund our cash needs principally from the following sources (subject to market conditions):
•   fees earned for services performed on behalf of the co-investment ventures, including promotes;
•   proceeds from the disposition of properties, land parcels or other investments to third parties;
•   proceeds from the contributions of properties to current or future co-investment ventures;
•   proceeds from the sale of a portion of our investments in co-investment ventures;
•   borrowing capacity under our current credit facility arrangements, other facilities or borrowing arrangements ($3.1 billion available at december 31, 2017); and
•   proceeds from the issuance of debt.
we may also generate proceeds from the issuance of equity securities, subject to market conditions.
debt the following table summarizes information about our debt at december 31 (dollars in millions):

see note 9 to the consolidated financial statements for more detail on debt.
off-balance sheet arrangements unconsolidated co-investment venture debt we had investments in and advances to our unconsolidated co-investment ventures, at december 31, 2017, of $5.3 billion. the ventures listed below had total third-party debt of $8.1 billion at december 31, 2017. certain of our ventures do not have third-party debt and are therefore excluded. this debt is non-recourse to prologis or the other investors in the co-investment ventures, matures and bears interest as follows (dollars in millions):
at december 31, 2017, we did not guarantee any third-party debt of the unconsolidated co-investment ventures. in our role as the manager or sponsor, we work with the co-investment ventures to maintain sufficient liquidity and refinance their maturing debt. there can be no assurance that the co-investment ventures will be able to refinance any maturing indebtedness on terms as favorable as the maturing debt, or at all. if the ventures are unable to refinance the maturing indebtedness with newly issued debt, they may be able to obtain funds by voluntary capital contributions from us and our partners or by selling assets. certain of our ventures also have credit facilities, or unencumbered properties, both of which may be used to obtain funds.
unfunded commitments on the development portfolio (1)                      1,121                        59                         -                             -                 1,180
operating lease payments                                                      34                        62                        51                           311                   458
(1)   we had properties in our consolidated development portfolio (completed and under development) at december 31, 2017, with a tei of $2.8 billion. the unfunded commitments presented include not only those costs that we are obligated to fund under construction contracts, but all costs necessary to place the property into service, including the estimated costs of tenant improvements, marketing and leasing costs that we expect to incur as the property is leased.
distribution and dividend requirements our dividend policy on our common stock is to distribute a percentage of our cash flow to ensure that we will meet the dividend requirements of the internal revenue code, relative to maintaining our reit status, while still allowing us to retain cash to fund capital improvements and other investment activities.
under the internal revenue code, reits may be subject to certain federal income and excise taxes on our undistributed taxable income. we do not expect the tax cuts and jobs act, enacted on december 22, 2017, to modify our current distribution policy.
in 2017, we paid quarterly cash dividends of $0.44 per common share. in 2016, we paid quarterly cash dividends of $0.42 per common share. our future common stock dividends, if and as declared, may vary and will be determined by the board upon the circumstances prevailing at the time, including our financial condition, operating results and reit distribution requirements, and may be adjusted at the discretion of the board during the year.
we make distributions on the common limited partnership units outstanding at the same per unit amount as our common stock dividend. the class a units in the op are entitled to a quarterly distribution equal to $0.64665 per unit so long as the common units receive a quarterly distribution of at least $0.40 per unit. we paid a quarterly distribution of $0.64665 per class a unit in 2017 and 2016.
at december 31, 2017, we had 1.4 million shares of series q preferred stock outstanding with a liquidation preference of $50 per share. the annual dividend rate is 8.54% per share and dividends are payable quarterly in arrears. pursuant to the terms of our preferred stock, we are restricted from declaring or paying any dividend with respect to our common stock unless and until all cumulative dividends with respect to the preferred stock have been paid and sufficient funds have been set aside for dividends that have been declared for the relevant dividend period with respect to the preferred stock.
other commitments on a continuing basis, we are engaged in various stages of negotiations for the acquisition or disposition of individual properties or portfolios of properties.
critical accounting policies a critical accounting policy is one that is both important to the portrayal of an entity's financial condition and results of operations and requires judgment on the part of management. generally, the judgment requires management to make estimates and assumptions about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. estimates are prepared using management's best judgment, after considering past and current economic conditions and expectations for the future. changes in estimates could affect our financial position and specific items in our results of operations that are used by stockholders, potential investors, industry analysts and lenders in their evaluation of our performance. of the accounting policies discussed in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, those presented below have been identified by us as critical accounting policies.
consolidation we consolidate all entities that are wholly owned and those in which we own less than 100% of the equity but control, as well as any variable interest entities in which we are the primary beneficiary. we evaluate our ability to control an entity including whether the entity is a variable interest entity and whether we are the primary beneficiary. we consider the substantive terms of the arrangement to
identify which enterprise has the power to direct the activities of the entity that most significantly impacts the entity's economic performance and the obligation to absorb losses of the entity or the right to receive benefits from the entity. investments in entities that we do not control but over which we have the ability to exercise significant influence over operating and financial policies are accounted for using the equity method. our ability to correctly assess our influence or control over an entity affects the presentation of these investments in the consolidated financial statements.
revenue recognition we recognize gains from the contributions and sales of real estate assets, generally at the time the title is transferred, consideration is received and we no longer have substantial continuing involvement with the real estate sold. in many of our transactions, an entity in which we have an equity investment will acquire a real estate asset from us. we make judgments based on the specific terms of each transaction as to the amount of the total profit from the transaction that we recognize given our continuing ownership interest and our level of future involvement with the entity that acquires the assets. in addition, we make judgments regarding recognition in earnings of certain fees and incentives earned for services provided to these entities based on when they are earned, fixed and determinable.
acquisitions upon acquisition of real estate that constitutes a business or an asset, which includes acquiring a controlling interest in an entity previously accounted for using the equity method of accounting, we allocate the purchase price to the various components of the acquisition based on the fair value of each component. the components typically include buildings, land, intangible assets related to the acquired leases, debt, deferred tax liabilities and other assumed assets and liabilities. in an acquisition of multiple properties, we allocate the purchase price among the properties. the allocation of the purchase price is based on our assessment of estimated fair value and often is based on the expected future cash flows of the property and various characteristics of the markets where the property is located. the fair value may also include an enterprise value premium that we estimate a third party would be willing to pay for a portfolio of properties for acquisitions that qualify as a business. in the case of an acquisition of a controlling interest in an entity previously accounted for under the equity method (a step-acquisition under the business combination rules), this allocation may result in a gain or a loss. the initial allocation of the purchase price is based on management's preliminary assessment, which may differ when final information becomes available. the use of different assumptions in the allocation of the purchase price of the acquired properties and liabilities assumed could affect the timing of recognition of the related revenues and expenses.
income taxes significant management judgment is required to estimate our income tax liability for each taxable entity, the liability associated with open tax years that are under review, our reit taxable income and our compliance with reit requirements. our estimates are based on interpretation of tax laws. we estimate our actual current income tax due and assess temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for book and tax purposes resulting in the recognition of deferred income tax assets and liabilities. these estimates may have an impact on the income tax expense recognized. adjustments may be required by a change in assessment of our deferred income tax assets and liabilities; changes in assessments of the recognition of income tax benefits for certain non-routine transactions; changes due to audit adjustments by federal, international and state tax authorities; our inability to qualify as a reit; the potential for built-in gain recognition; changes in the assessment of properties to be contributed to taxable reit subsidiaries and changes in tax laws. adjustments required in any given period are included within income tax expense. we recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by taxing authorities.
recoverability of real estate assets we assess the carrying values of our respective long-lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of these assets may not be fully recoverable.
recoverability of real estate assets is measured by comparison of the carrying amount of the asset to the estimated future undiscounted cash flows. to review our real estate assets for recoverability, we consider current market conditions, as well as our intent with respect to holding or disposing of the asset. our intent with regard to the underlying assets might change as market conditions change. fair value is determined through various valuation techniques, including discounted cash flow models, applying a capitalization rate to estimated noi of a property, quoted market values and third-party appraisals, where considered necessary. the use of projected future cash flows is based on assumptions that are consistent with our estimates of future expectations and the strategic plan we use to manage our underlying business. if our analysis indicates that the carrying value of a property that we expect to hold is not recoverable on an undiscounted cash flow basis, we recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the current estimated fair value of the property. assumptions and estimates used in the recoverability analyses for future cash flows, including market rents, discount rates and capitalization rates are complex and subjective. changes in economic and operating conditions or our intent with regard to our investment that occurs subsequent to our impairment analyses could impact these assumptions and result in future impairment.
capitalization of costs during the land development and construction periods (including renovating and rehabilitating), we capitalize interest, insurance, real estate taxes and certain general and administrative costs of the personnel performing development, renovations and rehabilitation if such costs are incremental and identifiable to a specific activity to get the asset ready for its intended use. the ability to specifically
identify internal personnel costs associated with development and the determination of when a development project is substantially complete and capitalization must cease, requires a high degree of judgment and failure to accurately assess these costs and timing could result in the misstatement of asset values and expenses. capitalized costs are included in the investment basis of real estate assets.
new accounting pronouncements see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements.
funds from operations attributable to common stockholders/unitholders ffo is a non-gaap financial measure that is commonly used in the real estate industry. the most directly comparable gaap measure to ffo is net earnings.
the national association of real estate investment trusts ("nareit") defines ffo as earnings computed under gaap to exclude historical cost depreciation and gains and losses from the sales, along with impairment charges, of previously depreciated properties. we also exclude the gains on revaluation of equity investments upon acquisition of a controlling interest and the gain recognized from a partial sale of our investment, as these are similar to gains from the sales of previously depreciated properties. we exclude similar adjustments from our unconsolidated entities and the third parties' share of our consolidated co-investment ventures.
our ffo measures our ffo measures begin with nareit's definition and we make certain adjustments to reflect our business and the way that management plans and executes our business strategy. while not infrequent or unusual, the additional items we adjust for in calculating ffo, as modified by prologis, and core ffo, both as defined below, are subject to significant fluctuations from period to period. although these items may have a material impact on our operations and are reflected in our financial statements, the removal of the effects of these items allows us to better understand the core operating performance of our properties over the long term. these items have both positive and negative short-term effects on our results of operations in inconsistent and unpredictable directions that are not relevant to our long-term outlook.
we calculate our ffo measures, as defined below, based on our proportionate ownership share of both our unconsolidated and consolidated ventures. we reflect our share of our ffo measures for unconsolidated ventures by applying our average ownership percentage for the period to the applicable reconciling items on an entity by entity basis. we reflect our share for consolidated ventures in which we do not own 100% of the equity by adjusting our ffo measures to remove the noncontrolling interests share of the applicable reconciling items based on our average ownership percentage for the applicable periods.
these ffo measures are used by management as supplemental financial measures of operating performance and we believe that it is important that stockholders, potential investors and financial analysts understand the measures management uses. we do not use our ffo measures as, nor should they be considered to be, alternatives to net earnings computed under gaap, as indicators of our operating performance, as alternatives to cash from operating activities computed under gaap or as indicators of our ability to fund our cash needs.
we analyze our operating performance primarily by the rental revenues of our real estate and the revenues from our strategic capital business, net of operating, administrative and financing expenses. this income stream is not directly impacted by fluctuations in the market value of our investments in real estate or debt securities.
to arrive at ffo, as modified by prologis, we adjust the nareit defined ffo measure to exclude the impact of foreign currency related items and deferred tax, specifically:
•   deferred income tax benefits and deferred income tax expenses recognized by our subsidiaries;
•   current income tax expense related to acquired tax liabilities that were recorded as deferred tax liabilities in an acquisition, to the extent the expense is offset with a deferred income tax benefit in earnings that is excluded from our defined ffo measure;
•   unhedged foreign currency exchange gains and losses resulting from debt transactions between us and our foreign consolidated subsidiaries and our foreign unconsolidated entities;
•   foreign currency exchange gains and losses from the remeasurement (based on current foreign currency exchange rates) of certain third-party debt of our foreign consolidated and unconsolidated entities; and
•   mark-to-market adjustments associated with derivative financial instruments.
we use ffo, as modified by prologis, so that management, analysts and investors are able to evaluate our performance against other reits that do not have similar operations or operations in jurisdictions outside the u.s.
•   gains or losses from the disposition of land and development properties that were developed with the intent to contribute or sell;
•   income tax expense related to the sale of investments in real estate and third-party acquisition costs related to the acquisition of real estate;
•   impairment charges recognized related to our investments in real estate generally as a result of our change in intent to contribute or sell these properties;
•   gains or losses from the early extinguishment of debt and redemption and repurchase of preferred stock; and
we use core ffo, including by segment and region, to: (i) assess our operating performance as compared to other real estate companies; (ii) evaluate our performance and the performance of our properties in comparison with expected results and results of previous periods; (iii) evaluate the performance of our management; (iv) budget and forecast future results to assist in the allocation of resources; (v) provide guidance to the financial markets to understand our expected operating performance; and (vi) evaluate how a specific potential investment will impact our future results.
limitations on the use of our ffo measures while we believe our modified ffo measures are important supplemental measures, neither nareit's nor our measures of ffo should be used alone because they exclude significant economic components of net earnings computed under gaap and are, therefore, limited as an analytical tool. accordingly, these are only a few of the many measures we use when analyzing our business. some of the limitations are:
•   the current income tax expenses and acquisition costs that are excluded from our modified ffo measures represent the taxes and transaction costs that are payable.
•   depreciation and amortization of real estate assets are economic costs that are excluded from ffo. ffo is limited, as it does not reflect the cash requirements that may be necessary for future replacements of the real estate assets. furthermore, the amortization of capital expenditures and leasing costs necessary to maintain the operating performance of logistics facilities are not reflected in ffo.
•   gains or losses from non-development property and dispositions or impairment charges related to expected dispositions represent changes in value of the properties. by excluding these gains and losses, ffo does not capture realized changes in the value of disposed properties arising from changes in market conditions.
•   the deferred income tax benefits and expenses that are excluded from our modified ffo measures result from the creation of a deferred income tax asset or liability that may have to be settled at some future point. our modified ffo measures do not currently reflect any income or expense that may result from such settlement.
•   the foreign currency exchange gains and losses that are excluded from our modified ffo measures are generally recognized based on movements in foreign currency exchange rates through a specific point in time. the ultimate settlement of our foreign currency-denominated net assets is indefinite as to timing and amount. our ffo measures are limited in that they do not reflect the current period changes in these net assets that result from periodic foreign currency exchange rate movements.
•   the gains and losses on extinguishment of debt that we exclude from our core ffo, may provide a benefit or cost to us as we may be settling our debt at less or more than our future obligation.
we compensate for these limitations by using our ffo measures only in conjunction with net earnings computed under gaap when making our decisions. this information should be read with our complete consolidated financial statements prepared under gaap. to assist investors in compensating for these limitations, we reconcile our modified ffo measures to our net earnings computed under gaap as follows (in millions).

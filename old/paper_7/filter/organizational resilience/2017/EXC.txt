(a)   the registrants' evaluate operating performance using the measure of revenues net of purchased power and fuel expense. the registrant's believe that revenues net of purchased power and fuel expense is a useful measurement because it provides information that can be used to evaluate its operational performance. revenues net of purchased power and fuel expense is not a presentation defined under gaap and may not be comparable to other companies' presentations or deemed more useful than the gaap information provided elsewhere in this report.
(b)   as a result of the phi merger, exelon includes the consolidated results of phi, pepco, dpl and ace from march 24, 2016 through december 31, 2016.
revenue net of purchased power and fuel expense, which is a non-gaap measure discussed below, increased by $776 million as compared to 2016. the year-over-year increase was primarily due to the following favorable factors:
•   increase of $104 million at bge primarily due to the impacts of the electric and natural gas distribution rate orders issued by the mdpsc in june 2016 and july 2016 and an increase in transmission formula rate revenues;
•   increase of $99 million at comed primarily due to increased electric distribution and transmission formula rate revenues (reflecting the impacts of increased capital investment and higher allowed electric distribution roe), partially offset by lower revenues resulting from the change to defer and recover over time energy efficiency costs pursuant to feja and the impact of favorable weather conditions in 2016; and
•   increase of $767 million in revenue net of purchased power and fuel due to the inclusion of phi's results for the year ended december 31, 2017 compared to the period march 24, 2016 to december 31, 2016, as well as distribution rate increases effective in 2016 and 2017.
the year-over-year increase in revenue net of purchased power and fuel expense was partially offset by the following unfavorable factors:
•   decrease of $134 million at generation due to mark-to-market losses of $175 million in 2017 compared to mark-to-market losses of $41 million in 2016;
•   decrease of $46 million at peco primarily due to unfavorable weather conditions; and
•   decrease of $11 million at generation primarily due to lower realized energy prices, the impacts of lower load volumes delivered due to mild weather in the third quarter 2017, the conclusion of the ginna reliability support services agreement and the impact of declining natural gas prices on generation's natural gas portfolio, partially offset by the impact of the new york ces, increased nuclear volumes primarily as a result of the acquisition of fitzpatrick, higher capacity prices, the addition of two combined-cycle gas turbines in texas and lower nuclear fuel prices.
operating and maintenance expense increased by $78 million as compared to 2016. the year-over-year increase was primarily due to the following unfavorable factors:
•   increase of $307 million at generation due to higher asset impairment charges;
•   increase of $127 million at generation primarily due to generation's decision in 2017 to early retire the tmi nuclear facility compared to the previous decision in 2016 to early retire the clinton and quad cities nuclear facilities;
•   increase of $104 million at generation due to increased nuclear refueling outage costs;
•   increase of $84 million at generation due to the annual update of the generation nuclear decommissioning obligation related to the non-regulatory units in 2017 versus 2016; and
•   increase of $253 million at phi due to the inclusion of phi's results for the year ended december 31, 2017 compared to the period march 24, 2016 to december 31, 2016.
the year-over-year increase in operating and maintenance expense was partially offset by the following favorable factors:
•   decrease of $665 million at exelon due to merger commitment and other merger-related costs of $73 million in 2017 compared to $738 million in 2016;
•   decrease of $85 million at comed due to the change to defer and recover over time energy efficiency costs pursuant to the illinois future energy jobs act; and
•   decrease of $21 million at bge primarily due to certain disallowances contained in the june and july 2016 rate orders, partially offset by the impact of the favorable 2016 settlement of the baltimore city conduit fee dispute.
depreciation and amortization expense decreased by $108 million primarily due to lower accelerated depreciation and amortization expense as a result of the 2017 decision to early retire the tmi nuclear facility compared to the previous decision in 2016 to early retire the clinton and quad cities nuclear facilities, partially offset by increased depreciation expense as a result of ongoing capital expenditures across all operating companies and the inclusion of phi's results for the year ended december 31, 2017 compared to the period march 24, 2016 to december 31, 2016.
taxes other than income increased by $155 million primarily due to increased real estate taxes and sales and use taxes at generation, as well as the inclusion of phi's results for the year ended december 31, 2017 compared to the period march 24, 2016 to december 31, 2016.
gain (loss) on sales of assets increased by $51 million primarily due to certain generation projects and contracts being terminated or renegotiated in 2016, partially offset by a gain associated with generation's sale of the retired new boston generating site in 2016.
bargain purchase gain increased by $233 million due to the gain associated with generation's acquisition of fitzpatrick in 2017.
gain on deconsolidation of business increased by $213 million due to the deconsolidation of egtp's net liabilities, which included the previously impaired assets and related debt, as a result of the november 2017 bankruptcy filing.
interest expense, net increased by $24 million primarily due to the inclusion of phi's results for the year ended december 31, 2017 compared to the period march 24, 2016 to december 31, 2016, partially offset by additional interest related to exelon's like-kind exchange tax position recorded in 2016 compared to 2017.
other, net increased by $643 million primarily due to higher net unrealized and realized gains on ndt funds at generation for the year ended december 31, 2017 as compared to the same period in 2016 and the penalty recorded in 2016 related to exelon's like-kind exchange tax position.
exelon's effective income tax rates for the years ended december 31, 2017 and 2016 were (3.3)% and 38.3%, respectively. exelon's effective income tax rate for the year ended december 31, 2017 includes the impact of the tax cuts and jobs act. see note 14 - income taxes of the combined notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the components of the effective income tax rates.
for further detail regarding the financial results for the years ended december 31, 2017 and 2016, including explanation of the non-gaap measure revenues net of purchased power and fuel expense, see the discussions of results of operations by segment below.
adjusted (non-gaap) operating earnings exelon's adjusted (non-gaap) operating earnings for the year ended december 31, 2017 were $2,471 million, or $2.60 per diluted share, compared with adjusted (non-gaap) operating earnings of $2,488 million, or $2.68 per diluted share, for the same period in 2016. in addition to net income, exelon evaluates its operating performance using the measure of adjusted (non-gaap) operating earnings because management believes it represents earnings directly related to the ongoing operations of the business. adjusted (non-gaap) operating earnings exclude certain costs, expenses, gains and losses and other specified items. this information is intended to enhance an investor's overall understanding of year-to-year operating results and provide an indication of exelon's baseline operating performance excluding items that are considered by management to be not directly related to the ongoing operations of the business. in addition, this information is among the primary indicators management uses as a basis for evaluating performance, allocating resources, setting incentive compensation targets and planning and forecasting of future periods. adjusted (non-gaap) operating earnings is not a presentation defined under gaap and may not be comparable to other companies' presentations or deemed more useful than the gaap information provided elsewhere in this report.

significant 2017 transactions and recent developments corporate tax reform on december 22, 2017, president trump signed the tcja into law. the tcja makes many significant changes to the internal revenue code, including, but not limited to, (1) reducing the u.s. federal corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%; (2) creating a 30% limitation on deductible interest expense (not applicable to regulated utilities); (3) allowing 100% expensing for the cost of qualified property (not applicable to regulated utilities); (4) eliminating the domestic production activities deduction; (5) eliminating the corporate alternative minimum tax and changing how existing alternative minimum tax credits can be realized; and (6) changing rules related to uses and limitations of net operating loss carryforwards created in tax years beginning after december 31, 2017.
the most significant change that impacts the registrants is the reduction of the corporate federal income tax rate from 35% to 21% beginning january 1, 2018. adjusted non-gaap operating earnings per share for exelon is expected to increase by approximately $0.10 on a run-rate basis in 2019 relative to exelon's projections before the tcja.  for the utility registrants, the amount and timing of when certain income tax benefits resulting from the tcja are provided to customers may vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction.
beginning in 2018, generation will incur lower income tax expense, which will decrease its projected effective income tax rate, even with the elimination of the domestic production activities deduction, and increase its net income. generation's operating cash inflows are also expected to increase beginning in 2018 reflecting the lower income tax rates and full expensing of capital investments. generation's projected effective income tax rate in 2018, 2019, and 2020 is expected to be approximately 22%.
beginning in 2018, the utility registrants will incur lower income tax expense, which will generally decrease their projected effective income tax rates. the tcja is expected to lead to lower customer rates over time due to lower income tax expense recoveries and the settlement of deferred income tax net regulatory liabilities. the tcja is expected to lead to an incremental increase in rate base of approximately $1.7 billion by 2020 relative to previous expectations across the utility registrants. the increased rate base will be funded consistent with each utility jurisdiction, using a combination of third party debt financings and equity funding from exelon generally consistent with existing capitalization ratio structures. to fund any additional equity contributions to the utility registrants, exelon would have available to it its typical sources, including, but not limited to, the increased operating cash flows at generation referenced above, which over time are expected to exceed the incremental equity needs at the utility registrants. the tcja is generally expected to result in lower operating cash inflows for the utility registrants as a result of the elimination of bonus depreciation and lower customer rates.
the utility registrants continue to work with their state regulatory commissions to determine the amount and timing of the passing back of tcja income tax savings benefits to customers; with filings either made, or expected to be made, at pepco, dpl and ace, and approved filings at comed and bge. the amounts being passed back or proposed to be passed back to customers reflect the benefit of lower income tax expense beginning january 1, 2018 (feb. 1, 2018 for dpl delaware), and the settlement of a portion of deferred income tax regulatory liabilities established upon enactment of the tcja. to date, neither the papuc nor ferc has yet issued guidance on how and when to reflect the impacts of the tcja in customer rates. refer to note 3 - regulatory matters of the combined notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on their filings.
early nuclear plant retirements on may 30, 2017, generation announced it will permanently cease generation operations at three mile island generating station (tmi) on or about september 30, 2019. the tmi nuclear plant did not clear in the may 2017 pjm capacity auction for the 2020-2021 planning year and will not receive capacity revenue for that period, the third consecutive year that tmi failed to clear the pjm base residual capacity auction. the plant is currently committed to operate through may 2019. in 2017, as a result of the plant retirement decision of tmi, exelon and generation recognized one-time charges in operating and maintenance expense of $77 million related to materials and supplies inventory reserve adjustments, employee-related costs and construction work-in-progress (cwip) impairments, among other items. in addition to these one-time charges, there will be ongoing annual incremental non-cash charges to earnings stemming from shortening the expected economic useful life of tmi primarily related to accelerated depreciation of plant assets (including any asset retirement costs (arc)), accelerated amortization of nuclear fuel, and additional asset retirement obligation (aro) accretion expense associated with the changes in decommissioning timing and cost assumptions. during the year ended december 31, 2017, both exelon's and generation's results include an incremental $262 million of pre-tax expense for these items.
the following table summarizes the estimated annual amount and timing of expected incremental non-cash expense items through 2019.
(a)   actual results may differ based on incremental future capital additions, actual units of production for nuclear fuel amortization, future revised aro assumptions, etc.
(b)   reflects incremental accelerated depreciation of plant assets, including any arc.
on february 2, 2018, exelon announced that generation will permanently cease generation operations at oyster creek at the end of its current operating cycle in october 2018. in 2010, generation announced that oyster creek would retire by the end of 2019 as part of an agreement with the state of new jersey to avoid significant costs associated with the construction of cooling towers to meet the state's then new environmental regulations. since then, like other nuclear sites, oyster creek has continued to face rising operating costs amid a historically low wholesale power price environment. the decision to retire oyster creek in 2018 at the end of its current operating cycle involved consideration of several factors, including economic and operating efficiencies, and avoids a refueling outage scheduled for the fall of 2018 that would have required advanced purchasing of fuel fabrication and materials beginning in late february 2018.
because of the decision to retire oyster creek in 2018, exelon and generation will recognize certain one-time charges in the first quarter of 2018 ranging from an estimated $25 million to $35 million (pre-tax) related to a materials and supplies inventory reserve adjustment, employee-related costs, and construction work-in-progress impairment, among other items. estimated cash expenditures related to the one-time charges primarily for employee-related costs are expected to range from $5 million to $10 million.
in addition to these one-time charges, there will be financial impacts stemming from shortening the expected economic useful life of oyster creek primarily related to accelerated depreciation of plant assets (including any arc), accelerated amortization of nuclear fuel, and additional aro accretion expense associated with the changes in decommissioning timing and cost assumptions to reflect an earlier retirement date. the following table summarizes the estimated amount of expected incremental non-cash expense items expected to be incurred in 2018 because of the early retirement decision.
operating and maintenance increased aro accretion                          up to $5
(a)   includes the accelerated depreciation of plant assets including any arc.
(b)   actual results may differ based on incremental future capital additions, actual units of production for nuclear fuel amortization, future revised aro assumptions, etc.
egtp consent agreement and bankruptcy on may 2, 2017, egtp, an indirect subsidiary of exelon and generation, entered into a consent agreement with its lenders to permit egtp to draw on its revolving credit facility and initiate an orderly sales process to sell the assets of its wholly owned subsidiaries. as a result, exelon and generation classified certain egtp assets and liabilities as held for sale at their respective fair values less costs to sell and recorded a $460 million pre-tax impairment loss during 2017. on november 7, 2017, egtp and all of its wholly owned subsidiaries filed voluntary petitions for relief under chapter 11 of title 11 of the united states code in the united states bankruptcy court for the district of delaware. as a result, exelon and generation deconsolidated egtp's assets and liabilities from their consolidated financial statements and recorded a $213 million pre-tax gain. see note 4 - mergers, acquisitions and dispositions, note 7 - impairment of long-lived assets and intangibles and note 13 - debt and credit agreements of the combined notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding egtp and the associated nonrecourse debt.
acquisition of james a. fitzpatrick nuclear generating station on march 31, 2017, generation acquired the 842 mw single-unit james a. fitzpatrick (fitzpatrick) nuclear generating station for a total purchase price of $289 million. in accounting for the acquisition as a business combination, exelon and generation recorded an after-tax bargain purchase gain of $233 million which is included within exelon's and generation's consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income. see note 4 - mergers, acquisitions and dispositions of the combined notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the generation's acquisition of fitzpatrick and related costs.
illinois future energy jobs act on december 7, 2016, feja was signed into law by the governor of illinois. feja was effective on june 1, 2017, and includes, among other provisions, (1) a zero emission standard (zes) providing compensation for certain nuclear-powered generating facilities, (2) an extension of and certain adjustments to comed's electric distribution formula rate, (3) new cumulative persisting annual energy efficiency mwh savings goals for comed, (4) revisions to the illinois rps requirements, (5) provisions for adjustments to or termination of feja programs if the average impact on comed's customer rates
exceeds specified limits, (6) revisions to the existing net metering statute and (7) support for low income rooftop and community solar programs. feja establishes new or adjusts existing rate recovery mechanisms for comed to recover costs associated with the new or expanded energy efficiency and rps requirements. regulatory or legal challenges over the validity of feja are possible. see note 3 - regulatory matters of the combined notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding feja. see note 8 - early nuclear plant retirements of the combined notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the economic challenges facing generation's clinton and quad cities nuclear plants and the expected benefits of the zes.
illinois zec procurement on january 25, 2018, the icc announced that generation's clinton unit 1, quad cities unit 1 and quad cities unit 2 nuclear plants were selected as the winning bidders through the ipa's zec procurement event. generation executed the zec procurement contracts with illinois utilities, including comed, effective january 26, 2018 and will begin recognizing revenue. winning bidders will be entitled to compensation for the sale of zecs retroactive to the june 1, 2017 effective date of feja. in the first quarter of 2018, generation will recognize approximately $150 million of revenue and comed will record an obligation to generation and corresponding reduction to its regulatory liability of approximately $100 million related to zecs generated from june 1, 2017 through december 31, 2017.
dismissal of litigation challenging zec programs on july 14, 2017, the u.s. district court for the northern district of illinois dismissed two lawsuits challenging the zec program contained in feja. on july 17, 2017, the plaintiffs appealed the court's decisions to the u.s. court of appeals for the seventh circuit. briefs were fully submitted on december 12, 2017 and the court heard oral argument on january 3, 2018. at the argument, the court asked for supplemental briefing, which was filed on january 26, 2018.
additionally, on july 25, 2017, the u.s. district court for the southern district of new york dismissed a lawsuit challenging the zec program contained in the new york ces. on august 24, 2017, the plaintiffs appealed the decision to the second circuit. briefing in the appeal was completed in december 2017, and oral argument is expected to take place in march 2018.
in addition, on november 30, 2016, a group of parties, including certain environmental groups and individuals, filed a petition in new york state court seeking to invalidate the zec program. the petition, which was amended on january 13, 2017, argued that the nypsc did not have authority to establish the program and that it violated certain technical provisions of the state administrative procedures act (sapa) when adopting the zec program. on february 15, 2017, generation and ceng filed a motion to dismiss the state court action. the nypsc also filed a motion to dismiss the state court action. on march 24, 2017, the plaintiffs filed a memorandum of law opposing the motions to dismiss, and generation and ceng filed a reply brief on april 28, 2017. oral argument was held on june 19, 2017. on january 22, 2018, the court denied the motions to dismiss without commenting on the merits of the case. the case will now proceed to summary judgment upon filing of the full record.
the court decisions to date have upheld the zec programs which support illinois's and new york's efforts to advance clean energy and preserve affordable and reliable energy resources for customers. see note 3 - regulatory matters of the combined notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding feja and the new york ces.
merger commitment unrecognized tax benefits exelon established a liability for an uncertain tax position associated with the tax deductibility of certain merger commitments incurred by exelon in connection with the acquisitions of constellation in 2012 and phi in 2016. in the first quarter 2017, as a part of its examination of exelon's return, the irs
national office issued guidance concurring with exelon's position that the merger commitments were deductible. as a result, exelon, generation, phi, pepco, dpl and ace decreased their liability for unrecognized tax benefits by $146 million, $19 million, $59 million, $21 million, $16 million, and $22 million, respectively, as of december 31, 2017, resulting in a benefit to income taxes on exelon's, generation's, phi's, pepco's, dpl's and ace's consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income and corresponding decreases in their effective tax rates.
combined-cycle gas turbine projects in june 2017, generation commenced commercial operations of two new combined-cycle gas turbines (ccgts) at the colorado bend ii and wolf hollow ii generating stations in texas. the two new ccgts have added nearly 2,200 mws of capacity to generation's fleet, enhancing generation's strategy to match generation to customer load.  generation invested approximately $1.5 billion over the past three years to complete the new plant construction, which utilizes new general electric technology to make them among the cleanest, most efficient ccgts in the nation.
utility rates and rate proceedings the utility registrants file rate cases with their regulatory commissions seeking increases or decreases to their electric transmission and distribution, and gas distribution rates to recover their costs and earn a fair return on their investments. the outcomes of these regulatory proceedings impact the utility registrants' current and future results of operations, cash flows and financial position.
pepco     district of columbia (electric)                                   $37                                     9.5              %         july 25, 2017        august 15, 2017
(a)   pursuant to eima, comed's electric distribution rates are established through a performance-based formula through which comed is required to file an annual update on or before may 1, with resulting rates effective in january of the following year. comed's annual electric distribution formula rate update is based on prior year actual costs and current year projected capital additions (initial year revenue requirement). the update also reconciles any differences between the revenue requirement in effect for the prior year and actual costs incurred for the year (annual reconciliation).
(b)   reflects an increase of $78 million for the initial revenue requirement for 2017 and an increase of $18 million related to the annual reconciliation.
(c)   comed's allowed roe under its electric distribution formula rate is the annual average rate on 30-year treasury notes plus 580 basis points and is subject to reduction if comed does not deliver certain reliability and customer service benefits. the initial revenue requirement for 2017 reflects an allowed roe of 8.40%, while the annual reconciliation reflects an allowed roe of 8.34%, which is inclusive of a 6-basis-point performance penalty.
pepco     district of columbia (electric)                                     $66                       (b)               10.1   %                     december 19, 2017                               fourth quarter 2018
(b)   by mid-february, pepco and dpl will update their current distribution rate cases to reflect the tcja impacts.
(c)   on december 18, 2017, a settlement agreement was filed with the mdpsc wherein dpl will be granted a rate increase of $13 million, and a roe of 9.5% solely for purposes of calculating afudc and regulatory asset carrying costs. on january 5, 2018, the mdpsc held a hearing on the settlement agreement. dpl expects a decision in the matter in the first quarter of 2018, but cannot predict whether the mdpsc will approve the settlement agreement as filed or how much of the requested increase will be approved.
(b)   bge's transmission revenues include a ferc approved dedicated facilities charge to recover the costs of providing transmission service to specifically designated load by bge.
(d)   as part of the ferc-approved settlement of comed's 2007 transmission rate case, the rate of return on common equity is 11.50%, inclusive of a 50-basis-point incentive adder for being a member of a rto, and the common equity component of the ratio used to calculate the weighted average debt and equity return for the transmission formula rate is currently capped at 55%. as part of the ferc-approved settlement of the roe complaint against bge, pepco, dpl and ace, the rate of return on common equity is 10.50%, inclusive of a 50-basis-point incentive adder for being a member of a rto.
peco transmission formula rate. on may 1, 2017, peco filed a request with ferc seeking approval to update its transmission rates and change the manner in which peco's transmission rate is determined from a fixed rate to a formula rate. the formula rate would be updated annually to ensure that under this rate customers pay the actual costs of providing transmission services. the formula rate filing includes a requested increase of $22 million to peco's annual transmission revenues and a requested rate of return on common equity of 11%, inclusive of a 50-basis-point adder for being a member of a regional transmission organization. peco requested that the new transmission rate be effective as of july 2017. on june 27, 2017, ferc issued an order accepting the filing and suspending the proposed rates until december 1, 2017, subject to refund, and set the matter for hearing and settlement judge procedures. peco cannot predict the final outcome of the settlement or hearing proceedings, or the transmission formula ferc may approve.
see note 3 - regulatory matters of the combined notes to consolidated financial statements for further details on these regulatory proceedings.
westinghouse electric company llc bankruptcy on march 29, 2017, westinghouse electric company llc (westinghouse) and its affiliated debtors filed petitions for relief under chapter 11 of the bankruptcy code in the u.s. bankruptcy court for the southern district of new york. in the petitions and supporting documents, westinghouse makes clear that its requests for relief center on one business area that is losing money - the construction of nuclear power plants in georgia and south carolina. on january 4, 2018, westinghouse announced its agreement to be acquired by brookfield business partners. the deal, which requires bankruptcy court and regulatory approvals, is expected to close in in the third quarter of 2018. brookfield has informally indicated to generation that it will assume all of exelon's contracts with westinghouse. generation is monitoring the bankruptcy and pending sale proceedings to ensure that its rights are protected.
exgen renewables holdings, llc transaction on july 6, 2017, exgen renewables holdings, llc, a wholly owned subsidiary of generation, completed the sale of a 49% interest of exgen renewables partners, llc, a newly formed owner and operator of approximately 1,439 megawatts of generation's operating wind and solar electric generating facilities. exgen renewables holdings will be the managing member of exgen renewables partners, llc, and have day-to-day control and management over its renewable generation portfolio. the closing of the transaction was subject to certain regulatory approvals, including the federal energy regulatory commission (ferc) and the public utility commission of texas (puct) which were received during the second quarter of 2017. the sale price was $400 million plus immaterial working capital and other customary post-closing adjustments. the net proceeds, after approximately $100 million of income taxes, will be used to pay down debt and for general corporate purposes. generation will continue to consolidate exgen renewables partners, llc and will record a noncontrolling interest on its consolidated balance sheet for the investor's equity share as well as earnings attributable to the noncontrolling interest in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income each period going forward.
hurricanes harvey, irma and maria impacts although exelon subsidiaries provided substantial assistance to recovery efforts following hurricanes harvey and irma, hurricanes harvey, irma and maria are not expected to have a material impact on the registrants' businesses or financial results given the limited operations in the areas affected by the storms.
exelon's strategy and outlook for 2018 and beyond exelon's value proposition and competitive advantage come from its scope and its core strengths of operational excellence and financial discipline. exelon leverages its integrated business model to create value. exelon's regulated and competitive businesses feature a mix of attributes that, when combined, offer shareholders and customers a unique value proposition:
•   generation's competitive businesses provide free cash flow to invest primarily in the utilities and in long-term, contracted assets and to reduce debt.
exelon believes its strategy provides a platform for optimal success in an energy industry experiencing fundamental and sweeping change.
exelon's utility strategy is to improve reliability and operations and enhance the customer experience, while ensuring ratemaking mechanisms provide the utilities fair financial returns. the exelon utilities only invest in rate base where it provides a benefit to customers and the community by improving reliability and the service experience or otherwise meeting customer needs. the exelon utilities make these investments at the lowest reasonable cost to customers. exelon seeks to leverage its scale and expertise across the utilities platform through enhanced standardization and sharing of resources and best practices to achieve improved operational and financial results. additionally, the utility registrants anticipate making significant future investments in smart meter technology, transmission projects, gas infrastructure, and electric system improvement projects, providing greater reliability and improved service for our customers and a stable return for the company.
generation's competitive businesses create value for customers by providing innovative energy solutions and reliable, clean and affordable energy. generation's electricity generation strategy is to pursue opportunities that provide stable revenues and generation to load matching to reduce earnings volatility. generation leverages its energy generation portfolio to deliver energy to both wholesale and retail customers. generation's customer-facing activities foster development and delivery of other innovative energy-related products and services for its customers. generation operates in well-developed energy markets and employs an integrated hedging strategy to manage commodity price volatility. its generation fleet, including its nuclear plants which consistently operate at high capacity factors, also provide geographic and supply source diversity. these factors help generation mitigate the current challenging conditions in competitive energy markets.
exelon's financial priorities are to maintain investment grade credit metrics at each of the registrants, to maintain optimal capital structure and to return value to exelon's shareholders with an attractive dividend throughout the energy commodity market cycle and through stable earnings growth. exelon's board of directors approved an updated dividend policy providing an increase of 5% each year for the period covering 2018 through 2020, beginning with the march 2018 dividend.
various market, financial, regulatory, legislative and operational factors could affect the registrants' success in pursuing their strategies. exelon continues to assess infrastructure, operational, commercial, policy, and legal solutions to these issues. one key issue is ensuring the ability to properly value nuclear generation assets in the market, solutions to which exelon is actively pursuing in a variety of jurisdictions and venues. see item 1a. risk factors for additional information regarding market and financial factors.
continually optimizing the cost structure is a key component of exelon's financial strategy.  in august 2015, exelon announced a cost management program focused on cost savings of approximately $400 million at bsc and generation, of which approximately 60% of run-rate savings was achieved by the
end of 2017 with the remainder to be fully realized in 2018.  at least 75% of the savings are expected to be related to generation, with the remaining amount related to the utility registrants. additionally, in november 2017, exelon announced a new commitment for an additional $250 million of cost savings, primarily at generation, to be achieved by 2020. these actions are in response to the continuing economic challenges confronting all parts of exelon's business and industry, necessitating continued focus on cost management through enhanced efficiency and productivity.
growth opportunities management continually evaluates growth opportunities aligned with exelon's businesses, assets and markets, leveraging exelon's expertise in those areas and offering sustainable returns.
regulated energy businesses. the phi merger provides an opportunity to accelerate exelon's regulated growth to provide stable cash flows, earnings accretion, and dividend support.  additionally, the utility registrants anticipate investing approximately $26 billion over the next five years in electric and natural gas infrastructure improvements and modernization projects, including smart meter and smart grid initiatives, storm hardening, advanced reliability technologies, and transmission projects, which is projected to result in an increase to current rate base of approximately $15 billion by the end of 2022. the utility registrants invest in rate base where beneficial to customers and the community by increasing reliability and the service experience or otherwise meeting customer needs. these investments are made at the lowest reasonable cost to customers.
see note 3 - regulatory matters of the combined notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information on the smart meter and smart grid initiatives and infrastructure development and enhancement programs.
competitive energy businesses. generation continually assesses the optimal structure and composition of its generation assets as well as explores wholesale and retail opportunities within the power and gas sectors. generation's long-term growth strategy is to ensure appropriate valuation of its generation assets, in part through public policy efforts, identify and capitalize on opportunities that provide generation to load matching as a means to provide stable earnings, and identify emerging technologies where strategic investments provide the option for significant future growth or influence in market development.
liquidity considerations each of the registrants annually evaluates its financing plan, dividend practices and credit line sizing, focusing on maintaining its investment grade ratings while meeting its cash needs to fund capital requirements, retire debt, pay dividends, fund pension and opeb obligations and invest in new and existing ventures. a broad spectrum of financing alternatives beyond the core financing options can be used to meet its needs and fund growth including monetizing assets in the portfolio via project financing, asset sales, and the use of other financing structures (e.g., joint ventures, minority partners, etc.). the registrants expect cash flows to be sufficient to meet operating expenses, financing costs and capital expenditure requirements.
exelon, generation, comed, peco, bge, pepco, dpl and ace have unsecured syndicated revolving credit facilities with aggregate bank commitments of $0.6 billion, $5.3 billion, $1.0 billion, $0.6 billion, $0.6 billion, $0.5 billion, $0.5 billion and $0.4 billion, respectively. generation also has bilateral credit facilities with aggregate maximum availability of $0.5 billion. see liquidity and capital resources - credit matters - exelon credit facilities below.
for further detail regarding the registrants' liquidity for the year ended december 31, 2017, see liquidity and capital resources discussion below.
project financing generation utilizes individual project financings as a means to finance the construction of various generating asset projects. project financing is based upon a nonrecourse financial structure, in which project debt and equity used to finance the project are paid back from the cash generated by the newly constructed asset once operational. borrowings under these agreements are secured by the assets and equity of each respective project. the lenders do not have recourse against exelon or generation in the event of a default. if a specific project financing entity does not maintain compliance with its specific debt financing covenants, there could be a requirement to accelerate repayment of the associated debt or other project-related borrowings earlier than the stated maturity dates. in these instances, if such repayment was not satisfied, or restructured, the lenders or security holders would generally have rights to foreclose against the project-specific assets and related collateral. the potential requirement to satisfy its associated debt or other borrowings earlier than otherwise anticipated could lead to impairments due to a higher likelihood of disposing of the respective project-specific assets significantly before the end of their useful lives. see note 13 - debt and credit agreements of the combined notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on nonrecourse debt.
other key business drivers and management strategies utility rates and rate proceedings the utility registrants file rate cases with their regulatory commissions seeking increases or decreases to their electric transmission and distribution, and gas distribution rates to recover their costs and earn a fair return on their investments. the outcomes of these regulatory proceedings impact the utility registrants' current and future results of operations, cash flows and financial positions. see note 3 - regulatory matters of the combined notes to consolidated financial statements for further details on these regulatory proceedings.
power markets price of fuels the use of new technologies to recover natural gas from shale deposits is increasing natural gas supply and reserves, which places downward pressure on natural gas prices and, therefore, on wholesale and retail power prices, which results in a reduction in exelon's revenues. forward natural gas prices have declined significantly over the last several years; in part reflecting an increase in supply due to strong natural gas production (due to shale gas development).
capacity market changes in pjm in the wake of the january 2014 polar vortex that blanketed much of the eastern and midwestern united states, it became clear that while a major outage event was narrowly avoided, resources in pjm were not providing the level of reliability expected by customers. as a result, on december 12, 2014, pjm filed at ferc a proposal to make significant changes to its current capacity market construct, the reliability pricing model (rpm). pjm's proposed changes generally sought to improve resource performance and reliability largely by limiting the excuses for non-performance and by increasing the penalties for performance failures. the proposal permits suppliers to include in capacity market offers additional costs and risk so they can meet these higher performance requirements. while offers are expected to put upward pressure on capacity clearing prices, operational improvements made as a result of pjm's proposal are expected to improve reliability, to reduce energy production costs as a result of more efficient operations and to reduce the need for out of market energy payments to suppliers. generation participated actively in pjm's stakeholder process through which pjm developed the proposal and also actively participated in the ferc proceeding including filing comments. on june 9,
2015, ferc approved pjm's filing largely as proposed by pjm, including transitional auction rules for delivery years 2016/2017 through 2017/2018. as a result of this and several related orders, pjm hosted its 2018/2019 base residual auction (results posted on august 21, 2015) and its transitional auction for delivery year 2016/2017 (results posted on august 31, 2015) and its transitional auction for delivery years 2017/2018 (results posted on september 9, 2015). on may 10, 2016, ferc largely denied rehearing, and a number of parties appealed to the u.s. court of appeals for the dc circuit for review of the decision. on june 20, 2017, the dc circuit denied all the appeals.
miso capacity market results on april 14, 2015, the miso released the results of its capacity auction covering the june 2015 through may 2016 delivery year.  as a result of the auction, capacity prices for the zone 4 region in downstate illinois increased to $150 per mw per day beginning in june 2015, an increase from the prior pricing of $16.75 per mw per day that was in effect from june 2014 to may 2015. generation had an offer that was selected in the auction. however, due to generation's ratable hedging strategy, the results of the capacity auction have not had a material impact on exelon's and generation's consolidated results of operations and cash flows.
additionally, in late may and june 2015, separate complaints were filed at the ferc by each of the state of illinois, the southwest electric cooperative, public citizens, inc., and the illinois industrial energy consumers challenging the results of this miso capacity auction for the 2015/2016 delivery in miso delivery zone 4. the complaints allege generally that 1) the results of the capacity auction for zone 4 are not just and reasonable, 2) the results should be suspended, set for hearing and replaced with a new just and reasonable rate, 3) a refund date should be established and that 4) certain alleged behavior by one of the market participants other than exelon or generation, be investigated.
on october 1, 2015, ferc announced that it was conducting a non-public investigation (that does not involve exelon or generation) into whether market manipulation or other potential violations occurred related to the auction. on december 31, 2015, ferc issued a decision that certain of the rules governing the establishment of capacity prices in downstate illinois are "not just and reasonable" on a prospective basis. ferc ordered that certain rules be changed prior to the april 2016 auction which set capacity prices for the 2016/2017 planning year. in response to this order, miso filed certain rule changes with ferc. on march 18, 2016, ferc largely denied rehearing of its december 31, 2015 order. ferc continues to conduct its non-public investigation to determine if the april 2015 auction results were manipulated and, if so, whether refunds are appropriate. ferc did establish may 28, 2015, the day the first complaint was filed, as the date from which refunds (if ordered) would be calculated, and it also made clear that the findings in the december 31, 2015 order do not prejudge the investigation or related proceedings. generation cannot predict the impact the ferc order may ultimately have on future auction results, capacity pricing or decisions related to the potential early retirement of the clinton nuclear plant, however, such impacts could be material to generation's future results of operations and cash flows. see note 8 - early nuclear plant retirements of the combined notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on the impacts of the miso announcement.
complaints at ferc seeking to mitigate illinois and new york programs providing zecs pjm and nyiso capacity markets include a minimum offer price rule (mopr) that is intended to preclude buyers from exercising buyer market power. if a resource is subjected to a mopr, its offer is adjusted to remove the revenues it receives through a federal, state or other government-provided financial support program - resulting in a higher offer that may not clear the capacity market. currently, the moprs in pjm and nyiso apply only to certain new resources. exelon has generally opposed policies that require subsidies or give preferential treatment to generation providers or technologies that do not provide superior reliability or environmental benefits, or that would threaten the reliability and value of the integrated electricity grid. thus, exelon has supported a mopr as a means of minimizing the detrimental impact certain subsidized resources could have on capacity markets (such as the new
jersey (lcapp) and maryland (cfd) programs). however, in exelon's view, moprs should not be applied to resources that receive compensation for providing superior reliability or environmental benefits.
on january 9, 2017, the electric power supply association (epsa) filed two requests with ferc: one seeking to amend a prior complaint against pjm and another seeking expedited action on a pending nyiso compliance filing in an existing proceeding. both filings allege that the relevant mopr should be expanded to also apply to existing resources receiving zec compensation under the new york ces and illinois zes programs. the epsa parties have filed motions to expedite both proceedings. exelon has filed protests at ferc in response to each filing, arguing generally that zec payments provide compensation for an environmental attribute that is distinct from the energy and capacity sold in the ferc-jurisdictional markets, and therefore, are no different than other renewable support programs like the ptc and rps that have generally not been subject to a mopr. however, if successful, for generation's facilities in nyiso and pjm expected to receive zec compensation (quad cities, ginna, nine mile point and fitzpatrick), an expanded mopr could require exclusion of zec compensation when bidding into future capacity auctions such that these facilities would have an increased risk of not clearing in those auctions and thus no longer receiving capacity revenues during the respective zec programs. any such mitigation of these generating resources could have a material effect on exelon's and generation's future cash flows and results of operations. on august 30, 2017, epsa filed motions to lodge the district court decisions dismissing the complaints and urging ferc to act expeditiously on its requests to expand the mopr. on september 14, 2017, exelon filed a response in each docket noting that it does not oppose the motions to lodge but arguing that the requests to expedite a decision on the requests to expand the mopr have no merit. the timing of ferc's decision with respect to both proceedings is currently unknown and the outcome of these matters is currently uncertain.
doe notice of proposed rulemaking on august 23, 2017, the doe staff released its report on the reliability of the electric grid. one aspect of the wide-ranging report is the doe's recognition that the electricity markets do not currently value the resiliency provided by baseload generation, such as nuclear plants. on september 28, 2017, the doe issued a notice of proposed rulemaking (nopr) that would entitle certain eligible resilient generating units (i.e., those located in organized markets, with a 90-day supply of fuel on site, not already subject to state cost of service regulation and satisfying certain other requirements) to recover fully allocated costs and earn a fair return on equity on their investment. the doe's nopr recommended that the ferc take comments for 45 days after publication in the federal register and issue a final order 60 days after such publication.  on january 8, 2018, the ferc issued an order terminating the rulemaking docket that was initiated to address the proposed rule in the doe nopr, concluding the proposed rule did not sufficiently demonstrate there is a resiliency issue and that it proposed a remedy that did not appear to be just, reasonable and nondiscriminatory as required under the federal power act. at the same time, the ferc initiated a new proceeding to consider resiliency challenges to the bulk power system and evaluate whether additional ferc action to address resiliency would be appropriate. the ferc directed each rto and iso to respond within 60 days to 24 specific questions about how they assess and mitigate threats to resiliency. interested parties may submit reply comments within 30 days after the due date of the rto/iso responses. exelon has been and will continue to be an active participant in these proceedings, but cannot predict the final outcome or its potential financial impact, if any, on exelon or generation.
energy demand modest economic growth partially offset by energy efficiency initiatives is resulting in flat to declining load growth in electricity for the utilities. there is decrease in projected load for electricity for comed, peco, bge, and dpl, and an increase in projected load for electricity for pepco and ace. comed, peco, bge, pepco, dpl, and ace are projecting load volumes to increase (decrease) by (0.5)%, (0.5)%, (0.6)%, 1.5%, (1.5)% and 1.5%, respectively, in 2018 compared to 2017.
retail competition generation's retail operations compete for customers in a competitive environment, which affect the margins that generation can earn and the volumes that it is able to serve. the market experienced high price volatility in the first quarter of 2014 which contributed to bankruptcies and consolidations within the industry during the year. however, forward natural gas and power prices are expected to remain low and thus we expect retail competitors to stay aggressive in their pursuit of market share, and that wholesale generators (including generation) will continue to use their retail operations to hedge generation output.
strategic policy alignment as part of its strategic business planning process, exelon routinely reviews its hedging policy, dividend policy, operating and capital costs, capital spending plans, strength of its balance sheet and credit metrics, and sufficiency of its liquidity position, by performing various stress tests with differing variables, such as commodity price movements, increases in margin-related transactions, changes in hedging practices, and the impacts of hypothetical credit downgrades.
exelon's board of directors declared first, second, third and fourth quarter 2017 dividends of $0.3275 per share each on exelon's common stock, and the first quarter 2018 dividends declared was $0.3450 per share. the dividends for the first, second, third and fourth quarter 2017 were paid on march 10, 2017, june 9, 2017, september 8, 2017 and december 8, 2017, respectively. the first quarter 2018 dividend is payable on march 9, 2018.
exelon's board of directors approved an updated dividend policy providing an increase of 5% each year for the period covering 2018 through 2020, beginning with the march 2018 dividend.
hedging strategy exelon's policy to hedge commodity risk on a ratable basis over three-year periods is intended to reduce the financial impact of market price volatility. generation is exposed to commodity price risk associated with the unhedged portion of its electricity portfolio. generation enters into non-derivative and derivative contracts, including financially-settled swaps, futures contracts and swap options, and physical options and physical forward contracts, all with credit-approved counterparties, to hedge this anticipated exposure. generation has hedges in place that significantly mitigate this risk for 2018 and 2019. however, generation is exposed to relatively greater commodity price risk in the subsequent years with respect to which a larger portion of its electricity portfolio is currently unhedged. as of december 31, 2017, the percentage of expected generation hedged is 85%-88%, 55%-58% and 26%-29% for 2018, 2019, and 2020 respectively. the percentage of expected generation hedged is the amount of equivalent sales divided by the expected generation. expected generation is the volume of energy that best represents our commodity position in energy markets from owned or contracted generating facilities based upon a simulated dispatch model that makes assumptions regarding future market conditions, which are calibrated to market quotes for power, fuel, load following products, and options. equivalent sales represent all hedging products, such as wholesale and retail sales of power, options and swaps. generation has been and will continue to be proactive in using hedging strategies to mitigate commodity price risk in subsequent years as well.
generation procures oil and natural gas through long-term and short-term contracts and spot-market purchases. nuclear fuel is obtained predominantly through long-term uranium concentrate supply contracts, contracted conversion services, contracted enrichment services, or a combination thereof, and contracted fuel fabrication services. the supply markets for uranium concentrates and certain nuclear fuel services, coal, oil and natural gas are subject to price fluctuations and availability restrictions. supply market conditions may make generation's procurement contracts subject to credit risk related to the potential non-performance of counterparties to deliver the contracted commodity or service at the
contracted prices. approximately 59% of generation's uranium concentrate requirements from 2018 through 2022 are supplied by three producers. in the event of non-performance by these or other suppliers, generation believes that replacement uranium concentrate can be obtained, although at prices that may be unfavorable when compared to the prices under the current supply agreements. non-performance by these counterparties could have a material adverse impact on exelon's and generation's results of operations, cash flows and financial positions.
the utility registrants mitigate commodity price risk through regulatory mechanisms that allow them to recover procurement costs from retail customers.
environmental legislative and regulatory developments exelon was actively involved in the obama administration's development and implementation of environmental regulations for the electric industry, in pursuit of its business strategy to provide reliable, clean, affordable and innovative energy products. these efforts have most frequently involved air, water and waste controls for fossil-fueled electric generating units, as set forth in the discussion below. these regulations have had a disproportionate adverse impact on coal-fired power plants, requiring significant expenditures of capital and variable operating and maintenance expense, and have resulted in the retirement of older, marginal facilities. due to its low emission generation portfolio, generation has not been significantly affected by these regulations, representing a competitive advantage relative to electric generators that are more reliant on fossil fuel plants.
through the issuance of a series of executive orders (eo), president trump has initiated review of a number of epa and other regulations issued during the obama administration, with the expectation that the administration will seek repeal or significant revision of these rules. under these eos, each executive agency is required to evaluate existing regulations and make recommendations regarding repeal, replacement, or modification. the administration's actions are intended to result in less stringent compliance requirements under air, water, and waste regulations. the exact nature, extent, and timing of the regulatory changes are unknown, as well as the ultimate impact on exelon's and its subsidiaries results of operations and cash flows.
in particular, the administration has targeted existing epa regulations for repeal, including notably the clean power plan, as well as revoking many executive orders, reports, and guidance issued by the obama administration on the topic of climate change or the regulation of greenhouse gases. the executive order also disbanded the interagency working group that developed the social cost of carbon used in rulemakings, and withdrew all technical support documents supporting the calculation. other regulations that have been specifically identified for review are the clean water act rule relating to jurisdictional waters of the u.s., the steam electric effluent guidelines relating to waste water discharges from coal-fired power plants, and the 2015 national ambient air quality standard (naaqs) for ozone. the review of final rules could extend over several years as formal notice and comment rulemaking process proceeds.
air quality mercury and air toxics standard rule (mats). on december 16, 2011, the epa signed a final rule to reduce emissions of toxic air pollutants from power plants and signed revisions to the nsps for electric generating units. the final rule, known as mats, requires coal-fired electric generation plants to achieve high removal rates of mercury, acid gases and other metals, and to make capital investments in pollution control equipment and incur higher operating expenses. the initial compliance deadline to meet the new standards was april 16, 2015; however, facilities may have been granted an additional one or two-year extension in limited cases. numerous entities challenged mats in the d.c. circuit court, and exelon intervened in support of the rule. in april 2014, the d.c. circuit court issued an opinion upholding mats in its entirety. on appeal, the u.s. supreme court decided in june 2015 that the epa unreasonably refused to consider costs in determining whether it is appropriate and necessary to regulate
hazardous air pollutants emitted by electric utilities. the u.s. supreme court, however, did not vacate the rule; rather, it was remanded to the d.c. circuit court to take further action consistent with the u.s. supreme court's opinion on this single issue. on april 27, 2017, the d.c. circuit granted epa's motion to hold the litigation in abeyance, pending epa's review of the mats rule pursuant to president trump's eo discussed above. following epa's review and determination of its course of action for the mats rule, the parties will have 30 days to file motions on future proceedings. notwithstanding the court's order to hold the litigation in abeyance, the mats rule remains in effect. exelon will continue to participate in the remanded proceedings before the d.c. circuit court as an intervenor in support of the rule.
clean power plan. on april 28, 2017, the d.c. circuit court issued orders in separate litigation related to the epa's actions under the clean power plan (cpp) to amend clean air act section 111(d) regulation of existing fossil-fired electric generating units and section 111(b) regulation of new fossil-fired electric generating units. in both cases, the court has determined to hold the litigation in abeyance pending a determination whether the rule should be remanded to the epa. on october 10, 2017, epa issued a proposed rule to repeal the cpp in its entirety, based on a proposed change in the agency's legal interpretation of clean air act section 111(d) regarding actions that the agency can consider when establishing the best system of emission reduction ("bser") for existing power plants. under the proposed interpretation, the agency exceeded its authority under the clean air act by regulating beyond individual sources of ghg emissions. the epa has also indicated its intent to issue an advance notice of proposed rulemaking to solicit information on systems of emission reduction that are in accord with the agency's proposed revised legal interpretation; namely, only by regulating emission reductions that can be implemented at and to individual sources.
2015 ozone national ambient air quality standards (naaqs). on april 11, 2017, the d.c. circuit ordered that the consolidated 2015 ozone naaqs litigation be held in abeyance pending epa's further review of the 2015 rule. epa did not meet the october 1, 2017 deadline to promulgate initial designations for areas in attainment or non-attainment of the standard. a number of states and environmental organizations have notified the epa of their intent to file suit to compel epa to issue the designations.
climate change. exelon supports comprehensive climate change legislation or regulation, including a cap-and-trade program for ghg emissions, which balances the need to protect consumers, business and the economy with the urgent need to reduce national ghg emissions. in the absence of federal legislation, the epa is moving forward with the regulation of ghg emissions under the clean air act. in addition, there have been recent developments in the international regulation of ghg emissions pursuant to the united nations framework convention on climate change ("unfccc" or "convention"). see item 1. business, "global climate change" for further discussion.
water quality section 316(b) requires that the cooling water intake structures at electric power plants reflect the best technology available to minimize adverse environmental impacts, and is implemented through state-level npdes permit programs. all of generation's power generation facilities with cooling water systems are subject to the regulations. facilities without closed-cycle recirculating systems (e.g., cooling towers) are potentially most affected by recent changes to the regulations. for generation, those facilities are calvert cliffs, clinton, dresden, eddystone, fairless hills, fitzpatrick, ginna, gould street, mountain creek, handley, mystic 7, nine mile point unit 1, peach bottom, quad cities, and salem. see item 1. business, "water quality" for further discussion.
solid and hazardous waste in october 2015, the first federal regulation for the disposal of coal combustion residuals (ccr) from power plants became effective. the rule classifies ccr as non-hazardous waste under rcra. under the regulation, ccr will continue to be regulated by most states subject to coordination with the
federal regulations. generation has previously recorded accruals consistent with state regulation for its owned coal ash sites, and as such, the regulation is not expected to impact exelon's and generation's financial results. generation does not have sufficient information to reasonably assess the potential likelihood or magnitude of any remediation requirements that may be asserted under the new federal regulations for coal ash disposal sites formerly owned by generation. for these reasons, generation is unable to predict whether and to what extent it may ultimately be held responsible for remediation and other costs relating to formerly owned coal ash disposal sites under the new regulations.
see note 23 - commitments and contingencies of the combined notes to consolidated financial statements for further detail related to environmental matters, including the impact of environmental regulation.
employees in january 2017, an election was held at bge which resulted in union representation for approximately 1,394 employees. bge and ibew local 410 are negotiating an initial agreement which could result in some modifications to wages, hours and other terms and conditions of employment. no agreement has been finalized to date and management cannot predict the outcome of such negotiations. in april 2017, exelon nuclear security successfully ratified its cba with the spfpa local 238 at quad cities to an extension of three years. in june 2017, exelon nuclear security successfully ratified its cba with the ugsoa local 12 at limerick to an extension of three years.
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires that management apply accounting policies and make estimates and assumptions that affect results of operations and the amounts of assets and liabilities reported in the financial statements. management discusses these policies, estimates and assumptions with its accounting and disclosure governance committee on a regular basis and provides periodic updates on management decisions to the audit committee of the exelon board of directors. management believes that the accounting policies described below require significant judgment in their application, or incorporate estimates and assumptions that are inherently uncertain and that may change in subsequent periods. additional discussion of the application of these accounting policies can be found in the combined notes to consolidated financial statements.
nuclear decommissioning asset retirement obligations (exelon and generation)
generation's aro associated with decommissioning its nuclear units was $9.7 billion at december 31, 2017. the authoritative guidance requires that generation estimate its obligation for the future decommissioning of its nuclear generating plants. to estimate that liability, generation uses an internally-developed, probability-weighted, discounted cash flow model which, on a unit-by-unit basis, considers multiple decommissioning outcome scenarios.
as a result of recent nuclear plant retirements in the industry, nuclear operators and third-party service providers are obtaining more information about costs associated with decommissioning activities. at the same time, regulators are gaining more information about decommissioning activities which could result in changes to existing decommissioning requirements. in addition, as more nuclear plants are retired, it is possible that technological advances will be identified that could create efficiencies and lead to a reduction in decommissioning costs. the availability of decommissioning trust funds could impact the timing of the decommissioning activities. additionally, certain factors such as changes in regulatory requirements during plant operations or the profitability of a nuclear plant could impact the timing of plant retirements. these factors could result in material changes to generation's current estimates as more information becomes available and could change the timing of plant retirements and the probability assigned to the decommissioning outcome scenarios.
the nuclear decommissioning obligation is adjusted on a regular basis due to the passage of time and revisions to the key assumptions for the expected timing and/or estimated amounts of the future undiscounted cash flows required to decommission the nuclear plants, based upon the following methodologies and significant estimates and assumptions:
decommissioning cost studies generation uses unit-by-unit decommissioning cost studies to provide a marketplace assessment of the expected costs (in current year dollars) and timing of decommissioning activities, which are validated by comparison to current decommissioning projects within the industry and other estimates. decommissioning cost studies are updated, on a rotational basis, for each of generation's nuclear units at least every five years, unless circumstances warrant more frequent updates (such as a change in assumed operating life for a nuclear plant). as part of the annual cost study update process, generation evaluates newly assumed costs or substantive changes in previously assumed costs to determine if the cost estimate impacts are sufficiently material to warrant application of the updated estimates to the aros across the nuclear fleet outside of the normal five-year rotating cost study update cycle.
cost escalation factors generation uses cost escalation factors to escalate the decommissioning costs from the decommissioning cost studies discussed above through the assumed decommissioning period for each of the units. cost escalation studies, updated on an annual basis, are used to determine escalation factors, and are based on inflation indices for labor, equipment and materials, energy, llrw disposal and other costs. all of the nuclear aros are adjusted each year for the updated cost escalation factors.
probabilistic cash flow models generation's probabilistic cash flow models include the assignment of probabilities to various scenarios for decommissioning cost levels, decommissioning approaches, and timing of plant shutdown on a unit-by-unit basis. probabilities assigned to cost levels include an assessment of the likelihood of costs 20% higher (high-cost scenario) or 15% lower (low-cost scenario) than the base cost scenario. probabilities are also assigned to four different decommissioning approaches.
1.   decon - a method of decommissioning shortly after the cessation of operation in which the equipment, structures, and portions of a facility and site containing radioactive contaminants are removed and safely buried in a llrw landfill or decontaminated to a level that permits property to be released for unrestricted use. spent fuel is transferred to dry cask storage as soon as possible until doe acceptance for disposal.
2.   delayed decon - similar to the decon scenario but with a delay to allow for spent fuel to be removed from the site prior to onset of decommissioning activities. spent fuel is retained in existing location (either wet or dry storage) until doe acceptance for disposal.
3.   shortened safstor - similar to the decon scenario but with generally a 30-year delay prior to onset of decommissioning activities. spent fuel is transferred to dry cask storage as soon as possible until doe acceptance for disposal.
4.   safstor - a method of decommissioning in which the nuclear facility is placed and maintained in such condition that the nuclear facility can be safely stored and subsequently decontaminated to levels that permit release for unrestricted use generally within 60 years after cessation of operations. spent fuel is transferred to dry cask storage as soon as possible until doe acceptance for disposal.
the actual decommissioning approach selected once a nuclear facility is shutdown will be determined by generation at the time of shutdown and may be influenced by multiple factors including the funding status of the nuclear decommissioning trust fund at the time of shutdown.
the assumed plant shutdown timing scenarios include the following four alternatives: (1) the probability of operating through the original 40-year nuclear license term, (2) the probability of operating through an extended 60-year nuclear license term (regardless of whether such 20-year license extension has been received for each unit), (3) the probability of a second, 20-year license renewal for some nuclear units, and (4) the probability of early plant retirement for certain sites due to changing market conditions and regulatory environments. the successful operation of nuclear plants in the u.s. beyond the initial 40-year license terms has prompted the nrc to consider regulatory and technical requirements for potential plant operations for an 80-year nuclear operating term. as power market and regulatory environment developments occur, generation evaluates and incorporates, as necessary, the impacts of such developments into its nuclear aro assumptions and estimates.
generation's probabilistic cash flow models also include an assessment of the timing of doe acceptance of snf for disposal. generation currently assumes doe will begin accepting snf in 2030. the snf acceptance date assumption is based on management's estimates of the amount of time required for doe to select a site location and develop the necessary infrastructure for long-term snf storage. for more information regarding the estimated date that doe will begin accepting snf, see note 23 - commitments and contingencies of the combined notes to consolidated financial statements.
license renewals except for its clinton unit, generation has successfully obtained initial 20-year operating license renewal extensions (i.e., extending the total license term to 60 years) for all of its operating nuclear units (including the two salem units co-owned by generation, but operated by pseg). generation intends to apply for an initial license renewal for the clinton unit. clinton depreciation provisions are based on 2027 which is the last year of the illinois zero emissions standard. no prior generation initial license extension application has been denied. generation intends to apply for a second 20-year renewal for the peach bottom units 2 and 3.
discount rates the probability-weighted estimated future cash flows for the various assumed scenarios are discounted using credit-adjusted, risk-free rates (carfr) applicable to the various businesses in which each of the nuclear units originally operated. the authoritative guidance required generation to establish an aro at fair value at the time of the initial adoption. subsequent to the initial adoption, the aro is adjusted for changes to estimated costs, timing of future cash flows and modifications to decommissioning assumptions, as described above. the aro is not required or permitted to be re-measured for changes in the carfr that occur in isolation. increases in the aro as a result of upward revisions in estimated undiscounted cash flows are considered new obligations and are measured using a current carfr as the increase creates a new cost layer within the aro. any decrease in the estimated undiscounted future cash flows relating to the aro are treated as a modification of an existing aro cost layer and, therefore, is measured using the average historical carfr rates used in creating the initial aro cost layers. if generation's future nominal cash flows associated with the aro were to be discounted at current prevailing carfr, the obligation would increase from approximately $9.7 billion to approximately $10.3 billion.
to illustrate the significant impact that changes in the carfr, when combined with changes in projected amounts and expected timing of cash flows, can have on the valuation of the aro: i) had generation used the 2016 carfr rather than the 2017 carfr in performing its annual 2017 aro update, generation would have increased the aro by an additional $10 million; and ii) if the carfr
used in performing the annual 2017 aro update are increased by 50 basis points or decreased by 50 basis points, the aro would have decreased by $170 million and increased by $30 million, respectively, as compared to the actual decrease of $69 million.
aro sensitivities changes in the assumptions underlying the aro could materially affect the decommissioning obligation. the impact to the aro of a change in any one of these assumptions is highly dependent on how the other assumptions may correspondingly change.
the following table illustrates the effects of changing certain aro assumptions while holding all other assumptions constant (dollars in millions):

goodwill (exelon, generation, comed, phi and dpl)
as of december 31, 2017, exelon's $6.7 billion carrying amount of goodwill primarily consists of $2.6 billion at comed relating to the acquisition of comed in 2000 as part of the formation of exelon and $4 billion at phi pursuant to exelon's acquisition of phi in the first quarter of 2016. dpl has $8 million of goodwill as of december 31, 2017, related to its 1995 acquisition of the conowingo power company. generation also has goodwill of $47 million as of december 31, 2017. under the provisions of the authoritative guidance for goodwill, these entities are required to perform an assessment for possible impairment of their goodwill at least annually or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the reporting units below their carrying amount. under the authoritative guidance, a reporting unit is an operating segment or one level below an operating segment (known as a component) and is the level at which goodwill is tested for impairment. a component of an operating segment is a reporting unit if the component constitutes a business for which discrete financial information is available and its operating results are regularly reviewed by segment management. comed has a single operating segment, and phi's operating segments are pepco, dpl and ace. see note 25 - segment information of the combined notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information. there is no level below these operating segments for which operating results are regularly reviewed by segment management. therefore, the comed, pepco, dpl and ace operating segments are also considered reporting units for goodwill impairment testing purposes. exelon's and comed's $2.6 billion of goodwill has been assigned entirely to the comed reporting unit, while exelon's and phi's $4 billion of goodwill has been assigned to the pepco, dpl and ace reporting units in the amounts of $1.7 billion, $1.1 billion and $1.2 billion, respectively. dpl's $8 million of goodwill is assigned entirely to the dpl reporting unit.
entities assessing goodwill for impairment have the option of first performing a qualitative assessment to determine whether a quantitative assessment is necessary. in performing a qualitative assessment, entities should assess, among other things, macroeconomic conditions, industry and market considerations including regulatory and political developments, overall financial performance, cost factors, and entity-specific conditions and events. if an entity determines, on the basis of qualitative factors, that the fair value of the reporting unit is more likely than not greater than the carrying amount, no further testing is required. if an entity bypasses the qualitative assessment, or performs the qualitative assessment but determines that it is more likely than not that its fair value is less than its carrying amount, a quantitative two-step, fair value-based test is performed.
exelon's, comed's and phi's accounting policy is to perform a quantitative test of goodwill at least once every three years, or more frequently if events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying amount. the first step in the quantitative test compares the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying amount, including goodwill. if the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the second step is performed. the second step requires an allocation of fair value to the individual assets and liabilities using purchase price allocation authoritative guidance in order to determine the implied fair value of goodwill. if the implied fair value of goodwill is less than the carrying amount, an impairment loss is recorded as a reduction to goodwill and a charge to operating expense. in january 2017, the fasb issued a new standard, effective january 1, 2020 with early adoption permitted, that simplifies the accounting for goodwill impairment by removing the second step of the test and, instead, measuring goodwill impairment at the amount by which a reporting unit's carrying value exceeds its fair value (currently the first step in the test). exelon, generation, comed, phi and dpl have not determined whether to early adopt this standard.
application of the goodwill impairment test requires management judgment, including the identification of reporting units and determining the fair value of the reporting unit, which management estimates using a weighted combination of a discounted cash flow analysis and a market multiples analysis. significant assumptions used in these fair value analyses include discount and growth rates,
utility sector market performance and transactions, projected operating and capital cash flows for comed's, pepco's, dpl's and ace's businesses and the fair value of debt. in applying the second step (if needed), management must estimate the fair value of specific assets and liabilities of the reporting unit.
for their 2017 annual goodwill impairment assessments, exelon, comed, phi and dpl each qualitatively determined that it was more likely than not that the fair value of their respective reporting unit exceeded their respective carrying value. therefore, comed, phi and dpl did not perform quantitative assessments. as part of their qualitative assessments, comed, phi and dpl evaluated, among other things, management's best estimate of projected operating and capital cash flows for their businesses, outcomes of recent regulatory proceedings, changes in certain market conditions, including the discount rate and regulated utility peer ebitda multiples, and the passing margin from their last quantitative assessments performed as of november 1, 2016.
comed, phi and dpl performed quantitative tests as of november 1, 2016, for their 2016 annual goodwill impairment assessments. the first step of the tests comparing the estimated fair values of the comed, pepco, dpl and ace reporting units to their carrying values, including goodwill, indicated no impairments of goodwill; therefore, no second steps were required.
while the annual assessments indicated no impairments, certain assumptions used to estimate reporting unit fair values are highly sensitive to changes. adverse regulatory actions or changes in significant assumptions could potentially result in future impairments of exelon's, comed's, phi's or dpl's goodwill, which could be material. based on the results of the annual goodwill tests performed as of november 1, 2016, the estimated fair values of the comed, pepco, dpl and ace reporting units would have needed to decrease by more than 30%, 10%, 10% and 10%, respectively, for exelon, comed and phi to have failed the first step of their respective impairment tests. for the $8 million of goodwill recorded at dpl related to dpl's 1995 acquisition of the conowingo power company, the fair value of the dpl reporting unit would have needed to decrease by more than 50% for dpl to fail the first step of the impairment test.

purchase accounting (exelon, generation and phi)
in january 2017, the fasb issued a new standard, effective january 1, 2018 with early adoption permitted, that clarifies the definition of a business with the objective of addressing whether acquisitions/dispositions should be accounted for as acquisitions/dispositions of assets or as acquisitions/dispositions of businesses. the registrants did not early adopt this new standard. see note 1-significant accounting policies of the combined notes to consolidated financial statements for further information.
in accordance with authoritative guidance, the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in an acquired business are recorded at their estimated fair values on the date of acquisition. the difference between the purchase price amount and the net fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed is recognized as goodwill on the balance sheet if the purchase price exceeds the estimated net fair value or as a bargain purchase gain on the income statement if the purchase price is less than the estimated net fair value. determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed requires management's judgment, often utilizes independent valuation experts and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions with respect to the timing and amounts of future cash inflows and outflows, discount rates, market prices and asset lives, among other items. the judgments made in the determination of the estimated fair value assigned to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, as well as the estimated useful life of each asset and the duration of each liability, could significantly impact the financial statements in periods after acquisition, such as through depreciation and amortization expense. authoritative guidance provides that the allocation of the purchase price may be modified up to one year after the
acquisition date as more information is obtained about the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed. see note 4 - mergers, acquisitions and dispositions of the combined notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information.
unamortized energy contract assets and liabilities (exelon, generation and phi)
unamortized energy contract assets and liabilities represent the remaining unamortized balances of non-derivative energy contracts that generation has acquired and the electricity contracts exelon has acquired as part of the phi acquisition. the initial amount recorded represents the fair value of the contracts at the time of acquisition. at phi, offsetting regulatory assets or liabilities were also recorded. the unamortized energy contract assets and liabilities and any corresponding regulatory assets or liabilities, respectively, are amortized over the life of the contract in relation to the expected realization of the underlying cash flows. amortization of the unamortized energy contract assets and liabilities is recorded through purchased power and fuel expense or operating revenues, depending on the nature of the underlying contract. refer to note 3 - regulatory matters, note 4 - mergers, acquisitions and dispositions and note 10 - intangible assets of the combined notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion.
impairment of long-lived assets (all registrants)
all registrants regularly monitor and evaluate their long-lived assets and asset groups, excluding goodwill, for impairment when circumstances indicate the carrying value of those assets may not be recoverable. indicators of potential impairment may include a deteriorating business climate, including declines in energy prices, condition of the asset, an asset remaining idle for more than a short period of time, specific regulatory disallowance, advances in technology or plans to dispose of a long-lived asset significantly before the end of its useful life, among others.
the review of long-lived assets and asset groups for impairment utilizes significant assumptions about operating strategies and estimates of future cash flows, which require assessments of current and projected market conditions. for the generation business, forecasting future cash flows requires assumptions regarding forecasted commodity prices for the sale of power and purchases of fuel and the expected operations of assets. a variation in the assumptions used could lead to a different conclusion regarding the recoverability of an asset or asset group and, thus, could have a significant impact on the consolidated financial statements. an impairment evaluation is based on an undiscounted cash flow analysis at the lowest level at which cash flows of the long-lived assets or asset groups are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities. for the generation business, the lowest level of independent cash flows is determined by the evaluation of several factors, including the geographic dispatch of the generation units and the hedging strategies related to those units as well as the associated intangible assets or liabilities recorded on the balance sheet. the cash flows from the generating units are generally evaluated at a regional portfolio level with cash flows generated from the customer supply and risk management activities, including cash flows from related intangible assets and liabilities on the balance sheet. in certain cases, generating assets may be evaluated on an individual basis where those assets are contracted on a long-term basis with a third party and operations are independent of other generating assets (typically contracted renewables).
on a quarterly basis, generation assesses its long-lived assets or asset groups for indicators of impairment. if indicators are present for a long-lived asset or asset group, a comparison of the undiscounted expected future cash flows to the carrying value is performed. when the undiscounted cash flow analysis indicates the carrying value of a long-lived asset or asset group is not recoverable, the amount of the impairment loss is determined by measuring the excess of the carrying amount of the long-lived asset or asset group over its fair value. the fair value of the long-lived asset or asset group is dependent upon a market participant's view of the exit price of the assets. this includes significant assumptions of the estimated future cash flows generated by the assets and market discount rates.
events and circumstances often do not occur as expected and there will usually be differences between prospective financial information and actual results, and those differences may be material. the determination of fair value is driven by both internal assumptions that include significant unobservable inputs (level 3) such as revenue and generation forecasts, projected capital, and maintenance expenditures and discount rates, as well as information from various public, financial and industry sources.
generation evaluates its equity method investments and other investments in debt and equity securities to determine whether or not they are impaired based on whether the investment has experienced a decline in value that is not temporary in nature. beginning january 1, 2018, the authoritative guidance eliminates the available-for-sale and cost method classifications for equity securities and requires that all equity investments (other than those accounted for using the equity method of accounting) be measured and recorded at fair value with any changes in fair value recorded through earnings. investments in equity securities without readily determinable fair values must be qualitatively assessed for impairment each reporting period and fair value determined if any significant impairment indicators exist. if the fair value is less than the carrying value, the impairment is recorded through earnings immediately in the period in which it is identified without regard to whether the decline in value is temporary in nature. the new authoritative guidance does not impact the classification or measurement of investments in debt securities. see note 1-significant accounting policies of the combined notes to consolidated financial statements for further information.
see note 7 - impairment of long-lived assets and intangibles of the combined notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion of asset impairment evaluations made by exelon.
depreciable lives of property, plant and equipment (all registrants)
the registrants have significant investments in electric generation assets and electric and natural gas transmission and distribution assets. these assets are generally depreciated on a straight-line basis, using the group, composite or unitary methods of depreciation. the group approach is typically for groups of similar assets that have approximately the same useful lives and the composite approach is used for heterogeneous assets that have different lives. under both methods, a reporting entity depreciates the assets over the average life of the assets in the group. the estimation of asset useful lives requires management judgment, supported by formal depreciation studies of historical asset retirement experience. depreciation studies are generally completed every five years, or more frequently if required by a rate regulator or if an event, regulatory action, or change in retirement patterns indicate an update is necessary.
for the utility registrants, depreciation studies generally serve as the basis for amounts allowed in customer rates for recovery of depreciation costs. generally, the utility registrants adjust their depreciation rates for financial reporting purposes concurrent with adjustments to depreciation rates reflected in customer rates, unless the depreciation rates reflected in customer rates do not align with management's judgment as to an appropriate estimated useful life or have not been updated on a timely basis. depreciation expense for comed, bge, pepco, dpl and ace includes an estimated cost of dismantling and removing plant from service upon retirement. actual incurred removal costs are applied against a related regulatory liability or recorded to a regulatory asset if in excess of previously collected removal costs. peco's removal costs are capitalized to accumulated depreciation when incurred, and recorded to depreciation expense over the life of the new asset constructed consistent with peco's regulatory recovery method. estimates for such removal costs are also evaluated in the periodic depreciation studies.
at generation, along with depreciation study results, management considers expected future energy market conditions and generation plant operating costs and capital investment requirements in determining the estimated service lives of its generating facilities. see note 8 - early nuclear plant
retirements of the combined notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on expected and potential early nuclear plant retirements.
generation completed a depreciation rate study during the first quarter of 2015, which resulted in revised depreciation rates effective january 1, 2015.
the mdpsc does not mandate the frequency or timing of bge's electric distribution or gas depreciation studies. in july 2014, bge filed revised depreciation rates with the mdpsc for both its electric distribution and gas assets, which became effective december 15, 2014. in addition, bge's electric transmission depreciation rates were updated effective april 1, 2015.
the mdpsc does not mandate the frequency or timing of pepco's electric distribution depreciation studies, while the dcpsc directs pepco as to when it should file an electric distribution depreciation study. in 2016 and 2013, pepco filed revised electric distribution depreciation rates with the mdpsc and dcpsc, respectively, with the new rates effective november 15, 2016 and april 16, 2014, respectively. on december 19, 2017, pepco filed an electric distribution rate application which included revised depreciation rates. pepco expects a decision in the fourth quarter of 2018.
neither the dpsc nor the mdpsc mandates the frequency or timing of dpl's electric distribution or gas depreciation studies. on july 20, 2016, dpl filed revised electric depreciation rates with the mdpsc as part of the electric distribution base rate filing, resulting in new depreciation rates effective on april 20, 2017. on may 17, 2016, dpl filed revised electric and natural gas depreciation rates with the dpsc as part of the electric and natural gas base rate case filing, resulting in new electric depreciation rates effective june 1, 2017 and new gas depreciation rates effective july 1, 2017.
the njbpu does not mandate the frequency or timing of ace's electric distribution depreciation studies. in 2012, ace filed revised electric distribution depreciation rates with the njbpu, with the new rates effective july 1, 2013. ace expects to perform an electric distribution depreciation study in 2018.
while ferc does not mandate the frequency or timing of electric transmission depreciation studies, the utility registrants and generation perform studies on all assets every 5 years. pepco, dpl and ace last performed transmission depreciation studies in 1988, 1990, and 2003, respectively, but are adopting exelon's practice and are currently evaluating the timing of the next study.
changes in estimated useful lives of electric generation assets and of electric and natural gas transmission and distribution assets could have a significant impact on the registrants' future results of operations. see note 1 - significant accounting policies of the combined notes to consolidated financial statements for information regarding depreciation and estimated service lives of the property, plant and equipment of the registrants.
defined benefit pension and other postretirement employee benefits (all registrants)
exelon sponsors defined benefit pension plans and other postretirement employee benefit plans for substantially all current employees. see note 16 - retirement benefits of the combined notes to
consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the accounting for the defined benefit pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans.
the measurement of the plan obligations and costs of providing benefits involves various factors, including the development of valuation assumptions and inputs and accounting policy elections. when developing the required assumptions, exelon considers historical information as well as future expectations. the measurement of benefit obligations and costs is affected by several assumptions including the discount rate applied to benefit obligations, the long-term expected rate of return on plan assets, the anticipated rate of increase of health care costs, exelon's expected level of contributions to the plans, the incidence of participant mortality, the expected remaining service period of plan participants, the level of compensation and rate of compensation increases, employee age, length of service, and the long-term expected investment rate credited to employees of certain plans, among others. the assumptions are updated annually and upon any interim remeasurement of the plan obligations. exelon amortizes actuarial gains or losses in excess of a corridor of 10% of the greater of the projected benefit obligation or the market-related value (mrv) of plan assets over the expected average remaining service period of plan participants. pension and other postretirement benefit costs attributed to the operating companies are labor costs and are ultimately allocated to projects within the operating companies, some of which are capitalized.
pension and other postretirement benefit plan assets include equity securities, including u.s. and international securities, and fixed income securities, as well as certain alternative investment classes such as real estate, private equity and hedge funds. see note 16 - retirement benefits of the combined notes to consolidated financial statements for information on fair value measurements of pension and other postretirement plan assets, including valuation techniques and classification under the fair value hierarchy in accordance with authoritative guidance.
expected rate of return on plan assets in determining the eroa, exelon considers historical economic indicators (including inflation and gdp growth) that impact asset returns, as well as expectation regarding future long-term capital market performance, weighted by exelon's target asset class allocations. exelon calculates the amount of expected return on pension and other postretirement benefit plan assets by multiplying the eroa by the mrv of plan assets at the beginning of the year, taking into consideration anticipated contributions and benefit payments to be made during the year. in determining mrv, the authoritative guidance for pensions and postretirement benefits allows the use of either fair value or a calculated value that recognizes changes in fair value in a systematic and rational manner over not more than five years. for the majority of pension plan assets, exelon uses a calculated value that adjusts for 20% of the difference between fair value and expected mrv of plan assets. use of this calculated value approach enables less volatile expected asset returns to be recognized as a component of pension cost from year to year. for other postretirement benefit plan assets and certain pension plan assets, exelon uses fair value to calculate the mrv. see note 16 - retirement benefits of the combined notes to consolidated financial statements for further information regarding exelon's eroa assumptions.
discount rate at december 31, 2017 and 2016, the discount rates were determined by developing a spot rate curve based on the yield to maturity of a universe of high-quality non-callable (or callable with make whole provisions) bonds with similar maturities to the related pension and other postretirement benefit obligations. the spot rates are used to discount the estimated future benefit distribution amounts under the pension and other postretirement benefit plans. the discount rate is the single level rate that produces the same result as the spot rate curve. exelon utilizes an analytical tool developed by its actuaries to determine the discount rates. see note 16 - retirement benefits of the combined notes to consolidated financial statements for further information regarding exelon's discount rate assumptions.
health care cost trend rate assumed health care cost trend rates impact the costs reported for exelon's other postretirement benefit plans for participant populations with plan designs that do not have a cap on cost growth. authoritative guidance requires that annual health care cost estimates be developed using past and present health care cost trends (both for exelon and across the broader economy), as well as expectations of health care cost escalation, changes in health care utilization and delivery patterns, technological advances and changes in the health status of plan participants. therefore, the trend rate assumption is subject to significant uncertainty. exelon assumes an ultimate health care cost trend rate of 5.00% has been reached in 2017 for its other postretirement benefit plans.
mortality the mortality assumption is composed of a base table that represents the current expectation of life expectancy of the population adjusted by an improvement scale that attempts to anticipate future improvements in life expectancy. exelon's mortality assumption is supported by an actuarial experience study of exelon's plan participants and utilizes the irs's rp-2000 base table and the scale bb 2-dimensional improvement scale with long-term improvements of 0.75%.
sensitivity to changes in key assumptions the following tables illustrate the effects of changing certain of the actuarial assumptions discussed above, while holding all other assumptions constant (dollars in millions):

(a)   in general, the discount rate will have a larger impact on the pension and other postretirement benefit cost and obligation as the rate moves closer to 0%. therefore, the discount rate sensitivities above cannot necessarily be extrapolated for larger increases or decreases in the discount rate. additionally, exelon utilizes a liability-driven investment strategy for its pension asset portfolio. the sensitivities shown above do not reflect the offsetting impact that changes in discount rates may have on pension asset returns.
exelon and the utility registrants account for their regulated electric and gas operations in accordance with the authoritative guidance, which requires exelon and the utility registrants to reflect the effects of cost-based rate regulation in their financial statements. this authoritative guidance is
applicable to entities with regulated operations that meet the following criteria: (1) rates are established or approved by a third-party regulator; (2) rates are designed to recover the entities' cost of providing services or products; and (3) a reasonable expectation that rates designed to recover costs can be charged to and collected from customers. regulatory assets represent incurred costs that have been deferred because of their probable future recovery from customers through regulated rates. regulatory liabilities represent (1) revenue or gains that have been deferred because it is probable such amounts will be returned to customers through future regulated rates; or (2) billings in advance of expenditures for approved regulatory programs. as of december 31, 2017, exelon and the utility registrants have concluded that the operations of each such registrant meet the criteria to apply the authoritative guidance. if it is concluded in a future period that a separable portion of operations no longer meets the criteria of this authoritative guidance, exelon and the utility registrants would be required to eliminate any associated regulatory assets and liabilities and the impact would be recognized in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income and could be material. at december 31, 2017, the gain (loss) could have been as much as $1.1 billion, $5.3 billion, $280 million, $592 million, $(1.1) billion, $(59) million, $321 million and $(8) million (before taxes) as a result of the elimination of regulatory assets and liabilities of exelon, comed, peco, bge, phi, pepco, dpl and ace, respectively. further, exelon would record a charge against oci (before taxes) of up to $3.8 billion, $2.4 billion, $544 million,$177 million, $407 million, $202 million and $92 million related to exelon's, comed's, bge's, phi's, pepco's, dpl's and ace's respective portions of the deferred costs associated with exelon's pension and other postretirement benefit plans that are recorded as regulatory assets on exelon's consolidated balance sheets. exelon also has a net regulatory liability of $(31) million (before taxes) related to peco's portion of the deferred costs associated with exelon's other postretirement benefit plans that would result in an increase in oci if reversed. see note 3 - regulatory matters of the combined notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding regulatory matters, including the regulatory assets and liabilities tables of exelon and the utility registrants.
for each regulatory jurisdiction in which they conduct business, exelon and the utility registrants assess whether the regulatory assets and liabilities continue to meet the criteria for probable future recovery or settlement at each balance sheet date and when regulatory events occur. this assessment includes consideration of recent rate orders, historical regulatory treatment for similar costs in each registrant's jurisdictions, and factors such as changes in applicable regulatory and political environments. furthermore, each registrant makes other judgments related to the financial statement impact of their regulatory environments, such as the types of adjustments to rate base that will be acceptable to regulatory bodies, if any, for which costs will be recoverable through rates. refer to the revenue recognition discussion below for additional information on the annual revenue reconciliations associated with icc-approved electric distribution and energy efficiency formula rates for comed, and ferc transmission formula rate tariffs for comed, peco, bge, pepco, dpl and ace. additionally, estimates are made in accordance with the authoritative guidance for contingencies as to the amount of revenues billed under certain regulatory orders that may ultimately be refunded to customers upon finalization of applicable regulatory or judicial processes. these assessments are based, to the extent possible, on past relevant experience with regulatory bodies in each registrant's jurisdictions, known circumstances specific to a particular matter and hearings held with the applicable regulatory body. if the assessments and estimates made by exelon and the utility registrants for regulatory assets and regulatory liabilities are ultimately different than actual regulatory outcomes, the impact on their results of operations, cash flows and financial positions could be material.
the registrants treat the impacts of a final rate order received after the balance sheet date but prior to the issuance of the financial statements as a non-recognized subsequent event, as the receipt of a final rate order is a separate and distinct event that has future impacts on the parties affected by the order.
the registrants use derivative instruments to manage commodity price risk, foreign currency exchange risk and interest rate risk related to ongoing business operations. the registrants' derivative activities are in accordance with exelon's risk management policy (rmp). see note 12 - derivative financial instruments of the combined notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the registrants' derivative instruments.
the registrants account for derivative financial instruments under the applicable authoritative guidance. determining whether a contract qualifies as a derivative requires that management exercise significant judgment, including assessing market liquidity as well as determining whether a contract has one or more underlyings and one or more notional quantities. changes in management's assessment of contracts and the liquidity of their markets, and changes in authoritative guidance, could result in previously excluded contracts becoming in scope to new authoritative guidance. generation has determined that contracts to purchase uranium, contracts to purchase and sell capacity in certain iso's, certain emission products, zecs and recs do not meet the definition of a derivative as they do not provide for net settlement and the uranium, certain capacity, emission and zec and rec markets are not sufficiently liquid to conclude that physical forward contracts are readily convertible to cash. if these markets become sufficiently liquid, then generation would be required to account for these contracts as derivative instruments. in this case, if market prices differ from the underlying prices of the contracts, generation would be required to record mark-to-market gains or losses, which could have a material impact to exelon's and generation's results of operations and financial positions.
under current authoritative guidance, all derivatives are recognized on the balance sheet at their fair value, except for certain derivatives that qualify for, and are elected under, the normal purchases and normal sales exception. further, derivatives that qualify and are designated for hedge accounting are classified as either fair value or cash flow hedges. for fair value hedges, changes in fair values for both the derivative and the underlying hedged exposure are recognized in earnings immediately. for cash flow hedges, the portion of the derivative gain or loss that is effective in offsetting the change in the hedged cash flows of the underlying exposure is deferred in aoci and reclassified into earnings when the underlying transaction occurs. gains and losses from the ineffective portion of any hedge are recognized in earnings immediately. the registrants rarely elect hedge accounting for commodity transactions. economic commodity hedges are recorded at fair value through earnings. in addition, for commodity derivatives executed for proprietary trading purposes, changes in the fair value of the derivatives are recognized in earnings immediately. for economic hedges that are not designated for hedge accounting for the utility registrants, changes in the fair value each period are generally recorded with a corresponding offsetting regulatory asset or liability given likelihood of recovering the associated costs through customer rates.
normal purchases and normal sales exception as part of generation's energy marketing business, generation enters into contracts to buy and sell energy to meet the requirements of its customers. these contracts include short-term and long-term commitments to purchase and sell energy and energy-related products in the retail and wholesale markets with the intent and ability to deliver or take delivery. while some of these contracts are considered derivative financial instruments under the authoritative guidance, certain of these qualifying transactions have been designated by generation as normal purchases and normal sales transactions, which are thus not required to be recorded at fair value, but rather on an accrual basis of accounting. determining whether a contract qualifies for the normal purchases and normal sales exception requires judgment on whether the contract will physically deliver and requires that management ensure compliance with all of the associated qualification and documentation requirements. revenues and expenses on contracts that qualify as normal purchases and normal sales are recognized when the underlying physical transaction is completed. contracts that qualify for the normal purchases and normal sales exception
are those for which physical delivery is probable, quantities are expected to be used or sold in the normal course of business over a reasonable period of time and the contract is not financially settled on a net basis. the contracts that comed has entered into with suppliers as part of comed's energy procurement process, peco's full requirement contracts under the papuc-approved dsp program, most of peco's natural gas supply agreements, all of bge's full requirement contracts and natural gas supply agreements that are derivatives and certain pepco, dpl and ace full requirement contracts qualify for and are accounted for under the normal purchases and normal sales exception.
commodity contracts identification of a commodity contract as an economic hedge requires generation to determine that the contract is in accordance with the rmp. generation reassesses its economic hedges on a regular basis to determine if they continue to be within the guidelines of the rmp.
as a part of the authoritative guidance, the registrants make estimates and assumptions concerning future commodity prices, load requirements, interest rates, the timing of future transactions and their probable cash flows, the fair value of contracts and the expected changes in the fair value in deciding whether or not to enter into derivative transactions, and in determining the initial accounting treatment for derivative transactions. under the authoritative guidance for fair value measurements, the registrants categorize these derivatives under a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value.
derivative contracts are traded in both exchange-based and non-exchange-based markets. exchange-based derivatives that are valued using unadjusted quoted prices in active markets are generally categorized in level 1 in the fair value hierarchy.
certain derivatives' pricing is verified using indicative price quotations available through brokers or over-the-counter, on-line exchanges. the price quotations reflect the average of the bid-ask mid-point from markets that the registrants believe provide the most liquid market for the commodity. the price quotations are reviewed and corroborated to ensure the prices are observable and representative of an orderly transaction between market participants. the registrant's derivatives are traded predominately at liquid trading points. the remaining derivative contracts are valued using models that consider inputs such as contract terms, including maturity, and market parameters, and assumptions of the future prices of energy, interest rates, volatility, credit worthiness and credit spread. for derivatives that trade in liquid markets, such as generic forwards, swaps and options, the model inputs are generally observable. such instruments are categorized in level 2.
for derivatives that trade in less liquid markets with limited pricing information, the model inputs generally would include both observable and unobservable inputs and are categorized in level 3.
the registrants consider nonperformance risk, including credit risk in the valuation of derivative contracts, including both historical and current market data in its assessment of nonperformance risk, including credit risk. the impacts of nonperformance and credit risk to date have generally not been material to the financial statements.
interest rate and foreign exchange derivative instruments the registrants may utilize fixed-to-floating interest rate swaps, which are typically designated as fair value hedges, to achieve the targeted level of variable-rate debt as a percent of total debt. additionally, the registrants may use forward-starting interest rate swaps and treasury rate locks to lock in interest-rate levels and floating to fixed swaps for project financing. in addition, generation enters into interest rate derivative contracts to economically hedge risk associated with the interest rate component of commodity positions. the characterization of the interest rate derivative contracts between the economic hedge and proprietary trading activity is driven by the corresponding characterization of the underlying
commodity position that gives rise to the interest rate exposure. generation does not utilize interest rate derivatives with the objective of benefiting from shifts or changes in market interest rates. to manage foreign exchange rate exposure associated with international energy purchases in currencies other than u.s. dollars, generation utilizes foreign currency derivatives, which are typically designated as economic hedges. the fair value of the agreements is calculated by discounting the future net cash flows to the present value based on observable inputs and are primarily categorized in level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. certain exchange based interest rate derivatives that are valued using unadjusted quoted prices in active markets are categorized in level 1 in the fair value hierarchy.
see item 7a. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk and note 11 - fair value of financial assets and liabilities and note 12 - derivative financial instruments of the combined notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the registrants' derivative instruments.
significant management judgment is required in determining the registrants' provisions for income taxes, primarily due to the uncertainty related to tax positions taken, as well as deferred tax assets and liabilities and valuation allowances. in accordance with applicable authoritative guidance, the registrants account for uncertain income tax positions using a benefit recognition model with a two-step approach including a more-likely-than-not recognition threshold and a measurement approach based on the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. if it is not more-likely-than-not that the benefit of the tax position will be sustained on its technical merits, no benefit is recorded. uncertain tax positions that relate only to timing of when an item is included on a tax return are considered to have met the recognition threshold. management evaluates each position based solely on the technical merits and facts and circumstances of the position, assuming the position will be examined by a taxing authority having full knowledge of all relevant information. significant judgment is required to determine whether the recognition threshold has been met and, if so, the appropriate amount of tax benefits to be recorded in the registrants' consolidated financial statements.
the registrants evaluate quarterly the probability of realizing deferred tax assets by reviewing a forecast of future taxable income and their intent and ability to implement tax planning strategies, if necessary, to realize deferred tax assets. the registrants also evaluate for negative evidence that could indicate the registrant's inability to realize its deferred tax assets, such as historical operating loss or tax credit carryforward expiration. based on the combined assessment, the registrants record valuation allowances for deferred tax assets when they conclude it is more-likely-than-not such benefit will not be realized in future periods.
actual income taxes could vary from estimated amounts due to the future impacts of various items, including future changes in income tax laws, the registrants' forecasted financial condition and results of operations, failure to successfully implement tax planning strategies, as well as results of audits and examinations of filed tax returns by taxing authorities. the registrants have recorded the provisional income tax amounts as of december 31, 2017 for changes pursuant to the tcja related to depreciation for which the impacts could not be finalized upon issuance of the registrants' financial statements, but for which reasonable estimates could be determined. in accordance with sab 118, additional remeasurement may occur based on technical corrections or other forms of guidance issued, which may result in material changes to previously finalized provisions. while the registrants believe the resulting tax balances as of december 31, 2017 and 2016 are appropriately accounted for in accordance with the applicable authoritative guidance, the ultimate outcome of tax matters could result in favorable or unfavorable adjustments that could be material to their consolidated financial statements. see note 14 - income taxes of the combined notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding taxes.
in the preparation of their financial statements, the registrants make judgments regarding the future outcome of contingent events and record liabilities for loss contingencies that are probable and can be reasonably estimated based upon available information. the amount recorded may differ from the actual expense incurred when the uncertainty is resolved. such difference could have a significant impact on the registrants' consolidated financial statements.
environmental costs environmental investigation and remediation liabilities are based upon estimates with respect to the number of sites for which the registrants will be responsible, the scope and cost of work to be performed at each site, the portion of costs that will be shared with other parties, the timing of the remediation work and changes in technology, regulations and the requirements of local governmental authorities. periodic studies are conducted at the utility registrants to determine future remediation requirements for mgp sites and estimates are adjusted accordingly. in addition, periodic reviews are performed at each of the registrants to assess the adequacy of other environmental reserves. these matters, if resolved in a manner different from the estimate, could have a significant impact on the registrants' results of operations, cash flows and financial positions. see note 23 - commitments and contingencies of the combined notes to consolidated financial statements for further information.
other, including personal injury claims the registrants are self-insured for general liability, automotive liability, workers' compensation, and personal injury claims to the extent that losses are within policy deductibles or exceed the amount of insurance maintained. the registrants have reserves for both open claims asserted and an estimate of claims incurred but not reported (ibnr). the ibnr reserve is estimated based on actuarial assumptions and analysis and is updated annually. future events, such as the number of new claims to be filed each year, the average cost of disposing of claims, as well as the numerous uncertainties surrounding litigation and possible state and national legislative measures could cause the actual costs to be higher or lower than estimated. accordingly, these claims, if resolved in a manner different from the estimate, could have a material impact on the registrants' results of operations, cash flows and financial positions.
revenue recognition (all registrants)
sources of revenue and determination of accounting treatment the registrants earn revenues from various business activities including: the sale of energy and energy-related products, such as natural gas, capacity, and other commodities in non-regulated markets (wholesale and retail); the sale and delivery of electricity and natural gas in regulated markets; and the provision of other energy-related non-regulated products and services.
the accounting treatment for revenue recognition is based on the nature of the underlying transaction and applicable authoritative guidance. the registrants primarily use accrual, mark-to-market, and alternative revenue program (arp) accounting as discussed in more detail below. beginning on january 1, 2018, the registrants will begin applying the revenue from contracts with customers guidance to recognize revenue. see note 1 - significant accounting policies of the combined notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information.
accrual accounting under accrual accounting, the registrants recognize revenues in the period when services are rendered or energy is delivered to customers. the registrants generally use accrual accounting to recognize revenues for sales of electricity, natural gas and other commodities as part of their physical delivery activities. the registrants enter into these sales transactions using a variety of instruments,
including non-derivative agreements, derivatives that qualify for and are designated as normal purchases and normal sales (npns) of commodities that will be physically delivered, sales to utility customers under regulated service tariffs and spot-market sales, including settlements with independent system operators.
the determination of generation's and the utility registrants' energy sales to individual customers is based on systematic readings of customer meters generally on a monthly basis. at the end of each month, amounts of energy delivered to customers since the date of the last meter reading are estimated, and corresponding unbilled revenue is recorded. the measurement of unbilled revenue is affected by the following factors: daily customer usage measured by energy or gas throughput volume, customer usage by class, losses of energy during delivery to customers and applicable customer rates. increases or decreases in volumes delivered to the utilities' customers and favorable or unfavorable rate mix due to changes in usage patterns in customers classes in the period could be significant to the calculation of unbilled revenue. in addition, unbilled revenues may fluctuate monthly as a result of customers electing to use an alternate supplier, since unbilled commodity receivables are not recorded for these customers. changes in the timing of meter reading schedules and the number and type of customers scheduled for each meter reading date also impact the measurement of unbilled revenue, however, total operating revenues would remain materially unchanged. see note 5 - accounts receivable of the combined notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information on unbilled revenue.
mark-to-market accounting the registrants record revenues and expenses using the mark-to-market method of accounting for transactions that meet the definition of a derivative for which they are not permitted, or have not elected, the npns exception. these mark-to-market transactions primarily relate to commodity price risk management activities. mark-to-market revenues and expenses include: inception gains or losses on new transactions where the fair value is observable and realized; and unrealized gains and losses from changes in the fair value of open contracts.
alternative revenue program accounting certain of the utility registrants' ratemaking mechanisms qualify as arps if they meet certain criteria. at each balance sheet date, the utility registrants with such mechanisms, including comed's electric distribution and energy efficiency formulas, and comed's, peco's, bge's, pepco's, dpl's, and ace's ferc transmission formula rates, record arp revenues for any differences between the prior year revenue requirement in effect in rates and their best estimate of the current year revenue requirement that is probable of approval by the icc or ferc. estimates of the current year revenue requirement are based on actual and/or forecasted costs and investment in rate base for the period and the rates of return on common equity and associated regulatory capital structure allowed under the applicable tariff. comed, bge, pepco, and dpl also have decoupling mechanisms which qualify as arps. the utility registrants recognize and record an offsetting regulatory asset or liability once the condition or event allowing for the automatic adjustment of future rates occurs.
the utility registrants' arp revenues include both: (i) the recognition of "originating" arp revenues (when the regulator-specified condition or event allowing for additional billing or refund has occurred) and (ii) an equal and offsetting reversal of the "originating" arp revenues as those amounts are reflected in the price of utility service see note 3 - regulatory matters of the combined notes to consolidated financial statements for further information.
the allowance for uncollectible accounts reflects the registrants' best estimates of losses on the accounts receivable balances. for generation, the allowance is based on accounts receivable aging historical experience and other currently available information. comed, peco, bge, pepco, dpl and ace, estimate the allowance for uncollectible accounts on customer receivables by applying loss rates developed specifically for each company to the outstanding receivable balance by customer risk segment. risk segments represent a group of customers with similar credit quality indicators that are comprised based on various attributes, including delinquency of their balances and payment history. loss rates applied to the accounts receivable balances are based on a historical average of charge-offs as a percentage of accounts receivable in each risk segment. the utility registrants' customer accounts are generally considered delinquent if the amount billed is not received by the time the next bill is issued, which normally occurs on a monthly basis. utility registrants' customer accounts are written off consistent with approved regulatory requirements. utility registrants' allowances for uncollectible accounts will continue to be affected by changes in volume, prices and economic conditions as well as changes in icc, papuc, mdpsc, dcpsc, dpsc and njbpu regulations. see note 5 - accounts receivable of the combined notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding accounts receivable.

(a)   generation evaluates its operating performance using the measure of revenues net of purchased power and fuel expense. generation believes that revenues net of purchased power and fuel expense is a useful measurement because it provides information that can be used to evaluate its operational performance. revenues net of purchased power and fuel expense is not a presentation defined under gaap and may not be comparable to other companies' presentations or deemed more useful than the gaap information provided elsewhere in this report.
net income attributable to membership interest year ended december 31, 2017 compared to year ended december 31, 2016. generation's net income attributable to membership interest increased compared to the same period in 2016, primarily due to lower depreciation and amortization, a bargain purchase gain in 2017, a gain on deconsolidation of business in 2017, higher other income and decreased income taxes, partially offset by lower revenues net of purchased power and fuel expense and higher operating and maintenance expense. the decrease in depreciation and amortization expense is primarily due to lower accelerated depreciation and amortization as a result of the 2017 decision to early retire the tmi nuclear facility compared to the previous decision in 2016 to early retire clinton and quad cities nuclear facilities. the bargain purchase gain is due to the acquisition of the fitzpatrick nuclear facility. the gain on deconsolidation of business in 2017 is due to the deconsolidation of egtp's net liabilities, which included the previously impaired assets and related debt, as a result of the november 2017 bankruptcy filing. the increase in other income is primarily due to higher realized ndt fund gains. the decrease in income taxes primarily relates to the one-time non-cash impacts associated with the tax cuts and jobs act. the decrease in revenues net of purchased power and fuel expense primarily reflects lower realized energy prices, the impacts of lower load volumes delivered due to mild weather in the third quarter 2017, the conclusion of the ginna reliability support services agreement and the impact of declining natural gas prices on generation's natural gas portfolio, partially offset by the impact of the new york ces, higher capacity prices, the addition of two combined-cycle gas turbines in texas and lower nuclear fuel prices. the increase in operating and maintenance expense is primarily related to the impairment of egtp in 2017.
year ended december 31, 2016 compared to year ended december 31, 2015. generation's net income attributable to membership interest decreased compared to the same period in 2015, primarily due to lower revenues net of purchased power and fuel expense, higher operating and maintenance expense, higher depreciation and amortization expense, and losses on sales of assets in 2016, partially offset by increased other income and decreased income tax expense. the decrease in revenues net of purchased power and fuel expense primarily relates to lower mark-to-market results in 2016 compared to 2015 and lower realized energy prices, partially offset by the ginna reliability support services agreement and a decrease in outage days at higher capacity units despite an increase in overall outage days. the increase in operating and maintenance expense is primarily related to the impairment of upstream assets and certain wind projects, and increased costs related to the implementation of the cost management program. the increase in depreciation and amortization expense is primarily related to accelerated depreciation and amortization expense related to the previous decision to early retire the clinton and quad cities nuclear generating facilities, increased nuclear decommissioning amortization and increased depreciation expense due to ongoing capital expenditures. the increase in losses on sales of assets is primarily due to generation's strategic decision to narrow the scope and scale of its growth and development activities. the increase in other income is primarily due to the change in realized and unrealized gains and losses on ndt funds.

(a)   comed evaluates its operating performance using the measure of revenue net of purchased power expense. comed believes that revenue net of purchased power expense is a useful measurement because it provides information that can be used to evaluate its operational performance. in general, comed only earns margin based on the delivery and transmission of electricity. comed has included its discussion of revenue net of purchased power expense below as a complement to the financial information provided in accordance with gaap. however, revenue net of purchased power expense is not a presentation defined under gaap and may not be comparable to other companies' presentations or deemed more useful than the gaap information provided elsewhere in this report.
(b)   for regulatory recovery mechanisms, including comed's electric distribution and transmission formula rates, and riders, revenues increase and decrease i) as fully recoverable costs fluctuate (with no impact on net earnings), and ii) pursuant to changes in rate base, capital structure and roe (which impact net earnings).
net income year ended december 31, 2017 compared to year ended december 31, 2016. comed's net income for the year ended december 31, 2017 was higher than the same period in 2016 primarily due to the recognition of the penalty and the after-tax interest due on the asserted penalty related to the tax court's decision on exelon's like-kind exchange tax position in 2016 and increased electric distribution and transmission formula rate earnings (reflecting the impacts of increased capital investment and higher allowed electric distribution roe). the higher net income was partially offset by the impact of weather conditions in 2016. see revenue decoupling discussion below for additional information on the impact of weather.
year ended december 31, 2016 compared to year ended december 31, 2015. comed's net income for the year ended december 31, 2016 was lower than the same period in 2015 primarily due to the recognition of the penalty and the after-tax interest due on the asserted penalty related to the tax court's decision on exelon's like-kind exchange tax position, partially offset by increased electric
distribution and transmission formula rate earnings (reflecting the impacts of increased capital investment, partially offset by lower allowed electric distribution roe) and favorable weather.
revenues net of purchased power expense there are certain drivers of operating revenues that are fully offset by their impact on purchased power expense, such as commodity, rec and zec procurement costs and participation in customer choice programs. comed is permitted to recover electricity, rec and zec procurement costs from retail customers without mark-up. therefore, fluctuations in these costs have no impact on revenue net of purchased power expense. see note 3 - regulatory matters of the combined notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information on comed's electricity procurement process.
all comed customers have the choice to purchase electricity from a competitive electric generation supplier. customer choice programs do not impact comed's volume of deliveries, but do affect comed's operating revenues related to supplied energy, which is fully offset in purchased power expense. therefore, customer choice programs have no impact on revenue net of purchased power expense.
retail deliveries purchased from competitive electric generation suppliers (as a percentage of kwh sales) for the years ended december 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, consisted of the following:
retail customers purchasing electric generation from competitive electric generation suppliers at december 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 consisted of the following:

the changes in comed's revenue net of purchased power expense for the year ended december 31, 2017, compared to the same period in 2016, and for the year ended december 31, 2016, compared to the same period in 2015, consisted of the following:
pricing and customer mix(a)                                  (18             )                             14

(a)   for the year ended december 31, 2017, compared to the same period in 2016, the changes reflect the 2016 impacts of weather, volume and pricing and customer mix. as further described below, pursuant to the revenue decoupling provision in feja, comed began recording an adjustment to revenue in the first quarter of 2017 to eliminate the favorable or unfavorable impacts associated with variations in delivery volumes associated with above or below normal weather, number of customers or usage per customer.
(b)   beginning on june 1, 2017, comed is deferring energy efficiency costs as a regulatory asset that will be recovered through the energy efficiency formula rate over the weighted average useful life of the related energy efficiency measures.
revenue decoupling. the demand for electricity is affected by weather conditions. very warm weather in summer months and very cold weather in other months are referred to as "favorable weather conditions" because these weather conditions result in increased customer usage. conversely, mild weather reduces demand.
under eima, comed's electric distribution formula rate provided for an adjustment to future billings if its earned roe fell outside a 50-basis-point collar of its allowed roe, which partially eliminated the impacts of weather and load on comed's revenue. as allowed under feja, comed will revise its electric distribution formula rate to eliminate the roe collar beginning with the reconciliation filed in 2018 for the 2017 calendar year. elimination of the roe collar effectively offsets the favorable or unfavorable impacts to operating revenues associated with variations in delivery volumes associated with above or below normal weather, numbers of customers or usage per customer. comed began recognizing the impacts of this change beginning in the first quarter of 2017. for the year ended december 31, 2017, comed recorded an increase to electric distribution revenues of approximately $32 million to eliminate weather and load impacts.
for the year ended december 31, 2016, favorable weather conditions increased operating revenues net of purchased power expense when compared to the prior year.
for the year ended december 31, 2016, the increase in revenue net of purchased power as a result of pricing and customer mix is primarily attributable to higher overall effective rates due to decreased usage across all major customer classes and change in customer mix.
heating and cooling degree days are quantitative indices that reflect the demand for energy needed to heat or cool a home or business. normal weather is determined based on historical average heating and cooling degree days for a 30-year period in comed's service territory with cooling degree days generally having a more significant impact to comed, particularly during the summer months. the changes in heating and cooling degree days in comed's service territory for the years ended december 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 consisted of the following:
heating and cooling degree-days             for the years ended december 31,                                   % change
heating and cooling degree-days             for the years ended december 31,                                                         % change
electric distribution revenue. eima and feja provide for a performance-based formula rate, which requires an annual reconciliation of the revenue requirement in effect to the actual costs that the icc determines are prudently and reasonably incurred in a given year. electric distribution revenue varies from year to year based upon fluctuations in the underlying costs, investments being recovered and allowed roe. comed's allowed roe is the annual average rate on 30-year treasury notes plus 580 basis points. in addition, comed's allowed roe is subject to reduction if comed does not deliver the reliability and customer service benefits to which it has committed over the ten-year life of the investment program. during the year ended december 31, 2017, electric distribution revenue increased $170 million, primarily due to increased capital investment, increased depreciation expense, higher allowed roe due to an increase in treasury rates and revenue decoupling impacts (as described above). during the year ended december 31, 2016, electric distribution revenue increased $69 million, primarily due to increased capital investment and depreciation expense, partially offset by lower allowed roe due to a decrease in treasury rates. see operating and maintenance expense below and note 3 - regulatory matters of the combined notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information.
transmission revenue. under a ferc-approved formula, transmission revenue varies from year to year based upon fluctuations in the underlying costs, capital investments being recovered and the highest daily peak load, which is updated annually in january based on the prior calendar year. generally, increases/decreases in the highest daily peak load will result in higher/lower transmission revenue. for the years ended december 31, 2017 and 2016, comed recorded increased transmission revenue due to increased capital investment, higher depreciation expense and increased highest daily peak load. see operating and maintenance expense below and note 3 - regulatory matters of the combined notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information.
energy efficiency revenue. beginning june 1, 2017, feja provides for a performance-based formula rate, which requires an annual reconciliation of the revenue requirement in effect to the actual costs that the icc determines are prudently and reasonably incurred in a given year.  under feja, energy efficiency revenue varies from year to year based upon fluctuations in the underlying costs, investments being recovered, and allowed roe. comed's allowed roe is the annual average rate on 30-year treasury notes plus 580 basis points. beginning january 1, 2018, comed's allowed roe is subject to a maximum downward or upward adjustment of 200 basis points if comed's cumulative persisting annual mwh savings falls short of or exceeds specified percentage benchmarks of its annual
incremental savings goal. see depreciation and amortization expense discussions below and note 3 - regulatory matters of the combined notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information.
regulatory required programs.  this represents the change in operating revenues collected under approved rate riders to recover costs incurred for regulatory programs such as comed's purchased power administrative costs and energy efficiency and demand response through june 1, 2017 pursuant to feja. the riders are designed to provide full and current cost recovery. an equal and offsetting amount has been included in operating and maintenance expense. see operating and maintenance expense discussion below for additional information on included programs.
uncollectible accounts recovery, net. uncollectible accounts recovery, net, represents recoveries under comed's uncollectible accounts tariff. see operating and maintenance expense discussion below for additional information on this tariff.
other. other revenue, which can vary period to period, includes rental revenue, revenue related to late payment charges, assistance provided to other utilities through mutual assistance programs, recoveries of environmental costs associated with mgp sites, and recoveries of energy procurement costs.

(a)   peco evaluates its operating performance using the measures of revenue net of purchased power expense for electric sales and revenue net of fuel expense for gas sales. peco believes revenue net of purchased power expense and revenue net of fuel expense are useful measurements of its performance because they provide information that can be used to evaluate its net revenue from operations. peco has included the analysis below as a complement to the financial information provided in accordance with gaap. however, revenue net of purchased power expense and revenue net of fuel expense figures are not a presentation defined under gaap and may not be comparable to other companies' presentations or more useful than the gaap information provided elsewhere in this report.
net income year ended december 31, 2017 compared to year ended december 31, 2016. peco's net income for the year ended december 31, 2017 was lower than the same period in 2016, primarily due to a decrease in revenues net of purchased power and fuel expense as a result of unfavorable weather in peco's service territory, partially offset by the one-time non-cash impacts associated with the tax cuts and jobs act in 2017.
year ended december 31, 2016 compared to year ended december 31, 2015. peco's net income for the year ended december 31, 2016 was higher than the same period in 2015, primarily due to an increase in revenues net of purchased power and fuel expense as a result of increased electric distribution revenue pursuant to the 2015 papuc authorized electric distribution rate increase effective january 1, 2016.
revenues net of purchased power and fuel expense electric and natural gas revenue and purchased power and fuel expense are affected by fluctuations in commodity procurement costs. peco's electric supply and natural gas cost rates charged to customers
are subject to adjustments as specified in the papuc-approved tariffs that are designed to recover or refund the difference between the actual cost of electric supply and natural gas and the amount included in rates in accordance with peco's gsa and pgc, respectively. therefore, fluctuations in electric supply and natural gas procurement costs have no impact on electric and natural gas revenues net of purchased power and fuel expense.
electric and natural gas revenue and purchased power and fuel expense are also affected by fluctuations in participation in the customer choice program. all peco customers have the choice to purchase electricity and natural gas from competitive electric generation and natural gas suppliers, respectively. the customer's choice of suppliers does not impact the volume of deliveries, but affects revenue collected from customers related to supplied energy and natural gas service. customer choice program activity has no impact on electric and natural gas revenue net of purchase power and fuel expense.
retail deliveries purchased from competitive electric generation and natural gas suppliers (as a percentage of kwh and mmcf sales, respectively) for the years ended december 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015 consisted of the following:

the changes in peco's operating revenues net of purchased power and fuel expense for the years ended december 31, 2017 and december 31, 2016 compared to the same periods in 2016 and 2015, respectively, consisted of the following:
weather. the demand for electricity and natural gas is affected by weather conditions. with respect to the electric business, very warm weather in summer months and, with respect to the electric and natural gas businesses, very cold weather in winter months are referred to as "favorable weather conditions" because these weather conditions result in increased deliveries of electricity and natural gas. conversely, mild weather reduces demand. for the year ended december 31, 2017 compared to the same period in 2016, and the year ended december 31, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 operating revenues net of purchased power and fuel expense was reduced by the impact of unfavorable weather conditions in peco's service territory.
heating and cooling degree days are quantitative indices that reflect the demand for energy needed to heat or cool a home or business. normal weather is determined based on historical average heating and cooling degree days for a 30-year period in peco's service territory. the changes in heating and cooling degree days in peco's service territory for the years ended december 31, 2017 and december 31, 2016 compared to the same periods in 2016 and 2015, respectively, and normal weather consisted of the following:

net income attributable to common shareholder year ended december 31, 2017 compared to year ended december 31, 2016. net income attributable to common shareholder was higher primarily due to an increase in revenues net of purchased power and fuel expense and lower operating and maintenance expense, partially offset by higher depreciation and amortization expense and higher income tax expense. the increase in revenues net of purchased power and fuel expense was primarily due to the impacts of the electric and natural gas distribution rate orders issued by the mdpsc in june 2016 and july 2016 and an increase in transmission formula rate revenues. the lower operating and maintenance expense was primarily due to the absence of cost disallowances resulting from the 2016 distribution rate orders issued by the mdpsc and
decreased storm costs in 2017 partially offset by the favorable 2016 settlement of the baltimore city conduit fee dispute. these items were partially offset by an increase in depreciation and amortization expense primarily related to the initiation of cost recovery of the ami programs under the distribution rate orders and the impacts of increased capital investment and higher income tax expense primarily resulting from higher taxable income as well as a 2016 favorable adjustment and 2017 impairment of certain transmission-related income tax regulatory assets.
year ended december 31, 2016 compared to year ended december 31, 2015. net income attributable to common shareholder was higher primarily due to lower income tax expense and decreased preference stock dividends partially offset by slightly lower operating income. the lower income tax expense was driven by a one-time adjustment associated with transmission-related regulatory assets. the slight decrease in operating income was driven by an increase in operating and maintenance expense as a result of cost disallowances which reduced certain regulatory assets and other long-lived assets stemming from the distribution rate orders issued by the mdpsc in june 2016 and july 2016 and increased storm costs. this increase in operating and maintenance expense was offset by an increase in revenues net of purchased power and fuel expense, primarily as a result of an increase in transmission formula rate revenues and higher electric and natural gas revenues as a result of the distribution rate orders issued by the mdpsc in june 2016 and july 2016.
revenues net of purchased power and fuel expense there are certain drivers to operating revenues that are offset by their impact on purchased power and fuel expense, such as commodity procurement costs and programs allowing customers to select a competitive electric or natural gas supplier. operating revenues and purchased power and fuel expense are affected by fluctuations in commodity procurement costs. bge's electric and natural gas rates charged to customers are subject to periodic adjustments that are designed to recover or refund the difference between the actual cost of purchased electric power and purchased natural gas and the amount included in rates in accordance with the mdpsc's market-based sos and gas commodity programs, respectively. therefore, fluctuations in electric supply and natural gas procurement costs have no impact on revenues net of purchased power and fuel expense.
electric and natural gas revenue and purchased power and fuel expense are also affected by fluctuations in the number of customers electing to use a competitive supplier for electricity and/or natural gas. all bge customers have the choice to purchase electricity and natural gas from competitive suppliers. the customers' choice of suppliers does not impact the volume of deliveries, but does affect revenue collected from customers related to supplied electricity and natural gas.
retail deliveries purchased from competitive electricity and natural gas suppliers (as a percentage of kwh and mmcf sales, respectively) for the years ended december 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 consisted of the following:
the number of retail customers purchasing electricity and natural gas from competitive suppliers at december 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 consisted of the following:

the changes in bge's operating revenues net of purchased power and fuel expense for the year ended december 31, 2017 compared to the same period in 2016 and for the year ended december 31, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015, respectively, consisted of the following:
distribution rate increase. during the years ended december 31, 2017 and december 31, 2016, the increases in distribution revenues were primarily due to the impact of the electric and natural gas distribution rate changes that became effective in june 2016 in accordance with the electric and natural gas distribution rate case orders in june 2016 and july 2016. see note 3 - regulatory matters of the combined notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information.
revenue decoupling. the demand for electricity and natural gas is affected by weather and usage conditions. the mdpsc allows bge to record a monthly adjustment to its electric and natural gas distribution revenue from all residential customers, commercial electric customers, the majority of large industrial electric customers, and all firm service natural gas customers to eliminate the effect of abnormal weather and usage patterns per customer on bge's electric and natural gas distribution volumes, thereby recovering a specified dollar amount of distribution revenue per customer, by customer class, regardless of fluctuations in actual consumption levels. this allows bge to recognize revenue at mdpsc-approved distribution charges per customer, regardless of what bge's actual distribution volumes were for a billing period. therefore, while this revenue is affected by customer growth (i.e., increase in the number of customers), it will not be affected by volatility in actual weather or usage conditions (i.e., changes in consumption per customer). bge bills or credits customers in subsequent months for the difference between approved revenue levels under revenue decoupling and actual customer billings.
heating and cooling degree days are quantitative indices that reflect the demand for energy needed to heat or cool a home or business. normal weather is determined based on historical average heating and cooling degree days for a 30-year period in bge's service territory. the changes in heating and cooling degree days in bge's service territory for the year ended december 31, 2017 compared to the same period in 2016 and for the year ended december 31, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015, respectively, and normal weather consisted of the following:

regulatory required programs.  revenue from regulatory required programs are billings for the costs of various legislative and/or regulatory programs that are recoverable from customers on a full and current basis. these programs are designed to provide full cost recovery, as well as a return in certain instances. the costs of these programs are included in operating and maintenance expense, depreciation and amortization expense and taxes other than income in bge's consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income.
transmission revenue.  under a ferc approved formula, transmission revenue varies from year to year based upon rate adjustments to reflect fluctuations in the underlying costs, capital investments being recovered and other billing determinants. during the years ended december 31, 2017 and 2016, the increase in transmission revenue was primarily due to increases in capital investment and operating and maintenance expense recoveries. see operating and maintenance expense below and note 3 - regulatory matters of the combined notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information.
other, net.  other net revenue, which can vary from period to period, primarily includes late payment fees and other miscellaneous revenue such as service application fees, assistance provided to other utilities through bge's mutual assistance program and recoveries of electric supply and natural gas procurement costs.

(a)   pepco evaluates its operating performance using the measure of revenue net of purchased power expense for electric sales. pepco believes revenue net of purchased power expense is a useful measurement because it provides information that can be used to evaluate its operational performance. pepco has included the analysis below as a complement to the financial information provided in accordance with gaap. however, revenue net of purchased power expense is not a presentation defined under gaap and may not be comparable to other companies' presentations or deemed more useful than the gaap information provided elsewhere in this report.
net income year ended december 31, 2017 compared to year ended december 31, 2016.  pepco's net income for the year ended december 31, 2017, was higher than the same period in 2016, primarily due to a decrease in operating and maintenance expense due to merger-related costs recognized in march 2016 and an increase in revenue net of purchased power expense as a result of the distribution rate increases approved by the mdpsc effective november 2016 and october 2017 and an electric distribution rate increase approved by the dcpsc effective august 2017, partially offset by higher depreciation expense due to increased depreciation rates in maryland effective november 2016. income taxes expense incurred included unrecognized tax benefits of $21 million for uncertain tax positions related to the deductibility of certain merger commitments in the first quarter of 2017. this decrease was offset by an increase in income taxes due to the $14 million december 2017 impairment of certain transmission-related income tax regulatory assets and the one-time non-cash impacts of $8 million associated with the tax cuts and jobs act in 2017.
year ended december 31, 2016 compared to year ended december 31, 2015.  pepco's net income for the year ended december 31, 2016, was lower than the same period in 2015, primarily due to an increase in operating and maintenance expense due to merger-related costs.
operating revenue net of purchased power expense operating revenues include revenue from the distribution and supply of electricity to pepco's customers within its service territories at regulated rates. operating revenues also include transmission service revenue that pepco receives as a transmission owner from pjm at rates regulated by ferc. transmission rates are updated annually based on a ferc-approved formula methodology.
electric revenues and purchased power expense are also affected by fluctuations in participation in the customer choice program. all pepco customers have the choice to purchase electricity from competitive electric generation suppliers. the customers' choice of supplier does not impact the volume of deliveries, but affects revenue collected from customers related to supplied energy service.
retail deliveries purchased from competitive electric generation suppliers (as a percentage of kwh sales) for the years ended december 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 respectively, consisted of the following:
retail customers purchasing electric generation from competitive electric generation suppliers at december 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 consisted of the following:

retail deliveries purchased from competitive electric generation suppliers represented 73% of pepco's retail kwh sales to the district of columbia customers and 60% of pepco's retail kwh sales to maryland customers for the year ended december 31, 2017; 73% of pepco's retail kwh sales to the district of columbia customers and 59% of pepco's retail kwh sales to maryland customers for the year ended december 31, 2016; and 71% of pepco's retail kwh sales to the district of columbia customers and 60% of pepco's retail kwh sales to maryland customers for year ended december 31, 2015.
operating revenues include transmission enhancement credits that pepco receives as a transmission owner from pjm in consideration for approved regional transmission expansion plan expenditures.
operating revenues also include work and services performed on behalf of customers, including other utilities, which is generally not subject to price regulation. work and services includes mutual assistance to other utilities, highway relocation, rentals of pole attachments, late payment fees and collection fees.
purchased power expense consists of the cost of electricity purchased by pepco to fulfill its default electricity supply obligation and, as such, is recoverable from customers in accordance with the terms of public service commission orders.
the changes in pepco's operating revenues net of purchased power expense for the years ended december 31, 2017 and 2016 compared to the same periods in 2016 and 2015, respectively, consisted of the following:
volume. the increase in operating revenues net of purchased power and fuel expense related to delivery volume, exclusive of the effects of weather, for the year ended december 31, 2017 compared to the same period in 2016 primarily reflects the impact of residential customer growth. the increase in operating revenues net of purchased power and fuel expense related to delivery volume, exclusive of the effects of weather, for the year ended december 31, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 primarily reflects the impact of moderate economic and customer growth.
distribution rate increase.  the increase in electric operating revenues net of purchased power expense for the year ended december 31, 2017 compared to the same period in 2016 was primarily due to the impact of the higher electric distribution rates charged to customers in maryland that became effective in november 2016 and october 2017 and higher electric distribution rates charged to customers in the district of columbia that became effective august 2017. the increase in distribution revenue for the year ended december 31, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 was primarily due to the impact of the new electric distribution rates charged to customers in maryland that became effective in november 2016. see note 3 - regulatory matters of the combined notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information.
revenue decoupling.  pepco's results historically have been seasonal, generally producing higher revenue and income in the warmest and coldest periods of the year. for retail customers of pepco in maryland and in the district of columbia, revenues are not affected by unseasonably warmer or colder weather because a bill stabilization adjustment (bsa) for retail customers was implemented that provides for a fixed distribution charge per customer. the bsa has the effect of decoupling the distribution revenue recognized in a reporting period from the amount of power delivered during the period. as a result, the only factors that will cause distribution revenue from customers in maryland and the district of columbia to fluctuate from period to period are changes in the number of customers and changes in the approved distribution charge per customer. changes in customer usage (due to weather conditions, energy prices, energy efficiency programs or other reasons) from period to period have no impact on reported distribution revenue for customers to whom the bsa applies.
heating and cooling degree days are quantitative indices that reflect the demand for energy needed to heat or cool a home or business. normal weather is determined based on historical average heating and cooling degree days for a 20-year period in pepco's service territory. the changes in heating and cooling degree days in pepco's service territory for the years ended december 31, 2017 and december 31, 2016 compared to same periods in 2016 and 2015, respectively, and normal weather consisted of the following:

regulatory required programs. this represents the change in operating revenues collected under approved riders to recover costs incurred for regulatory programs such as energy efficiency programs. the riders are designed to provide full and current cost recovery as well as a return. the costs of these programs are included in operating and maintenance expense, depreciation and amortization expense and taxes other than income in pepco's consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income. revenue from regulatory required programs decreased for the year ended december 31, 2017 compared to the same period in 2016 primarily due to lower demand-side management program surcharge revenue due to a decrease in kwh sales and a rate decrease effective january 2017. revenue from regulatory required programs increased for the year ended december 31, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 primarily due to higher demand-side management program surcharge revenue due to a rate increase effective february 2016. refer to the operating and maintenance expense and depreciation and amortization expense discussion below for additional information on included programs.
transmission revenues. under a ferc approved formula, transmission revenue varies from year to year based upon fluctuations in the underlying costs, capital investments being recovered and other billing adjustments. transmission revenue increased for the year ended december 31, 2017 compared to the same period in 2016 due to higher rates effective june 1, 2017 and june 1, 2016 related to increases in transmission plant investment and operating expenses. transmission revenue decreased for the year ended december 31, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 due to lower revenue related to the mapp abandonment recovery period that ended in march 2016, partially offset by higher rates effective june 1, 2016 and june 1, 2015 related to increases in transmission plant investment and operating expenses.
other.  the decrease in other operating revenue net of purchased power expense for the year ended december 31, 2017 compared to the same period in 2016 is primarily due to lower pass-through revenue (which is substantially offset in taxes other than income) primarily the result of lower sales that resulted in a decrease in utility taxes that are collected by pepco on behalf of the jurisdiction. the increase in other operating revenue net of purchased power expense for the year ended december 31, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 is primarily due to higher pass-through revenue (which is substantially offset in taxes other than income) primarily the result of higher sales that resulted in an increase in utility taxes that are collected by pepco on behalf of the jurisdiction.

(c)   primarily related to merger-related commitments for customer rate credits and charitable contributions recognized in 2016.
(d)   primarily resulting from a review of capital projects during the fourth quarter of 2016.
depreciation and amortization expense the changes in depreciation and amortization expense for 2017 compared to 2016 and 2016 compared to 2015 consisted of the following:
(a)   depreciation expense increased primarily due to higher depreciation rates in maryland effective november 2016 and ongoing capital expenditures.
(b)   regulatory asset amortization increased for the year ended december 31, 2017 compared to the same period in 2016 primarily due to higher amortization of ami-related regulatory assets, partially offset by lower amortization of mapp abandonment costs. regulatory asset amortization decreased for the year ended december 31, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 primarily due to lower amortization of mapp abandonment costs.
(c)   regulatory required programs decreased for the year ended december 31, 2017 compared to the same period in 2016 primarily due to an empower maryland surcharge rate decrease effective february 2016 and increased for the year ended december 31, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 due to an empower maryland surcharge rate increase effective february 2015. depreciation and amortization expenses for regulatory required programs are recoverable from customers on a full and current basis through approved regulated rates. an equal and offsetting amount has been reflected in operating revenues and operating and maintenance expense.
taxes other than income taxes other than income for the year ended december 31, 2017 compared to the same period in 2016 decreased primarily due to lower utility taxes that are collected and passed through by pepco (which is substantially offset in operating revenues), partially offset by higher property taxes. taxes other than income for the year ended december 31, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 increased primarily due to higher utility taxes that are collected and passed through by pepco, partially offset by lower property taxes in maryland.
gain on sales of assets gain on sales of assets for the year ended december 31, 2017 compared to the same period in 2016 decreased primarily due to higher gains recorded in 2016 at pepco associated with the sale of land. gain on sale of assets for the year ended december 31, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 decreased primarily due to higher gains recorded in 2015 at pepco associated with the sale of land held as non-utility property.
interest expense, net interest expense, net for the year ended december 31, 2017 compared to the same period in 2016 decreased primarily due to the recording of interest expense for an uncertain tax position in 2016, partially offset by higher interest expense associated with the issuance of long term debt in may 2017. interest expense, net for the year ended december 31, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 increased primarily due to the recording of interest expense for an uncertain tax position in 2016, partially offset by an increase in capitalized afudc debt.
other, net other, net for the year ended december 31, 2017 compared to the same period in 2016 decreased primarily due to the september 2016 reversal of contributions in aid of construction tax gross-
up reserves due to the determination that there is no legal obligation to refund customers per contract term. other, net for the year ended december 31, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 increased primarily due to higher income from afudc equity.
effective income tax rate pepco's effective income tax rates for the years ended december 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015 were 33.9%, 49.4%, and 35.3%, respectively. see note 14 - income taxes of the combined notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the components of the change in effective income tax rates. in the first quarter of 2017, pepco decreased its liability for unrecognized tax benefits by $21 million resulting in a benefit to income taxes and corresponding decrease to its effective tax rate. this decrease was offset by an increase in income taxes due to the $14 million december 2017 impairment of certain transmission-related income tax regulatory assets and the one-time non-cash impacts of $8 million associated with the tax cuts and jobs act in 2017.
as a result of the merger, pepco recorded an after-tax charge of $31 million during the year ended december 31, 2016 as a result of the assessment and remeasurement of certain federal and state uncertain tax positions.

(a)   dpl evaluates its operating performance using the measure of revenue net of purchased power expense for electric sales and revenue net of fuel expense for gas sales. dpl believes revenue net of purchased power expense and revenue net of fuel expense are useful measurements because they provide information that can be used to evaluate its operational performance. dpl has included the analysis below as a complement to the financial information provided in accordance with gaap. however, revenue net of purchased power expense and revenue net of fuel expense is not a presentation defined under gaap and may not be comparable to other companies' presentations or deemed more useful than the gaap information provided elsewhere in this report.
year ended december 31, 2017 compared to year ended december 31, 2016.  the increase in net income was driven primarily by a decrease in operating and maintenance expense primarily due to merger-related costs recognized in march 2016 and an increase in revenues net of purchased power and fuel expense as a result of the distribution rate increases approved by the dpsc effective july and december 2016 and a distribution rate increase approved by the mdpsc effective february 2017, partially offset by higher depreciation expense due to increased depreciation rates in maryland effective february 2017. income taxes expense incurred included unrecognized tax benefits of $16 million for uncertain tax positions related to the deductibility of certain merger commitments in the first quarter of 2017. this decrease was offset by an increase in income taxes due to the $6 million december 2017 impairment of certain transmission-related income tax regulatory assets and the one-time non-cash impacts of $5 million associated with the tax cuts and jobs act in 2017.
year ended december 31, 2016 compared to year ended december 31, 2015.  the decrease in net income was driven primarily by an increase in operating and maintenance expense primarily due to merger-related costs.
operating revenue net of purchased power and fuel expense operating revenues include revenue from the distribution and supply of electricity and natural gas to dpl's customers within its service territories at regulated rates. operating revenues also include transmission service revenue that dpl receives as a transmission owner from pjm at rates regulated by ferc. transmission rates are updated annually based on a ferc-approved formula methodology.
electric and natural gas revenues and purchased power and fuel expense are also affected by fluctuations in participation in the customer choice program. all dpl customers have the choice to purchase electricity and gas from competitive electric generation and natural gas suppliers, respectively. the customers' choice of suppliers does not impact the volume of deliveries, but affects revenue collected from customers related to supplied energy and natural gas service.
retail deliveries purchased from competitive electric generation and natural gas suppliers (as a percentage of kwh and mmcf sales, respectively) for the years ended december 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, consisted of the following:
retail customers purchasing electric generation and natural gas from competitive electric generation and natural gas suppliers at december 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 consisted of the following:

retail deliveries purchased from competitive electric generation suppliers represented 54% of dpl's retail kwh sales to delaware customers and 48% of dpl retail kwh sales to maryland customers for
the year ended december 31, 2017; 53% of dpl's retail kwh sales to delaware customers and 48% of dpl's retail kwh sales to maryland customers for the year ended december 31, 2016; and 53% of dpl's retail kwh sales to delaware customers and 47% of dpl's retail kwh sales to maryland customers for the year ended december 31, 2015.
operating revenues include transmission enhancement credits that dpl receives as a transmission owner from pjm in consideration for approved regional transmission expansion plan expenditures.
operating revenues also include work and services performed on behalf of customers, including other utilities, which is generally not subject to price regulation. work and services includes mutual assistance to other utilities, highway relocation, rentals of pole attachments, late payment fees and collection fees.
natural gas operating revenues includes sources that are subject to price regulation (regulated gas revenue) and those that generally are not subject to price regulation (other gas revenue). regulated gas revenue includes the revenue dpl receives from on-system natural gas delivered sales and the transportation of natural gas for customers within its service territory at regulated rates. other gas revenue consists of off-system natural gas sales and the short-term release of interstate pipeline transportation and storage capacity not needed to serve customers. off-system sales are made possible when low demand for natural gas by regulated customers creates excess pipeline capacity.
purchased power expense consists of the cost of electricity purchased by dpl to fulfill its default electricity supply obligation and, as such, is recoverable from customers in accordance with the terms of public service commission orders. purchased fuel expense consists of the cost of gas purchased by dpl to fulfill its obligation to regulated gas customers and, as such, is recoverable from customers in accordance with the terms of public service commission orders. it also includes the cost of gas purchased for off-system sales.
the changes in dpl's operating revenues net of purchased power and fuel expense for the years ended december 31, 2017 and 2016 compared to the same periods in 2016 and 2015, respectively, consisted of the following:
increase in revenue net of purchased power expense       $73            $1                    $74              $23            $3                $26
revenue decoupling. dpl's results historically have been seasonal, generally producing higher revenue and income in the warmest and coldest periods of the year. for retail customers of dpl in maryland, revenues are not affected by unseasonably warmer or colder weather because a bill stabilization adjustment (bsa) for retail customers was implemented that provides for a fixed distribution charge per customer. the bsa has the effect of decoupling the distribution revenue recognized in a reporting period from the amount of power delivered during the period. as a result, the only factors that will cause distribution revenue from customers in maryland to fluctuate from period to period are changes
in the number of customers and changes in the approved distribution charge per customer. a modified fixed variable rate design, which would provide for a charge not tied to a customer's volumetric consumption of electricity or natural gas, has been proposed for dpl electricity and natural gas customers in delaware. changes in customer usage (due to weather conditions, energy prices, energy efficiency programs or other reasons) from period to period have no impact on reported distribution revenue for customers to whom the bsa applies.
weather.  the demand for electricity and natural gas in areas not subject to the bsa is affected by weather conditions. with respect to the electric business, very warm weather in summer months and, with respect to the electric and natural gas businesses, very cold weather in winter months are referred to as "favorable weather conditions" because these weather conditions result in increased deliveries of electricity and natural gas. conversely, mild weather reduces demand. during the year ended december 31, 2017 compared to the same period in 2016, operating revenues net of purchased power and fuel expenses was lower due to the impact of unfavorable weather conditions in dpl's service territory. during the year ended december 31, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015, weather was not a significant impact.
heating and cooling degree days are quantitative indices that reflect the demand for energy needed to heat or cool a home or business. normal weather is determined based on historical average heating and cooling degree days for a 20-year period in dpl's electric service territory and a 30-year period in dpl's natural gas service territory. the changes in heating and cooling degree days in dpl's service territory for the years ended december 31, 2017 and december 31, 2016 compared to same periods in 2016 and 2015, respectively, and normal weather consisted of the following:

of weather, for the year ended december 31, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015, primarily reflects the impact of moderate economic and customer growth.
distribution rate increase.  the increase in electric operating revenues net of purchased power expense for the year ended december 31, 2017 compared to the same period in 2016 was primarily due to the impact of the higher electric distribution and natural gas rates charged to delaware customers that became effective in july and december 2016 and the impact of higher electric distribution rates charged to maryland customers that became effective in february 2017. the increase in electric operating revenues net of purchased power expense for the year ended december 31, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 was primarily due to the impact of the new electric distribution rates charged to delaware customers that became effective in july 2016. see note 3 - regulatory matters of the combined notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information.
regulatory required programs. this represents the change in operating revenues collected under approved riders to recover costs incurred for regulatory programs such as energy efficiency programs. the riders are designed to provide full and current cost recovery as well as a return. the costs of these programs are included in operating and maintenance expense, depreciation and amortization expense and taxes other than income in dpl's consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income. revenue from regulatory required programs decreased for the year ended december 31, 2017 compared to the same period in 2016 primarily due to lower demand-side management program surcharge revenue due to a decrease in kwh sales and a rate decrease effective january 2017. revenue from regulatory required programs increased for the year ended december 31, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 primarily due to higher demand-side management program surcharge revenue due to a rate increase effective february 2016. refer to the operating and maintenance expense and depreciation and amortization expense discussion below for additional information on included programs.
transmission revenues. under a ferc approved formula, transmission revenue varies from year to year based upon fluctuations in the underlying costs, capital investments being recovered and other billing adjustments. transmission revenue increased for the year ended december 31, 2017 compared to the same period in 2016 due to higher rates effective june 1, 2017 and june 1, 2016 related to increases in transmission plant investment and operating expenses. transmission revenue increased for the year ended december 31, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 due to higher rates effective june 1, 2016 and june 1, 2015 related to increases in transmission plant investment and operating expenses, partially offset by lower revenue related to the mapp abandonment recovery period that ended in march 2016.
other.  other revenue, which can vary period to period, includes rental revenue, revenue related to late payment charges, assistance provided to other utilities through mutual assistance programs, and recoveries of other taxes.

(c)   primarily resulting from a review of capital projects during the fourth quarter of 2016.
depreciation and amortization expense the changes in depreciation and amortization expense for 2017 compared to 2016 and 2016 compared to 2015 consisted of the following:
(a)   depreciation expense increased due to higher depreciation rates in maryland effective february 2017 and due to ongoing capital expenditures.
(b)   regulatory asset amortization decreased for the year ended december 31, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 primarily due to lower amortization of mapp abandonment costs.
(c)   regulatory required programs decreased for the year ended december 31, 2017 compared to the same period in 2016 primarily due to an empower maryland surcharge rate decrease effective february 2016 and increased for the year ended december 31, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 due to an empower maryland surcharge rate increase effective february 2015. depreciation and amortization expenses for regulatory required programs are recoverable from customers on a full and current basis through approved regulated rates. a partially offsetting amount has been reflected in operating revenues and operating and maintenance expense.
taxes other than income taxes other than income for the year ended december 31, 2017 compared to the same period in 2016 remained relatively constant. taxes other than income for the year ended december 31, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 increased primarily due to higher property taxes in maryland related to higher property assessments and rate increases.
gain on sales of assets gain on sales of assets for the year ended december 31, 2017 compared to the same period in 2016 decreased primarily due to gains recorded in 2016 at dpl associated with the sale of land held as non-utility property. gain on sales of assets for the year ended december 31, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 increased primarily due to gains recorded in 2016 at dpl associated with the sale of land held as non-utility property.
effective income tax rate dpl's effective income tax rates for the years ended december 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 were 37.0%, 169.2% and 39.2%, respectively. see note 14 - income taxes of the combined notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the components of the change in effective income tax rates. in the first quarter of 2017, dpl decreased its liability for unrecognized
tax benefits by $16 million resulting in a benefit to income taxes and corresponding decrease to its effective tax rate. this decrease was offset by an increase in income taxes due to the $6 million december 2017 impairment of certain transmission-related income tax regulatory assets and the one-time non-cash impacts of $5 million associated with the tax cuts and jobs act in 2017.
as a result of the merger, dpl recorded an after-tax charge of $23 million during the year ended december 31, 2016 as a result of the assessment and remeasurement of certain federal and state uncertain tax positions.

(a)   ace evaluates its operating performance using the measure of revenue net of purchased power expense for electric sales. ace believes revenue net of purchased power expense is a useful measurement of its performance because it provides information that can be used to evaluate its operational performance. ace has included the analysis below as a complement to the financial information provided in accordance with gaap. however, revenue net of purchased power expense is not a presentation defined under gaap and may not be comparable to other companies' presentations or deemed more useful than the gaap information provided elsewhere in this report.
year ended december 31, 2017 compared to year ended december 31, 2016. the increase in net income was primarily due to a decrease in operating and maintenance expense primarily due to merger-related costs recognized in march 2016 and an increase in revenues net of purchased power expense resulting from impact of distribution rate increases approved by the njbpu effective august 2016 and october 2017 and an increase in transmission formula rate revenues, partially offset by lower customer usage. income taxes expense incurred included unrecognized tax benefits of $22 million for uncertain tax positions related to the deductibility of certain merger commitments in the first quarter of 2017. this decrease was offset by an increase in income taxes due to the december 2017 impairment of certain transmission-related income tax regulatory assets of $7 million and the one-time non-cash impacts of $2 million associated with the tax cuts and jobs act in 2017.
year ended december 31, 2016 compared to year ended december 31, 2015. the decrease in net income was driven primarily by an increase in operating and maintenance expense primarily due to merger-related costs.
revenues net of purchased power expense operating revenues include revenue from the distribution and supply of electricity to ace's customers within its service territories at regulated rates. operating revenues also include transmission service revenue that ace receives as a transmission owner from pjm at rates regulated by ferc. transmission rates are updated annually based on a ferc-approved formula methodology.
electric revenues and purchased power expense are also affected by fluctuations in participation in the customer choice program. all ace customers have the choice to purchase electricity from competitive electric generation suppliers. the customer's choice of supplier does not impact the volume of deliveries, but affects revenue collected from customers related to supplied energy service.
retail deliveries purchased from competitive electric generation suppliers (as a percentage of kwh sales) for the years ended december 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, consisted of the following:

operating revenues include revenue from transition bond charges that ace receives, and pays to ace funding, to fund the principal and interest payments on transition bonds, revenue from the resale in the pjm wholesale markets for energy and capacity purchased under contracts with unaffiliated nugs, and revenue from transmission enhancement credits.
operating revenues also include work and services performed on behalf of customers, including other utilities, which is generally not subject to price regulation. work and services includes mutual assistance to other utilities, highway relocation, rentals of pole attachments, late payment fees and collection fees.
purchased power expense consists of the cost of electricity purchased by ace to fulfill its default electricity supply obligation and, as such, is recoverable from customers in accordance with the terms of public service commission orders.

increase in revenue net of purchased power expense                         $10                                          $19
weather. the demand for electricity is affected by weather conditions. with respect to the electric business, very warm weather in summer months and very cold weather in winter months are referred to as "favorable weather conditions" because these weather conditions result in increased deliveries of electricity. conversely, mild weather reduces demand. during the year ended december 31, 2017 compared to the same period in 2016, operating revenues net of purchased power and fuel expense was lower due to the impact of unfavorable winter weather conditions in ace's service territory. during the year ended december 31, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015, operating revenues net of purchased power and fuel expense was lower due to the impact of unfavorable winter weather conditions in ace's service territory.
for retail customers of ace, distribution revenues are not decoupled for the distribution of electricity by ace, and thus are subject to variability due to changes in customer consumption. therefore, changes in customer usage (due to weather conditions, energy prices, energy savings programs or other reasons) from period to period have a direct impact on reported distribution revenue for customers in ace's service territory.
heating and cooling degree days are quantitative indices that reflect the demand for energy needed to heat or cool a home or business. normal weather is determined based on historical average heating and cooling degree days for a 20-year period in ace's service territory. the changes in heating and cooling degree days in ace's service territory for the years ended december 31, 2017 and december 31, 2016 compared to same periods in 2016 and 2015, respectively, and normal weather consisted of the following:

volume. the decrease in operating revenues net of purchased power and fuel expense related to delivery volume, exclusive of the effects of weather, for the year ended december 31, 2017 compared to the same period in 2016, primarily reflects lower average customer usage, partially offset by the impact of customer growth. the increase in operating revenues net of purchased power and fuel expense related to delivery volume, exclusive of the effects of weather, for the year ended december 31, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015, primarily reflects the impact of moderate economic and customer growth, partially offset by lower average customer usage.
distribution rate increase. the increase in electric operating revenues net of purchased power expense for the year ended december 31, 2017 compared to the same period in 2016 was primarily due to the impact of the new electric distribution rates charged to customers that became effective in august 2016 and october 2017. the increase in electric operating revenues net of purchased power expense for the year ended december 31, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 was primarily due to the impact of the new electric distribution rates charged to customers that became effective in august 2016. see note 3 - regulatory matters of the combined notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information.
regulatory required programs. this represents the change in operating revenues collected under approved riders to recover costs incurred for regulatory programs such as energy efficiency programs. the riders are designed to provide full and current cost recovery as well as a return. the costs of these programs are included in operating and maintenance expense, depreciation and amortization expense and taxes other than income in ace's consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income. revenue from regulatory required programs decreased for the year ended december 31, 2017 compared to the same period in 2016 due to a rate decrease effective october 2016 for the ace transition bond charge and market transition charge tax. revenue from required regulatory programs decreased for the year ended december 31, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 due to rate decreases effective october 2016 and october 2015 for the ace market transition charge tax. refer to the operating and maintenance expense and depreciation and amortization expense discussion below for additional information on included programs.
transmission revenues. under a ferc approved formula, transmission revenue varies from year to year based upon fluctuations in the underlying costs, capital investments being recovered and other billing adjustments. transmission revenue increased for the year ended december 31, 2017 compared to the same period in 2016 due to higher rates effective june 1, 2017 and june 1, 2016 related to increases in transmission plant investment and operating expenses. transmission revenue increased for the year ended december 31, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 due to higher rates effective june 1, 2016 and june 1, 2015 related to increases in transmission plant investment and operating expenses.

depreciation and amortization expense the changes in depreciation and amortization expense for 2017 compared to 2016 and 2016 compared to 2015 consisted of the following:
(a)   depreciation expense increased due to ongoing capital expenditures.
(b)   regulatory required programs decreased for the year ended december 31, 2017 compared to the same period in 2016 primarily as a result of lower revenue due to a rate decrease effective october 2016 for the ace transition bond charge and market transition charge tax. required regulatory programs amortization decreased for the year ended december 31, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 primarily as a result of lower revenue due to a rate decrease effective october 2015 for the ace market transition charge tax. depreciation and amortization expenses for regulatory required programs are recoverable from customers on a full and current basis through approved regulated rates. an equal and offsetting amount has been reflected in operating revenues and operating and maintenance expense.
gain on sales of assets gain on sales of assets for the year ended december 31, 2017 compared to the same period in 2016 decreased primarily due to gains recorded in 2016 at ace associated with the sale of property. gain on sales of assets for the year ended december 31, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 increased primarily due to gains recorded in 2016 at ace associated with the sale of property.
effective income tax rate ace's effective income tax rates for the years ended december 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 were 25.2%, 8.7%, and 45.2%, respectively. see note 14 - income taxes of the combined notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the components of the change in effective income tax rates. in the first quarter of 2017, ace decreased its liability for unrecognized tax benefits by $22 million resulting in a benefit to income taxes and corresponding decrease to its effective tax rate. this decrease was offset by an increase in income taxes due to the december 2017
impairment of certain transmission-related income tax regulatory assets of $7 million and the one-time non-cash impacts of $2 million associated with the tax cuts and jobs act in 2017.
as a result of the merger, ace recorded an after-tax charge of $22 million during the year ended december 31, 2016 as a result of the assessment and remeasurement of certain federal and state uncertain tax positions.

liquidity and capital resources exelon activity presented below includes the activity of phi, pepco, dpl and ace, from the phi merger effective date of march 24, 2016 through december 31, 2017. exelon prior year activity is unadjusted for the effects of the phi merger. due to the application of push-down accounting to the phi entity, phi's activity is presented in two separate reporting periods, the legacy phi activity through march 23, 2016 (predecessor), and phi activity for the remainder of the period after the phi merger date (successor). for each of pepco, dpl and ace the activity presented below include its activity for the years ended december 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015. all results included throughout the liquidity and capital resources section are presented on a gaap basis.
the registrants' operating and capital expenditures requirements are provided by internally generated cash flows from operations as well as funds from external sources in the capital markets and through bank borrowings. the registrants' businesses are capital intensive and require considerable capital resources. each registrant's access to external financing on reasonable terms depends on its credit ratings and current overall capital market business conditions, including that of the utility industry in general. if these conditions deteriorate to the extent that the registrants no longer have access to the capital markets at reasonable terms, the registrants have access to unsecured revolving credit facilities with aggregate bank commitments of $9 billion. in addition, generation has $480 million in bilateral facilities with banks which have various expirations between january 2019 and december 2019. the registrants utilize their credit facilities to support their commercial paper programs, provide for other short-term borrowings and to issue letters of credit. see the "credit matters" section below for further discussion. the registrants expect cash flows to be sufficient to meet operating expenses, financing costs and capital expenditure requirements.
the registrants primarily use their capital resources, including cash, to fund capital requirements, including construction expenditures, retire debt, pay dividends, fund pension and other postretirement benefit obligations and invest in new and existing ventures. the registrants spend a significant amount of cash on capital improvements and construction projects that have a long-term return on investment. additionally, comed, peco, bge, pepco, dpl and ace operate in rate-regulated environments in which the amount of new investment recovery may be delayed or limited and where such recovery takes place over an extended period of time. see note 13 - debt and credit agreements of the combined notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the registrants' debt and credit agreements.
nrc minimum funding requirements nrc regulations require that licensees of nuclear generating facilities demonstrate reasonable assurance that sufficient funds will be available in certain minimum amounts to decommission the facility.  these nrc minimum funding levels are based upon the assumption that decommissioning activities will commence after the end of the current licensed life of each unit.  if a unit fails the nrc minimum funding test, then the plant's owners or parent companies would be required to take steps, such as providing financial guarantees through letters of credit or parent company guarantees or making additional cash contributions to the ndt fund to ensure sufficient funds are available. see note 15 - asset retirement obligations of the combined notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information on the nrc minimum funding requirements.
if a nuclear plant were to early retire there is a risk that it will no longer meet the nrc minimum funding requirements due to the earlier commencement of decommissioning activities and a shorter time period over which the ndt fund investments could appreciate in value. a shortfall could require exelon to post parental guarantees for generation's share of the obligations. however, the amount of any required guarantees will ultimately depend on the decommissioning approach adopted at each site, the associated level of costs, and the decommissioning trust fund investment performance going forward.
within two years after shutting down a plant, generation must submit a post-shutdown decommissioning activities report (psdar) to the nrc that includes the planned option for decommissioning the site. as discussed in note 15 - asset retirement obligations of the combined notes to consolidated financial statements, generation filed its biennial decommissioning funding status report with the nrc on march 31, 2017 and demonstrated adequate funding assurance for all nuclear units currently operating. as of december 31, 2017, across the four alternative decommissioning approaches available, generation estimates a parental guarantee of up to $90 million from exelon could be required for tmi, dependent upon the ultimate decommissioning approach selected. for oyster creek, none of the alternative decommissioning approaches available would require exelon to post a parental guarantee. in the event pseg decides to early retire salem, generation estimates a parental guarantee of up to $45 million from exelon could be required for salem, dependent upon the ultimate decommissioning approach selected.
upon issuance of any required financial guarantees, each site would be able to utilize the respective ndt funds for radiological decommissioning costs, which represent the majority of the total expected decommissioning costs. however, the nrc must approve an additional exemption in order for the plant's owner(s) to utilize the ndt fund to pay for non-radiological decommissioning costs (i.e., spent fuel management and site restoration costs). if a unit does not receive this exemption, the costs would be borne by the owner(s). while the ultimate amounts may vary greatly and could be reduced by alternate decommissioning scenarios and/or reimbursement of certain costs under the united states department of energy reimbursement agreements or future litigation, across the four alternative decommissioning approaches available, if tmi or oyster creek were to fail to obtain the exemption, generation estimates it could incur spent fuel management and site restoration costs over the next ten years of up to $225 million and $200 million net of taxes, respectively, dependent upon the ultimate decommissioning approach selected. in the event pseg decides to early retire salem and salem were to fail to obtain the exemption, generation estimates it could incur spent fuel management and site restoration costs over the next ten years of up to $80 million net of taxes.
junior subordinated notes in june 2014, exelon issued $1.15 billion of junior subordinated notes in the form of 23 million equity units at a stated amount of $50.00 per unit. each equity unit represented an undivided beneficial ownership interest in exelon's $1.15 billion of 2.50% junior subordinated notes due in 2024 ("2024 notes") and a forward equity purchase contract.  as contemplated in the june 2014 equity unit structure, in april 2017, exelon completed the remarketing of the 2024 notes into $1.15 billion of 3.497% junior subordinated notes due in 2022 ("remarketing").  exelon conducted the remarketing on behalf of the holders of equity units and did not directly receive any proceeds therefrom. instead, the former holders of the 2024 notes used debt remarketing proceeds towards settling the forward equity purchase contract with exelon on june 1, 2017. exelon issued approximately 33 million shares of common stock from treasury stock and received $1.15 billion upon settlement of the forward equity purchase contract. when reissuing treasury stock exelon uses the average price paid to repurchase shares to calculate a gain or loss on issuance and records gains or losses directly to retained earnings. a loss on reissuance of treasury shares of $1.05 billion was recorded to retained earnings as of december 31, 2017. see note 21 - earnings per share of the combined notes to consolidated financial statements for further information on the issuance of common stock.
cash flows from operating activities general generation's cash flows from operating activities primarily result from the sale of electric energy and energy-related products and services to customers. generation's future cash flows from operating activities may be affected by future demand for and market prices of energy and its ability to continue to produce and supply power at competitive costs as well as to obtain collections from customers.
the utility registrants' cash flows from operating activities primarily result from the transmission and distribution of electricity and, in the case of peco, bge and dpl, gas distribution services. the utility registrants' distribution services are provided to an established and diverse base of retail customers. the utility registrants' future cash flows may be affected by the economy, weather conditions, future legislative initiatives, future regulatory proceedings with respect to their rates or operations, competitive suppliers, and their ability to achieve operating cost reductions.
see notes 3 - regulatory matters and 23 - commitments and contingencies of the combined notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion of regulatory and legal proceedings and proposed legislation.
the following table provides a summary of the major items affecting exelon's cash flows from operations for the years ended december 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015:

(b)   changes in working capital and other noncurrent assets and liabilities exclude the changes in commercial paper, income taxes and the current portion of long-term debt.
pension and other postretirement benefits management considers various factors when making pension funding decisions, including actuarially determined minimum contribution requirements under erisa, contributions required to avoid benefit restrictions and at-risk status as defined by the pension protection act of 2006 (the act), management of the pension obligation and regulatory implications. the act requires the attainment of certain funding levels to avoid benefit restrictions (such as an inability to pay lump sums or to accrue benefits prospectively), and at-risk status (which triggers higher minimum contribution requirements and participant notification). the projected contributions below reflect a funding strategy of contributing the greater of (1) $300 million (updated for the inclusion of phi) until the qualified plans are fully funded on an abo basis, and (2) the minimum amounts under erisa to avoid benefit restrictions and at-risk status. this level funding strategy helps minimize volatility of future period required pension contributions. unlike
while other postretirement plans are also not subject to statutory minimum contribution requirements, exelon does fund certain of its plans. for exelon's funded opeb plans, contributions generally equal accounting costs, however, exelon's management has historically considered several factors in determining the level of contributions to its other postretirement benefit plans, including liabilities management, levels of benefit claims paid and regulatory implications (amounts deemed prudent to meet regulatory expectations and best assure continued rate recovery). the amounts below include benefit payments related to unfunded plans.
the following table provides all registrants' planned contributions to the qualified pension plans, planned benefit payments to non-qualified pension plans, and planned contributions to other postretirement plans in 2018:
qualified pension plans            non-qualified pension plans                   other postretirement benefits exelon                    $301                                  $30                          $42
generation                 119                                   11                           13
to the extent interest rates decline significantly or the pension and opeb plans earn less than the expected asset returns, annual pension contribution requirements in future years could increase. conversely, to the extent interest rates increase significantly or the pension and opeb plans earn greater than the expected asset returns, annual pension and opeb contribution requirements in future years could decrease. additionally, expected contributions could change if exelon changes its pension or opeb funding strategy.
on october 3, 2017, the us department of treasury and irs released final regulations updating the mortality tables to be used for defined benefit pension plan funding, as well as the valuation of lump sum and other accelerated distribution options, effective for plan years beginning in 2018. the new mortality tables reflect improved projected life expectancy as compared to the existing table, which is generally expected to increase minimum pension funding requirements, pension benefit guaranty corporation premiums and the value of lump sum distributions. the irs permits plan sponsors the option of delaying use of the new mortality tables for determining minimum funding requirements until 2019, which exelon intends to utilize. the one-year delay does not apply for use of the mortality tables to determine the present value of lump sum distributions. the estimated impact of the new mortality tables along with other current assumptions and market information are reflected in the estimated future pension contributions in the "contractual obligations" section below.
the ema requires ceng to fund the obligation related to pre-transfer service of employees, including the underfunded balance of the pension and other postretirement welfare benefit plans
measured as of july 14, 2014 by making periodic payments to generation. these payments will be made on an agreed payment schedule or upon the occurrence of certain specified events, such as edf's disposition of a majority of its interest in ceng. however, in the event that edf exercises its rights under the put option, all payments not made as of the put closing date shall accelerate to be paid immediately prior to such closing date. see note 2 - variable interest entities of the combined notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the investment in ceng.
tax matters the registrants' future cash flows from operating activities may be affected by the following tax matters:
•   pursuant to the tcja, beginning in 2018 generation is expected to have higher operating cash flows in the range of approximately $1.2 billion to $1.6 billion for the period from 2018 to 2021, reflecting the reduction in the corporate federal income tax rate and full expensing of capital investments.
the tcja is generally expected to result in lower operating cash flows for the utility registrants as a result of the elimination of bonus depreciation and lower customer rates. increased operating cash flows for the utility registrants from lower corporate federal income tax rates is expected to be more than offset over time by lower customer rates resulting from lower income tax expense recoveries and the settlement of deferred income tax net regulatory liabilities established pursuant to the tcja. the amount and timing of settlement of the net regulatory liabilities will be determined by the utility registrants' respective rate regulators, subject to certain irs "normalization" rules. the table below sets forth the registrants' estimated categorization of their net regulatory liabilities as of december 31, 2017. the amounts in the table below are shown on an after-tax basis reflecting future net cash outflows after taking into consideration the income tax benefits associated with the ultimate settlement with customers.
successor exelon               comed           peco(a)               bge                   phi             pepco               dpl               ace subject to irs normalization rules           $3,040               $1,400             $533               $459                $648                $299              $195              $153
(a)   given the regulatory treatment of income tax benefits related to electric and gas distribution repairs, peco remains in an overall net regulatory asset position as of december 31, 2017 after recording the impacts related to the tcja. as a result, the amount of customer benefits resulting from the tcja subject to the discretion of peco's rate regulators are lower relative to the other utility registrants. refer to note 3 - regulatory matters for additional information.
net regulatory liability amounts subject to normalization rules generally may not be passed back to customers any faster than over the remaining useful lives of the underlying assets giving rise to the associated deferred income taxes. such deferred income taxes generally relate to property, plant and equipment with remaining useful lives ranging from 30 to 40 years across the utility registrants. for the remaining amounts, rate regulators could require the passing back of amounts to customers over shorter time frames, which could materially decrease operating cash outflows at each of the utility registrants in the near term.
the utility registrants expect to fund any such required incremental operating cash outflows using a combination of third party debt financings and equity funding from exelon in combinations generally consistent with existing capitalization ratio structures. to fund any additional equity contributions to the utility registrants, exelon would have available to it its typical sources, including, but not limited to, the increased operating cash flows at generation
referenced above, which over time are expected to exceed the incremental equity needs at the utility registrants.
the utility registrants continue to work with their state regulatory commissions to determine the amount and timing of the passing back of tcja income tax savings benefits to customers; with filings either made, or expected to be made, at pepco, dpl and ace, and approved filings at comed and bge. the amounts being passed back or proposed to be passed back to customers reflect the benefit of lower income tax expense beginning january 1, 2018 (feb. 1, 2018 for dpl delaware), and the settlement of a portion of deferred income tax regulatory liabilities established upon enactment of the tcja. to date, neither the papuc nor ferc has yet issued guidance on how and when to reflect the impacts of the tcja in customer rates. refer to note 3 - regulatory matters of the combined notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on their filings.
in general, most states use federal taxable income as the starting point for computing state corporate income tax. now that the tcja has been enacted, state governments are beginning to analyze the impact of the tcja on their state revenues. exelon is uncertain regarding what the state governments will do, and there is a possibility that state corporate income taxes could change due to the enactment of the tcja. in 2018, exelon will be closely monitoring the states' responses to the tcja as these could have an impact on exelon's future cash flows.
see note 14 - income taxes of the combined notes to consolidated financial information for further information on the amounts of the net regulatory liabilities subject to determinations by rate regulators.
•   exelon appealed the tax court's like-kind exchange decision in the third quarter of 2017. in the fourth quarter of 2017, the irs assessed the tax, penalties and interest of approximately $1.3 billion related to the like-kind exchange, including $300 million attributable to comed. while exelon will receive a tax benefit of approximately $350 million associated with the deduction for the interest, exelon currently has a net operating loss carryforward and thus does not expect to realize the cash benefit until 2018. after taking into account these interest deduction tax benefits, the total estimated net cash outflow for the like-kind exchange is approximately $950 million, of which approximately $300 million is attributable to comed after giving consideration to exelon's agreement to hold comed harmless from any unfavorable impacts on comed's equity from the like-kind exchange position.
of the above amounts payable, exelon deposited with the irs $1.25 billion in october of 2016. exelon funded the $1.25 billion deposit with a combination of cash on hand and short-term borrowings. as a result of the irs's assessment of the tax, penalties and interest in the fourth quarter of 2017, the deposit is no longer available to exelon and thus was reclassified from a current asset and is now reflected as an offset to the related liabilities for the tax, penalties, and interest that are included on exelon's balance sheet as current liabilities. the remaining amount due of approximately $20 million was paid in the fourth quarter of 2017. in the third quarter of 2017, the $300 million payable discussed above attributable to comed, net of comed's receivable pursuant to the hold harmless agreement, was settled with exelon. see note 14 - income taxes of the combined notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the like-kind exchange tax position.
•   state and local governments continue to face increasing financial challenges, which may increase the risk of additional income tax, property taxes and other taxes or the imposition, extension or permanence of temporary tax increases. on july 6, 2017, illinois enacted senate bill 9, which permanently increased illinois' total corporate income tax rate from 7.75% to 9.50% effective july 1, 2017. the rate increase is not expected to have a material ongoing
impact to exelon's, generation's or comed's future cash taxes. see note 14 - income taxes of the combined notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the illinois tax rate change.

changes in registrants' cash flows from operations were generally consistent with changes in each registrant's respective results of operations, as adjusted by changes in working capital in the normal course of business, except as discussed below. in addition, significant operating cash flow impacts for the registrants for 2017, 2016 and 2015 were as follows:
generation
•   depending upon whether generation is in a net mark-to-market liability or asset position, collateral may be required to be posted with or collected from its counterparties. in addition, the collateral posting and collection requirements differ depending on whether the transactions are on an exchange or in the otc markets. during 2017, 2016 and 2015, generation had net collections/(payments) of counterparty cash collateral of $(129) million, $923 million and $407 million, respectively, primarily due to market conditions that resulted in changes to generation's net mark-to-market position.
•   during 2017, 2016 and 2015, generation had net collections/(payments) of approximately $28 million, $(66) million and $58 million, respectively, related to purchases and sales of options. the level of option activity in a given year may vary due to several factors, including changes in market conditions as well as changes in hedging strategy.
•   during 2017, 2016, and 2015 comed (posted)/received approximately $(27 million), $7 million, and $(31 million) of cash collateral with/from pjm, respectively. comed's collateral posted with pjm has increased from 2017 to 2016, primarily due to an increase in comed's rpm credit requirements and peak market activity with pjm. the collateral posted with pjm decreased from 2016 to 2015 due to lower pjm billings.

significant investing cash flow impacts for the registrants for 2017, 2016 and 2015 were as follows:
•   during 2017, exelon had additional expenditures of $23 million and $178 million relating to the conedison solutions and the acquisitions of the fitzpatrick nuclear generating station, respectively. during 2016, exelon had expenditures of $6.6 billion, $235 million, and $58 million relating to the acquisitions of phi, conedison solutions and the acquisitions of the fitzpatrick nuclear generating station, respectively.
•   during 2017, exelon had proceeds of $219 million from sales of long-lived assets.
•   during 2016, exelon had proceeds of $360 million as a result of early termination of direct financing leases.
generation
•   during 2017, generation had additional expenditures of $23 million and $178 million relating to the conedison solutions and the acquisitions of the fitzpatrick nuclear generating station, respectively. during 2016, generation had expenditures of $235 million, and $58 million relating to the acquisitions of conedison solutions and the acquisitions of the fitzpatrick nuclear generating station, respectively.

capital expenditure spending generation generation has entered into several agreements to acquire equity interests in privately held development stage entities which develop energy-related technology.  the agreements contain a series of scheduled investment commitments, including in-kind services contributions. there are anticipated expenditures to fund anticipated planned capital and operating needs of the associated companies.
capital expenditures by registrant for the year ended december 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 and projected amounts for 2018 are as follows:
generation           2,100                   2,259               3,078               3,841

(a)   total projected capital expenditures do not include adjustments for non-cash activity.
(c)   the capital expenditures and 2018 projections include $86 million of expected incremental spending pursuant to eima, comed has committed to invest approximately $2.6 billion over a ten-year period to modernize and storm-harden its distribution system and to implement smart grid technology.
projected capital expenditures and other investments are subject to periodic review and revision to reflect changes in economic conditions and other factors.
generation approximately 40% and 10% of the projected 2018 capital expenditures at generation are for the acquisition of nuclear fuel, and the construction of new natural gas plants and solar facilities, respectively, with the remaining amounts reflecting investment in renewable energy and additions and upgrades to existing facilities (including material condition improvements during nuclear refueling outages). generation anticipates that they will fund capital expenditures with internally generated funds and borrowings.
comed, peco, bge, pepco, dpl and ace projected 2018 capital expenditures at the utility registrants are for continuing projects to maintain and improve operations, including enhancing reliability and adding capacity to the transmission and distribution systems such as comed's reliability related investments required under eima, and the utility registrants' construction commitments under pjm's rtep.
the utility registrants as transmission owners are subject to nerc compliance requirements. nerc provides guidance to transmission owners regarding assessments of transmission lines. the results of these assessments could require the utility registrants to incur incremental capital or operating and maintenance expenditures to ensure their transmission lines meet nerc standards. in 2010, nerc provided guidance to transmission owners that recommended the utility registrants perform assessments of their transmission lines. comed, peco and bge submitted their final bi-annual reports to nerc in january 2014. comed, peco and bge will be incurring incremental capital expenditures associated with this guidance following the completion of the assessments. specific projects and
expenditures are identified as the assessments are completed. comed's, peco's and bge's forecasted 2018 capital expenditures above reflect capital spending for remediation to be completed through 2019. pepco, dpl and ace have substantially completed their assessments and thus do not expect significant capital expenditures related to this guidance in 2018.
the utility registrants anticipate that they will fund their capital expenditures with a combination of internally generated funds and borrowings and additional capital contributions from parent.

credit matters market conditions the registrants fund liquidity needs for capital investment, working capital, energy hedging and other financial commitments through cash flows from continuing operations, public debt offerings, commercial paper markets and large, diversified credit facilities. the credit facilities include $9.5 billion in aggregate total commitments of which $8.3 billion was available as of december 31, 2017, and of which no financial institution has more than 7% of the aggregate commitments for exelon, generation, comed, peco, bge, pepco, dpl and ace. the registrants had access to the commercial paper market during 2017 to fund their short-term liquidity needs, when necessary. the registrants routinely review the sufficiency of their liquidity position, including appropriate sizing of credit facility commitments, by performing various stress test scenarios, such as commodity price movements, increases in margin-related transactions, changes in hedging levels and the impacts of hypothetical credit downgrades. the registrants have continued to closely monitor events in the financial markets and the financial institutions associated with the credit facilities, including monitoring credit ratings and outlooks, credit default swap levels, capital raising and merger activity. see part i. item 1a. risk factors for further information regarding the effects of uncertainty in the capital and credit markets.
the registrants believe their cash flow from operating activities, access to credit markets and their credit facilities provide sufficient liquidity. if generation lost its investment grade credit rating as of december 31, 2017, it would have been required to provide incremental collateral of $1.8 billion to meet collateral obligations for derivatives, non-derivatives, normal purchases and normal sales contracts and applicable payables and receivables, net of the contractual right of offset under master netting agreements, which is well within its current available credit facility capacities of $4.7 billion.
the following table presents the incremental collateral that each utility registrant would have been required to provide in the event each utility registrant lost its investment grade credit rating at december 31, 2017 and available credit facility capacity prior to any incremental collateral at december 31, 2017:

(a)   represents incremental collateral related to natural gas procurement contracts.
exelon credit facilities exelon, comed and bge meet their short-term liquidity requirements primarily through the issuance of commercial paper. generation and peco meet their short-term liquidity requirements primarily through the issuance of commercial paper and borrowings from the intercompany money pool. phi meets its short-term liquidity requirements primarily through the issuance of short-term notes and the exelon intercompany money pool. pepco, dpl and ace meet their short-term liquidity requirements primarily through the issuance of commercial paper and short-term notes. the registrants may use their respective credit facilities for general corporate purposes, including meeting short-term funding requirements and the issuance of letters of credit.
see note 13 - debt and credit agreements of the combined notes to consolidated financial statements for discussion of the registrants' credit facilities and short term borrowing activity.
other credit matters capital structure. at december 31, 2017, the capital structures of the registrants consisted of the following:
exelon       generation          comed         peco            bge         phi         pepco         dpl         ace long-term debt                        51   %            32   %           44   %        44   %       45   %      39   %       50   %       46   %      49   %
(a)   includes approximately $389 million, $205 million and $184 million owed to unconsolidated affiliates of exelon, comed, and peco respectively. these special purpose entities were created for the sole purposes of issuing mandatorily redeemable trust preferred securities of comed and peco. see note 2 - variable interest entities of the combined notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the authoritative guidance for vies.
security ratings the registrants' access to the capital markets, including the commercial paper market, and their respective financing costs in those markets, may depend on the securities ratings of the entity that is accessing the capital markets.
the registrants' borrowings are not subject to default or prepayment as a result of a downgrading of securities, although such a downgrading of a registrant's securities could increase fees and interest charges under that registrant's credit agreements.
as part of the normal course of business, the registrants enter into contracts that contain express provisions or otherwise permit the registrants and their counterparties to demand adequate assurance of future performance when there are reasonable grounds for doing so. in accordance with the contracts and applicable contracts law, if the registrants are downgraded by a credit rating agency, it is possible that a counterparty would attempt to rely on such a downgrade as a basis for making a demand for adequate assurance of future performance, which could include the posting of collateral. see note 12 - derivative financial instruments of the combined notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information on collateral provisions.
intercompany money pool to provide an additional short-term borrowing option that will generally be more favorable to the borrowing participants than the cost of external financing, both exelon and phi operate an intercompany money pool. maximum amounts contributed to and borrowed from the money pool by participant and the net contribution or borrowing as of december 31, 2017, are presented in the following tables:

investments in nuclear decommissioning trust funds. exelon, generation and ceng maintain trust funds, as required by the nrc, to fund certain costs of decommissioning nuclear plants. the mix of securities in the trust funds is designed to provide returns to be used to fund decommissioning and to offset inflationary increases in decommissioning costs. generation actively monitors the investment performance of the trust funds and periodically reviews asset allocations in accordance with
generation's ndt fund investment policy. generation's and ceng's investment policies establish limits on the concentration of holdings in any one company and also in any one industry. see note 15 - asset retirement obligations of the combined notes to consolidated financial statements for further information regarding the trust funds, the nrc's minimum funding requirements and related liquidity ramifications.
shelf registration statements. exelon, generation, comed, peco, bge, pepco, dpl and ace have a currently effective combined shelf registration statement unlimited in amount, filed with the sec, that will expire in august 2019. the ability of each registrant to sell securities off the shelf registration statement or to access the private placement markets will depend on a number of factors at the time of the proposed sale, including other required regulatory approvals, as applicable, the current financial condition of the registrant, its securities ratings and market conditions.
(a)   generation currently has blanket financing authority it received from ferc in connection with its market-based rate authority.
(b)   comed had $1,140 million available in long-term debt refinancing authority and $243 million available in new money long term debt financing authority from the icc as of december 31, 2017 and has an expiration date of june 1, 2019 and march 1, 2019, respectively.

exelon's ability to pay dividends on its common stock depends on the receipt of dividends paid by its operating subsidiaries. the payments of dividends to exelon by its subsidiaries in turn depend on their results of operations and cash flows and other items affecting retained earnings. the federal power act declares it to be unlawful for any officer or director of any public utility "to participate in the making or paying of any dividends of such public utility from any funds properly included in capital account." in addition, under illinois law, comed may not pay any dividend on its stock, unless, among other things, its earnings and earned surplus are sufficient to declare and pay a dividend after provision is made for reasonable and proper reserves, or unless comed has specific authorization from the icc. bge is subject to certain dividend restrictions established by the mdpsc. first, bge was prohibited from paying a dividend on its common shares through the end of 2014. second, bge is prohibited from paying a dividend on its common shares if (a) after the dividend payment, bge's equity ratio would be below 48% as calculated pursuant to the mdpsc's ratemaking precedents or (b) bge's senior unsecured credit rating is rated by two of the three major credit rating agencies below investment grade. finally, bge must notify the mdpsc that it intends to declare a dividend on its common shares at least 30 days before such a dividend is paid. pepco, dpl and ace are subject to certain dividend restrictions established by settlements approved in nj, de, md and the dc. pepco, dpl and ace are prohibited from paying a dividend on their common shares if (a) after the dividend payment, pepco's, dpl's or ace's equity ratio would be below 48% as equity levels are calculated under the ratemaking precedents of the commissions
and the board or (b) pepco's, dpl's or ace's senior unsecured credit rating is rated by one of the three major credit rating agencies below investment grade. at december 31, 2017, exelon had retained earnings of $13,503 million, including generation's undistributed earnings of $4,310 million, comed's retained earnings of $1,132 million consisting of retained earnings appropriated for future dividends of $2,771 million partially offset by $1,639 million of unappropriated retained deficit, peco's retained earnings of $1,087 million and bge's retained earnings $1,536 million. at december 31, 2017, pepco had retained earnings of $1,063 million, dpl had retained earnings of $571 million and ace had retained earnings of $131 million. see note 23 - commitments and contingencies of the combined notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding fund transfer restrictions.

item 7.   management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations generation general generation's integrated business consists of the generation, physical delivery and marketing of power across multiple geographical regions through its customer-facing business, constellation, which sells electricity and natural gas to both wholesale and retail customers. generation also sells renewable energy and other energy-related products and services. generation has six reportable segments consisting of the mid-atlantic, midwest, new england, new york, ercot and other power regions. these segments are discussed in further detail in item 1. business - exelon generation company, llc of this form 10-k.
executive overview a discussion of items pertinent to generation's executive overview is set forth under item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations - exelon corporation - executive overview of this form 10-k.
results of operations year ended december 31, 2017 compared to year ended december 31, 2016 and year ended december 31, 2016 compared to year ended december 31, 2015
a discussion of generation's results of operations for 2017 compared to 2016 and 2016 compared to 2015 is set forth under results of operations-generation in exelon corporation - results of operations of this form 10-k.
liquidity and capital resources generation's business is capital intensive and requires considerable capital resources. generation's capital resources are primarily provided by internally generated cash flows from operations and, to the extent necessary, external financing, including the issuance of long-term debt, commercial paper, participation in the intercompany money pool or capital contributions from exelon. generation's access to external financing at reasonable terms is dependent on its credit ratings and general business conditions, as well as that of the utility industry in general. if these conditions deteriorate to where generation no longer has access to the capital markets at reasonable terms, generation has access to credit facilities in the aggregate of $5.8 billion that generation currently utilizes to support its commercial paper program and to issue letters of credit.

we are continuing to aggressively seek new technology and process solutions to provide continued loss cost accuracy, efficient processing and enhanced customer experiences that are simple, fast and produce high degrees of satisfaction. for example, we have opened several digital operating centers to handle auto claims countrywide utilizing our virtual estimation capabilities, which includes estimating damage through photos and video with the use of quickfoto claimÂ® and virtual assistsm. these organizational and process changes have been beneficial to our operations as they are occurring, but frequency and severity statistics may be impacted as changes in claim opening and closing practices, if any, can impact comparisons to prior periods.
prior year reserve reestimates are developed based on factors that are calculated quarterly and periodically throughout the year for data elements such as claims reported and settled, paid losses and paid losses combined with case reserves. these data elements are primarily responsible for revisions to loss development factors used to predict how losses are likely to develop from the end of a reporting period until all claims have been paid. when actual development of these data elements is different than the historical development pattern used in a prior period reserve estimate, reserves are revised as actuarial studies validate new trends based on the indications of updated development factor calculations. claims organizational and process changes that are currently occurring are considered within our estimation process.

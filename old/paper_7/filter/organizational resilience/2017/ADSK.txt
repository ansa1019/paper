in order to support our strategic priorities of completing the subscription transition, digitizing the company, and re-imagining manufacturing, construction, and production, we commenced a world-wide restructuring plan in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018. through the restructuring, we seek to reduce our investments in areas not aligned with our strategic priorities, including in areas related to research and development and go-to-market activities. at the same time, we plan to further invest in strategic priority areas related to digital infrastructure, customer success, and construction. by re-balancing resources to better align with our strategic priorities, we are positioning ourselves to meet our long-term goals, while keeping non-gaap spend flat in fiscal 2019. we anticipate incurring pre-tax restructuring charges of $135 million to $149 million, substantially all of which would result in cash expenditures, $124 million to $137 million of which would be for one-time employee termination benefits, and $11 million to $12 million of which would be for facilities-related and other costs. if we are unable to successfully complete our reorganizational efforts we may need to undertake additional restructuring efforts, and our business and operating results may be harmed.

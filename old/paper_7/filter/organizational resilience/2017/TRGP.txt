overview targa resources corp. (nyse: trgp) is a publicly traded delaware corporation formed in october 2005. targa is a leading provider of midstream services and is one of the largest independent midstream energy companies in north america. we own, operate, acquire and develop a diversified portfolio of complementary midstream energy assets.
we are engaged in the business of:
•   gathering, compressing, treating, processing and selling natural gas;
•   storing, fractionating, treating, transporting and selling ngls and ngl products, including services to lpg exporters;
factors that significantly affect our results our results of operations are impacted by a number of factors, including changes in commodity prices, the volumes that move through our gathering, processing and logistics assets, contract terms, the impact of hedging activities and the cost to operate and support assets.commodity prices the following table presents selected average annual and quarterly industry index prices for natural gas, selected ngl products and crude oil for the periods presented:
(1)   natural gas prices are based on average first of month prices from henry hub inside ferc commercial index prices.
(3)   crude oil prices are based on average quarterly prices of west texas intermediate crude oil as measured on the nymex.
volumes in our gathering and processing operations, plant inlet volumes, crude oil volumes and capacity utilization rates generally are driven by wellhead production and our competitive and contractual position on a regional basis and more broadly by the impact of prices for crude oil, natural gas and ngls on exploration and production activity in the areas of our operations. the factors that impact the gathering and processing volumes also impact the total volumes that flow to our downstream business. in addition, fractionation volumes are also affected by the location of the resulting mixed ngls, available pipeline capacity to transport ngls to our fractionators and our competitive and contractual position relative to other fractionators.
contract terms, contract mix and the impact of commodity prices with the potential for volatility of commodity prices, the contract mix of our gathering and processing segment, other than fee-based contracts in certain gathering and processing business units and gathering and processing services, can have a significant impact on our profitability, especially those contracts that create direct exposure to changes in energy prices by paying us for gathering and processing services with a portion of proceeds from the commodities handled ("equity volumes").
contract terms in the gathering and processing segment are based upon a variety of factors, including natural gas and crude quality, geographic location, competitive dynamics and the pricing environment at the time the contract is executed, and customer requirements. our gathering and processing contract mix and, accordingly, our exposure to crude, natural gas and ngl prices may change as a result of producer preferences, competition and changes in production as wells decline at different rates or are added, our expansion into regions where different types of contracts are more common and other market factors.
the contract terms and contract mix of our downstream business can also have a significant impact on our results of operations. the current demand for fractionation services has grown, resulting in increases in fractionation fees, reservation fees and contract term. export services are supported by fee-based contracts whose rates and terms are driven by global lpg demand fundamentals. the logistics and marketing segment includes primarily fee-based contracts.
impact of our commodity price hedging activities we have hedged the commodity price risk associated with a portion of our expected natural gas, ngl and condensate equity volumes and future commodity purchases and sales through 2020 by entering into financially settled derivative transactions. these transactions include swaps, futures, and purchased puts (or floors) and calls (or caps) to hedge additional expected equity commodity volumes without creating volumetric risk. we intend to continue managing our exposure to commodity prices in the future by entering into derivative transactions. we actively manage the downstream business product inventory and other working capital levels to reduce exposure to changing prices. for additional information regarding our hedging activities, see "item 7a. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk- commodity price risk."
operating expenses variable costs such as fuel, utilities, power, service and repairs can impact our results as volumes fluctuate through our systems. the fuel and power costs are pass-through elements in many of our logistics contracts, which mitigates their impact on our results. continued expansion of existing assets will also give rise to additional operating expenses, which will affect our results. the employees supporting our operations are employees of targa resources llc, a delaware limited liability company, and an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of ours.
general and administrative expenses we perform centralized corporate functions such as legal, accounting, treasury, insurance, risk management, health, safety, environmental, information technology, human resources, credit, payroll, internal audit, taxes, engineering and marketing. other than our direct costs of being a separate public reporting company, these costs are reimbursed by the partnership. see "item 13. certain relationships and related transactions, and director independence."
general trends and outlook we expect the midstream energy business environment to continue to be affected by the following key trends: demand for our products and services, commodity prices, volatile capital markets and increased regulation. these expectations are based on assumptions made by us and information currently available to us. to the extent our underlying assumptions about or interpretations of available information prove to be incorrect, our actual results may vary materially from our expected results.
demand for our services fluctuations in energy prices can greatly affect production rates and investments by third parties in the development and production of new oil and natural gas reserves. our operations are affected by the level of crude, natural gas and ngl prices, the relationship among these prices and related activity levels from our customers. drilling and production activity generally decreases as crude oil and natural gas prices decrease below commercially acceptable levels. producers generally focus their drilling activity on certain basins depending on commodity price fundamentals. as a result, our asset systems are predominately located in some of the most economic basins in the united states. accordingly, increased producer activity will drive demand for our midstream services and may result in incremental infrastructure growth capital expenditures. demand in our downstream business for fractionation and other fee-based services is largely correlated with producer activity levels. demand for our international export, storage and terminaling services has remained relatively constant during recent commodity price volatility, as demand for these services is based on a number of domestic and international factors.
commodity prices there has been and we believe there will continue to be volatility in commodity prices and in the relationships among ngl, crude oil and natural gas prices. in addition, the volatility and uncertainty of natural gas, crude oil and ngl prices impact drilling, completion and other investment decisions by producers and ultimately supply to our systems. notably, beginning in the third quarter of 2014, crude oil, natural gas and ngl prices declined significantly primarily due to global supply and demand imbalances. crude oil, natural gas and ngl prices continued to decline in 2015 and remained depressed in 2016 before starting to recover in 2017. see "item 1a. risk factors - our cash flow is affected by supply and demand for natural gas and ngl products and by natural gas, ngl, crude oil and condensate prices, and decreases in these prices could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition."
our operating income generally improves in an environment of higher natural gas, ngl and condensate prices, and where the spread between ngl prices and natural gas prices widens primarily as a result of our percent-of-proceeds contracts. our processing profitability is largely dependent upon pricing and the supply of and market demand for natural gas, ngls and condensate. pricing and supply are beyond our control and have been volatile. in a declining commodity price environment, without taking into account our hedges, we will realize a reduction in cash flows under our percent-of-proceeds contracts proportionate to average price declines. due to the recent volatility in commodity prices, we are uncertain of what pricing and market demand for oil, condensate, ngls and natural gas will be throughout 2018, and, as a result, demand for the services that we provide may decrease. across our operations and particularly in our downstream business, we benefit from long-term fee-based arrangements for our services, regardless of the actual volumes processed or delivered. the significant level of margin we derive from fee-based arrangements combined with our hedging arrangements helps to mitigate our exposure to commodity price movements. for additional information regarding our hedging activities, see "item 7a. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk-commodity price risk."
volatile capital markets we continuously consider and enter into discussions regarding potential acquisitions and growth projects, and identify appropriate private and public capital sources for funding potential acquisitions and growth projects. any limitations on our access to capital may impair our ability to execute this strategy. if the cost of such capital becomes too expensive, our ability to develop or acquire strategic and accretive assets may be limited. we may not be able to raise the necessary funds on satisfactory terms, if at all. the primary factors influencing our cost of borrowing include interest rates, credit spreads, covenants, underwriting or loan origination fees and similar charges we pay to lenders. these factors may impair our ability to execute our acquisition and growth strategy.
in addition, we are experiencing increased competition for the types of assets we contemplate purchasing or developing. current economic conditions and competition for asset purchases and development opportunities could limit our ability to fully execute our growth strategy.
increased regulation additional regulation in various areas has the potential to materially impact our operations and financial condition. for example, increased regulation of hydraulic fracturing used by producers and increased ghg emission regulations may cause reductions in supplies of natural gas, ngls, and crude oil from producers. please read "increased regulation of hydraulic fracturing could result in reductions or delays in drilling and completing new oil and natural gas wells, which could adversely impact our revenues by decreasing the volumes of natural gas, ngls or crude oil through our facilities and reducing the utilization of our assets" and "the adoption and implementation of climate change legislation or regulations restricting emissions of ghgs could result in increased operating costs and reduced demand for the products and services we provide" under item 1a of this annual report. similarly, the forthcoming rules and regulations of the cftc may limit our ability or increase the cost to use derivatives, which could create more volatility and less predictability in our results of operations.
how we evaluate our operations the profitability of our business segments is a function of the difference between: (i) the revenues we receive from our operations, including fee-based revenues from services and revenues from the natural gas, ngls, crude oil and condensate we sell, and (ii) the costs associated with conducting our operations, including the costs of wellhead natural gas, crude oil and mixed ngls that we purchase as well as operating, general and administrative costs and the impact of our commodity hedging activities. because commodity price movements tend to impact both revenues and costs, increases or decreases in our revenues alone are not necessarily indicative of increases or decreases in our profitability. our contract portfolio, the prevailing pricing environment for crude oil, natural gas and ngls, and the volumes of crude oil, natural gas and ngl throughput on our systems are important factors in determining our profitability. our profitability is also affected by the ngl content in gathered wellhead natural gas, supply and demand for our products and services, utilization of our assets and changes in our customer mix.
our profitability is also impacted by fee-based contracts. our growing fee-related capital expenditures for pipelines, expansion of our downstream facilities, as well as third-party acquisitions of businesses and assets, will continue to increase the number of our contracts that are fee-based. fixed fees for services such as fractionation, storage, terminaling and crude oil gathering are not directly tied to changes in market prices for commodities. nevertheless, a change in unit fees due to market dynamics does affect profitability.
management uses a variety of financial measures and operational measurements to analyze our performance. these include: (1) throughput volumes, facility efficiencies and fuel consumption, (2) operating expenses, (3) capital expenditures and (4) the following non-gaap measures: gross margin, operating margin, adjusted ebitda and distributable cash flow.
throughput volumes, facility efficiencies and fuel consumption our profitability is impacted by our ability to add new sources of natural gas supply and crude oil supply to offset the natural decline of existing volumes from oil and natural gas wells that are connected to our gathering and processing systems. this is achieved by connecting new wells and adding new volumes in existing areas of production, as well as by capturing crude oil and natural gas supplies currently gathered by third-parties. similarly, our profitability is impacted by our ability to add new sources of mixed ngl supply, typically connected by third-party transportation, to our downstream business fractionation facilities. we fractionate ngls generated by our gathering and processing plants, as well as by contracting for mixed ngl supply from third-party facilities.
in addition, we seek to increase operating margin by limiting volume losses, reducing fuel consumption and by increasing efficiency. with our gathering systems' extensive use of remote monitoring capabilities, we monitor the volumes received at the wellhead or central delivery points along our gathering systems, the volume of natural gas received at our processing plant inlets and the volumes of ngls and residue natural gas recovered by our processing plants. we also monitor the volumes of ngls received, stored, fractionated and delivered across our logistics assets. this information is tracked through our processing plants and downstream business facilities to determine customer settlements for sales and volume related fees for service and helps us increase efficiency and reduce fuel consumption.
as part of monitoring the efficiency of our operations, we measure the difference between the volume of natural gas received at the wellhead or central delivery points on our gathering systems and the volume received at the inlet of our processing plants as an indicator of fuel consumption and line loss. we also track the difference between the volume of natural gas received at the inlet of the processing plant and the ngls and residue gas produced at the outlet of such plant to monitor the fuel consumption and recoveries of our facilities. similar tracking is performed for our crude oil gathering and logistics assets. these volume, recovery and fuel consumption measurements are an important part of our operational efficiency analysis and safety programs.
operating expenses operating expenses are costs associated with the operation of specific assets. labor, contract services, repair and maintenance, utilities and ad valorem taxes comprise the most significant portion of our operating expenses. these expenses, other than fuel and power, remain relatively stable and independent of the volumes through our systems, but fluctuate depending on the scope of the activities performed during a specific period.
capital expenditures capital projects associated with growth and maintenance projects are closely monitored. return on investment is analyzed before a capital project is approved, spending is closely monitored throughout the development of the project, and the subsequent operational performance is compared to the assumptions used in the economic analysis performed for the capital investment approval.
gross margin we define gross margin as revenues less product purchases. it is impacted by volumes and commodity prices as well as by our contract mix and commodity hedging program.
gathering and processing segment gross margin consists primarily of revenues from the sale of natural gas, condensate, crude oil and ngls and fees related to natural gas and crude oil gathering and services, less producer payments and other natural gas and crude oil purchases.
logistics and marketing segment gross margin consists primarily of :
•   service fees (including the pass-through of energy costs included in fee rates),
•   system product gains and losses, and
•   ngl and natural gas sales less ngl and natural gas purchases, transportation costs and the net inventory change.
the gross margin impacts of our equity volumes hedge settlements are reported in other.
operating margin we define operating margin as gross margin less operating expenses. operating margin is an important performance measure of the core profitability of our operations.
management reviews business segment gross margin and operating margin monthly as a core internal management process. we believe that investors benefit from having access to the same financial measures that management uses in evaluating our operating results. gross margin and operating margin provide useful information to investors because they are used as supplemental financial measures by management and by external users of our financial statements, including investors and commercial banks, to assess:
•   the financial performance of our assets without regard to financing methods, capital structure or historical cost basis;
•   our operating performance and return on capital as compared to other companies in the midstream energy sector, without regard to financing or capital structure; and
•   the viability of acquisitions and capital expenditure projects and the overall rates of return on alternative investment opportunities.
gross margin and operating margin are non-gaap measures. the gaap measure most directly comparable to gross margin and operating margin is net income. gross margin and operating margin are not alternatives to gaap net income and have important limitations as analytical tools. investors should not consider gross margin and operating margin in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under gaap. because gross margin and operating margin exclude some, but not all, items that affect net income and are defined differently by different companies in our industry, our definitions of gross margin and operating margin may not be comparable with similarly titled measures of other companies, thereby diminishing their utility. management compensates for the limitations of gross margin and operating margin as analytical tools by reviewing the comparable gaap measures, understanding the differences between the measures and incorporating these insights into its decision-making processes.
adjusted ebitda we define adjusted ebitda as net income (loss) available to trc before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, and other items that we believe should be adjusted consistent with our core operating performance. the adjusting items are detailed in the adjusted ebitda reconciliation table and its footnotes. adjusted ebitda is used as a supplemental financial measure by us and by external users of our financial statements such as investors, commercial banks and others. the economic substance behind our use of adjusted ebitda is to measure the ability of our assets to generate cash sufficient to pay interest costs, support our indebtedness and pay dividends to our investors.
adjusted ebitda is a non-gaap financial measure. the gaap measure most directly comparable to adjusted ebitda is net income (loss) attributable to trc. adjusted ebitda should not be considered as an alternative to gaap net income. adjusted ebitda has important limitations as an analytical tool. investors should not consider adjusted ebitda in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under gaap. because adjusted ebitda excludes some, but not all, items that affect net income and is defined differently by different companies in our industry, our definition of adjusted ebitda may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies, thereby diminishing its utility.
management compensates for the limitations of adjusted ebitda as an analytical tool by reviewing the comparable gaap measures, understanding the differences between the measures and incorporating these insights into its decision-making processes.
distributable cash flow we define distributable cash flow as adjusted ebitda less distributions to trp preferred limited partners, the splitter agreement adjustment, cash interest expense on debt obligations, cash tax (expense) benefit and maintenance capital expenditures (net of any reimbursements of project costs). this measure includes the impact of noncontrolling interests on the prior adjustment items.
distributable cash flow is a significant performance metric used by us and by external users of our financial statements, such as investors, commercial banks and research analysts, to compare basic cash flows generated by us (prior to the establishment of any retained cash reserves by our board of directors) to the cash dividends we expect to pay our shareholders. using this metric, management and external users of our financial statements can quickly compute the coverage ratio of estimated cash flows to cash dividends. distributable cash flow is also an important financial measure for our shareholders since it serves as an indicator of our success in providing a cash return on investment. specifically, this financial measure indicates to investors whether or not we are generating cash flow at a level that can sustain or support an increase in our quarterly dividend rates.
distributable cash flow is a non-gaap financial measure. the gaap measure most directly comparable to distributable cash flow is net income (loss) attributable to trc. distributable cash flow should not be considered as an alternative to gaap net income (loss) available to common and preferred shareholders. it has important limitations as an analytical tool. investors should not consider distributable cash flow in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under gaap. because distributable cash flow excludes some, but not all, items that affect net income and is defined differently by different companies in our industry, our definition of distributable cash flow may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies, thereby diminishing its utility.
management compensates for the limitations of distributable cash flow as an analytical tool by reviewing the comparable gaap measure, understanding the differences between the measures and incorporating these insights into our decision-making processes.
our non-gaap financial measures the following tables reconcile the non-gaap financial measures used by management to the most directly comparable gaap measures for the periods indicated, with 2015 amounts presented for comparative purposes.

(2)   includes the acquisition date fair value of the potential earn-out payments of $416.3 million that would occur in 2018 and 2019.
(3)   these volume statistics are presented with the numerator as the total volume sold during the year and the denominator as the number of calendar days during the year.
(4)   includes operations from the permian acquisition for the period effective march 1, 2017. for the volume statistics presented, the numerator is the total volume sold during the period of our ownership while the denominator is the number of calendar days during the year.
(5)   plant natural gas inlet represents the volume of natural gas passing through the meter located at the inlet of a natural gas processing plant, other than in badlands, where it represents total wellhead gathered volume.
(7)   export volumes represent the quantity of ngl products delivered to third-party customers at our galena park marine terminal that are destined for international markets.
(8)   includes the impact of intersegment eliminations.
nm   due to a low denominator, the noted percentage change is disproportionately high and as a result, considered not meaningful.
the increase in commodity sales was primarily due to higher commodity prices ($2,124.2 million) and increased petroleum products, natural gas and condensate sales volumes ($100.1 million), partially offset by decreased ngl sales volumes ($13.8 million) and the impact of hedge settlements ($86.2 million). fee-based and other revenues were flat as a result of lower export fees offset by increases in gas processing and crude gathering fees, which included the impact of our march 2017 permian acquisition.
the increase in product purchases was primarily due to the impact of higher commodity prices and increased volumes.
in the third quarter of 2017, we experienced limited impacts to our operations from hurricane harvey and our operating margin for the full year 2017 was not significantly impacted. no property insurance or business interruption insurance claims were made as a result of the storm.
the higher operating margin and gross margin in 2017 reflect increased segment results for gathering and processing, partially offset by decreased logistics and marketing segment results. see "-results of operations-by reportable segment" for additional information regarding changes in operating margin and gross margin on a segment basis.
depreciation and amortization expense increased primarily due to the impact of the march 2017 permian acquisition and the impact of other growth investments, including cbf train 5 that went into service in the second quarter of 2016 and the raptor plant at southtx that went into service in the second quarter of 2017. these factors were partially offset by lower planned amortization of the badlands intangible assets.
general and administrative expense increased primarily due to higher compensation and benefits, partially offset by lower professional services and insurance premiums.
the impairment of property, plant and equipment in 2017 reflects a third quarter impairment of gas processing facilities and gathering systems associated with our north texas operations in the gathering and processing segment. the impairment was the result of our assessment that forecasted undiscounted future net cash flows from operations, while positive, would not be sufficient to recover the total net book value of the underlying assets.
in conjunction with our required annual goodwill assessments, we recognized impairments of goodwill totaling $207.0 million during 2016 related to goodwill acquired in the mergers with atlas energy l.p. and atlas pipeline partners l.p. in 2015 (collectively the "atlas mergers"). there was no impairment of goodwill in 2017 as the fair values of affected reporting units exceeded their accounting carrying values.
other operating expense in 2017 was primarily due to the reduction in the carrying value of our ownership interest in the venice gathering system in connection with the april 2017 sale. other operating expense in 2016 was primarily due to the loss on decommissioning two storage wells at our hattiesburg facility and an acid gas injection well at our versado facility.
net interest expense in 2017 decreased as compared with 2016 primarily due to lower average outstanding borrowings and higher capitalized interest during 2017, partially offset by higher non-cash interest expense related to the increase in the estimated redemption value of mandatorily redeemable preferred interests.
higher equity losses in 2017 reflect a $12.0 million loss provision due to the impairment of our investment in the t2 ef cogen joint venture, partially offset by increased equity earnings at gulf coast fractionators lp.
during 2017, we recorded a loss from financing activities of $16.8 million on the redemption of the outstanding 63⁄8% senior notes and the repayment of the outstanding balance on our senior secured term loan, whereas in 2016 we recorded a $48.2 million loss from financing activities that included the tender, open market repurchase and redemption of various series of partnership senior notes.
during 2017, we recorded other income for changes in contingent considerations of $99.6 million resulting primarily from a reduction in the estimated fair value of the permian acquisition contingent consideration, which is based on a multiple of gross margin realized during the first two annual periods after the acquisition date. the estimated fair value of the contingent consideration may decrease or increase until the settlement dates, resulting in the recognition of additional other income (expense).
the increase in income tax benefit was primarily due to the tax cuts and jobs act of 2017 (the "tax act") and the resulting reduction of the federal corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%, which under gaap results in a recalculation of our ending balance sheet deferred tax balances. the resulting $269.5 million reduction of our net deferred tax liability is included in current period earnings.  further, in 2017, which is subject to pre-tax act rates, a higher pre-tax loss resulted in higher income tax benefits.
net income attributable to noncontrolling interests was higher in 2017 primarily due to the february 2016 trc/trp merger, which eliminated the noncontrolling interest associated with the third-party trp common unit holders for a portion of the first quarter of 2016, and our october 2016 acquisition of the 37% interest of versado that we did not already own. further, earnings at our joint ventures increased as compared with 2016.
preferred dividends represent both cash dividends related to the march 2016 series a preferred stock offering and non-cash deemed dividends for the accretion of the preferred discount related to a beneficial conversion feature. preferred dividends increased as the series a preferred stock was outstanding for a full year in 2017.
the increase in commodity sales was primarily due to the favorable impact of the inclusion of two additional months of tpl's operations during 2016 ($270.1 million), partially offset by lower commodity prices ($53.7 million) and the impact of hedge settlements ($42.5 million). additionally, fee-based and other revenues decreased primarily due to lower fractionation and export fees, partially offset by the impact of an additional two months of tpl's fee revenue in 2016 ($40.9 million).
the increase in product purchases was primarily due to the inclusion of two additional months of operations from tpl in 2016 ($137.5 million), partially offset by the impact of the lower commodity prices.
the lower operating margin and gross margin in 2016 reflect decreased segment results for logistics and marketing, partially offset by increased gathering and processing segment results. operating expenses increased slightly compared to 2015 due to the inclusion of tpl's operations for an additional two months in 2016, offset by a continued focused cost reduction effort throughout our operating areas. see "-results of operations-by reportable segment" for additional information regarding changes in operating margin and gross margin on a segment basis.
the increase in depreciation and amortization expense reflects an additional two months of tpl operations in 2016, growth investments from other system expansions including cbf train 5, the buffalo plant, compressor stations and pipelines, and higher planned amortization of the badlands intangible assets.
general and administrative expense, which includes tpl operations for an additional two months in 2016, increased primarily due to higher compensation and benefits, partially offset by lower insurance premiums.
we recognized impairments of goodwill totaling $207.0 million during 2016, as compared with the $290.0 million provisional impairment of goodwill recorded during the fourth quarter of 2015. goodwill impairment recorded in 2016 includes $24.0 million recorded in the first quarter to finalize the 2015 provisional charge, as well as an additional $183.0 million associated with our annual impairment evaluation in the fourth quarter of 2016. these impairment charges relate to goodwill acquired in the atlas mergers in 2015.
there was no impairment of property, plant and equipment in 2016, whereas in 2015 we recorded a loss of $32.6 million to reflect the impairment of certain gas processing facilities and associated gathering systems due to market conditions and processing spreads in louisiana.
other operating (income) expense in 2016 includes the loss on decommissioning two storage wells at our hattiesburg facility and an acid gas injection well at our versado facility, whereas in 2015 we reported a net gain on sales of assets.
net interest expense increased primarily due to lower non-cash interest income related to the mandatorily redeemable preferred interests liability that is revalued quarterly at the estimated redemption value as of the reporting date. the estimated redemption value of the mandatorily redeemable preferred interests decreased in 2016 by a lesser amount than in 2015. other factors included lower capitalized interest due to decreased capital expenditures in 2016, partially offset by the impact of lower average outstanding borrowings during 2016.
the decrease in equity earnings (loss) was due to lower operating results from gcf and the inclusion of an additional two months of equity losses from the t2 joint ventures in 2016.
during 2016, we recorded a $48.2 million loss from financing activities that included the tender of $1,138.3 million of partnership senior notes, the repurchase of $559.2 million of partnership senior notes in open market purchases, and the redemption of $146.2 million of partnership senior notes. in 2015, we incurred a net loss from financing activities of $10.1 million from the partial repayments of the trc senior secured term loan and the repurchase of partnership senior notes.
the change in income tax (expense) benefit was primarily due to the decrease in income (loss) before income taxes and the impact of the trc/trp merger, which eliminated the noncontrolling interest associated with the third-party trp common unit holders for most of 2016. income attributable to noncontrolling interests is not subject to income taxes in our financial statements. therefore, during most of 2016, we recorded income taxes on the majority of the pre-tax loss generated by trp due to absence of the large noncontrolling interest in trp.
despite similar amounts of net losses in 2016 and 2015, net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests was significantly lower for 2016 due to the february 2016 trc/trp merger, which eliminated the noncontrolling interest associated with the third-party trp common unit holders for most of 2016. the impact of the trp non-controlling common interest buy-in was most pronounced during the fourth quarter of both years that included significant losses as a result of our annual goodwill impairment evaluations. the noncontrolling interest bore approximately 89% of the fourth quarter impairment loss in 2015 and 0% in 2016. this reduction was partially offset by the impact of a full year of distributions in 2016 for the trp's preferred units issued in october 2015.
preferred dividends in 2016 represent both cash dividends related to the march 2016 series a preferred stock offering and non-cash deemed dividends for the accretion of the preferred discount related to a beneficial conversion feature.

(6)   average realized prices exclude the impact of hedging activities presented in other.
the increase in gross margin was primarily due to higher commodity prices and higher permian volumes including those associated with the permian acquisition. the overall increase in gathering and processing inlet volumes included all areas in the permian region, at southtx and southok, partially offset by decreases at westok, north texas and coastal. the coastal gathering and processing assets generate significantly lower unit margins than the field gathering and processing assets. ngl production, ngl sales and natural gas sales increased primarily due to higher field gathering and processing inlet volumes and increased plant recoveries including additional ethane recovery. total crude oil gathered volumes increased in the permian region due to the permian acquisition. in the badlands, total crude oil gathered volumes and natural gas volumes increased primarily due to higher production from new wells and system expansions.
the increase in operating expenses was primarily driven by the inclusion of the permian acquisition, plant and system expansions in the permian region and the june 2017 commencement in operations of the raptor plant at southtx.
the increase in gross margin was primarily due to the inclusion of the tpl volumes for all of 2016 and an increase in ngl prices partially offset by lower natural gas and condensate prices and lower inlet volumes in westok and on certain of our other systems. the plant inlet volume increase in saou was more than offset by reduced producer activity and volumes at sand hills (which also had operational issues), versado and north texas. badlands natural gas volumes increased due to system expansions while crude oil volumes were essentially flat. coastal plant inlet volumes decreased due to current market conditions and the decline of off-system volumes partially offset by additional higher gpm volumes.
excluding the impact of including operating expenses for tpl for an additional two months in 2016 and system expansions, operating expenses for most areas were lower due to a continued focused cost reduction effort.

operating statistics mbbl/d (1):
(1)   segment operating statistics include intersegment amounts, which have been eliminated from the consolidated presentation. for all volume statistics presented, the numerator is the total volume sold during the year and the denominator is the number of calendar days during the year.
(2)   fractionation and treating contracts include pricing terms composed of base fees and fuel and power components which vary with the cost of energy. as such, the logistics and marketing segment results include effects of variable energy costs that impact both gross margin and operating expenses.
(3)   fractionation volumes reflect those volumes delivered and settled under fractionation contracts.
(4)   export volumes represent the quantity of ngl products delivered to third-party customers at our galena park marine terminal that are destined for international markets.
logistics and marketing gross margin decreased due to lower lpg export margin and lower domestic marketing margin, partially offset by higher fractionation margin, higher terminaling and storage throughput and higher marketing gains. lpg export margin decreased due to lower fees partially offset by higher volumes. domestic marketing margin decreased due to lower terminal margins.  fractionation margin increased due to higher supply volume and higher system product gains. fractionation margin was partially impacted by the variable effects of fuel and power costs that are largely reflected in operating expenses (see footnote (2) above).
operating expenses increased due to higher fuel and power costs that are largely passed through, higher compensation and benefits related to the operations of cbf train 5, 2017 repairs and maintenance activities that were not required in 2016 and higher taxes.
logistics and marketing gross margin decreased primarily due to lower lpg export margin and the realization in 2015 of contract renegotiation fees related to our crude oil and condensate splitter project. gross margin also decreased due to lower fractionation margin and lower terminaling and storage throughput, partially offset by higher ngl marketing gains. lpg export margin decreased due to lower fees. fractionation margin decreased primarily due to lower supply volume and lower system product gains, partially offset by higher fees. fractionation margin was partially impacted by the variable effects of fuel and power costs that are largely reflected in operating expenses (see footnote (2) above).
operating expenses were relatively flat. higher compensation and benefits and higher ad valorem taxes associated with the start-up of cbf train 5 were largely offset by lower fuel and power costs, and lower maintenance expense resulting from continued focused cost reductions.
operating margin       $(9.6     )           $62.9               $84.2         $(72.5            )      $(21.3            )
other contains the results (including any hedge ineffectiveness) of commodity derivative activities related to gathering and processing hedges of equity volumes that are included in operating margin and mark-to-market gain/losses related to derivative contracts that were not designated as cash flow hedges. the primary purpose of our commodity risk management activities is to mitigate a portion of the impact of commodity prices on our operating cash flow. we have entered into derivative instruments to hedge the commodity price associated with a portion of our expected natural gas, ngl and condensate equity volumes in our gathering and processing operations that result from percent of proceeds/liquids processing arrangements. because we are essentially forward-selling a portion of our future plant equity volumes, these hedge positions will move favorably in periods of falling commodity prices and unfavorably in periods of rising commodity prices.
the following table provides a breakdown of the change in other operating margin:
ineffectiveness (3)                                                            (0.2   )                                                     (0.9   )                                                      0.9
(1)   the price spread is the differential between the contracted derivative instrument pricing and the price of the corresponding settled commodity transaction.
(2)   mark-to-market income (loss) associated with derivative contracts that are not designated as hedges for accounting purposes.
(3)   ineffectiveness primarily relates to certain crude hedging contracts and certain acquired hedges of tpl that do not qualify for hedge accounting.
as part of the atlas mergers, outstanding tpl derivative contracts with a fair value of $102.1 million as of the acquisition date were novated to us and included in the acquisition date fair value of assets acquired. we received derivative settlements of $7.6 million, $26.6 million, and $67.9 million for the years ended december 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, related to these novated contracts. the final settlement was received in december 2017. these settlements were reflected as a reduction of the acquisition date fair value of the tpl derivative assets acquired and had no effect on results of operations.
our liquidity and capital resources as of december 31, 2017, we had $137.2 million of "cash and cash equivalents," on our consolidated balance sheet. we believe our cash position, remaining borrowing capacity on our credit facilities (discussed below in "short-term liquidity"), and our cash flows from operating activities are adequate to allow us to manage our day-to-day cash requirements and anticipated obligations as discussed further below.
after completion of the trc/trp merger, our liquidity and capital resources have been managed on a consolidated basis. we have the ability to access the partnership's liquidity, subject to the limitations set forth in the partnership agreement and any restrictions contained in the covenants of the partnership's debt agreements, as well as the ability to contribute capital to the partnership, subject to any restrictions contained in the covenants of our debt agreements.
on a consolidated basis, our ability to finance our operations, including funding capital expenditures and acquisitions, meeting our indebtedness obligations, refinancing our indebtedness and meeting our collateral requirements, and to pay dividends declared by our board of directors will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future. our ability to generate cash is subject to a number of factors, some of which are beyond our control. these include commodity prices, weather and ongoing efforts to manage operating costs and maintenance capital expenditures, as well as general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors.
historically, dividends have been funded primarily by the cash distributions we received from the partnership. in connection with the trc/trp merger, trc acquired all of the outstanding trp common units that trc and its subsidiaries did not already own. as a result, we are entitled to the entirety of distributions made by the partnership on its equity interests, other than those made to the trp preferred unitholders. the actual amount we declare as dividends continues to depend on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations, cash flow, the level of our capital expenditures, future business prospects, compliance with our debt covenants and any other matters that our board of directors deems relevant.
the partnership's debt agreements and obligations to its preferred unitholders may restrict or prohibit the payment of distributions if the partnership is in default, threat of default, or arrears. in addition, so long as any shares of our preferred shares are outstanding, certain common stock distribution limitations exist. if the partnership cannot make distributions to us, we may be limited in our ability, or unable, to pay dividends on our common stock.
on a consolidated basis, our main sources of liquidity and capital resources are internally generated cash flows from operations, borrowings under the trc revolver, the trp revolver, and the securitization facility, and access to debt and equity capital markets. we may supplement these sources of liquidity with proceeds from potential asset sales and/or joint ventures.  for companies involved in hydrocarbon production, transportation and other oil and gas related services, the capital markets have experienced and may continue to experience volatility. our exposure to adverse credit conditions includes our credit facilities, cash investments, hedging abilities, customer performance risks and counterparty performance risks.
short-term liquidity our short-term liquidity on a consolidated basis as of february 9, 2018, was:
total availability under the trc revolver                                                      670.0                        -                      670.0
total availability under the trp revolver                                                          -                  1,600.0                    1,600.0

outstanding letters of credit under the trp revolver                                               -                    (28.9   )                  (28.9   )
other potential capital resources associated with our existing arrangements include:
•   our right to request an additional $200 million in commitment increases under the trc revolver, subject to the terms therein. the trc revolver matures on february 27, 2020.
•   our right to request an additional $500 million in commitment increases under the trp revolver, subject to the terms therein. the trp revolver matures on october 7, 2020.
a portion of our capital resources are allocated to letters of credit to satisfy certain counterparty credit requirements. these letters of credit reflect our non-investment grade status, as assigned to us by moody's and s&p. they also reflect certain counterparties' views of our financial condition and ability to satisfy our performance obligations, as well as commodity prices and other factors.
working capital working capital is the amount by which current assets exceed current liabilities. on a consolidated basis, at the end of any given month, accounts receivable and payable tied to commodity sales and purchases are relatively balanced, with receivables from ngl customers being offset by plant settlements payable to producers. the factors that typically cause overall variability in our reported total working capital are: (1) our cash position; (2) liquids inventory levels and valuation, which we closely manage; (3) changes in the fair value of the current portion of derivative contracts; (4) monthly swings in borrowings under the securitization facility; and (5) major structural changes in our asset base or business operations, such as acquisitions or divestitures and certain organic growth projects.
our working capital, exclusive of current debt obligations, decreased $110.9 million. the major item contributing to this decrease was an increase in capital accruals related to permian growth projects. the remaining working capital decrease reflects the collection of an income tax refund, partially offset by higher inventories due to price and volume increases, a higher cash balance and an increase in broker margin deposits associated with futures contracts utilized in our derivatives program. the increase of $75.0 million in current debt obligations was due to increased receivables available for the securitization facility.
based on our anticipated levels of operations and absent any disruptive events, we believe that our internally generated cash flow, borrowings available under the trc revolver, the trp revolver and the securitization facility and proceeds from debt and equity offerings should provide sufficient resources to finance our operations, capital expenditures, long-term debt obligations, collateral requirements and quarterly cash dividends for at least the next twelve months.
long-term financing our long-term financing consists of raising funds through the issuance of common stock, common warrants, preferred stock and long-term debt obligations. on january 26, 2017, we completed a public offering of 9,200,000 shares of our common stock (including the shares sold pursuant to the underwriters' overallotment option) at a price to the public of $57.65, providing net proceeds of $524.2 million. we used the net proceeds from this public offering to fund the cash portion of the permian acquisition purchase price due upon closing and for general corporate purposes. on june 1, 2017, we completed a public offering of 17,000,000 shares of our common stock at a price to the public of $46.10, providing net proceeds after underwriting discounts, commissions and other expenses of $777.3 million. we used the net proceeds from this public offering to fund a portion of the capital expenditures related to the construction of grand prix, repay outstanding borrowings under the company's credit facilities, redeem the partnership's 63⁄8% senior notes, and for general corporate purposes.
during 2017, under the december 2016 equity distribution agreement, we issued and sold through our sales agents 6,433,561 shares of common stock and received net proceeds of $343.1 million. as of february 9, 2018, we have $266.0 million remaining under our december 2016 equity distribution agreement and the full $750.0 million remaining under our may 2017 equity distribution agreement.
during 2016, 19,983,843 warrants were exercised and net settled for 11,336,856 shares of common stock. during 2017, no detachable warrants were exercised. as a result, series a warrants exercisable into a maximum of 67,392 shares of common stock and series b warrants exercisable into a maximum of 32,496 shares of common stock were outstanding as of december 31, 2017. in february 2018, the remaining 99,888 warrants were exercised and net settled by us for 58,814 shares of common stock.
from time to time, we issue long-term debt securities, which we refer to as senior notes. our senior notes issued to date, generally have similar terms other than interest rates, maturity dates and redemption premiums. as of december 31, 2017 and  december 31, 2016, the aggregate principal amount outstanding of our various long-term debt obligations (excluding current maturities) was $4,732.6 million and $4,641.8 million, respectively. in october 2017, the partnership issued $750.0 million aggregate principal amount of 5% senior notes due 2028, with net proceeds of $744.1 million after costs, and redeemed its outstanding 5% senior notes due 2018 at face value plus accrued interest through the redemption date.
we consolidate the debt of the partnership with that of our own; however, we do not have the contractual obligation to make interest or principal payments with respect to the debt of the partnership. our debt obligations do not restrict the ability of the partnership to make distributions to us. our credit agreement has restrictions and covenants that may limit our ability to pay dividends to our stockholders. see note 10 - debt obligations to our consolidated financial statements for more information regarding our debt obligations.
the majority of our consolidated long-term debt is fixed rate borrowings; however, we have some exposure to the risk of changes in interest rates, primarily as a result of the variable rate borrowings under the trc revolver and the trp revolver. we may enter into interest rate hedges with the intent to mitigate the impact of changes in interest rates on cash flows. as of december 31, 2017, we do not have any interest rate hedges.
to date, our and our subsidiaries' debt balances have not adversely affected our operations, ability to grow or ability to repay or refinance indebtedness. for additional information about our debt-related transactions, see note 10 - debt obligations to our consolidated financial statements. for information about our interest rate risk, see item 7a "quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk-interest rate risk."
on february 6, 2018, we announced the formation of the devco jvs with stonepeak. stonepeak committed a maximum of approximately $960 million of capital to the devco jvs, including an initial contribution of approximately $190 million that will be distributed to the partnership to reimburse it for a portion of capital spent to date. the proceeds from stonepeak's initial contribution will be used to reduce our current debt.
compliance with debt covenants as of december 31, 2017, both we and the partnership were in compliance with the covenants contained in our various debt agreements.
cash flow cash flows from operating activities
the primary drivers of cash flows from operating activities are (i) the collection of cash from customers from the sale of ngls, natural gas and other petroleum commodities, as well as fees for gas processing, crude gathering, export, fractionation, terminaling, storage and transportation, (ii) the payment of amounts related to the purchase of ngls and natural gas, and (iii) the payment of other expenses, primarily field operating costs, general and administrative expense and interest expense. in addition, we use derivative instruments to manage our exposure to commodity price risk. changes in the prices of the commodities we hedge impact our derivative settlements as well as our margin deposit requirements on unsettled futures contracts.
net cash provided by operating activities increased in 2017 compared to 2016, primarily driven by higher commodity prices and a lower average debt balance, offset by the impact of expanded operations in 2017. higher commodity prices resulted in higher net cash collections from the sale of commodities, partially offset by an increase in ngl product inventory, and higher margin calls and payments related to our derivative contracts. the lower average debt balance in 2017 resulting from the debt repayments in the fourth quarter of 2016 contributed to lower interest charges. in addition, we received net tax refunds mainly from net operating loss carry back. expanded operations in 2017 contributed to increases in payments for compensation and benefits, as well as utilities.
net cash provided by operating activities decreased in 2016 compared to 2015, primarily driven by lower commodity prices, the impact of expanded operations, and a higher average debt balance. lower commodity prices resulted in decreased cash collections from the sale of commodities. derivative settlements remained an overall source of revenue during 2016, but at a lower amount as commodity price spreads on those derivative contracts were lower in 2016 in comparison to 2015. expanded operations primarily from the atlas mergers contributed to increased compensation and benefits, as well as utilities. the higher average debt balance in 2016 that resulted from new debt instruments entered into in 2015 caused increases in interest charges.
cash used in investing activities increased in 2017 compared to 2016, primarily due to an $735.4 million increase in capital expenditures, reflecting the spending for major growth projects during 2017 and the acquisition of the flag city plant. in addition, outlays for business acquisitions increased by $570.8 million for the cash portion of the permian acquisition consideration.
cash used in investing activities decreased in 2016 compared to 2015, primarily due to the $1,574.4 million outlay for the cash portion of the atlas merger consideration in 2015. in addition, capital expenditures decreased $255.1 million during 2016 reflecting the completion of major growth projects and cost control initiatives.

in 2017, we realized a net source of cash from financing activities primarily due to equity offerings and a net increase of debt borrowing, partially offset by payments of dividends and distributions. we issued 9,200,000 shares of common stock in january 2017 and 17,000,000 shares of common stock in june 2017 through public offerings in addition to common stock offerings through our december 2016 equity distribution agreement. a portion of the proceeds from the equity issuances was used to repay outstanding borrowings under the trp revolver and to redeem trp's 63⁄8% senior notes. in october, we issued 5% senior notes due 2028 and used a portion of the proceeds to redeem our 5% senior notes due 2018. during 2017, we sold a 25% interest in the grand prix joint venture to blackstone, which contributed a total of $96.3 million to the joint venture in 2017. the contributions from blackstone are included in financing activities as contributions from noncontrolling interests.
we incurred a net use of cash from financing activities in 2016, primarily due to a net reduction of outstanding debt and payment of dividends and distributions, partially offset by proceeds from our series a preferred issuance and common stock issued under our may 2015 and december 2016 edas. with the proceeds from equity issuances we repurchased a portion of the partnership's senior notes through open market repurchases generally at a discount to par values and repaid a portion of our senior secured credit facilities.  with the proceeds from new senior note borrowings and additional borrowings under the trp revolver, we tendered for, and then redeemed, certain of the partnership's senior notes to refinance to longer maturities.
we realized a net source of cash from financing activities in 2015, primarily due to the cash borrowings and equity offerings associated with the atlas mergers, offset by dividends and distributions. net borrowings under the partnership's debt facilities increased, offset by payment to tender apl's senior notes; issuance of our term loan and borrowings under our senior secured credit facility and proceeds from common stock offerings, offset by partial repayments of our term loan and our senior secured credit facility.

preferred dividends our series a preferred has a liquidation value of $1,000 per share and bears a cumulative 9.5% fixed dividend payable quarterly 45 days after the end of each fiscal quarter. we had the option, but did not elect, to pay dividends in kind ("pik") for any quarter through december 31, 2017.
cash dividends of $91.7 million were paid to holders of the series a preferred during the year ended december 31, 2017. as of december 31, 2017, cash dividends accrued for our series a preferred were $22.9 million, which were paid on february 14, 2018.
capital requirements our capital requirements relate to capital expenditures, which are classified as growth capital expenditures, business acquisitions, and maintenance expenditures. growth capital expenditures improve the service capability of the existing assets, extend asset useful lives, increase capacities from existing levels, add capabilities, reduce costs or enhance revenues, and fund acquisitions of businesses or assets. maintenance capital expenditures are those expenditures that are necessary to maintain the service capability of our existing assets, including the replacement of system components and equipment, which are worn, obsolete or completing their useful life and expenditures to remain in compliance with environmental laws and regulations.

we currently estimate that we will invest at least $1,630 million in net growth capital expenditures (exclusive of outlays for business acquisitions) in 2018. given our objective of growth through expansions of existing assets, other internal growth projects, and acquisitions, we anticipate that over time that we will invest significant amounts of capital to grow and acquire assets. future growth capital expenditures may vary significantly based on investment opportunities. we expect that 2018 net maintenance capital expenditures will be approximately $120 million.
our growth capital expenditures increased for the year ended december 31, 2017 as compared to the year ended december 31, 2016, primarily due to spending related to additional processing plants and associated infrastructure in the permian basin, grand prix and the channelview splitter, as well as the acquisition of the flag city plant. the increase was partially offset by the impact of the substantial completion of the cbf train 5 project in the second quarter of 2016. our maintenance capital expenditures increased for 2017 as compared to 2016, primarily due to increases in overhauls driven by higher volumes on our systems and additional infrastructure upgrades of the existing capital assets.
our growth capital expenditures decreased in 2016 as compared to 2015, primarily due to reduced gathering and processing business unit spending activity and lower cbf train 5 construction costs in 2016. reductions were partially offset by spending on the carnero joint ventures and the channelview splitter. our maintenance capital expenditures decreased for 2016 as compared to 2015, primarily due to fewer well connects and lengthened maintenance cycle times resulting from decreases in producer activity, as well as a higher percentage of environmental expenditures incurred in 2015 versus 2016.
off-balance sheet arrangements as of december 31, 2017, there were $44.0 million in surety bonds outstanding related to various performance obligations. these are in place to support various performance obligations as required by (i) statutes within the regulatory jurisdictions where we operate and (ii) counterparty support. obligations under these surety bonds are not normally called, as we typically comply with the underlying performance requirement.
we have invested in entities that are not consolidated in our financial statements. for information on our obligations with respect to these investments, as well as our obligations with respect to related letters of credit, see note 8 - investments in unconsolidated affiliates and note 10 - debt obligations.

critical accounting policies and estimates the accounting policies and estimates discussed below are considered by management to be critical to an understanding of our financial statements because their application requires the most significant judgments from management in estimating matters for financial reporting that are inherently uncertain. see the description of our accounting policies in the notes to the financial statements for additional information about our critical accounting policies and estimates.
business acquisitions for business acquisitions, we generally recognize the identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree at their estimated fair values on the acquisition date. goodwill results when the cost of a business acquisition exceeds the fair value of the net identifiable assets of the acquired business. determining fair value requires management's judgment and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions with respect to projections of future production volumes, pricing and cash flows, benchmark analysis of comparable public companies, discount rates, expectations regarding customer contracts and relationships, and other management estimates. the judgments made in the determination of the estimated fair value assigned to the assets acquired, liabilities assumed and any noncontrolling interest in the investee, the duration of each liability, and any resulting goodwill can materially impact the financial statements in periods after acquisition. see note 4 - acquisitions and divestitures to our consolidated financial statements.
depreciation of property, plant and equipment and amortization of intangible assets in general, depreciation and amortization is the systematic and rational allocation of an asset's cost, less its residual value (if any), to the period it benefits. our property, plant and equipment are depreciated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets. our estimate of depreciation incorporates assumptions regarding the useful economic lives and residual values of our assets. amortization expense attributable to intangible assets is recorded in a manner that closely resembles the expected benefit pattern of the intangible assets, or where such pattern is not readily determinable, on a straight-line basis, over the periods in which we benefit from services provided to customers. at the time assets are placed in service or acquired, we believe such assumptions are reasonable; however, circumstances may develop that would cause us to change these assumptions, which would change our depreciation/amortization amounts prospectively. examples of such circumstances include:
•changes in energy prices;
•changes in competition;
•changes in laws and regulations that limit the estimated economic life of an asset;
•changes in technology that render an asset obsolete;
•changes in expected salvage values; and
•changes in the forecasted life of applicable resources basins.
impairment of long-lived assets, including intangible assets and goodwill we evaluate long-lived assets, including related intangibles, for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate, in management's judgment, that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable. asset recoverability is measured by comparing the carrying value of the asset or asset group with its expected future pre-tax undiscounted cash flows. these cash flow estimates require us to make projections and assumptions for many years into the future for pricing, demand, competition, operating cost and other factors. if the carrying amount exceeds the expected future undiscounted cash flows, we recognize an impairment equal to the excess of net book value over fair value as determined by quoted market prices in active markets or present value techniques if quotes are unavailable. the determination of the fair value using present value techniques requires us to make projections and assumptions regarding the probability of a range of outcomes and the rates of interest used in the present value calculations. any changes we make to these projections and assumptions could result in significant revisions to our evaluation of recoverability of our property, plant and equipment and the recognition of additional impairments.
as a result of such evaluations, we recorded non-cash pre-tax impairment charges of $378.0 million related to north texas assets during 2017 and $32.6 million related to certain coastal gathering and processing assets during 2015. for further details regarding our property, plant and equipment impairment charges, see note 6 - property, plant and equipment and intangible assets to our consolidated financial statements.
we evaluate goodwill for impairment at least annually, as of november 30, as well as whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate it is more likely than not the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. we early adopted asu 2017-04 for our annual goodwill impairment test as of november 30, 2017, which requires an impairment up to the amount of goodwill to the extent that the carrying value of the affected reporting unit exceeds its fair value. there was no impairment of goodwill during 2017. our 2016 and 2015 evaluations were performed under the previous guidance, which required a second step if the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeded its fair value. the second step involved determining the fair value of the assets and liabilities of the affected reporting unit to derive the implied fair value of goodwill. any excess carrying value over the implied fair value was recognized as a goodwill impairment loss. in 2016 and 2015, we recognized goodwill impairments of $207.0 million and $290.0 million. included in the 2016 impairment was $24.0 million that represented the finalization of the 2015 provisional impairment.
our goodwill assessments utilized the income approach (a discounted cash flow analysis ("dcf")) to estimate the fair values of our reporting units. future cash flows for our reporting units were based on our estimates, at that time, of future volumes and operating margin and other factors, such as timing of capital expenditures and terminal values. we took into account current and expected industry and market conditions, including commodity pricing, volumetric forecasts and observable exit multiples in the basins in which the reporting units operate. the discount rates used in our dcf analysis were based on a weighted average cost of capital determined from relevant market comparisons. changes in the forecasts and assumptions used in our dcf analysis could have a material effect on the results of our goodwill assessment.
for further details regarding our goodwill impairment, see note 7 - goodwill to our consolidated financial statements.
price risk management (hedging)
our net income and cash flows are subject to volatility stemming from changes in commodity prices and interest rates. in an effort to reduce the volatility of our cash flows, we have entered into derivative financial instruments to hedge the commodity price associated with a significant portion of our expected natural gas, ngl, and condensate equity volumes and future commodity purchases and sales.
one of the primary factors that can affect our operating results each period is the price assumptions used to value our derivative financial instruments, which are reflected at their fair values on the balance sheet. we determine the fair value of our derivative instruments using present value methods or standard option valuation models with assumptions about commodity prices based on those observed in underlying markets. changes in the methods or assumptions we use to calculate the fair value of our derivative instruments could have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements. for further details regarding our derivative instruments and fair value measurements, see note 16 - derivative instruments and hedging activities and note 17 - fair value measurements to our consolidated financial statements.

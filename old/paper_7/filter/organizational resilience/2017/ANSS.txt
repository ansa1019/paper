item 7.   management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the company's gaap results for the year ended december 31, 2017 reflect growth in revenue of 10.8% and operating income of 3.9% while diluted earnings per share was comparable to the year ended december 31, 2016. the company experienced higher revenue in 2017 across all classes of revenue, including license revenue, maintenance and services. the company also experienced increased operating expenses primarily due to increased personnel costs, costs associated with workforce realignment activities and higher stock-based compensation. the company's effective tax rate increased significantly in 2017 as a result of charges associated with the enactment of the u.s. tax cuts and jobs act.
the company's non-gaap results for the year ended december 31, 2017 reflect growth in revenue of 11.1%, operating income of 9.7% and diluted earnings per share of 10.5% as compared to the year ended december 31, 2016. the non-gaap results exclude the income statement effects of the acquisition accounting adjustment to deferred revenue, stock-based compensation, amortization of acquired intangible assets, restructuring charges, transaction costs related to business combinations and the impact of the tax cuts and jobs act. for further disclosure regarding non-gaap results, see the section titled "non-gaap results" immediately preceding the section titled "liquidity and capital resources."
the company incurred $11.7 million in restructuring charges, or $7.9 million net of tax, during the year ended december 31, 2017. the company completed the workforce realignment activities associated with these charges. these charges are excluded from the company's non-gaap results.
the company's comparative financial results were impacted by fluctuations in the u.s. dollar during the year ended december 31, 2017 as compared to the year ended december 31, 2016. the impacts on the company's revenue and operating income due to currency fluctuations are reflected in the table below.
the amounts in the table represent the difference between the actual 2017 results and the same results calculated at the 2016 exchange rates. amounts below indicate a net favorable impact from currency fluctuations.
operating income   $3,501                      $3,560
in constant currency(1), the company's growth rates were as follows:
operating income   2.9     %                 8.9   %
(1) constant currency amounts exclude the effect of foreign currency fluctuations on the reported results. to present this information, the results for 2017 for entities whose functional currency is a currency other than the u.s. dollar were converted to u.s. dollars at rates that were in effect for 2016, rather than the actual exchange rates in effect for 2017.
the company's financial position includes $881.8 million in cash and short-term investments, and working capital of $661.7 million as of december 31, 2017.
during the year ended december 31, 2017, the company repurchased 2.8 million shares for $336.0 million at an average price of $122.20 per share under the company's stock repurchase program.
business on august 29, 2016, the board of directors (the board) of the company appointed dr. ajei s. gopal, a member of the board, as president and chief operating officer of the company, effective as of such date. in addition, effective as of january 1, 2017, dr. gopal assumed the role of chief executive officer of the company and mr. james e. cashman iii, who was the chief executive officer of the company as of december 31, 2016, became chairman of the board. in connection therewith, ronald w. hovsepian, the chairman of the board as of december 31, 2016, became the board's lead independent director.
ansys, a delaware corporation formed in 1994, develops and globally markets engineering simulation software and services widely used by engineers, designers, researchers and students across a broad spectrum of industries and academia, including aerospace and defense, automotive, electronics, semiconductors, energy, materials and chemical processing, turbomachinery, consumer products, healthcare, and sports. headquartered south of pittsburgh, pennsylvania, the company and its subsidiaries employed approximately 2,900 people as of december 31, 2017. the company focuses on the development of open and flexible solutions that enable users to analyze designs directly on the desktop, providing a common platform for fast, efficient and cost-conscious product development, from design concept to final-stage testing and validation. the company distributes its ansys suite of simulation technologies through a global network of independent resellers and distributors (collectively, channel partners) and direct sales offices in strategic, global locations. it is the company's intention to continue to maintain this hybrid sales and distribution model.
the company licenses its technology to businesses, educational institutions and governmental agencies. growth in the company's revenue is affected by the strength of global economies, general business conditions, currency exchange rate fluctuations, customer budgetary constraints and the competitive position of the company's products. please see item 1a. risk factors for a complete discussion of factors that might impact the company's financial condition and operating results. the company believes that the features, functionality and integrated multiphysics capabilities of its software products are as strong as they have ever been. however, the software business is generally characterized by long sales cycles. these long sales cycles increase the difficulty of predicting sales for any particular quarter. the company makes many operational and strategic decisions based upon short- and long-term sales forecasts that are impacted not only by these long sales cycles, but also by current global economic conditions. as a result, the company believes that its overall performance is best measured by fiscal year results rather than by quarterly results. please see the sub-section entitled "sales forecasts" under item 1a. risk factors for a complete discussion of the potential impact of the company's sales forecasts on the company's financial condition, cash flows and operating results.
the company's management considers the competition and price pressure that it faces in the short- and long-term by focusing on expanding the breadth, depth, ease of use and quality of the technologies, features, functionality and integrated multiphysics capabilities of its software products as compared to its competitors; investing in research and development to develop new and innovative products and increase the capabilities of its existing products; supplying new products and services; focusing on customer needs, training, consulting and support; and enhancing its distribution channels. from time to time, the company also considers acquisitions to supplement its global engineering talent, product offerings and distribution channels.
geographic trends the following table presents the company's geographic constant currency revenue growth during the year ended december 31, 2017 as compared to the year ended december 31, 2016:
in north america, the company's performance was primarily driven by the aerospace and defense, electronics, semiconductors and automotive industries. the performance within aerospace and defense continued to be driven by major and strategic accounts, growing demand from the commercial space sector and increased u.s. defense spending. the electronics industry continued to benefit from the placement of software into a wide range of smart, connected products. the automotive manufacturers maintained their strong investments in developing advanced technologies for autonomous, electric and smart, connected vehicles. the renewable energy sector remained strong as energy companies continued their investment initiatives and commodity prices improved.
while revenue growth in europe showed improvement, it continued to lag the other regions. sales leadership in the region remained focused on building the sales pipeline and finalizing initiatives to update the company's go-to-market strategy. europe demonstrated similar trends as north america except that the commodity recovery has not been fully realized. additionally, the indirect channel grew faster than the direct business, helping to bolster the overall growth rate in the region.
the results in asia-pacific were driven by the aerospace and defense, electronics, automotive and industrial equipment sectors. the region continued to benefit from investment in domestic development programs, particularly in china and india. the indirect channel performance was especially strong in this region and contributed to the growth rate even more significantly than in europe.
the company continues to focus on a number of sales improvement activities across the geographic regions, including sales hiring, pipeline building, productivity initiatives and customer engagement activities.

the company's revenue increased 10.8% (10.3% in constant currency) during the year ended december 31, 2017 as compared to the year ended december 31, 2016. the growth rate was favorably impacted by the company's continued investment in its global sales, support and marketing organizations. lease license revenue increased 10.7% as compared to the prior year. perpetual license revenue, which is derived primarily from new sales, increased 8.9% as compared to the prior year. annual maintenance contracts that were sold with new perpetual licenses, along with maintenance contracts sold with new perpetual licenses in previous years, contributed to maintenance revenue growth of 11.6%. service revenue, primarily composed of consulting projects, increased 16.9%.
with respect to revenue, on average for the year ended december 31, 2017, the u.s. dollar was 1.0% weaker, when measured against the company's primary foreign currencies, than for the year ended december 31, 2016. the table below presents the impacts of currency fluctuations on revenue for the year ended december 31, 2017. amounts in brackets indicate a net adverse impact from currency fluctuations.
the weaker u.s. dollar also resulted in increased operating income of $3.5 million for the year ended december 31, 2017 as compared to the year ended december 31, 2016.
a substantial portion of the company's license and maintenance revenue is derived from annual lease and maintenance contracts. these contracts are generally renewed on an annual basis and typically have a high rate of customer renewal. in addition to the recurring revenue base associated with these contracts, a majority of customers purchasing new perpetual licenses also purchase related annual maintenance contracts. as a result of the significant recurring revenue base, the company's license and maintenance revenue growth rate in any period does not necessarily correlate to the growth rate of new license and maintenance contracts sold during that period. to the extent the rate of customer renewal for lease and maintenance contracts is high, incremental lease contracts, and maintenance contracts sold with new perpetual licenses, will result in license and maintenance revenue growth in constant currency. conversely, if the rate of renewal for these contracts is adversely affected by economic or other factors, the company's license and maintenance growth will be adversely affected over the term that the revenue for those contracts would have otherwise been recognized.
the company is starting to experience an increased interest by some of its larger customers in enterprise agreements that often include longer-term, time-based licenses involving a larger number of the company's software products. while these arrangements typically involve a higher overall transaction price, the revenue from these contracts has been typically deferred
under asc 605 and recognized over the period of the contract, resulting in increased deferred revenue and backlog. under asc 606, which is effective on january 1, 2018, the license component of these arrangements will be recognized up-front, resulting in increased volatility in the company's reporting of quarterly and annual revenue. the company is similarly experiencing a shifting preference from perpetual licenses to time-based licenses across a broader spectrum of its customers, particularly in the more mature geographic markets, such as the u.s. and japan. to the extent this shift continues or becomes more prevalent, the result could be a near-term adverse impact on software license and maintenance revenue growth.
international and domestic revenues, as a percentage of total revenue, were 61.9% and 38.1%, respectively, during the year ended december 31, 2017, and 62.8% and 37.2%, respectively, during the year ended december 31, 2016. the company derived 24.8% and 24.4% of its total revenue through the indirect sales channel for the years ended december 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.
in valuing deferred revenue on the balance sheets of the company's recent acquisitions as of their respective acquisition dates, the company applied the fair value provisions applicable to the accounting for business combinations, resulting in a reduction of deferred revenue as compared to its historical carrying amount. as a result, the company's post-acquisition revenue will be less than the sum of what would have otherwise been reported by ansys and each acquiree absent the acquisitions. the impacts on reported revenue for the years ended december 31, 2017 and 2016 were $2.9 million and $0.1 million, respectively.

software licenses: the increase in the cost of software licenses was primarily due to the following:
•   increased third-party royalties of $2.9 million.
•   increased salaries and other headcount-related costs of $1.6 million.
•   increased restructuring costs of $0.6 million.
amortization: the decrease in amortization expense was primarily due to a net decrease in the amortization of acquired technology, partially offset by an increase in the amortization of trade names.
maintenance and service: the net decrease in maintenance and service costs was primarily due to the following:
•   decreased salaries and other headcount-related costs of $4.0 million, primarily due to a redeployment of technical personnel resources to pre-sales activities.
•   decreased depreciation and facility costs, each of $0.6 million.
•   increased third-party technical support of $2.1 million.
•   increased restructuring costs of $1.7 million.
•   increased stock-based compensation of $1.0 million.
the improvement in gross profit was a result of the increase in revenue, partially offset by the increase in the related cost of sales.

•   increased salaries, incentive compensation and other headcount-related costs of $42.1 million.
•   increased stock-based compensation of $14.8 million.
•   increased consulting costs of $7.3 million.
the company anticipates that it will continue to make targeted investments in its global sales and marketing organizations and its global business infrastructure to enhance and support its revenue-generating activities.
research and development: the increase in research and development costs was primarily due to the following:
•   increased salaries, incentive compensation and other headcount-related costs of $9.6 million.
•   increased restructuring costs of $6.5 million.
•   increased stock-based compensation of $3.8 million.
the company has traditionally invested significant resources in research and development activities and intends to continue to make investments in expanding the ease of use and capabilities of its broad portfolio of simulation software products.
interest income: interest income for the year ended december 31, 2017 was $7.0 million as compared to $4.2 million for the year ended december 31, 2016. interest income increased as a result of an increase in both the company's average invested cash balances and the average rate of return on those balances.
other expense, net: the company's other expense consists of the following:
income tax provision: the company recorded income tax expense of $136.4 million and had income before income taxes of $395.7 million for the year ended december 31, 2017, representing an effective tax rate of 34.5%. during the year ended december 31, 2016, the company recorded income tax expense of $114.7 million and had income before income taxes of $380.3 million, representing an effective tax rate of 30.2%.
on december 22, 2017, the u.s. government enacted comprehensive tax legislation commonly referred to as the tax cuts and jobs act (tax reform). tax reform makes broad and complex changes to the u.s. tax code, including, but not limited to, (1) reducing the u.s. federal corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent; (2) requiring companies to pay a one-time transition tax on certain unrepatriated earnings of foreign subsidiaries (transition tax); (3) generally eliminating u.s. federal income taxes on dividends from foreign subsidiaries; (4) creating a new provision designed to tax global intangible low-taxed income (gilti) which allows for the possibility of using foreign tax credits (ftcs) and a deduction of up to 50 percent to offset the income tax liability (subject to some limitations); (5) repealing the domestic production activity deduction; (6) creating the base erosion anti-abuse tax, a new minimum tax; (7) allowing for full expensing of qualified property through bonus depreciation; and (8) creating limitations on the deductibility of certain executive compensation.
the sec staff issued staff accounting bulletin (sab) 118, which provides guidance on accounting for the tax effects of tax reform. sab 118 provides a measurement period that should not extend beyond one year from enactment for companies to complete the accounting under asc 740, income taxes. in accordance with sab 118, a company must reflect the income tax effects of those aspects of tax reform for which the accounting under asc 740 is complete in the financial statements. to the extent that a company's accounting for certain income tax effects of tax reform is incomplete, but a reasonable estimate is able to be made, the company must record a provisional estimate in the financial statements. if a company cannot determine a provisional estimate to be included in the financial statements, it should continue to apply asc 740 on the basis of the tax laws that were in effect immediately before the enactment of tax reform.
in connection with the company's initial analysis of the impact of tax reform, a discrete net tax expense of $17.9 million was recorded in the period ending december 31, 2017, primarily consisting of $1.9 million for the revaluation of net deferred tax assets and $16.0 million for the transition tax. in addition to the $17.9 million charge, the company would have recognized a $4.8 million benefit in the fourth quarter related to foreign earnings repatriation, but this benefit was eliminated due to tax reform. as further discussed below, the company was able to complete final or provisional calculations for certain elements of tax reform and the amounts and estimates are included in the financial statements. for other elements, the company was not able to make reasonable estimates and therefore those elements have not been recorded and are accounted for in accordance with asc 740 on the basis of the tax laws in effect before tax reform.
the company's accounting for the impact of the reduction in the u.s. federal corporate tax rate on the company's deferred tax assets and liabilities is complete. tax reform reduces the corporate tax rate to 21 percent, effective january 1, 2018. consequently, the company has recorded a net adjustment to deferred income tax expense of $1.9 million for the year ended december 31, 2017 to revalue the company's deferred tax assets and liabilities. the lower statutory rate of 21% will have a favorable impact on the company's effective tax rate in future years.
the company's accounting for the transition tax is incomplete. however, reasonable estimates of certain effects were able to be calculated and, therefore, a provisional adjustment was recorded. the transition tax is a tax on the deemed repatriation of previously untaxed accumulated current earnings and profits (e&p) of certain foreign subsidiaries. to determine the amount of the transition tax, the company must determine, in addition to other factors, the amount of post-1986 e&p of the relevant subsidiaries, as well as the amount of non-u.s. income taxes paid on such earnings. the company was able to make a reasonable estimate of the transition tax and recorded a provisional transition tax expense of $16.0 million. however, the company will continue to gather additional information to more precisely compute the final amount. the company plans to elect to pay this liability over eight years and has recorded $14.5 million of the obligation in other long-term liabilities, with the balance recorded to accrued income taxes.
the company's accounting for the indefinite reinvestment assertion is incomplete. however, a reasonable estimate of book and tax basis was calculated, and the company made a provisional assertion. in general, it is the practice and intention of the company to repatriate previously taxed earnings and to reinvest all other earnings of its non-u.s. subsidiaries. as part of tax reform, the company incurred u.s. tax on substantially all of the earnings of its non-u.s. subsidiaries as part of the transition tax. this tax increased the company's previously taxed earnings and will allow for the repatriation of the majority of its foreign earnings without any residual u.s. federal tax. the company does not believe that there is an excess of the financial reporting basis over the tax basis of investments in foreign subsidiaries. accordingly, any repatriation in excess of previously taxed earnings will be a non-taxable return of basis. this assertion is subject to change as additional information is gathered to precisely compute the book and tax basis of the company's non-u.s. subsidiaries.
the company's accounting for gilti is incomplete, and reasonable estimates of the effects are not able to be made. therefore, no provisional adjustments were recorded. tax reform creates a new requirement that gilti earned by controlled foreign corporations (cfcs) must be included currently in the gross income of the cfcs' u.s. shareholder. gilti is the excess of the shareholder's "net cfc tested income" over the net deemed tangible income return which is currently defined as the excess of (1) 10 percent of the aggregate of the u.s. shareholder's pro rata share of the qualified business asset investment of each cfc over (2) the amount of certain interest expense taken into account in the determination of net cfc-tested income.
due to the complexity of the new gilti tax rules, the company is continuing to evaluate this provision of tax reform and the application of asc 740. under u.s. gaap, the company is allowed to make an accounting policy choice of either (1) treating taxes due on future u.s. inclusions in taxable income related to gilti as a current-period expense when incurred (the "period cost method") or (2) factoring such amounts into the company's measurement of its deferred taxes (the "deferred method"). the company's selection of an accounting policy with respect to the new gilti tax rules will depend, in part, on analyzing global income to determine whether future u.s. inclusions in taxable income related to gilti are expected and, if so, the expected impact. whether the company expects to have future u.s. inclusions in taxable income related to gilti depends not only on the current structure and estimated future results of global operations, but also on the company's intent and ability to modify the structure and/or the business. the company is not yet able to reasonably estimate the effect of this provision of tax reform and therefore has not made any adjustments related to potential gilti tax in the financial statements. in addition, the company has not made the accounting policy decision regarding whether to record deferred taxes on gilti or expense taxes as incurred on gilti.
the increase in the effective tax rate from the prior year is primarily due to tax charges of $17.9 million related to tax reform, partially offset by increased tax benefits of $13.1 million related to stock-based compensation in 2017. in addition, the 2016 effective tax rate was reduced by entity structuring and related repatriation benefits of $10.8 million that did not recur in 2017. in the first quarter of 2017, the company adopted asu 2016-09, compensation - stock compensation (topic 718): improvements to employee share-based payment accounting, which requires excess tax benefits and deficiencies related to stock-based compensation to be reflected in the income statement as a component of the provision for income taxes. previously, these tax effects were reflected in stockholders' equity.
when compared to the federal and state combined statutory rate, the effective tax rates for the years ended december 31, 2017 and 2016 were favorably impacted by the domestic manufacturing deduction and research and development credits. the rates were also favorably impacted by the recurring item of lower statutory tax rates in many of the company's foreign jurisdictions.
net income: the company's net income for the year ended december 31, 2017 was $259.3 million as compared to net income of $265.6 million for the year ended december 31, 2016. diluted earnings per share was $2.98 for the year ended december 31, 2017 and $2.99 for the year ended december 31, 2016. the weighted average shares used in computing diluted earnings per share were 86.9 million and 89.0 million for the years ended december 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.

the company's revenue increased 4.8% during the year ended december 31, 2016 as compared to the year ended december 31, 2015, while revenue grew 5.1% in constant currency. the growth rate was favorably impacted by the company's continued investment in its global sales, support and marketing organizations and was adversely impacted by a recent shift in the licensing preference of certain customers from perpetual licenses to lease licenses. lease license revenue increased 7.6% as compared to the prior year. perpetual license revenue, which is derived primarily from new sales, decreased 4.6% as compared to the prior year. annual maintenance contracts that were sold with new perpetual licenses, along with maintenance contracts sold with new perpetual licenses in previous years, contributed to maintenance revenue growth of 8.3%.
with respect to revenue, on average for the year ended december 31, 2016, the u.s. dollar was 0.5% stronger, when measured against the company's primary foreign currencies, than for the year ended december 31, 2015. the table below presents the impacts of currency fluctuations on revenue for the year ended december 31, 2016. amounts in brackets indicate a net adverse impact from currency fluctuations.
the net overall stronger u.s. dollar also resulted in increased operating income of $0.9 million during the year ended december 31, 2016 as compared to the year ended december 31, 2015.
international and domestic revenues, as a percentage of total revenue, were 62.8% and 37.2%, respectively, during the year ended december 31, 2016, and 62.4% and 37.6%, respectively, during the year ended december 31, 2015. the company derived 24.4% and 24.2% of its total revenue through the indirect sales channel for the years ended december 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
in valuing deferred revenue on the balance sheets of the company's acquisitions as of their respective acquisition dates, the company applied the fair value provisions applicable to the accounting for business combinations, resulting in a reduction of deferred revenue as compared to its historical carrying amount. as a result, the company's post-acquisition revenue is less than the sum of what would have otherwise been reported by ansys and each acquiree absent the acquisitions. the impacts on reported revenue for the years ended december 31, 2016 and 2015 were $0.1 million and $1.7 million, respectively.

software licenses: contributing to the minimal change in costs of software were the following two offsetting factors:
•   decreased salaries and other headcount-related costs of $1.2 million, primarily due to a decrease in headcount.
•   increased third-party royalties of $1.2 million.
amortization: the net decrease in amortization expense was primarily due to a net decrease in the amortization of acquired technology, partially offset by a net increase in the amortization of trade names.
maintenance and service: the net increase in maintenance and service costs was primarily due to the following:
•   net increase in salaries, incentive compensation and other headcount-related costs of $3.5 million.
•   increased it-related maintenance and software hosting costs of $0.5 million.
•   decreased depreciation and severance costs, each of $0.7 million.
•   decreased facility costs of $0.4 million.
•   cost reduction related to foreign exchange translation of $0.4 million due to a stronger u.s. dollar.
•   decreased business travel and stock-based compensation, each of $0.3 million.
the improvement in gross profit was a result of the increase in revenue and decrease in related cost of sales.

•   $4.7 million of costs associated with an employment-related settlement agreement.
•   increased severance costs of $3.2 million.
•   net increase in salaries, incentive compensation and other headcount-related costs of $2.1 million.
•   increased it-related maintenance and software hosting costs of $2.1 million.
•   increased government charges and taxes of $1.4 million.
•   increased marketing costs of $1.2 million.
research and development: the net increase in research and development costs was primarily due to the following:
•   increased salaries, incentive compensation and other headcount-related costs of $10.6 million.
•   increased it-related maintenance and software hosting costs of $2.1 million.
•   increased stock-based compensation of $0.9 million.
•   cost reduction due to foreign exchange translation of $1.6 million.
amortization: the decrease in amortization expense was primarily due to a decrease in the amortization of acquired customer lists that became fully amortized.
interest income: interest income for the year ended december 31, 2016 was $4.2 million as compared to $2.8 million for the year ended december 31, 2015. interest income increased as a result of an increase in both the company's average invested cash balances and the average rate of return on those balances.
other (expense) income, net: the company's other (expense) income consists of the following:
income tax provision: the company recorded income tax expense of $114.7 million and had income before income taxes of $380.3 million for the year ended december 31, 2016, representing an effective tax rate of 30.2%. during the year ended december 31, 2015, the company recorded income tax expense of $104.2 million and had income before income taxes of $356.8 million, representing an effective tax rate of 29.2%.
the increase in the effective tax rate from the prior year is primarily due to tax benefits related to the merger of the company's japan subsidiaries in 2010 recognized in 2015 that did not recur in 2016, partially offset by tax benefits from restructuring activities in 2016. when compared to the federal and state combined statutory rate, the effective tax rates for the years ended december 31, 2016 and 2015 were favorably impacted by the domestic manufacturing deduction and research and development credits. the quarterly benefit of approximately $3.1 million associated with the merger of the company's japan subsidiaries was fully amortized in the third quarter of 2015. there will be no additional ongoing benefit from this transaction. the rates were also favorably impacted by the recurring item of lower statutory tax rates in many of the company's foreign jurisdictions.
net income: the company's net income for the year ended december 31, 2016 was $265.6 million as compared to net income of $252.5 million for the year ended december 31, 2015. diluted earnings per share was $2.99 for the year ended december 31, 2016 and $2.76 for the year ended december 31, 2015. the weighted average shares used in computing diluted earnings per share were 89.0 million and 91.5 million for the years ended december 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
non-gaap results the company provides non-gaap revenue, non-gaap operating income, non-gaap operating profit margin, non-gaap net income and non-gaap diluted earnings per share as supplemental measures to gaap regarding the company's operational performance. these financial measures exclude the impact of certain items and, therefore, have not been calculated in accordance with gaap. a detailed explanation and a reconciliation of each non-gaap financial measure to its most comparable gaap financial measure are described below.

non-gaap measures management uses non-gaap financial measures (a) to evaluate the company's historical and prospective financial performance as well as its performance relative to its competitors, (b) to set internal sales targets and spending budgets, (c) to allocate resources, (d) to measure operational profitability and the accuracy of forecasting, (e) to assess financial discipline over operational expenditures and (f) as an important factor in determining variable compensation for management and its employees. in addition, many financial analysts that follow the company focus on and publish both historical results and future projections based on non-gaap financial measures. the company believes that it is in the best interest of its investors to provide this information to analysts so that they accurately report the non-gaap financial information. moreover, investors have historically requested and the company has historically reported these non-gaap financial measures as a means of providing consistent and comparable information with past reports of financial results.
while management believes that these non-gaap financial measures provide useful supplemental information to investors, there are limitations associated with the use of these non-gaap financial measures. these non-gaap financial measures are not prepared in accordance with gaap, are not reported by all of the company's competitors and may not be directly comparable to similarly titled measures of the company's competitors due to potential differences in the exact method of calculation. the company compensates for these limitations by using these non-gaap financial measures as supplements to gaap financial measures and by reviewing the reconciliations of the non-gaap financial measures to their most comparable gaap financial measures.
the adjustments to these non-gaap financial measures, and the basis for such adjustments, are outlined below:
acquisition accounting for deferred revenue and its related tax impact. historically, the company has consummated acquisitions in order to support its strategic and other business objectives. in accordance with the fair value provisions applicable to the accounting for business combinations, acquired deferred revenue is often recorded on the opening balance sheet at an amount that is lower than the historical carrying value. although this acquisition accounting requirement has no impact on the company's business or cash flow, it adversely impacts the company's reported gaap revenue in the reporting periods following an acquisition. in order to provide investors with financial information that facilitates comparison of both historical and future results, the company provides non-gaap financial measures which exclude the impact of the acquisition accounting adjustment. the company believes that this non-gaap financial adjustment is useful to investors because it allows investors to (a) evaluate the effectiveness of the methodology and information used by management in its financial and operational decision-making, and (b) compare past and future reports of financial results of the company as the revenue reduction related to acquired deferred revenue will not recur when related annual lease licenses and software maintenance contracts are renewed in future periods.
amortization of intangible assets from acquisitions and its related tax impact. the company incurs amortization of intangible assets, included in its gaap presentation of amortization expense, related to various acquisitions it has made. management excludes these expenses and their related tax impact for the purpose of calculating non-gaap operating income, non-gaap operating profit margin, non-gaap net income and non-gaap diluted earnings per share when it evaluates the continuing operational performance of the company because these costs are fixed at the time of an acquisition, are then amortized over a period of several years after the acquisition and generally cannot be changed or influenced by management after the acquisition. accordingly, management does not consider these expenses for purposes of evaluating the performance of the company during the applicable time period after the acquisition, and it excludes such expenses when making decisions to allocate resources. the company believes that these non-gaap financial measures are useful to investors because they allow investors to (a) evaluate the effectiveness of the methodology and information used by management in its financial and operational decision-making, and (b) compare past reports of financial results of the company as the company has historically reported these non-gaap financial measures.
stock-based compensation expense and its related tax impact. the company incurs expense related to stock-based compensation included in its gaap presentation of cost of software licenses; cost of maintenance and service; research and development expense; and selling, general and administrative expense. stock-based compensation expense (benefit) incurred in connection with the company's deferred compensation plan held in a rabbi trust includes an offsetting benefit (charge) recorded in other income (expense). although stock-based compensation is an expense of the company and viewed as a form of compensation, management excludes these expenses for the purpose of calculating non-gaap operating income, non-gaap operating profit margin, non-gaap net income and non-gaap diluted earnings per share when it evaluates the continuing operational performance of the company. management similarly excludes income (expense) related to assets held in a rabbi trust in connection with the company's deferred compensation plan. specifically, the company excludes stock-based compensation and income related to assets held in the deferred compensation plan rabbi trust during its annual budgeting process and its quarterly and annual assessments of the company's and management's performance. the annual budgeting process is the primary mechanism whereby the company allocates resources to various initiatives and operational requirements. additionally, the annual review by the board of directors during which it compares the company's historical business model and profitability to the planned business model and profitability for the forthcoming year excludes the impact of stock-based compensation. in evaluating the performance of senior management and department managers, charges related to stock-based compensation are excluded from expenditure and profitability results. in fact, the company records stock-based compensation expense into a stand-alone cost center for which no single operational manager is responsible or accountable. in this way, management is able to review, on a period-to-period basis, each manager's performance and assess financial discipline over operational expenditures without the effect of stock-based compensation. the company believes that these non-gaap financial measures are useful to investors because they allow investors to (a) evaluate the company's operating results and the effectiveness of the methodology used by management to review the company's operating results, and (b) review historical comparability in the company's financial reporting as well as comparability with competitors' operating results.
restructuring charges and the related tax impact. the company occasionally incurs expenses for restructuring its workforce included in its gaap presentation of cost of software licenses; cost of maintenance and service; research and development expense; and selling, general and administrative expense. management excludes these expenses for the purpose of calculating non-gaap operating income, non-gaap operating profit margin, non-gaap net income and non-gaap diluted earnings per share when it evaluates the continuing operational performance of the company, as it generally does not incur these expenses as a part of its operations. the company believes that these non-gaap financial measures are useful to investors because they allow investors to (a) evaluate the company's operating results and the effectiveness of the methodology used by management to review the company's operating results, and (b) review historical comparability in the company's financial reporting as well as comparability with competitors' operating results.
transaction costs related to business combinations. the company incurs expenses for professional services rendered in connection with business combinations, which are included in its gaap presentation of research and development expense and selling, general and administrative expense. these expenses are generally not tax-deductible. management excludes these acquisition-related transaction expenses, derived from closed acquisitions, for the purpose of calculating non-gaap operating income, non-gaap operating profit margin, non-gaap net income and non-gaap diluted earnings per share when it evaluates the continuing operational performance of the company, as it generally would not have otherwise incurred these expenses in the periods presented as a part of its operations. the company believes that these non-gaap financial measures are useful to investors because they allow investors to (a) evaluate the company's operating results and the effectiveness of the methodology used by management to review the company's operating results, and (b) review historical comparability in the company's financial reporting as well as comparability with competitors' operating results.
tax cuts and jobs act. the company recorded charges in its income tax provision related to the enactment of the tax cuts and jobs act, including charges for the transition tax related to unrepatriated cash and the impacts of the tax rate change on net deferred tax assets. in addition, the company was not able to realize a tax benefit related to foreign earnings repatriation due to the enactment of the tax cuts and jobs act. management excludes these charges and the unrealized benefit for the purpose of calculating non-gaap net income and non-gaap diluted earnings per share when it evaluates the continuing operational performance of the company, as (i) the charges are not expected to recur as part of its normal operations and (ii) both the charges and unrealized tax benefit resulted from the extremely infrequent event of major u.s. tax reform, the last such reform having occurred in 1986. the company believes that these non-gaap financial measures are useful to investors because they allow investors to (a) evaluate the company's operating results and the effectiveness of the methodology used by management to review the company's operating results, and (b) review historical comparability in the company's financial reporting.
non-gaap financial measures are not in accordance with, or an alternative for, gaap. the company's non-gaap financial measures are not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for comparable gaap financial measures, and should be read only in conjunction with the company's consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with gaap.
the company has provided a reconciliation of the non-gaap financial measures to the most directly comparable gaap financial measures as listed below:
gaap reporting measure       non-gaap reporting measure revenue                      non-gaap revenue operating income             non-gaap operating income operating profit margin      non-gaap operating profit margin net income                   non-gaap net income diluted earnings per share   non-gaap diluted earnings per share
liquidity and capital resources as of december 31,   change
working capital                                            $661,713                $630,301        $31,412            5.0
cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments cash and cash equivalents consist primarily of highly liquid investments such as money market funds and deposits held at major banks. short-term investments consist primarily of deposits held by certain foreign subsidiaries of the company with original maturities of three months to one year. the following table presents the company's foreign and domestic holdings of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments:
as of december 31,
(in thousands, except percentages)              2017        % of total   2016                       % of total domestic                                $561,417                  63.7          $593,348                  72.1
in general, it is the practice and intention of the company to repatriate previously taxed earnings and to reinvest all other earnings of its non-u.s. subsidiaries. as part of the tax cuts and jobs act enacted in the united states in 2017, the company incurred u.s. tax on substantially all of the earnings of its non-u.s. subsidiaries. the company recorded a provisional adjustment for the transition tax. this tax increased the company's previously taxed earnings and will allow for the repatriation of the majority of its foreign earnings without any residual u.s. federal tax. the company does not believe that there is an excess of the financial reporting basis over the tax basis of investments in foreign subsidiaries. accordingly, any repatriation in excess of previously taxed earnings will be a non-taxable return of basis.
the amount of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments held by foreign subsidiaries is subject to translation adjustments caused by changes in foreign currency exchange rates as of the end of each respective reporting period, the offset to which is recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss on the company's consolidated balance sheet.
cash flows from operating activities year ended december 31,                                       change
net cash provided by operating activities          $430,438                $365,980                $375,699            $64,458             $(9,719       )
net cash provided by operating activities increased during the current fiscal year due to increased net cash flows from operating assets and liabilities of $46.5 million and increased net income (net of non-cash operating adjustments) of $17.9 million.
net cash provided by operating activities decreased during the prior fiscal year due to decreased net cash flows from operating assets and liabilities of $19.0 million, partially offset by increased net income (net of non-cash operating adjustments) of $9.3 million. the company experienced an increase in net tax payments of $8.5 million in 2016 as compared to 2015 as 2016 benefited less from prior year overpayments.
cash flows from investing activities year ended december 31,                                            change
net cash used in investing activities increased during the current fiscal year due to increased acquisition-related net cash outlays of $56.0 million and increased capital expenditures of $6.7 million. the company currently plans capital spending of $22 million to $27 million during fiscal year 2018 as compared to the $19.1 million that was spent in 2017. the level of spending will be dependent upon various factors, including growth of the business and general economic conditions.
net cash used in investing activities decreased during the prior fiscal year due to decreased acquisition-related net cash outlays of $38.2 million and decreased capital expenditures of $3.7 million, partially offset by increased net cash outlays of $12.1 million for other investing activities.
year ended december 31,                                            change
net cash used in financing activities increased during the current fiscal year due primarily to increased restricted stock withholding taxes paid in lieu of issued shares of $6.1 million.
net cash used in financing activities decreased during the prior fiscal year due primarily to increased proceeds from shares issued for stock-based compensation of $10.2 million.
other cash flow information the company believes that existing cash and cash equivalent balances of $881.5 million, together with cash generated from operations, will be sufficient to meet the company's working capital and capital expenditure requirements through the next twelve months. the company's cash requirements in the future may also be financed through additional equity or debt financings. there can be no assurance that such financings can be obtained on favorable terms, if at all.
under the company's stock repurchase program, the company repurchased shares as follows:
number of shares repurchased                  2,750                   3,700                   3,833
in february 2018, the company's board of directors increased the number of shares authorized for repurchase to a total of 5.0 million shares under the stock repurchase program. as of december 31, 2017, 2.8 million shares remained available for repurchase under the program.
the company continues to generate positive cash flows from operating activities and believes that the best uses of its excess cash are to invest in the business and repurchase stock in order to both offset dilution and return capital, in excess of its requirements, to stockholders with the goal of increasing stockholder value. additionally, the company has in the past, and expects in the future, to acquire or make investments in complementary companies, products, services and technologies. any future acquisitions may be funded by available cash and investments, cash generated from operations, credit facilities, or the issuance of additional securities.
off-balance-sheet arrangements the company does not have any special-purpose entities or off-balance-sheet financing.
contractual obligations the company's significant contractual obligations as of december 31, 2017 are summarized below:
(in thousands)                                                                                     total            within 1 year           2 - 3 years           4 - 5 years       after 5 years global headquarters operating lease(1)                                                       $36,581                $4,278                 $8,742                $8,928             $14,633
other operating leases(2)                                                                     30,064                10,884                 12,112                 5,802             1,266
(1)   the company previously entered into a lease agreement for 186,000 square feet of rentable space located in an office facility in canonsburg, pennsylvania, which serves as the company's headquarters. the term of the lease is 183 months, beginning on october 1, 2014 and expiring on december 31, 2029. the company has a one-time right to terminate the lease effective upon the last day of the tenth full year following the date of possession (december 31, 2024) by providing the landlord with at least 18 months' prior written notice of such termination.
(2)   other operating leases primarily include noncancellable lease commitments for the company's other domestic and international offices as well as certain operating equipment.
(3)   unconditional purchase obligations primarily include royalties, software licenses and long-term purchase contracts for network, communication and office maintenance services, which are unrecorded as of december 31, 2017.
(4)   the company has $24.8 million of unrecognized tax benefits, including estimated interest and penalties, that have been recorded as liabilities in accordance with income tax accounting guidance for which the company is uncertain as to if or when such amounts may be settled. as a result, such amounts are excluded from the table above.
(5)   other long-term obligations primarily include federal transition tax related to tax reform of $15.7 million, post-employment benefits, including pension obligations, of $8.1 million for certain foreign locations of the company and deferred compensation of $3.3 million (including estimated imputed interest of $87,000 within 1 year). these amounts include the related current portions when applicable.
critical accounting policies and estimates the company believes that the following critical accounting policies affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements.
revenue recognition:  revenue is derived principally from the licensing of computer software products and from related maintenance contracts. revenue from perpetual licenses is classified as license revenue and is recognized upon delivery of the licensed product and the utility that enables the customer to access authorization keys, provided that acceptance has occurred and a signed contractual obligation has been received, the price is fixed and determinable, and collectibility of the receivable is probable. the company determines the fair value of post-contract customer support (pcs) sold together with perpetual licenses based on the rate charged for pcs when sold separately. revenue from pcs contracts is classified as maintenance and service revenue and is recognized ratably over the term of the contract.
revenue for software lease licenses is classified as license revenue and is recognized over the period of the lease contract. typically, the company's software leases include pcs which, due to the short term (principally one year or less) of the company's software lease licenses, is not separated from lease revenue for accounting purposes. both the lease licenses and pcs are recognized ratably over the lease period. the company includes the revenue for the entire lease arrangement within software license revenue in the consolidated statements of income.
many of the company's semiconductor products are typically licensed via longer term leases of 24-36 months. the company recognizes revenue for these licenses over the term of the lease contract. because the company does not have vendor-specific objective evidence of the fair value of these leases, the company also recognizes revenue from perpetual licenses over the term of the lease contract during the infrequent occurrence of these licenses being sold with semiconductor leases in multiple-element arrangements.
revenue from training, support and other services is recognized as the services are performed. the company applies the specific performance method to contracts in which the service consists of a single act, such as providing a training class to a customer, and the proportional performance method to other service contracts that are longer in duration and often include multiple acts (for example, both training and consulting). in applying the proportional performance method, the company typically utilizes output-based estimates for services with contractual billing arrangements that are not based on time and materials, and estimates output based on the total tasks completed as compared to the total tasks required for each work contract. input-based estimates are utilized for services that involve general consultations with contractual billing arrangements based on time and materials, utilizing direct labor as the input measure.
the company also executes arrangements through independent channel partners in which the channel partners are authorized to market and distribute the company's software products to end users of the company's products and services in specified territories. in sales facilitated by channel partners, the channel partner bears the risk of collection from the end-user customer. the company recognizes revenue from transactions with channel partners when the channel partner submits a written purchase commitment, collectibility from the channel partner is probable, a license agreement signed by the end-user customer is received and delivery has occurred, provided that all other revenue recognition criteria are satisfied. revenue from channel partner transactions is the amount remitted to the company by the channel partners. this amount includes a fee for pcs that is compensation for providing technical enhancements and the second level of technical support to the end user, which is based on the rate charged for pcs when sold separately, and is recognized over the period that pcs is to be provided. the company does not offer right of return, product rotation or price protection to any of its channel partners.
non-income-related taxes collected from customers and remitted to governmental authorities are recorded on the consolidated balance sheet as accounts receivable and accrued expenses. the collection and payment of these amounts are reported on a net basis in the consolidated statements of income and do not impact reported revenues or expenses.
the company warrants to its customers that its software will substantially perform as specified in the company's current user manuals. the company has not experienced significant claims related to software warranties beyond the scope of maintenance support, which the company is already obligated to provide. consequently, the company has not established reserves for warranty obligations.
the company's agreements with its customers generally require it to indemnify the customer against claims that the company's software infringes third-party patent, copyright, trademark or other proprietary rights. such indemnification obligations are generally limited in a variety of industry-standard respects, including the company's right to replace an infringing product. as of december 31, 2017, the company had not experienced any losses related to these indemnification obligations and no claims with respect thereto were outstanding. the company does not expect significant claims related to these indemnification obligations, and, consequently, the company has not established any related reserves.
allowance for doubtful accounts:  the company makes judgments as to its ability to collect outstanding receivables and provides allowances for a portion of receivables when collection becomes doubtful. provisions are made based upon a specific review of all significant outstanding invoices from both value and delinquency perspectives. for those invoices not specifically reviewed, provisions are provided at differing rates based upon the age of the receivable and the geographic area of origin. in determining these percentages, the company considers its historical collection experience and current economic trends in the customer's industry and geographic region. if the historical data used to calculate the allowance for doubtful accounts does not reflect the future ability to collect outstanding receivables, additional provisions for doubtful accounts may be needed and future results of operations could be materially affected.
income taxes: the company accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability method, which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements. under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. the effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period of the enactment date.
the company records net deferred tax assets to the extent it believes these assets will more likely than not be realized. in making such determination, the company considers all available positive and negative evidence, including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, tax planning strategies and recent financial operations. in the event the company determines that it will be able to realize deferred tax assets for which a valuation allowance was used to reduce their carrying value, the adjustment to the valuation allowance will be recorded as a reduction to the provision for income taxes.
tax benefits related to uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken on a tax return are recorded when such benefits meet a more-likely-than-not threshold. otherwise, these tax benefits are recorded when a tax position has been effectively settled, which means that the statute of limitations has expired or the appropriate taxing authority has completed their examination even though the statute of limitations remains open. the company recognizes interest and penalties related to income taxes within the income tax expense line in the consolidated statements of income. accrued interest and penalties are included within the related tax liability line in the consolidated balance sheets.
goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets: the company tests goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment at least annually by performing a quantitative assessment of whether the fair value of each reporting unit or asset exceeds its carrying amount. goodwill is tested at the reporting unit level and indefinite-lived intangible assets are tested at the individual asset level. this requires the company to assess and make judgments regarding a variety of factors which impact the fair value of the reporting unit or asset being tested, including business plans, anticipated future cash flows, economic projections and other market data. because there are inherent uncertainties involved in these factors, significant differences between these estimates and actual results could result in future impairment charges and could materially impact the company's future financial results. during the first quarter of 2017, the company completed the annual impairment test for goodwill and the indefinite-lived intangible asset and determined that these assets had not been impaired as of the test date, january 1, 2017. no other events or circumstances changed during the year ended december 31, 2017 that would indicate that the fair values of the company's reporting unit and indefinite-lived intangible asset are below their carrying values.
contingencies: the company is involved in various investigations, claims and legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business, including commercial disputes, labor and employment matters, tax audits, alleged infringement of intellectual property rights and other matters. the company reviews the status of these matters, assesses its financial exposure and records a related accrual if the potential loss from an investigation, claim or legal proceeding is probable and the amount is reasonably estimable. significant judgment is involved in the determination of probability and in the determination of whether an exposure is reasonably estimable. as a result of the uncertainties involved in making these estimates, the company may have to revise its estimates as facts and circumstances change. the revision of these estimates could have a material impact on the company's financial position and results of operations.
stock-based compensation: the company grants restricted stock units and other stock awards to employees and directors under the company's stock option and grant plan. eligible employees can also purchase shares of the company's common stock at a discount under the company's employee stock purchase plan. the benefits provided under these plans are share-based payments subject to the provisions of share-based payment accounting guidance. the company uses the fair value method to apply the provisions of share-based payment accounting guidance. stock-based compensation expense for 2017, 2016 and 2015 was $53.2 million, $33.3 million and $34.0 million, respectively. as of december 31, 2017, total unrecognized estimated compensation expense related to unvested stock options and awards granted prior to that date was $107.7 million, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 1.9 years.
the value of each stock option award was estimated on the date of grant, or date of acquisition for options issued in a business combination, using the black-scholes option pricing model (black-scholes model). the determination of the fair value of share-based payment awards using an option pricing model is affected by the company's stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables. these variables include the company's expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards, actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors, risk-free interest rates and expected dividends. the table below presents the weighted-average input assumptions used and resulting fair values for options granted or issued in business combinations during each respective year. the stock-based compensation expense for options is recorded ratably over the requisite service period. the interest rate assumptions were determined by using the five-year u.s. treasury note yield on the date of grant or date of acquisition. the company did not grant stock option awards during 2017.
risk-free interest rate                      1.19% to 1.93%             1.18% to 1.65%

the company issues various restricted stock awards which contain a market condition, a performance condition, a service condition, or any combination of the three. restricted stock awards are valued based on the grant-date fair value of the award. stock-based compensation expense is recognized over the employee's requisite service period for awards with only a service condition. for awards with a performance condition, stock-based compensation expense is recorded from the service inception date through the conclusion of the measurement period based on management's estimates concerning the probability of vesting.
vesting of restricted stock awards with a market condition is based on the company's performance as measured by total shareholder return relative to the appreciation of a specified stock index over the measurement period, subject to each participant's continued employment with the company through the conclusion of the measurement period. the fair value of the restricted stock awards with a market condition is estimated using a monte carlo simulation model. the determination of the fair value of the awards is affected by the grant date and a number of variables, each of which has been identified in the chart below for awards granted during each respective period. share-based compensation expense based on the fair value of the award is being recorded from the grant date through the conclusion of the measurement period.
risk-free interest rate                                      1.5%               1.0%               1.1%

expected volatility-nasdaq composite index                    15%                16%                14%

the company also grants deferred stock awards to non-affiliate independent directors, which are rights to receive shares of common stock upon termination of service as a director. in 2015 and prior, the deferred stock awards were issued quarterly in arrears and vested immediately upon grant. starting in 2016, the company issued the deferred stock awards immediately, but the awards vest in full on the one-year anniversary of the grant.
to the extent the company changes the terms of its stock-based compensation programs, experiences market volatility in the pricing of its common stock that increases the implied volatility assumption used in the black-scholes model, refines different assumptions, or assumes stock awards from acquired companies that are different in nature than the company's stock award arrangements, among other potential impacts, the stock-based compensation expense recorded in future periods and the related tax benefits may differ significantly from what was recorded in previous reporting periods. the company accounts for forfeitures of stock-based awards as they occur.
estimates of stock-based compensation expense are significant to the company's financial statements, but this expense is partially based on the aforementioned option valuation and monte carlo simulation models and will never result in the payment of cash by the company. for this reason, and because the company does not view stock-based compensation as related to its
operational performance, the board of directors and management exclude stock-based compensation expense when evaluating the company's underlying business performance.

on january 1, 2014, an organizational change occurred within our north america region from a country and product category structure to a regional product category structure. as a result, our north america region now has two instead of four reporting units. for any reporting units that were reorganized, the goodwill was allocated to the new reporting unit structure based on relative fair values of the related business units.

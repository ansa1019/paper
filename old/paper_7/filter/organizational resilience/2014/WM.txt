in july 2012, we announced a reorganization of operations, designed to streamline management and staff support and reduce our cost structure, while not disrupting our front-line operations. principal organizational changes included removing the management layer of our four geographic groups, each of which previously constituted a reportable segment, and consolidating and reducing the number of our geographic areas through which we evaluate and oversee our solid waste subsidiaries from 22 to 17. this reorganization eliminated approximately 700 employee positions throughout the company, including positions at both the management and support level. voluntary separation arrangements were offered to many employees.

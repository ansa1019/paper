item 7.  management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the following discussion is intended to further the reader's understanding of the consolidated financial condition and results of operations of our company. it should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying footnotes included in part ii, item 8 of this form 10-k. these historical financial statements may not be indicative of our future performance. this management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contains a number of forward-looking statements, all of which are based on our current expectations and could be affected by the uncertainties and risks discussed in part i, item 1a of this form 10-k.
throughout this section, references to "notes" refer to the footnotes included in part ii, item 8 of this form 10-k, unless otherwise indicated.
non-gaap financial measures for the purpose of aiding the comparison of our year-over-year results, we may refer to net sales and other financial results excluding the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. the constant-currency amounts are calculated by translating the current year's functional currency results at the prior-year period's exchange rate. these re-measured results excluding effects from currency translation are not in conformity with u.s. gaap and should not be used as a substitute for the comparable u.s. gaap financial measures. the non-u.s. gaap financial measures are incorporated into our discussion and analysis as management uses them in evaluating our results of operations, and believes that this information provides users a valuable insight into our results.
our operations we are a manufacturer of components and systems for the packaging and delivery of injectable drugs as well as delivery system components for the pharmaceutical, healthcare and consumer products industries. our products include stoppers and seals for vials, prefillable syringe components and systems, components for intravenous and blood collection systems, safety and administration systems, advanced injection systems, and contract design and manufacturing services. our customers include the leading global producers of pharmaceuticals, biologics, medical devices and personal care products. we were incorporated under the laws of the commonwealth of pennsylvania on july 27, 1923.
our business operations are organized into two reportable segments, which are aligned with the underlying markets and customers they serve. our reportable segments are packaging systems and delivery systems. packaging systems develops, manufactures and sells primary packaging components and systems for injectable drug delivery, including stoppers and seals for vials, closures and other components used in syringe, intravenous and blood collection systems, and prefillable syringe components. delivery systems develops, manufactures and sells safety and administration systems, multi-component systems for drug administration, and a variety of custom contract-manufacturing solutions targeted to the healthcare and consumer-products industries. in addition, delivery systems is responsible for the continued development and commercialization of our line of proprietary, multi-component systems for injectable drug administration and other healthcare applications. we also maintain global partnerships to share technologies and market products with affiliates in japan and mexico.
as a result of our global manufacturing and distribution presence, more than half of our revenues are generated outside of the u.s. in currencies other than the u.s. dollar, including 44% in europe and 10% collectively in asia, south america, and israel. fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, therefore, can have a significant effect on our consolidated financial results. generally, our financial results are affected positively by a weaker u.s. dollar and negatively by a stronger u.s. dollar, as compared to the foreign currencies in which we conduct our business. in terms of net sales, the most significant foreign currencies are the euro, the danish krone, and the singapore dollar, with euro-denominated sales representing the majority of sales transacted in foreign currencies. in addition, we are exposed to yen, as we maintain a 25% ownership interest in, and we purchase finished goods and other materials from, daikyo. during 2014, average exchange rates were unfavorable versus the exchange rates realized in 2013, resulting in lower reported net sales and operating profit of $5.5 million and $1.4 million, respectively, versus 2013.
2014 financial performance highlights
•   net sales were $1,421.4 million, an increase of 3.9% from 2013. excluding foreign currency effects, net sales increased by $58.5 million, or 4.3%.
•   gross profit was $447.8 million, an increase of 3.0% from 2013, and our gross margin percentage decreased by 0.3 margin points to 31.5%.
•   operating profit for 2014 was $182.0 million, an increase of 12.1% from 2013, and our operating profit margin increased by 0.9 margin points to 12.8%.
•   our financial position remains strong, with cash and cash equivalents of $255.3 million and a borrowing capacity available under our multi-currency revolving credit facility of $266.8 million at december 31, 2014, and net cash provided by operating activities totaling $182.9 million in 2014.
•   our board of directors approved an increase in the quarterly cash dividend, which began with the fourth quarter 2014 dividend of $0.11 per share.
•   the translation of our non-u.s. dollar-denominated sales is expected to adversely affect 2015 sales and net income per share, as compared to 2014.
we anticipate continued revenue and margin improvement on a long-term basis, driven by customers' increasing demand for higher product quality, which results in higher revenues and margin per unit sold in packaging systems and an increasing percentage of total sales from higher margin proprietary products in delivery systems. we continue to believe that actions taken in recent years to increase capacity for certain products, reduce costs through restructuring and lean savings efforts, and expand into emerging markets will lead to improved profitability as global demand increases. we plan to continue funding capital projects related to new products, expansion activity, advanced quality systems, and investment in emerging markets for packaging systems and new proprietary products within delivery systems. we believe that our strong operating results and financial position give us a platform for sustained growth, and will enable us to take advantage of opportunities to invest in our business as they arise. see part i, item 1a, risk factors, of this form 10-k for further discussion regarding the risks associated with our operations.
in october 2014, donald e. morel, jr., ph.d., our chairman and chief executive officer, announced his intention to retire at our annual meeting in may 2015. our board of directors has launched a comprehensive search for dr. morel's successor.
results of operations we evaluate the performance of our segments based upon, among other things, segment net sales and operating profit. segment operating profit excludes general corporate costs, which include executive and director compensation, stock-based compensation, adjustments to annual incentive plan expense for over- or under-attainment of targets, certain pension and other retirement benefit costs, and other corporate facilities and administrative expenses not allocated to the segments. also excluded are items that management considers not representative of ongoing operations. such items are referred to as other unallocated items and generally include restructuring and related charges, certain asset impairments and other specifically-identified income or expense items.
percentages in the following tables and throughout the results of operations section may reflect rounding adjustments.

packaging systems - packaging systems' gross profit increased by $7.6 million, or 2.1%, in 2014, despite an unfavorable foreign currency impact of $2.3 million. packaging systems' gross margin decreased by 0.1 margin points in 2014, as lower raw material costs and moderate sales price and product mix improvements were offset by increased employee compensation, laboratory and engineering costs.
delivery systems - delivery systems' gross profit increased by $5.5 million, or 7.5%, in 2014. delivery systems' gross margin remained constant at 19.6%, as margin improvements from the increased proportion of proprietary products sold were offset by higher depreciation and overhead costs for these programs, as well as start-up costs on new contract manufacturing products.
consolidated gross profit increased by $47.0 million, or 12.1%, in 2013, including a favorable foreign currency impact of $3.1 million. consolidated gross margin increased by 1.2 margin points in 2013.
packaging systems - packaging systems' gross profit increased by $43.0 million, or 13.5%, in 2013, including a favorable foreign currency impact of $2.8 million. packaging systems' gross margin increased by 1.5 margin points in 2013, primarily as a result of sales price increases and an improved product mix, which increased packaging systems' gross margin by 2.3 margin points. these favorable items were partially offset by the impact of increased compensation and plant overhead costs in excess of efficiency gains, which combined to decrease packaging systems' gross margin by 0.8 margin points.
delivery systems - delivery systems' gross profit increased by $4.0 million, or 5.8%, in 2013, including a favorable foreign currency impact of $0.3 million. delivery systems' gross margin decreased by 0.1 margin points in 2013, as the impact of increased compensation and raw material costs in excess of efficiency improvements combined to decrease delivery systems' gross margin by 1.4 margin points. these unfavorable items were largely offset by the impact of sales price increases and an improved product mix, which increased delivery systems' gross margin by 1.3 margin points.
research and development ("r&d") costs the following table presents r&d costs, consolidated and by reportable segment:
year ended december 31,                             % change

consolidated sg&a costs decreased by $6.2 million, or 2.6%, in 2014, including the impact of foreign currency, which decreased sg&a costs by $0.9 million. consolidated sg&a costs for 2014 and 2013 were 16.1% and 17.2%, respectively, of consolidated net sales for 2014 and 2013.
packaging systems - packaging systems' sg&a costs increased by $1.7 million, or 1.3%, in 2014, as a result of increased compensation costs for wage increases and additional marketing and sales personnel in asia, partially offset by a decrease in consulting costs and foreign currency effects.
delivery systems - delivery systems' sg&a costs increased by $2.8 million, or 6.6%, in 2014, as a result of incremental business development costs and depreciation and amortization expense.
corporate - corporate's sg&a costs decreased by $10.7 million, or 16.7%, in 2014, due to a decrease in u.s. pension expense mostly resulting from the amortization of actuarial gains and losses and a decrease in incentive compensation costs.
consolidated sg&a costs increased by $16.8 million, or 7.7%, in 2013, including the impact of foreign currency, which increased sg&a costs by $0.5 million. consolidated sg&a costs for both 2013 and 2012 were 17.2% of consolidated net sales for 2013 and 2012.
packaging systems - packaging systems' sg&a costs increased by $11.7 million, or 10.0%, in 2013, as a result of increased compensation costs mainly related to merit and headcount increases, particularly in asia, incremental consulting costs for supply chain initiatives and information technology projects, incentive compensation cost increases, and foreign currency effects, which increased sg&a costs by $0.4 million.
delivery systems - delivery systems' sg&a costs increased by $5.6 million, or 15.1%, in 2013, as a result of increased compensation costs, incremental legal, sales and marketing costs, and foreign currency effects, which increased sg&a costs by $0.1 million.
corporate - corporate's sg&a costs decreased by $0.5 million, or 0.8%, in 2013, as decreases in outside services and pension costs were mostly offset by increased stock-based compensation expense. the increase in stock-based compensation expense was due to increased performance-based achievement levels and the impact of higher share prices on our incentive and deferred compensation plan liabilities, which are indexed to our share price.
(income) expense                                                   year ended december 31,                                 % change

other income and expense items, consisting primarily of foreign exchange transaction gains and losses, gains and losses on the sale of fixed assets, development income, contingent consideration costs, and miscellaneous income and charges, are generally recorded within segment results.
packaging systems - packaging systems' other (income) expense changed by $1.3 million in 2014, due to foreign exchange transaction gains, partially offset by an increase in losses on miscellaneous fixed asset disposals.
delivery systems - delivery systems' other income decreased by $0.4 million in 2014, due to foreign exchange transaction losses and a decrease in development income, partially offset by an increase in gains on miscellaneous fixed asset disposals.
since february 2013, when the venezuelan government announced a devaluation of the bolivar, we have used the official exchange rate of 6.3 bolivars to the u.s. dollar to re-measure our venezuelan subsidiary's financial statements in u.s. dollars. from december 2013 through february 2015, the venezuelan government announced a series of changes to the regulations governing its currency exchange market, which included the expanded use of one currency exchange mechanism and the creation of two additional currency exchange mechanisms. as the majority of our currency purchases are transacted at the official exchange rate of 6.3 bolivars per u.s. dollar, we have continued to re-measure our venezuelan subsidiary's financial statements using the official exchange rate. at december 31, 2014, we had $2.0 million in net monetary assets denominated in venezuelan bolivars, including $1.4 million in cash and cash equivalents. use of the official exchange rate has been restricted by the venezuelan government to companies providing critical supplies, such as food and medicine, and there is no guarantee that we will have access to the official exchange rate in the future. if we are no longer able to use the official exchange rate in the future, if we determine that we should use one of the other currency exchange mechanisms in venezuela in the future, or if there is a significant devaluation in the official exchange rate, a pre-tax charge up to the amount of our venezuelan subsidiary's net monetary assets denominated in bolivars could be required. we will continue to actively monitor the political and economic developments in venezuela.
consolidated other (income) expense changed by $1.8 million, or 138.5%, in 2013.
packaging systems - packaging systems' other expense decreased by $0.6 million, or 40.0%, in 2013, primarily due to a decrease in losses on miscellaneous fixed asset disposals, partially offset by an increase in foreign exchange transaction losses.
delivery systems - delivery systems' other income decreased by $5.1 million, or 77.3%, in 2013, primarily due to a decrease in development income.
corporate - corporate other expense (income) changed by $0.4 million, or 133.3%, in 2013, primarily due to a decrease in miscellaneous income and a gain on miscellaneous fixed asset disposals in 2012.
unallocated items - during 2012, we recorded restructuring and related charges of $2.1 million, an impairment charge of $3.4 million, and an increase in acquisition-related contingencies of $1.2 million. beginning in 2013, contingent consideration costs are included within delivery systems' results.
operating profit the following table presents operating profit (loss), consolidated and by reportable segment, corporate and unallocated items:

consolidated operating profit margin        12.8    %             11.9    %             10.7    %
consolidated operating profit increased by $19.6 million, or 12.1%, in 2014, despite an unfavorable foreign currency impact of $1.4 million. consolidated operating profit margin increased by 0.9 margin points in 2014.
packaging systems - packaging systems' operating profit increased by $6.0 million, or 2.8%, in 2014, despite an unfavorable foreign currency impact of $1.4 million, due to the factors described above.
delivery systems - delivery systems' operating profit increased by $4.1 million, or 43.6%, in 2014, due to the factors described above.
corporate - corporate costs decreased by $10.7 million, or 16.7%, in 2014, due to the factors described above.
consolidated operating profit increased by $27.3 million, or 20.2%, in 2013, including a favorable foreign currency impact of $2.4 million. consolidated operating profit margin increased by 1.2 margin points in 2013.
packaging systems - packaging systems' operating profit increased by $29.5 million, or 15.7%, in 2013, including a favorable foreign currency impact of $2.2 million, due to the factors described above.
delivery systems - delivery systems' operating profit decreased by $9.0 million, or 48.9%, in 2013, despite a favorable foreign currency impact of $0.2 million, due to the factors described above.
corporate - corporate costs decreased by $0.1 million, or 0.2%, in 2013, due to the factors described above.
unallocated items - during 2012, we recorded restructuring and related charges of $2.1 million, an impairment charge of $3.4 million, and an increase in acquisition-related contingencies of $1.2 million. beginning in 2013, contingent consideration costs are included within delivery systems' results.
loss on debt extinguishment during the year ended december 31, 2014, we repurchased the remaining $0.6 million in aggregate principal amount of our 4.00% convertible junior subordinated debentures due march 15, 2047 (the "convertible debentures"), resulting in a pre-tax loss on debt extinguishment of less than $0.1 million.
during the year ended december 31, 2013, we repurchased $2.5 million in aggregate principal amount of our convertible debentures, resulting in a pre-tax loss on debt extinguishment of $0.2 million, the majority of which consisted of the premium over par value.
during the year ended december 31, 2012, we recognized a pre-tax loss on debt extinguishment of $11.6 million related to our repurchase of $158.4 million of our convertible debentures, which consisted of a $6.2 million premium over par value, $4.4 million write-off of unamortized debt issuance costs and $1.0 million in transaction costs.
year ended december 31,                               % change
capitalized interest       (1.6    )           (1.6    )           (1.9    )            -   %          (15.8     )%
interest expense, net, decreased by $2.1 million, or 13.9%, in 2014, primarily due to $1.6 million in interest income following the settlement of a tax matter in brazil and lower interest expense resulting from less debt outstanding during 2014.
interest expense, net, increased by $0.2 million, or 1.3%, in 2013, primarily due to a decrease in capitalized interest, as less capital projects were in progress in 2013, as compared to 2012. interest expense was constant at $18.6 million for both 2013 and 2012, as the impact of the higher interest rate associated with the five-year team loan that we entered into in 2013 was offset by the impact of less debt outstanding during 2013.
income taxes the provision for income taxes was $47.2 million, $40.2 million, and $32.7 million for the years 2014, 2013, and 2012, respectively, resulting in effective tax rates of 28.0%, 27.4%, and 30.2%, respectively.
the increase in the effective tax rate for 2014 reflects changes in our geographic mix of earnings and the impact of the discrete tax items discussed below.
during 2014, we recorded a discrete tax charge of $1.0 million resulting from the impact of a change in apportionment factors on state tax rates applied to items in other comprehensive income and a discrete tax charge of $0.8 million as a result of the finalization of estimates of foreign tax credits available with respect to a repatriation of cash from our subsidiaries in israel.
the decrease in the effective tax rate for 2013 reflects the nondeductibility of the purchase premium paid during 2012 related to the extinguishment of our convertible debentures and the impact of the discrete tax items discussed below.
during 2013, we recorded a discrete tax charge of $3.5 million, which related to the finalization of a beneficial agreement with local tax authorities in israel that clarified the future tax status of our entities in israel and settled a tax audit for the years 2009 through 2011. during 2013, we also recorded a discrete tax charge of $1.3 million resulting from the impact of the change in the enacted tax rate in the united kingdom on our previously-recorded deferred tax asset balances and a discrete tax benefit of $1.3 million related to the research and development tax credit for activities completed in 2012. in accordance with u.s. gaap, although the american taxpayer relief act of 2012 (the "taxpayer relief act") reinstated the tax credit on a retroactive basis to january 1, 2012, the credit was not taken into account for financial reporting purposes until 2013. had the act been signed prior to january 2013, our effective tax rate for 2012 would have been reduced by approximately 1.0%.
during 2012, as a result of the finalization of estimates of foreign tax credits available with respect to a dividend from one of our foreign subsidiaries, we recorded a discrete tax charge of $1.0 million. we also recorded a discrete tax charge of $0.8 million resulting from the impact of a change in the enacted tax rate in the united kingdom on our previously-recorded deferred tax balances and recorded a discrete tax charge of $0.3 million reduction of our deferred tax assets associated with the legal restructuring of the ownership of our puerto rico operations.
as of december 31, 2014, we had $6.9 million of total gross unrecognized tax benefits, of which $6.8 million, if recognized, would favorably impact the effective income tax rate. it is reasonably possible that, due to the expiration of statutes and the closing of tax audits, the liability for unrecognized tax benefits may be reduced by approximately $0.3 million during the next twelve months, which would favorably impact our effective tax rate.
equity in net income of affiliated companies equity in net income of affiliated companies represents the contribution to earnings from our 25% ownership interest in daikyo and our 49% ownership interest in four companies in mexico. equity in net income of affiliated companies was $5.3 million, $5.4 million, and $4.8 million for the years 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. equity in net income of affiliated companies decreased by $0.1 million, or 1.9%, in 2014, as an unfavorable foreign currency impact on daikyo's results was partially offset by favorable operating results in mexico. equity in net income of affiliated companies increased by $0.6 million, or 12.5%, in 2013, primarily due to favorable operating results in mexico.
purchases from, and royalty payments made to, affiliates totaled $68.7 million in 2014, $67.7 million in 2013, and $75.2 million in 2012, the majority of which related to a distributorship agreement with daikyo that allows us to purchase and re-sell daikyo products. sales to affiliates were $5.1 million, $5.9 million, and $3.5 million in 2014, 2013, and 2012, respectively.
net income net income in 2014 was $127.1 million, or $1.75 per diluted share, compared to $112.3 million, or $1.57 per diluted share, in 2013. our 2014 results included the impact of a charge for license costs associated with acquired in-process research of $0.8 million (net of $0.4 million in tax) and discrete tax charges of $1.8 million.
net income in 2013 was $112.3 million, or $1.57 per diluted share, compared to $80.7 million, or $1.15 per diluted share, in 2012. our 2013 results included the impact of a loss on extinguishment of debt of $0.2 million and net discrete tax charges of $3.6 million.
net income in 2012 was $80.7 million, or $1.15 per diluted share, compared to $75.5 million, or $1.08 per diluted share, in 2011. our 2012 results included the impact of restructuring and related charges of $1.4 million (net of $0.7 million in tax), an impairment charge of $2.1 million (net of $1.3 million in tax), an increase in acquisition-related contingencies of $1.0 million (net of $0.2 million in tax), a loss on extinguishment of debt of $9.8 million (net of $1.8 million in tax) and discrete tax charges of $2.1 million.
financial condition, liquidity and capital resources cash flows the following table presents cash flow data for the years ended december 31:
net cash provided by operating activities      $182.9              $220.5              $187.4
net cash provided by operating activities
net cash provided by operating activities was $182.9 million in 2014, a decrease of $37.6 million from 2013. net cash provided by operating activities decreased in 2014 due to a $27.2 million increase in pension plan contributions and our receipt of a nonrefundable customer payment of $20.0 million in june 2013 in return for the exclusive use of smartdose within a specific therapeutic area.
net cash provided by operating activities was $220.5 million in 2013, an increase of $33.1 million from 2012. net cash provided by operating activities increased in 2013 primarily due to the increase in net income and our receipt of a nonrefundable customer payment of $20.0 million in june 2013 in return for the exclusive use of smartdose within a specific therapeutic area, both of which were partially offset by higher working capital requirements and the timing of other payments.
net cash used in investing activities was $104.0 million in 2014, a decrease of $45.9 million from 2013. net cash used in investing activities decreased in 2014 due to a $40.0 million decrease in capital spending, to $111.9 million, mainly as the construction of our corporate office and research building was completed in february 2013. the majority of the capital spending for 2014 related to new products, expansion activity, and emerging markets, including projects in the u.s., europe, china and india.
in october 2014, we announced plans to expand our global manufacturing operations to include a new facility in waterford, ireland, which will produce packaging components for insulin injector cartridges and other high-value packaging components. construction is planned to begin in 2015, subject to the project obtaining requisite planning and zoning approvals.
net cash used in investing activities was $149.9 million in 2013, an increase of $33.9 million from 2012. net cash used in investing activities increased in 2013 primarily due to a $20.6 million increase in capital spending, to $151.9 million, in 2013. the majority of the increased capital spending was related to construction of our corporate office and research building, which began in 2011 and settled in february 2013, construction of our new rubber and metal manufacturing facility in india, and various capital projects related to new products, expansion activity, and emerging markets. net cash used in investing activities also increased in 2013 due to the change in our short-term investment activity. during 2013, we sold $19.1 million, and purchased $14.2 million, of short-term investments. during 2012, we sold $45.6 million, and purchased $31.2 million, of short-term investments. the short-term investments represent certificates of deposit, primarily in israel, with maturities between ninety-one days and one year at the time of purchase.
net cash used in financing activities was $30.8 million in 2014, an increase of $25.7 million from 2013. net cash used in financing activities for 2014 increased primarily due to an increase in net repayments of debt and a $7.4 million decrease in proceeds from the exercise of stock options and stock appreciation rights.
on october 29, 2014, our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to $100.0 million of our common stock from time to time on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions as permitted under the regulations of the securities and exchange commission. the extent to which we repurchase the shares and the timing of any repurchases will be determined by us based on our evaluation of market conditions and other factors. the program is expected to be completed no later than december 31, 2015. as of december 31, 2014, no shares had been repurchased under the program.
net cash used in financing activities was $5.1 million in 2013, an increase of $1.7 million from 2012. net cash used in financing activities for 2013 increased primarily due to a reduction in our net debt activity, partially offset by a $13.0 million increase in proceeds from exercises of stock options and stock appreciation rights, as compared to 2012. during 2013, upon settlement of our corporate office and research building, we borrowed $42.8 million under a revolving credit facility, which was immediately converted to a five-year term loan due january 2018. a portion of the loan was used to pay the $35.3 million in outstanding obligations at december 31, 2012 related to the construction and acquisition of the building. during 2013, we also entered into euro-denominated debt under our multi-currency revolving credit facility and used a portion of our multi-currency revolving credit facility to repay our euro note a that matured on february 27, 2013. during 2013, we also repurchased $2.5 million in aggregate principal amount of our convertible debentures. during 2012, we used our multi-currency revolving credit facility to fund our repurchase of $158.4 million of our convertible debentures and we incurred debt issuance costs of $7.5 million, which primarily consisted of the settlement payment made by us for two treasury lock agreements that we entered into and subsequently terminated.
liquidity and capital resources the table below presents selected liquidity and capital measures as of:
working capital                             $406.8                      $413.8
net debt-to-total invested capital             7.8       %   13.7                    %
cash and cash equivalents include all instruments that have maturities of ninety days or less when purchased. short-term investments include all instruments that have maturities between ninety-one days and one year at the time of purchase. working capital is defined as current assets less current liabilities. net debt is defined as total debt less cash and cash equivalents, and total invested capital is defined as the sum of net debt and total equity.
cash and cash equivalents - our cash and cash equivalents balance at december 31, 2014 consisted of cash held in depository accounts with banks around the world and cash invested in high-quality, short-term investments. the cash and cash equivalents balance at december 31, 2014 included $47.2 million of cash held by subsidiaries within the u.s., and $208.1 million of cash held by subsidiaries outside of the u.s., primarily in germany and singapore, which is available to fund operations and growth of non-u.s. subsidiaries. repatriating the cash into the u.s. could trigger u.s. federal, state and local income tax obligations, however, we may temporarily access cash held by our non-u.s. subsidiaries without becoming subject to u.s. income tax by entering into short-term intercompany loans.
working capital - working capital at december 31, 2014 decreased by $7.0 million, or 1.7%, during 2014, as compared to 2013, including a decrease of $35.9 million due to foreign currency translation. excluding the impact of currency exchange rates, cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable and inventories increased by $48.1 million, $5.9 million and $16.2 million, respectively, and total current liabilities increased by $28.1 million. accounts receivable turnover measurements improved between december 31, 2013 and december 31, 2014, while inventory turnover measurements remained consistent. the increase in current liabilities was primarily due to the reclassification of our series b notes from long-term debt to current liabilities.
debt and credit facilities - the $36.8 million decrease in total debt at december 31, 2014, as compared to december 31, 2013, resulted from net repayments of $22.9 million and foreign currency rate fluctuations of $13.9 million.
our sources of liquidity include our multi-currency revolving credit facility, which expires in april 2017 and contains a $300.0 million committed credit facility and an accordion feature allowing the maximum to be increased through a term loan to $350.0 million upon approval by the banks. borrowings under the revolving credit facility bear interest at a rate equal to one-month london interbank offering rates ("libor") plus a margin ranging from 1.25 to 2.25 percentage points, which is based on the ratio of our senior debt to modified earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization ("ebitda"). at december 31, 2014, we had $29.7 million in outstanding borrowings under this facility, of which $4.2 million was denominated in yen and $25.5 million was denominated in euro. the total amount outstanding at december 31, 2014 and 2013 was classified as long-term. these borrowings, together with outstanding letters of credit of $3.5 million, resulted in a borrowing capacity available under this facility of $266.8 million at december 31, 2014. we do not expect any significant limitations on our ability to access this source of funds.
pursuant to the financial covenants in our debt agreements, we are required to maintain established interest coverage ratios and to not exceed established leverage ratios. in addition, the agreements contain other customary covenants, none of which we consider restrictive to our operations. at december 31, 2014, we were in compliance with all of our debt covenants, and we expect to continue to be in compliance with the terms of these agreements throughout 2015.
we believe that cash on hand and cash generated from operations, together with availability under our multi-currency revolving credit facility, will be adequate to address our foreseeable liquidity needs based on our current expectations of our business operations, capital expenditures and scheduled payments of debt obligations.
commitments and contractual obligations the following table summarizes our contractual obligations and commitments at december 31, 2014. these obligations are not expected to have a material impact on liquidity.
capital lease obligations                                      0.2                   -                 0.2                 -                     -
operating lease obligations                                   63.0                10.3                14.2               7.9                  30.6
(1)   our business creates a need to enter into various commitments with suppliers. in accordance with u.s. gaap, these purchase obligations are not reflected in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. these purchase commitments do not exceed our projected requirements and are in the normal course of business.
(2)   for fixed-rate long-term debt, interest was based on principal amounts and fixed coupon rates at year end. future interest payments on variable-rate debt were calculated using principal amounts and the applicable ending interest rate at year end. interest on fixed-rate derivative instruments was based on notional amounts and fixed interest rates contractually obligated at year end.
(3)   represents acquisition-related contingencies. in connection with certain business acquisitions, we agreed to make payments to the sellers when and if certain operating milestones are achieved, such as sales and operating income targets.
(4)   this table does not include obligations pertaining to pension and postretirement benefits because the actual amount and timing of future contributions may vary significantly depending upon plan asset performance, benefit payments, and other factors. contributions to our plans are expected to be $24.1 million in 2015. see note 13, benefit plans, for estimated benefit payments over the next ten years.
reserves for uncertain tax positions - the table above does not include $6.9 million of total gross unrecognized tax benefits as of december 31, 2014. due to the high degree of uncertainty regarding the timing of potential cash flows, we cannot reasonably estimate the settlement periods for amounts which may be paid.
letters of credit - we have letters of credit totaling $3.5 million supporting the reimbursement of workers' compensation and other claims paid on our behalf by insurance carriers. the accrual for insurance obligations was $8.7 million at december 31, 2014, of which $4.6 million is in excess of our deductible and, therefore, is reimbursable by the insurance company.
off-balance sheet arrangements at december 31, 2014, we had no off-balance sheet financing arrangements other than operating leases, unconditional purchase obligations incurred in the ordinary course of business, and outstanding letters of credit related to various insurance programs.
critical accounting policies and estimates management's discussion and analysis addresses consolidated financial statements that are prepared in accordance with u.s. gaap. the application of these principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions, some of which are subjective and complex, that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements. we believe the following accounting policies and estimates are critical to understanding and evaluating our results of operations and financial position:
revenue recognition: revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of a sales arrangement exists, title and risk of loss have transferred, the selling price is fixed or determinable, and collectability is reasonably assured. generally, sales are recognized upon shipment or upon delivery to our customers' site, based upon shipping terms or legal requirements. some customers receive pricing rebates upon attaining established sales volumes. we record rebate costs when sales occur based on our assessment of the likelihood that the required volumes will be attained. we also maintain an allowance for product returns, as we believe that we are able to reasonably estimate the amount of returns based on our substantial historical experience.
impairment of long-lived assets: long-lived assets, including property, plant and equipment, are tested for impairment whenever circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable. an asset is considered impaired if the carrying value of the asset exceeds the sum of the future expected undiscounted cash flows to be derived from the asset. once an asset is considered impaired, an impairment loss is recorded within other (income) expense for the difference between the asset's carrying value and its fair value. for assets held and used in the business, management determines fair value using estimated future cash flows to be derived from the asset, discounted to a net present value using an appropriate discount rate. for assets held for sale or for investment purposes, management determines fair value by estimating the proceeds to be received upon sale of the asset, less disposition costs.
during 2012, as a result of continuing delays and lower-than-expected demand, we updated the sales projections related to one of our delivery systems' product lines. the revised projections triggered an impairment review of the associated assets. our review concluded that the estimated fair value of the product line no longer exceeded the carrying value of the related assembly equipment and intangible asset and, therefore, an impairment charge of $3.4 million was recorded, $3.2 million of which was for the related assembly equipment. we estimated the fair value of the asset group using an income approach based on discounted cash flows.
impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets: goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are tested for impairment at least annually, following the completion of our annual budget and long-range planning process, or whenever circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable. goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level, which is the same as, or one level below, our operating segments. recent accounting guidance allows entities to first assess qualitative factors, including macroeconomic conditions, industry and market considerations, cost factors, and overall financial performance, to determine whether it is necessary to perform the first step of the two-step quantitative goodwill impairment test. we considered this guidance when performing our annual impairment testing, but elected to continue utilizing the two-step quantitative impairment test. the first step in the two-step test is to compare the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying amount, including goodwill. if the carrying amount exceeds fair value, the second step must be performed. the second step requires the comparison of the carrying amount of the goodwill to its implied fair value, which is calculated as if the reporting unit had just been acquired as of the testing date. any excess of the carrying amount of goodwill over the implied fair value would represent an impairment loss. considerable management judgment is necessary to estimate fair value. amounts and assumptions used in our goodwill impairment test, such as future sales, future cash flows and long-term growth rates, are consistent with internal projections and operating plans. amounts and assumptions used in our goodwill impairment test are also largely dependent on the continued sale of drug products delivered by injection and the packaging of drug products, as well as our timeliness and success in new-product innovation or the development and commercialization of proprietary multi-component systems. changes in the estimate of fair value, including the estimate of future cash flows, could have a material impact on our future results of operations and financial position. no impairment in the carrying value of our reporting units was evident as a result of our annual review of goodwill. with the exception of our delivery systems' europe reporting unit, which had a fair value in
excess of its carrying value of 23% and which is largely dependent on the continued and anticipated demand for certain of its contract manufacturing and proprietary safety systems products, each of our reporting units whose assets included goodwill had a fair value in excess of its respective carrying value of at least 32%. at december 31, 2014, the goodwill associated with the delivery systems' europe reporting unit equaled $8.6 million, or 7.9% of our total goodwill.
certain trademarks have been determined to have indefinite lives and, therefore, are not subject to amortization. similar to the impairment testing for goodwill, there is an option to first assess qualitative factors as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform a quantitative impairment test. we considered this option when performing our impairment testing, but elected to continue utilizing a quantitative test, comparing the fair value and carrying value of the asset. any excess carrying value would represent an impairment loss. fair values are determined using discounted cash flow analyses.
intangible assets with finite lives are amortized using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives, and reviewed for impairment whenever circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable.
as discussed above, during 2012, an impairment charge of $3.4 million was recorded as the estimated fair value of one of our delivery systems' product lines no longer exceeded the carrying value of the related assembly equipment and intangible asset. the impairment charge for the intangible asset was $0.2 million. see above for further discussion.
employee benefits: we maintain funded and unfunded defined benefit pension plans in the u.s. and a number of other countries that cover employees who meet eligibility requirements. in addition, we sponsor postretirement benefit plans which provide healthcare benefits for eligible employees who retire or become disabled. the measurement of annual cost and obligations under these defined benefit postretirement plans is subject to a number of assumptions, which are specific for each of our u.s. and foreign plans. the assumptions, which are reviewed at least annually, are relevant to both the plan assets (where applicable) and the obligation for benefits that will ultimately be provided to our employees. two of the most critical assumptions in determining pension and retiree medical plan expense are the discount rate and expected long-term rate of return on plan assets. other assumptions reflect demographic factors such as retirement age, rates of compensation increases, mortality and turnover and are evaluated periodically and updated to reflect our actual experience. for our funded plans, we consider the current and expected asset allocations of our plan assets, as well as historical and expected rates of return in estimating the long-term rate of return on plan assets. under u.s. gaap, differences between actual and expected results are generally accumulated in other comprehensive income (loss) as actuarial gains or losses and subsequently amortized into earnings over future periods.
changes in key assumptions could have a material impact on our future results of operations and financial position. we estimate that every 25 basis point reduction in our long-term rate of return assumption would increase pension expense by $0.6 million, and every 25 basis point reduction in our discount rate would increase pension expense by $0.6 million. a decrease in the discount rate increases the present value of benefit obligations. our net pension underfunded balance at december 31, 2014 was $76.2 million, compared to $76.1 million at december 31, 2013. our underfunded balance for other postretirement benefits was $10.1 million at december 31, 2014, compared to $9.2 million at december 31, 2013.
in october 2014, the society of actuaries released final reports containing new mortality tables and an improvement scale that suggested significant mortality improvements. after an analysis of our actual mortality experience, we adopted the rp-2014 mortality table without collar adjustment and applied scale bb 2-dimensional mortality improvements. this adoption increased our u.s. benefit obligations by $6.1 million at december 31, 2014.
income taxes: we estimate income taxes payable based upon current domestic and international tax legislation. in addition, deferred income tax assets and liabilities are established to recognize differences between the tax basis and financial statement carrying values of assets and liabilities. we maintain valuation allowances where it is more likely than not that all or a portion of a deferred tax asset will not be realized. the recoverability of tax assets is subject to our estimates of future profitability, generally at the respective subsidiary company and country level. changes in tax legislation, business plans and other factors may affect the ultimate recoverability of tax assets or final tax payments, which could result in adjustments to tax expense in the period such change is determined.
when accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in our financial statements, we apply a more-likely-than-not threshold for financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return.
contingent consideration the fair value of the contingent consideration liability related to smartdose ("smartdose contingent consideration") was initially determined using a probability-weighted income approach, and is revalued at each reporting date or more frequently if circumstances dictate. changes in the fair value of this obligation are recorded as income or expense within other (income) expense in our consolidated statements of income. the significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement of the contingent consideration are the sales projections, the probability of success factors, and the discount rate. significant increases or decreases in any of those inputs in isolation would result in a significantly lower or higher fair value measurement. as development and commercialization of smartdose progresses, we may need to update the sales projections, the probability of success factors, and the discount rate used. this could result in a material increase or decrease to the contingent consideration liability.
see note 1, summary of significant accounting policies and note 2, new accounting standards, to our consolidated financial statements for additional information on accounting and reporting standards considered in the preparation and presentation of our financial statements.

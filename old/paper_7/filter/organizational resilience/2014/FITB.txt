managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contractual obligations and other commitments the bancorp has certain obligations and commitments to make future payments under contracts. the aggregate contractual obligations and commitments at december 31, 2014 are shown in table 63. as of december 31, 2014, the bancorp has unrecognized tax benefits that, if recognized, would impact the effective tax rate in future periods. due to the uncertainty of the amounts to be ultimately paid as well as the timing of such payments, all uncertain tax liabilities that have not been paid have been excluded from the contractual obligations and other commitments table. for further detail on the impact of income taxes refer to note 20 of the notes to consolidated financial statements.

83  fifth third bancorp reports of independent registered public accounting firm to the shareholders and board of directors of fifth third bancorp:
we have audited the internal control over financial reporting of fifth third bancorp and subsidiaries (the bancorp) as of december 31, 2014, based on criteria established in internal control  integrated framework (2013) issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission. the bancorps management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying managements assessment as to the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. our responsibility is to express an opinion on the bancorps internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.
we conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board (united states). those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. we believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
a companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the companys principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by the companys board of directors, management, and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. a companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. also, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
in our opinion, the bancorp maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of december 31, 2014, based on the criteria established in internal control integrated framework (2013) issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission.
we have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board (united states), the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended december 31, 2014 of the bancorp and our report dated february 25, 2015 expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements.
to the shareholders and board of directors of fifth third bancorp:
we have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of fifth third bancorp and subsidiaries (the bancorp) as of december 31, 2014 and 2013, and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended december 31, 2014. these consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the bancorps management. our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits.
we conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board (united states). those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. an audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. an audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. we believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
in our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of fifth third bancorp and subsidiaries as of december 31, 2014 and 2013, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended december 31, 2014, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america.
we have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board (united states), the bancorps internal control over financial reporting as of december 31, 2014, based on the criteria established in internal controlintegrated framework (2013) issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission and our report dated february 25, 2015 expressed an unqualified opinion on the bancorps internal control over financial reporting.

89  fifth third bancorp notes to consolidated financial statements
1. summary of significant accounting and reporting policies nature of operations fifth third bancorp, an ohio corporation, conducts its principal lending, deposit gathering, transaction processing and service advisory activities through its banking and non-banking subsidiaries from banking centers located throughout the midwestern and southeastern regions of the united states.
basis of presentation the consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the bancorp and its majority-owned subsidiaries and vies in which the bancorp has been determined to be the primary beneficiary. other entities, including certain joint ventures, in which the bancorp has the ability to exercise significant influence over operating and financial policies of the investee, but upon which the bancorp does not possess control, are accounted for by the equity method of accounting and not consolidated. the investments in those entities in which the bancorp does not have the ability to exercise significant influence are generally carried at the lower of cost or fair value. intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated.
use of estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with u.s. gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. actual results could differ from those estimates.
cash and due from banks cash and due from banks consist of currency and coin, cash items in the process of collection and due from banks. currency and coin includes both u.s. and foreign currency owned and held at fifth third offices and that is in-transit to the frb. cash items in the process of collection include checks and drafts that are drawn on another depository institution or the frb that are payable immediately upon presentation in the u.s. balances due from banks include non-interest bearing balances that are funds on deposit at other depository institutions or the frb.
securities securities are classified as held-to-maturity, available-for-sale or trading on the date of purchase. only those securities which management has the intent and ability to hold to maturity are classified as held-to-maturity and reported at amortized cost. securities are classified as available-for-sale when, in managements judgment, they may be sold in response to, or in anticipation of, changes in market conditions. securities are classified as trading when bought and held principally for the purpose of selling them in the near term. available-for-sale securities are reported at fair value with unrealized gains and losses, net of related deferred income taxes, included in oci. trading securities are reported at fair value with unrealized gains and losses included in noninterest income. the fair value of a security is determined based on quoted market prices. if quoted market prices are not available, fair value is determined based on quoted prices of similar instruments or dcf models that incorporate market inputs and assumptions including discount rates, prepayment speeds, and loss rates. realized securities gains or losses are reported within noninterest income in the consolidated statements of income. the cost of securities sold is based on the specific identification method.
available-for-sale and held-to-maturity securities with unrealized losses are reviewed quarterly for possible otti. for debt securities, if the bancorp intends to sell the debt security or will more likely than not be required to sell the debt security before recovery of the entire amortized cost basis, then an otti has occurred. however, even if the bancorp does not intend to sell the debt security and will not likely be required to sell the debt security before recovery of its entire amortized cost basis, the bancorp must evaluate expected cash flows to be received and determine if a credit loss has occurred. in the event of a credit loss, the credit component of the impairment is recognized within noninterest income and the non-credit component is recognized through oci. for equity securities, the bancorps management evaluates the securities in an unrealized loss position in the available-for-sale portfolio for otti on the basis of the duration of the decline in value of the security and severity of that decline as well as the bancorps intent and ability to hold these securities for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in the market value. if it is determined that the impairment on an equity security is other-than-temporary, an impairment loss equal to the difference between the amortized cost of the security and its fair value is recognized within noninterest income.
portfolio loans and leases basis of accounting portfolio loans and leases are generally reported at the principal amount outstanding, net of unearned income, deferred loan fees and costs, and any direct principal charge-offs. direct loan origination fees and costs are deferred and the net amount is amortized over the estimated life of the related loans as a yield adjustment. interest income is recognized based on the principal balance outstanding computed using the effective interest method.
loans acquired by the bancorp through a purchase business combination are recorded at fair value as of the acquisition date. the bancorp does not carry over the acquired companys alll, nor does the bancorp add to its existing alll as part of purchase accounting.
purchased loans are evaluated for evidence of credit deterioration at acquisition and recorded at their initial fair value. for loans acquired with no evidence of credit deterioration, the fair value discount or premium is amortized over the contractual life of the loan as an adjustment to yield. for loans acquired with evidence of credit deterioration, the bancorp determines at the acquisition date the excess of the loans contractually required payments over all cash flows expected to be collected as an amount that should not be accreted into interest income (nonaccretable difference). the remaining amount representing the difference in the expected cash flows of acquired loans and the initial investment in the acquired loans is accreted into interest income over the remaining life of the loan or pool of loans (accretable yield). subsequent to the acqusition date, increases in expected cash flows over those expected at the acquisition date are recognized prospectively as interest income over the remaining life of the loan. the present value of any decreases in expected cash flows resulting directly from a change in the contractual interest rate are recognized prospectively as a reduction of the accretable yield. the present value of any decreases in expected cash flows after the acquisition date as a result of credit deterioration is recognized by recording an alll or a direct charge-off. subsequent to the purchase date, the methods utilized to estimate the required alll are similar to originated loans. loans carried at fair value, mortgage loans held for sale and loans under revolving credit agreements are excluded from the scope of this guidance on loans acquired with deteriorated credit quality.
the bancorps lease portfolio consists of both direct financing and leveraged leases. direct financing leases are carried at the aggregate of lease payments plus estimated residual value of the leased property, less unearned income. interest income on direct
90 fifth third bancorp notes to consolidated financial statements financing leases is recognized over the term of the lease to achieve a constant periodic rate of return on the outstanding investment.
leveraged leases are carried at the aggregate of lease payments (less nonrecourse debt payments) plus estimated residual value of the leased property, less unearned income. interest income on leveraged leases is recognized over the term of the lease to achieve a constant rate of return on the outstanding investment in the lease, net of the related deferred income tax liability, in the years in which the net investment is positive.
nonaccrual loans and leases when a loan is placed on nonaccrual status, the accrual of interest, amortization of loan premium, accretion of loan discount, and amortization/accretion of deferred net loan fees are discontinued and all previously accrued and unpaid interest is charged against income. commercial loans are placed on nonaccrual status when there is a clear indication that the borrowers cash flows may not be sufficient to meet payments as they become due. such loans are also placed on nonaccrual status when the principal or interest is past due 90 days or more, unless the loan is both well secured and in the process of collection. the bancorp classifies residential mortgage loans that have principal and interest payments that have become past due 150 days as nonaccrual unless the loan is both well secured and in the process of collection. residential mortgage loans may stay on nonperforming status for an extended time as the foreclosure process typically lasts longer than 180 days. home equity loans and lines of credit are reported on nonaccrual status if principal or interest has been in default for 90 days or more unless the loan is both well secured and in the process of collection. home equity loans and lines of credit that have been in default for 60 days or more are also reported on nonaccrual status if the senior lien has been in default 120 days or more, unless the loan is both well secured and in the process of collection. residential mortgage, home equity, automobile and other consumer loans and leases that have been modified in a tdr and subsequently become past due 90 days are placed on nonaccrual status unless the loan is both well secured and in the process of collection. commercial and credit card loans that have been modified in a tdr are classified as nonaccrual unless such loans have sustained repayment performance of six months or greater and are reasonably assured of repayment in accordance with the restructured terms. well secured loans are collateralized by perfected security interests in real and/or personal property for which the bancorp estimates proceeds from sale would be sufficient to recover the outstanding principal and accrued interest balance of the loan and pay all costs to sell the collateral. the bancorp considers a loan in the process of collection if collection efforts or legal action is proceeding and the bancorp expects to collect funds sufficient to bring the loan current or recover the entire outstanding principal and accrued interest balance.
nonaccrual commercial loans and nonaccrual credit card loans are generally accounted for on the cost recovery method. the bancorp believes the cost recovery method is appropriate for nonaccrual commercial loans and nonaccrual credit card loans because the assessment of collectability of the remaining recorded investment of these loans involves a high degree of subjectivity and uncertainty due to the nature or absence of underlying collateral. under the cost recovery method, any payments received are applied to reduce principal. once the entire recorded investment is collected, additional payments received are treated as recoveries of amounts previously charged-off until recovered in full, and any subsequent payments are treated as interest income. nonaccrual residential mortgage loans and other nonaccrual consumer loans are generally accounted for on the cash basis method. the bancorp believes the cash basis method is appropriate for nonaccrual residential mortgage and other nonaccrual consumer loans because such loans have generally been written down to estimated collateral values and the collectability of the remaining investment involves only an assessment of the fair value of the underlying collateral, which can be measured more objectively with a lesser degree of uncertainty than assessments of typical commercial loan collateral. under the cash basis method, interest income is recognized upon cash receipt to the extent to which it would have been accrued on the loans remaining balance at the contractual rate. nonaccrual loans may be returned to accrual status when all delinquent interest and principal payments become current in accordance with the loan agreement and are reasonably assured of repayment in accordance with the contractual terms of the loan agreement, or when the loan is both well-secured and in the process of collection.
commercial loans on nonaccrual status, including those modified in a tdr, as well as criticized commercial loans with aggregate borrower relationships exceeding $1 million, are subject to an individual review to identify charge-offs. the bancorp does not have an established delinquency threshold for partially or fully charging off commercial loans. residential mortgage loans, home equity loans and lines of credit and credit card loans that have principal and interest payments that have become past due 180 days are assessed for a charge-off to the alll, unless such loans are both well-secured and in the process of collection. home equity loans and lines of credit are also assessed for charge-off to the alll when such loans or lines of credit have become past due 120 days if the senior lien is also 120 days past due, unless such loans are both well-secured and in the process of collection. automobile and other consumer loans and leases that have principal and interest payments that have become past due 120 days are assessed for a charge-off to the alll, unless such loans are both well-secured and in the process of collection.
restructured loans and leases a loan is accounted for as a tdr if the bancorp, for economic or legal reasons related to the borrowers financial difficulties, grants a concession to the borrower that it would not otherwise consider. a tdr typically involves a modification of terms such as a reduction of the stated interest rate or remaining principal amount of the loan, a reduction of accrued interest, or an extension of the maturity date(s) at a stated interest rate lower than the current market rate for a new loan with similar risk. during the third quarter of 2012, the occ, a national bank regulatory agency, issued interpretive guidance that requires non-reaffirmed loans included in chapter 7 bankruptcy filings to be accounted for as nonperforming tdrs and collateral dependent loans regardless of their payment history and capacity to pay in the future. the bancorps banking subsidiary is a state chartered bank which therefore is not subject to guidance of the occ. the bancorp does not consider the bankruptcy courts discharge of the borrowers debt a concession when the discharged debt is not reaffirmed, and as such these loans are classified as tdrs only if one or more of the previously mentioned concessions are granted.
the bancorp measures the impairment loss of a tdr based on the difference between the original loans carrying amount and the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the original, effective yield of the loan. residential mortgage loans, home equity loans, automobile loans and other consumer loans modified as part of a tdr are maintained on accrual status, provided there is reasonable assurance of repayment and of performance according to the modified terms based upon a current, well-documented credit evaluation. commercial loans and credit card loans modified as part of a tdr are maintained on accrual status provided there is a sustained payment history of six-months or greater prior to the modification in accordance with the modified
91 fifth third bancorp notes to consolidated financial statements terms and all remaining contractual payments under the modified terms are reasonably assured of collection. tdrs of commercial loans and credit cards that do not have a sustained payment history of six months or greater in accordance with their modified terms remain on nonaccrual status until a six-month payment history is sustained. in certain cases, commercial tdrs on nonaccrual status may be accounted for using the cash basis method for income recognition, provided that full repayment of principal under the modified terms of the loan is reasonably assured.
impaired loans and leases a loan is considered to be impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that the bancorp will be unable to collect all amounts due (including both principal and interest) according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement. impaired loans generally consist of nonaccrual loans and leases, loans modified in a tdr and loans over $1 million that are currently on accrual status and not yet modified in a tdr, but for which the bancorp has determined that it is probable that it will grant a payment concession in the near term due to the borrowers financial difficulties. for loans modified in a tdr, the contractual terms of the loan agreement refer to the terms specified in the original loan agreement. a loan restructured in a tdr is no longer considered impaired in years after the restructuring if the restructuring agreement specifies a rate equal to or greater than the rate the bancorp was willing to accept at the time of the restructuring for a new loan with comparable risk and the loan is not impaired based on the terms specified by the restructuring agreement. refer to the alll section for discussion regarding the bancorps methodology for identifying impaired loans and determination of the need for a loss accrual.
loans held for sale loans held for sale primarily represent conforming fixed-rate residential mortgage loans originated or acquired with the intent to sell in the secondary market and jumbo residential mortgage loans, commercial loans, other residential mortgage loans and other consumer loans that management has the intent to sell. loans held for sale may be carried at the lower of cost or fair value, or carried at fair value where the bancorp has elected the fair value option of accounting under u.s. gaap. the bancorp has elected to measure residential mortgage loans originated as held for sale under the fair value option. for loans in which the bancorp has not elected the fair value option, the lower of cost or fair value is determined at the individual loan level.
the fair value of residential mortgage loans held for sale for which the fair value election has been made is estimated based upon mortgage-backed securities prices and spreads to those prices or, for certain arm loans, dcf models that may incorporate the anticipated portfolio composition, credit spreads of asset-backed securities with similar collateral, and market conditions. the anticipated portfolio composition includes the effects of interest rate spreads and discount rates due to loan characteristics such as the state in which the loan was originated, the loan amount and the arm margin. these fair value marks are recorded as a component of noninterest income in mortgage banking net revenue. the bancorp generally has commitments to sell residential mortgage loans held for sale in the secondary market. gains or losses on sales are recognized in mortgage banking net revenue.
managements intent to sell residential mortgage loans classified as held for sale may change over time due to such factors as changes in the overall liquidity in markets or changes in characteristics specific to certain loans held for sale. consequently, these loans may be reclassified to loans held for investment and, thereafter, reported within the bancorps residential mortgage class of portfolio loans and leases. in such cases, the residential mortgage loans will continue to be measured at fair value, which is based on mortgage-backed securities prices, interest rate risk and an internally developed credit component.
other real estate owned oreo, which is included in other assets, represents property acquired through foreclosure or other proceedings and is carried at the lower of cost or fair value, less costs to sell. all oreo property is periodically evaluated for impairment and decreases in carrying value are recognized as reductions in other noninterest income in the consolidated statements of income.
alll the bancorp disaggregates its portfolio loans and leases into portfolio segments for purposes of determining the alll. the bancorps portfolio segments include commercial, residential mortgage, and consumer. the bancorp further disaggregates its portfolio segments into classes for purposes of monitoring and assessing credit quality based on certain risk characteristics. classes within the commercial portfolio segment include commercial and industrial, commercial mortgage owner-occupied, commercial mortgage nonowner-occupied, commercial construction, and commercial leasing. the residential mortgage portfolio segment is also considered a class. classes within the consumer portfolio segment include home equity, automobile, credit card, and other consumer loans and leases. for an analysis of the bancorps alll by portfolio segment and credit quality information by class, refer to note 6.
the bancorp maintains the alll to absorb probable loan and lease losses inherent in its portfolio segments. the alll is maintained at a level the bancorp considers to be adequate and is based on ongoing quarterly assessments and evaluations of the collectability and historical loss experience of loans and leases. credit losses are charged and recoveries are credited to the alll. provisions for loan and lease losses are based on the bancorps review of the historical credit loss experience and such factors that, in managements judgment, deserve consideration under existing economic conditions in estimating probable credit losses. the bancorps strategy for credit risk management includes a combination of conservative exposure limits significantly below legal lending limits and conservative underwriting, documentation and collections standards. the strategy also emphasizes diversification on a geographic, industry and customer level, regular credit examinations and quarterly management reviews of large credit exposures and loans experiencing deterioration of credit quality.
the bancorps methodology for determining the alll is based on historical loss rates, current credit grades, specific allocation on loans modified in a tdr and impaired commercial credits above specified thresholds and other qualitative adjustments. allowances on individual commercial loans, tdrs and historical loss rates are reviewed quarterly and adjusted as necessary based on changing borrower and/or collateral conditions and actual collection and charge-off experience. an unallocated allowance is maintained to recognize the imprecision in estimating and measuring losses when evaluating allowances for individual loans or pools of loans.
larger commercial loans included within aggregate borrower relationship balances exceeding $1 million that exhibit probable or observed credit weaknesses, as well as loans that have been modified in a tdr, are subject to individual review for impairment. the bancorp considers the current value of collateral, credit quality of any guarantees, the guarantors liquidity and willingness to cooperate, the loan structure, and other factors when evaluating
92 fifth third bancorp notes to consolidated financial statements whether an individual loan is impaired. other factors may include the industry and geographic region of the borrower, size and financial condition of the borrower, cash flow and leverage of the borrower, and the bancorps evaluation of the borrowers management. when individual loans are impaired, allowances are determined based on managements estimate of the borrowers ability to repay the loan given the availability of collateral and other sources of cash flow, as well as an evaluation of legal options available to the bancorp. allowances for impaired loans are measured based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loans effective interest rate, fair value of the underlying collateral or readily observable secondary market values. the bancorp evaluates the collectability of both principal and interest when assessing the need for a loss accrual.
historical credit loss rates are applied to commercial loans that are not impaired or are impaired, but smaller than the established threshold of $1 million and thus not subject to specific allowance allocations. the loss rates are derived from a migration analysis, which tracks the historical net charge-off experience sustained on loans according to their internal risk grade. the risk grading system utilized for allowance analysis purposes encompasses ten categories.
homogenous loans and leases in the residential mortgage and consumer portfolio segments are not individually risk graded. rather, standard credit scoring systems and delinquency monitoring are used to assess credit risks, and allowances are established based on the expected net charge-offs. loss rates are based on the trailing twelve month net charge-off history by loan category. historical loss rates may be adjusted for certain prescriptive and qualitative factors that, in managements judgment, are necessary to reflect losses inherent in the portfolio. factors that management considers in the analysis include the effects of the national and local economies; trends in the nature and volume of delinquencies, charge-offs and nonaccrual loans; changes in loan mix; credit score migration comparisons; asset quality trends; risk management and loan administration; changes in the internal lending policies and credit standards; collection practices; and examination results from bank regulatory agencies and the bancorps internal credit reviewers.
the bancorps primary market areas for lending are the midwestern and southeastern regions of the unites states. when evaluating the adequacy of allowances, consideration is given to these regional geographic concentrations and the closely associated effect changing economic conditions have on the bancorps customers.
in the current year, the bancorp has not substantively changed any material aspect to its overall approach to determining its alll for any of its portfolio segments. there have been no material changes in criteria or estimation techniques as compared to prior periods that impacted the determination of the current period alll for any of the bancorps portfolio segments.
reserve for unfunded commitments the reserve for unfunded commitments is maintained at a level believed by management to be sufficient to absorb estimated probable losses related to unfunded credit facilities and is included in other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets. the determination of the adequacy of the reserve is based upon an evaluation of the unfunded credit facilities, including an assessment of historical commitment utilization experience, credit risk grading and historical loss rates based on credit grade migration. this process takes into consideration the same risk elements that are analyzed in the determination of the adequacy of the bancorps alll, as discussed above. net adjustments to the reserve for unfunded commitments are included in other noninterest expense in the consolidated statements of income.
loan sales and securitizations the bancorp periodically sells loans through either securitizations or individual loan sales in accordance with its investment policies. the sold loans are removed from the balance sheet and a net gain or loss is recognized in the bancorps consolidated financial statements at the time of sale. the bancorp typically isolates the loans through the use of a vie and thus is required to assess whether the entity holding the sold or securitized loans is a vie and whether the bancorp is the primary beneficiary and therefore consolidator of that vie. if the bancorp holds the power to direct activities most significant to the economic performance of the vie and has the obligation to absorb losses or right to receive benefits that could potentially be significant to the vie, then the bancorp will generally be deemed the primary beneficiary of the vie. if the bancorp is determined not to be the primary beneficiary of a vie but holds a variable interest in the entity, such variable interests are accounted for under the equity method of accounting or other accounting standards as appropriate. refer to note 10 for further information on consolidated and non-consolidated vies.
the bancorps loan sales and securitizations are generally structured with servicing retained. as a result, servicing rights resulting from residential mortgage loan sales are initially recorded at fair value and subsequently amortized in proportion to and over the period of estimated net servicing revenues and are reported as a component of mortgage banking net revenue in the consolidated statements of income. servicing rights are assessed for impairment monthly, based on fair value, with temporary impairment recognized through a valuation allowance and permanent impairment recognized through a write-off of the servicing asset and related valuation allowance. key economic assumptions used in measuring any potential impairment of the servicing rights include the prepayment speeds of the underlying loans, the weighted-average life, the discount rate, and the weighted-average coupon, as applicable. the primary risk of material changes to the value of the servicing rights resides in the potential volatility in the economic assumptions used, particularly the prepayment speeds. the bancorp monitors risk and adjusts its valuation allowance as necessary to adequately reserve for impairment in the servicing portfolio. for purposes of measuring impairment, the mortgage servicing rights are stratified into classes based on the financial asset type (fixed-rate vs. adjustable rate) and interest rates. fees received for servicing loans owned by investors are based on a percentage of the outstanding monthly principal balance of such loans and are included in noninterest income in the consolidated statements of income as loan payments are received. costs of servicing loans are charged to expense as incurred.
reserve for representation and warranty provisions conforming residential mortgage loans sold to unrelated third parties are generally sold with representation and warranty provisions. a contractual liability arises only in the event of a breach of these representations and warranties and, in general, only when a loss results from the breach. the bancorp may be required to repurchase any previously sold loan or indemnify (make whole) the investor or insurer for which the representation or warranty of the bancorp proves to be inaccurate, incomplete or misleading. the bancorp establishes a residential mortgage repurchase reserve related to various representations and warranties that reflects managements estimate of losses based on a combination of factors.
the bancorps estimation process requires management to make subjective and complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain, such as future demand expectations, economic factors and the specific characteristics of the loans subject to repurchase. such factors incorporate historical investor audit and repurchase demand rates, appeals success rates, historical loss
93 fifth third bancorp notes to consolidated financial statements severity, and any additional information obtained from the gses regarding future mortgage repurchase and file request criteria. at the time of a loan sale, the bancorp records a representation and warranty reserve at the estimated fair value of the bancorps guarantee and continually updates the reserve during the life of the loan as losses in excess of the reserve become probable and reasonably estimable. the provision for the estimated fair value of the representation and warranty guarantee arising from the loan sales is recorded as an adjustment to the gain on sale, which is included in other noninterest income at the time of sale. updates to the reserve are recorded in other noninterest expense.
legal contingencies the bancorp is party to numerous claims and lawsuits as well as threatened or potential actions or claims concerning matters arising from the conduct of its business activities. the outcome of claims or litigation and the timing of ultimate resolution are inherently difficult to predict, and significant judgment may be required in the determination of both the probability of loss and whether the amount of the loss is reasonably estimable. the bancorps estimates are subjective and are based on the status of legal and regulatory proceedings, the merit of the bancorps defenses and consultation with internal and external legal counsel. a reserve for a potential litigation loss is established when information related to the loss contingency indicates both that a loss is probable and that the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. this reserve is included in other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets and is adjusted from time to time as appropriate to reflect changes in circumstances. legal expenses are recorded in other noninterest expense in the consolidated statements of income.
bank premises and equipment bank premises and equipment, including leasehold improvements, are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization. depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method based on estimated useful lives of the assets for book purposes, while accelerated depreciation is used for income tax purposes. amortization of leasehold improvements is computed using the straight-line method over the lives of the related leases or useful lives of the related assets, whichever is shorter. whenever events or changes in circumstances dictate, the bancorp tests its long-lived assets for impairment by determining whether the sum of the estimated undiscounted future cash flows attributable to a long-lived asset or asset group is less than the carrying amount of the long-lived asset or asset group through a probability-weighted approach. in the event the carrying amount of the long-lived asset or asset group is not recoverable, an impairment loss is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the long-lived asset or asset group exceeds its fair value. maintenance, repairs and minor improvements are charged to noninterest expense in the consolidated statements of income as incurred.
derivative financial instruments the bancorp accounts for its derivatives as either assets or liabilities measured at fair value through adjustments to aoci and/or current earnings, as appropriate. on the date the bancorp enters into a derivative contract, the bancorp designates the derivative instrument as either a fair value hedge, cash flow hedge or as a free-standing derivative instrument. for a fair value hedge, changes in the fair value of the derivative instrument and changes in the fair value of the hedged asset or liability attributable to the hedged risk are recorded in current period net income. for a cash flow hedge, changes in the fair value of the derivative instrument, to the extent that it is effective, are recorded in aoci and subsequently reclassified to net income in the same period(s) that the hedged transaction impacts net income. for free-standing derivative instruments, changes in fair values are reported in current period net income.
prior to entering into a hedge transaction, the bancorp formally documents the relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged item, as well as the risk management objective and strategy for undertaking the hedge transaction. this process includes linking the derivative instrument designated as a fair value or cash flow hedge to a specific asset or liability on the balance sheet or to specific forecasted transactions and the risk being hedged, along with a formal assessment at both inception of the hedge and on an ongoing basis as to the effectiveness of the derivative instrument in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows of the hedged item. if it is determined that the derivative instrument is not highly effective as a hedge, hedge accounting is discontinued.
income taxes the bancorp estimates income tax expense based on amounts expected to be owed to the various tax jurisdictions in which the bancorp conducts business. on a quarterly basis, management assesses the reasonableness of its effective tax rate based upon its current estimate of the amount and components of net income, tax credits and the applicable statutory tax rates expected for the full year. the estimated income tax expense is recorded in the consolidated statements of income.
deferred income tax assets and liabilities are determined using the balance sheet method and the net deferred tax asset or liability is reported in other assets or accrued taxes, interest and expenses in the consolidated balance sheets. under this method, the net deferred tax asset or liability is based on the tax effects of the differences between the book and tax basis of assets and liabilities, and reflects enacted changes in tax rates and laws. deferred tax assets are recognized to the extent they exist and are subject to a valuation allowance based on managements judgment that realization is more likely than not. this analysis is performed on a quarterly basis and includes an evaluation of all positive and negative evidence, such as the limitation on the use of any net operating losses, to determine whether realization is more likely than not.
accrued taxes represent the net estimated amount due to taxing jurisdictions and are reported in accrued taxes, interest and expenses in the consolidated balance sheets. the bancorp evaluates and assesses the relative risks and appropriate tax treatment of transactions and filing positions after considering statutes, regulations, judicial precedent and other information and maintains tax accruals consistent with its evaluation of these relative risks and merits. changes to the estimate of accrued taxes occur periodically due to changes in tax rates, interpretations of tax laws, the status of examinations being conducted by taxing authorities and changes to statutory, judicial and regulatory guidance that impact the relative risks of tax positions. these changes, when they occur, can affect deferred taxes and accrued taxes as well as the current periods income tax expense and can be significant to the operating results of the bancorp. any interest and penalties incurred in connection with income taxes are recorded as a component of income tax expense in the consolidated financial statements. for additional information on income taxes, refer to note 20.
earnings per share basic earnings per share is computed by dividing net income available to common shareholders by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. earnings per diluted share is computed by dividing adjusted net income available to common shareholders by the weighted-average number
94  fifth third bancorp notes to consolidated financial statements of shares of common stock and common stock equivalents outstanding during the period. dilutive common stock equivalents represent the assumed conversion of dilutive convertible preferred stock, the exercise of dilutive stock-based awards and warrants and the dilutive effect of the settlement of outstanding forward contracts.
the bancorp calculates earnings per share pursuant to the two-class method. the two-class method is an earnings allocation formula that determines earnings per share separately for common stock and participating securities according to dividends declared and participation rights in undistributed earnings. for purposes of calculating earnings per share under the two-class method, restricted shares that contain nonforfeitable rights to dividends are considered participating securities until vested. while the dividends declared per share on such restricted shares are the same as dividends declared per common share outstanding, the dividends recognized on such restricted shares may be less because dividends paid on restricted shares that are expected to be forfeited are reclassified to compensation expense during the period when forfeiture is expected.
goodwill business combinations entered into by the bancorp typically include the acquisition of goodwill. goodwill is required to be tested for impairment at the bancorps reporting unit level on an annual basis, which for the bancorp is september 30, and more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that there may be impairment. the bancorp has determined that its segments qualify as reporting units under u.s. gaap.
impairment exists when a reporting units carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value. in testing goodwill for impairment, u.s. gaap permits the bancorp to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. in this qualitative assessment, the bancorp evaluates events and circumstances which may include, but are not limited to, the general economic environment, banking industry and market conditions, the overall financial performance of the bancorp, the performance of the bancorps common stock, the key financial performance metrics of the bancorps reporting units, and events affecting the reporting units. if, after assessing the totality of events and circumstances, the bancorp determines it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, then performing the two-step impairment test would be unnecessary. however, if the bancorp concludes otherwise, it would then be required to perform the first step (step 1) of the goodwill impairment test, and continue to the second step (step 2), if necessary. step 1 of the goodwill impairment test compares the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount, including goodwill. if the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, step 2 of the goodwill impairment test is performed to measure the amount of impairment loss, if any.
the fair value of a reporting unit is the price that would be received to sell the unit as a whole in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. as none of the bancorps reporting units are publicly traded, individual reporting unit fair value determinations cannot be directly correlated to the bancorps stock price. to determine the fair value of a reporting unit, the bancorp employs an income-based approach, utilizing the reporting units forecasted cash flows (including a terminal value approach to estimate cash flows beyond the final year of the forecast) and the reporting units estimated cost of equity as the discount rate. additionally, the bancorp determines its market capitalization based on the average of the closing price of the bancorps stock during the month including the measurement date, incorporating an additional control premium, and compares this market-based fair value measurement to the aggregate fair value of the bancorps reporting units in order to corroborate the results of the income approach.
when required to perform step 2, the bancorp compares the implied fair value of a reporting units goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill. if the carrying amount exceeds the implied fair value, an impairment loss equal to that excess amount is recognized. a recognized impairment loss cannot exceed the carrying amount of that goodwill and cannot be reversed in future periods even if the fair value of the reporting unit subsequently recovers.
during step 2, the bancorp determines the implied fair value of goodwill for a reporting unit by assigning the fair value of the reporting unit to all of the assets and liabilities of that unit (including any unrecognized intangible assets) as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination. the excess of the fair value of the reporting unit over the amounts assigned to its assets and liabilities is the implied fair value of goodwill. this assignment process is only performed for purposes of testing goodwill for impairment. the bancorp does not adjust the carrying values of recognized assets or liabilities (other than goodwill, if appropriate), nor does it recognize previously unrecognized intangible assets in the consolidated financial statements as a result of this assignment process. refer to note 8 for further information regarding the bancorps goodwill.
fair value measurements the bancorp measures certain financial assets and liabilities at fair value in accordance with u.s. gaap, which defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. valuation techniques the bancorp uses to measure fair value include the market approach, income approach and cost approach. the market approach uses prices or relevant information generated by market transactions involving identical or comparable assets or liabilities. the income approach involves discounting future amounts to a single present amount and is based on current market expectations about those future amounts. the cost approach is based on the amount that currently would be required to replace the service capacity of the asset.
u.s. gaap establishes a fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three broad levels. the fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (level 1) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (level 3). a financial instruments categorization within the fair value hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the instruments fair value measurement. the three levels within the fair value hierarchy are described as follows:
level 1  quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the bancorp has the ability to access at the measurement date.
level 2  inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly. level 2 inputs include: quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active; inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability; and inputs that are
95 fifth third bancorp notes to consolidated financial statements derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means.
level 3  unobservable inputs for the asset or liability for which there is little, if any, market activity at the measurement date. unobservable inputs reflect the bancorps own assumptions about what market participants would use to price the asset or liability.
the inputs are developed based on the best information available in the circumstances, which might include the bancorps own financial data such as internally developed pricing models and dcf methodologies, as well as instruments for which the fair value determination requires significant management judgment.
the bancorps fair value measurements involve various valuation techniques and models, which involve inputs that are observable, when available. valuation techniques and parameters used for measuring assets and liabilities are reviewed and validated by the bancorp on a quarterly basis. additionally, the bancorp monitors the fair values of significant assets and liabilities using a variety of methods including the evaluation of pricing runs and exception reports based on certain analytical criteria, comparison to previous trades and overall review and assessments for reasonableness. refer to note 27 for further information on fair value measurements.
stock-based compensation the bancorp recognizes compensation expense for the grant-date fair value of stock-based awards that are expected to vest over the requisite service period. all awards, both those with cliff vesting and graded vesting, are expensed on a straight-line basis. awards to employees that meet eligible retirement status are expensed immediately. as compensation expense is recognized, a deferred tax asset is recorded that represents an estimate of the future tax deduction from exercise or release of restrictions. at the time awards are exercised, cancelled, expire, or restrictions are released, the bancorp may be required to recognize an adjustment to income tax expense for the difference between the previously estimated tax deduction and the actual tax deduction realized. for further information on the bancorps stock-based compensation plans, refer to note 24.
pension plans the bancorp uses an expected long-term rate of return applied to the fair market value of assets as of the beginning of the year and the expected cash flow during the year for calculating the expected investment return on all pension plan assets. amortization of the net gain or loss resulting from experience different from that assumed and from changes in assumptions (excluding asset gains and losses not yet reflected in market-related value) is included as a component of net periodic benefit cost. if, as of the beginning of the year, that net gain or loss exceeds 10% of the greater of the projected benefit obligation and the market-related value of plan assets, the amortization is that excess divided by the average remaining service period of participating employees expected to receive benefits under the plan. the bancorp uses a third-party actuary to compute the remaining service period of participating employees. this period reflects expected turnover, pre-retirement mortality, and other applicable employee demographics.
other securities and other property held by fifth third investment advisors, a division of the bancorps banking subsidiary, in a fiduciary or agency capacity are not included in the consolidated balance sheets because such items are not assets of the subsidiaries. investment advisory revenue in the consolidated statements of income is recognized on the accrual basis. investment advisory service revenues are recognized monthly based on a fee charged per transaction processed and/or a fee charged on the market value of average account balances associated with individual contracts.
the bancorp recognizes revenue from its card and processing services on an accrual basis as such services are performed, recording revenues net of certain costs (primarily interchange fees charged by credit card associations) not controlled by the bancorp.
the bancorp purchases life insurance policies on the lives of certain directors, officers and employees and is the owner and beneficiary of the policies. the bancorp invests in these policies, known as boli, to provide an efficient form of funding for long-term retirement and other employee benefits costs. the bancorp records these boli policies within other assets in the consolidated balance sheets at each policys respective cash surrender value, with changes recorded in other noninterest income in the consolidated statements of income.
other intangible assets consist of core deposit intangibles, customer lists, non-compete agreements and cardholder relationships. other intangible assets are amortized on either a straight-line or an accelerated basis over their estimated useful lives. the bancorp reviews other intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that carrying amounts may not be recoverable.
securities sold under repurchase agreements are accounted for as secured borrowings and included in other short-term borrowings in the consolidated balance sheets at the amounts at which the securities were sold plus accrued interest.
acquisitions of treasury stock are carried at cost. reissuance of shares in treasury for acquisitions, exercises of stock-based awards or other corporate purposes is recorded based on the specific identification method.
accounting and reporting developments obligations resulting from joint and several liability arrangements for which the total amount of the obligation is fixed at the reporting date in february 2013, the fasb issued amended guidance relating to the measurement of obligations resulting from joint and several liability arrangements for which the total amount under the arrangement is fixed at the reporting date. for the total amount of an obligation under an arrangement to be considered fixed at the reporting date, there can be no measurement uncertainty relating to the total amount of the obligation. the obligation resulting from joint and several liability arrangements would be measured initially as the sum of 1) the amount the bancorp has agreed to pay on the basis of its arrangement among its co-obligors and 2) any additional amount the bancorp expects to pay on behalf of its co-obligors. the amended guidance also would require the bancorp to disclose the nature and amount of the obligation as well as information about the risks that such obligations pose to future cash flows. the amended guidance was effective for reporting periods beginning after december 15, 2013 and was applied retrospectively to all prior periods presented for those obligations resulting from joint and several liability arrangements that exist at the beginning of the fiscal year of adoption. the bancorp adopted the amended guidance on january 1, 2014 and the adoption did not have a material impact on the bancorps consolidated financial statements.
presentation of an unrecognized tax benefit when a net operating loss carryforward, a similar tax loss, or a tax credit carryforward exists
96 fifth third bancorp notes to consolidated financial statements in july 2013, the fasb issued amended guidance to clarify that an unrecognized tax benefit, or a portion of an unrecognized tax benefit, should be presented in the financial statements as a reduction to a deferred tax asset for a net operating loss carryforward, a similar tax loss, or a tax credit carryforward, except as follows. to the extent a net operating loss carryforward, a similar tax loss, or a tax credit carryforward is not available at the reporting date under the tax law of the applicable jurisdiction to settle any income taxes that would result from the disallowance of a tax position or the tax law of the applicable jurisdiction does not require the entity to use, and the entity does not intend to use, the deferred tax asset for such purpose, the unrecognized tax benefit should be presented in the financial statements as a liability and should not be combined with deferred tax assets. the assessment of whether a deferred tax asset is available is based on the unrecognized tax benefit and deferred tax asset that exist at the reporting date and should be made presuming disallowance of the tax position at the reporting date. the amended guidance was effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after december 15, 2013, with early adoption permitted. the bancorp adopted the amended guidance on january 1, 2014 and the adoption of the amended guidance did not have a material impact on the bancorps consolidated financial statements.
accounting for investments in qualified affordable housing projects in january 2014, the fasb issued amended guidance which would permit the bancorp to make an accounting policy election to account for its investments in qualified affordable housing projects using a proportional amortization method if certain conditions are met and to present the amortization as a component of income tax expense. the amended guidance would be applied retrospectively to all periods presented and is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after december 15, 2014, with early adoption permitted. regardless of the policy election, the amended guidance requires disclosures to enable the users of the financial statements to understand the nature of the bancorps investments in qualified affordable housing projects and the effect of the measurement of the investments in qualified affordable housing projects and the related tax credits on the bancorps financial position and results of operation.
the bancorp adopted the amended guidance on january 1, 2015, and did not make an accounting policy election to apply the proportional amortization method for its investments in qualified affordable housing projects. therefore, the adoption did not have an impact on the bancorps consolidated financial statements.
reclassification of residential real estate collateralized consumer mortgage loans upon foreclosure in january 2014, the fasb issued amended guidance that clarifies when a creditor should be considered to have received physical possession of residential real estate property collateralizing a consumer mortgage loan such that the loan receivable should be derecognized and the real estate property recognized. the amended guidance clarifies that an in substance repossession or foreclosure occurs, and a creditor is considered to have received physical possession of residential real estate property collateralizing a consumer mortgage loan, upon either (1) the creditor obtaining legal title to the residential real estate property upon completion of a foreclosure or (2) the borrower conveying all interest in the residential real estate property to the creditor to satisfy that loan through completion of a deed in lieu of foreclosure or through a similar legal agreement. in addition, the amended guidance requires interim and annual disclosures of both (1) the amount of foreclosed residential real estate property held by the creditor and (2) the recorded investment in consumer mortgage loans collateralized by residential real estate property that are in the process of foreclosure according to local requirements of the applicable jurisdiction. the amended guidance may be applied prospectively or through a modified retrospective approach and is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after december 15, 2014, with early adoption permitted. the bancorp adopted the amended guidance on january 1, 2015 and the adoption of the amended guidance did not have a material impact on the bancorps consolidated financial statements.
reporting discontinued operations and disclosures of disposals of components of an entity in april 2014, the fasb issued amended guidance that changes the criteria for reporting discontinued operations. the amended guidance requires a disposal of a component of an entity or a group of components of an entity to be reported in discontinued operations if the disposal represents a strategic shift that has (or will have) a major effect on an entitys operations and financial results when any of the following occurs: 1) the component of an entity or group of components of an entity meets the criteria to be classified as held for sale; 2) the component of an entity or group of components of an entity is disposed of by sale; or 3) the component of an entity or group of components of an entity is disposed of other than by sale (for example, by abandonment or in a distribution to owners in a spinoff). the amended guidance requires an entity to present, for each comparative period, the assets and liabilities of a disposal group that includes a discontinued operation separately in the asset and liability sections, respectively, of the statement of financial position, as well as additional disclosures about discontinued operations. the amended guidance is to be applied prospectively for 1) all disposals (or classifications as held for sale) of components of an entity that occur within annual periods beginning on or after december 15, 2014, and interim periods within those years; and 2) all businesses or nonprofit activities that, on acquisition, are classified as held for sale that occur within annual periods beginning on or after december 15, 2014, and interim periods within those years. early adoption is permitted, but only for disposals (or classifications as held for sale) that have not been reported in financial statements previously issued. the bancorp adopted the amended guidance on january 1, 2015 and the adoption of the amended guidance did not have a material impact on the bancorps consolidated financial statements.
revenue from contracts with customers in may 2014, the fasb issued amended guidance on revenue recognition from contracts with customers. the standard outlines a single comprehensive model for entities to use in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers and supersedes most contract revenue recognition guidance, including industry-specific guidance. the core principle of the amended guidance is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. the amended guidance is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after december 15, 2016, and interim periods within the reporting period, and should be applied either retrospectively to each prior reporting period presented or retrospectively with the cumulative effect of initially applying the amendments recognized at the date of initial application. early adoption is prohibited. the bancorp is currently in the process of evaluating the impact of the amended guidance on its consolidated financial statements.
97 fifth third bancorp notes to consolidated financial statements repurchase-to-maturity transactions, repurchase financings, and disclosures in june 2014, the fasb issued amended guidance that changes the accounting for repurchase-to-maturity transactions to secured borrowing accounting. the amended guidance also requires separate accounting for a transfer of a financial asset executed contemporaneously with a repurchase agreement with the same counterparty, which will result in secured borrowing accounting for the repurchase agreement. the amended guidance requires disclosures for certain transactions comprising: 1) a transfer of a financial asset accounted for as a sale and 2) an agreement with the same transferee entered into in contemplation of the initial transfer that results in the transferor retaining substantially all of the exposure to the economic return on the transferred financial asset throughout the term of the transaction. the amended guidance also requires new disclosures for repurchase agreements, securities lending transactions, and repurchase-to-maturity transactions accounted for as secured borrowings. the amended guidance is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after december 15, 2014, with early adoption prohibited. changes in accounting for transactions outstanding on the effective date should be presented as a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the period of adoption. the disclosures for certain transactions accounted for as a sale are required to be presented for interim and annual periods beginning after december 15, 2014, and the disclosures for repurchase agreements, securities lending transactions, and repurchase-to-maturity transactions accounted for as secured borrowings are required to be presented for annual periods beginning after december 15, 2014, and interim periods beginning after march 15, 2015. the bancorp adopted the amended guidance on january 1, 2015 and the adoption of the amended guidance did not have a material impact on the bancorps consolidated financial statements.
accounting for share-based payments when the terms of the award provide that a performance target could be achieved after the requisite service period in june 2014, the fasb issued amended guidance which clarifies that a performance target that affects vesting and can be achieved after the requisite service period be treated as a performance condition. the amended guidance provides that an entity should apply existing guidance as it relates to awards with performance conditions that affect vesting to account for such awards. as such, the performance target should not be reflected in estimating the grant-date fair value of the award. compensation cost should be recognized in the period in which it becomes probable that the performance target will be achieved and should represent the compensation cost attributable to the period(s) for which the requisite service has already been rendered. if the performance target becomes probable of being achieved before the end of the requisite service period, the remaining unrecognized compensation cost should be recognized prospectively over the remaining requisite service period. the total amount of compensation cost recognized during and after the requisite service period should reflect the number of awards that are expected to vest and should be adjusted to reflect those awards that ultimately vest. the requisite service period ends when the employee can cease rendering service and still be eligible to vest in the award if the performance target is achieved. the amended guidance is effective for annual periods, and interim periods within those annual periods, beginning after december 15, 2015, with early adoption permitted. the amended guidance may be adopted either prospectively to all awards granted or modified after the effective date or retrospectively to all awards with performance targets that are outstanding as of the beginning of the earliest annual period presented in the financial statements and to all new or modified awards thereafter. if retrospective transition is adopted, the cumulative effect of applying the amended guidance as of the beginning of the earliest annual period presented in the financial statements should be recognized as an adjustment to the opening retained earnings balance at that date. the amended guidance is not expected to have a material impact on the bancorps consolidated financial statements.
measuring the financial assets and financial liabilities of a consolidated collateralized financing entity in august 2014, the fasb issued amended guidance that provides an alternative to asc topic 820: fair value measurement for measuring the financial assets and financial liabilities of a cfe, such as a collateralized debt obligation or a collateralized loan obligation entity consolidated as a vie when a) all of the financial assets and the financial liabilities of that cfe are measured at fair value in the consolidated financial statements and b) the changes in the fair values of those financial assets and financial liabilities are reflected in earnings. if elected, the measurement alternative would allow the bancorp to measure both the financial assets and the financial liabilities of the cfe by using the more observable of the fair value of the financial assets or the fair value of the financial liabilities and to eliminate any measurement difference. when the measurement alternative is not elected for a consolidated cfe within the scope of this amended guidance, the amendments clarify that 1) the fair value of the financial assets and the fair value of the financial liabilities of the consolidated cfe should be measured using the requirements of topic 820 and 2) any difference in the fair value of the financial assets and the fair value of the financial liabilities of that consolidated cfe should be reflected in earnings and attributed to the bancorp in the consolidated statements of income. the amended guidance may be applied retrospectively or through a modified retrospective approach and is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after december 15, 2015. the amended guidance is not expected to have a material impact on the bancorps consolidated financial statements.
classification of certain government-guaranteed mortgage loans upon foreclosure in august 2014, the fasb issued amended guidance clarifying the classification of certain foreclosed mortgage loans that are either full or partially guaranteed under government programs. the amended guidance requires that a mortgage loan be derecognized and that a separate other receivable be recognized upon foreclosure if the following conditions are met: 1) the loan has a government guarantee that is not separable from the loan before foreclosure; 2) at the time of foreclosure, the creditor has the intent to convey the real estate property to the guarantor and make a claim on the guarantee, and the creditor has the ability to recover under that claim; and 3) at the time of foreclosure, any amount of the claim that is determined on the basis of the fair value of the real estate is fixed. upon foreclosure, the separate other receivable would be measured based on the amount of the loan balance (principal and interest) expected to be recovered from the guarantor. the amended guidance may be applied prospectively or through a modified retrospective approach and is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after december 15, 2014, with early adoption permitted. the bancorp adopted the amended guidance on january 1, 2015 and the adoption of the amended guidance did not have a material impact on the bancorps consolidated financial statements.
98 fifth third bancorp notes to consolidated financial statements pushdown accounting in november 2014, the fasb issued amended guidance on whether and at what threshold an acquired entity that is a business or nonprofit activity can apply pushdown accounting in its separate financial statements upon the occurrence of an event in which an acquirer (an individual or an entity) obtains control of the acquired entity. the amended guidance provides that an acquired entity may elect the option to apply pushdown accounting in the reporting period in which the change-in-control event occurs. an acquired entity should determine whether to elect to apply pushdown accounting for each individual change-in-control event in which an acquirer obtains control of the acquired entity. if pushdown accounting is not applied in the reporting period in which the change-in-control event occurs, an acquired entity will have the option to elect to apply pushdown accounting in a subsequent reporting period to the acquired entitys most recent change-in-control event. an election to apply pushdown accounting in a reporting period after the reporting period in which the change-in-control event occurred should be considered a change in accounting principle. if pushdown accounting is applied to an individual change-in-control event, that election is irrevocable. if an acquired entity elects the option to apply pushdown accounting in its separate financial statements, it should disclose information in the current reporting period that enables users of financial statements to evaluate the effect of pushdown accounting. the amended guidance was effective upon issuance, and the adoption of the amended guidance did not have a material impact on the bancorps consolidated financial statements.
determining whether the host contract in a hybrid financial instrument issued in the form of a share is more akin to debt or equity in november 2014, the fasb issued amended guidance that clarifies how current gaap should be interpreted in evaluating the economic characteristics and risks of a host contract in a hybrid financial instrument that is issued in the form of a share. specifically, the amendments clarify that an entity should consider all relevant terms and featuresincluding the embedded derivative features being evaluated for bifurcationin evaluating the nature of the host contract. furthermore, the amendments clarify that no single term or feature would necessarily determine the economic characteristics and risks of the host contract. rather, the nature of the host contract depends upon the economic characteristics and risks of the entire hybrid financial instrument. the amended guidance is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after december 15, 2015, with early adoption permitted. the effects of initially adopting the amended guidance should be applied on a modified retrospective basis to existing hybrid financial instruments issued in the form of a share as of the beginning of the fiscal year for which the amendments are effective and shall be reported as a cumulative-effect adjustment directly to retained earnings as of the beginning of the year of adoption. the amended guidance is not expected to have a material impact on the bancorps consolidated financial statements.
simplifying income statement presentation by eliminating the concept of extraordinary items in january 2015, the fasb issued amended guidance that eliminates the concept of extraordinary items from gaap. presently, an event or transaction is presumed to be an ordinary and usual activity of a reporting entity unless evidence clearly supports its classification as an extraordinary item, which must be both unusual in nature and infrequent in occurrence. an entity was required to segregate the extraordinary item from the results of ordinary operations and show the item separately in the income statement, net of tax, after income from continuing operations. an entity was also required to disclose applicable income taxes and either present or disclose earnings-per-share data applicable to the extraordinary item. the presentation and disclosure guidance for items that are unusual in nature or occur infrequently will be retained and will be expanded to include items that are both unusual in nature and infrequently occurring. the amended guidance is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after december 15, 2015, with early adoption permitted provided that the guidance is applied from the beginning of the fiscal year of adoption. the amended guidance may be applied prospectively or retrospectively to all periods presented in the financial statements. the amended guidance is not expected to have a material impact on the bancorps consolidated financial statements amendments to the consolidation analysis in february 2015, the fasb issued amended guidance that changes the analysis a reporting entity must perform to determine whether it should consolidate certain types of legal entities. the amended guidance 1) modifies the evaluation of whether limited partnerships and similar legal entities are vies or voting interest entities; 2) eliminates the presumption that a general partner should consolidate a limited partnership; 3) affects the consolidation analysis of reporting entities that are involved with vies, particularly those that have fee arrangements and related party relationships; and 4) provides a scope exception from consolidation guidance for reporting entities that are required to comply with or operate in accordance with requirements that are similar to those in rule 2a-7 of the investment company act of 1940 for registered money market funds. the amended guidance is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after december 15, 2015, with early adoption permitted. the amended guidance may be applied using either a retrospective approach or a modified retrospective approach with a cumulative-effect adjustment to equity as of the beginning of the fiscal year of adoption. the bancorp is currently in the process of evaluating the impact of adopting the amended guidance on the bancorps consolidated financial statements.

3.  restrictions on cash and dividends the frb, under regulation d, requires that banks hold cash in reserve against deposit liabilities, known as the reserve requirement. the reserve requirement is calculated based on a two-week average of daily net transaction account deposits as defined by the frb and may be satisfied with vault cash. when vault cash is not sufficient to meet the reserve requirement, the remaining amount must be satisfied with funds held at the frb. at december 31, 2014 and 2013, the bancorps banking subsidiary reserve requirement was $1.8 billion and $1.6 billion, respectively. vault cash was not sufficient to meet the total reserve requirement; therefore, as of december 31, 2014 and 2013, the bancorps banking subsidiary satisfied the remaining reserve requirement with $1.0 billion and $942 million, respectively, of the bancorps total deposit at the frb. the noninterest-bearing portion of the bancorps deposit at the frb is held in cash and due from banks in the consolidated balance sheets while the interest bearing portion is held in other short-term investments in the consolidated balance sheets.
in 2011, the frb adopted the capital plan rule, which requires bhcs with consolidated assets of $50 billion or more to submit annual capital plans to the frb for review. under the rule, these capital plans must include detailed descriptions of the following: the bhcs internal processes for assessing capital adequacy; the policies governing capital actions such as common stock issuances, dividends, and share repurchases; and all planned capital actions over a nine-quarter planning horizon. further, each bhc must also report to the frb the results of stress tests conducted by the bhc under a number of scenarios that assess the sources and uses of capital under baseline and stressed economic scenarios. the frb launched the 2014 stress testing program and ccar on november 1, 2013, with firm submissions of stress test results and capital plans due to the frb on january 6, 2014, which the bancorp submitted as required.
the frbs review of the capital plan assessed the comprehensiveness of the capital plan, the reasonableness of the assumptions and the analysis underlying the capital plan. additionally, the frb reviewed the robustness of the capital adequacy process, the capital policy and the bancorps ability to maintain capital above the minimum regulatory capital ratios and above a tier i common ratio of five percent on a pro forma basis under expected and stressful conditions throughout the planning horizon. the frb assessed the bancorps strategies for addressing proposed revisions to the regulatory capital framework agreed upon by the bcbs and requirements arising from the dfa.
on march 26, 2014, the frb announced it had completed the 2014 ccar. for bhcs that proposed capital distributions in their plans, the frb either objected to the plan or provided a non-objection whereby the frb permitted the proposed 2014 capital distributions. the frb indicated to the bancorp that it did not object to the following proposed capital actions for the period beginning april 1, 2014 and ending march 31, 2015:
(b)   the potential repurchase of common shares in an amount up to $669 million;
(c)   the additional ability to repurchase shares in the amount of any after-tax gains from the sale of vantiv, inc. common stock; and
(d)   the issuance of $300 million in preferred stock.
as contemplated by the 2014 ccar, during the second quarter of 2014, the bancorp increased the quarterly common stock dividend from $0.12 to $0.13 per share, entered into a $150 million accelerated share repurchase transaction, and issued 300,000 depositary shares of non-cumulative perpetual preferred stock for net proceeds of $297 million. additionally, during the third and fourth quarters of 2014, the bancorp entered into accelerated share repurchase transactions of $225 million and $180 million, respectively.
additionally, as a ccar institution, the bancorp is required to disclose the results of its company-run stress test under the supervisory severely adverse scenario, and to provide information related to the types of risk included in its stress testing; a general description of the methodologies used; estimates of certain financial results and pro forma capital ratios; and an explanation of the most significant causes of changes in regulatory capital ratios. on march 26, 2014 the bancorp publicly disclosed the results of its company-run stress test as required by the dfa stress testing rules.
the bhcs that participated in the 2014 ccar, including the bancorp, are required to conduct mid-cycle company-run stress tests using data as of march 31, 2014. the stress tests must be based on three bhc defined scenarios  baseline, adverse and severely adverse. as required, the bancorp reported the mid-cycle stress test results to the frb on july 7, 2014. these results represented estimates of the bancorps results from the second quarter of 2014
100 fifth third bancorp notes to consolidated financial statements through the second quarter of 2016 under the severely adverse scenario, which is considered highly unlikely to occur.
the frb launched the 2015 stress testing program and ccar on october 23, 2014. the stress testing results and capital plan were submitted by the bancorp to the frb on january 5, 2015.
the frb expects to release summary results of the 2015 stress testing program and ccar in march of 2015. the results will include supervisory projections of capital ratios, losses and revenues under the supervisory adverse and supervisory severely adverse scenarios. the frb will also issue an objection or non-objection to each participating institutions capital plan submitted under ccar. additionally, as a ccar institution, the bancorp will be required to publicly disclose the results of its company run stress test as required by the dfa, within 15 days of the date the frb discloses the results of its dfa supervisory stress test.

credit risk profile commercial portfolio segment for purposes of monitoring the credit quality and risk characteristics of its commercial portfolio segment, the bancorp disaggregates the segment into the following classes: commercial and industrial, commercial mortgage owner-occupied, commercial mortgage nonowner-occupied, commercial construction and commercial leasing.
to facilitate the monitoring of credit quality within the commercial portfolio segment, and for purposes of analyzing historical loss rates used in the determination of the alll for the commercial portfolio segment, the bancorp utilizes the following categories of credit grades: pass, special mention, substandard, doubtful or loss. the five categories, which are derived from standard regulatory rating definitions, are assigned upon initial approval of credit to borrowers and updated periodically thereafter.
pass ratings, which are assigned to those borrowers that do not have identified potential or well defined weaknesses and for which there is a high likelihood of orderly repayment, are updated at least annually based on the size and credit characteristics of the borrower. all other categories are updated on a quarterly basis during the month preceding the end of the calendar quarter.
the bancorp assigns a special mention rating to loans and leases that have potential weaknesses that deserve managements close attention. if left uncorrected, these potential weaknesses may, at some future date, result in the deterioration of the repayment prospects for the loan or lease or the bancorps credit position.
the bancorp assigns a substandard rating to loans and leases that are inadequately protected by the current sound worth and paying capacity of the borrower or of the collateral pledged. substandard loans and leases have well defined weaknesses or weaknesses that could jeopardize the orderly repayment of the debt. loans and leases in this grade also are characterized by the distinct possibility that the bancorp will sustain some loss if the deficiencies noted are not addressed and corrected.
the bancorp assigns a doubtful rating to loans and leases that have all the attributes of a substandard rating with the added characteristic that the weaknesses make collection or liquidation in full, on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions, and values, highly questionable and improbable. the possibility of loss is extremely high, but because of certain important and reasonable specific pending factors that may work to the advantage of and strengthen the credit quality of the loan or lease, its classification as an estimated loss is deferred until its more exact status may be determined. pending factors may include a proposed merger or acquisition, liquidation proceeding, capital injection, perfecting liens on additional collateral or refinancing plans.
loans and leases classified as loss are considered uncollectible and are charged-off in the period in which they are determined to be uncollectible. because loans and leases in this category are fully charged-off, they are not included in the following tables.

107  fifth third bancorp notes to consolidated financial statements impaired loans and leases larger commercial loans and leases included within aggregate borrower relationship balances exceeding $1 million that exhibit probable or observed credit weaknesses are subject to individual review for impairment. the bancorp also performs an individual review on loans and leases that are restructured in a tdr. the bancorp considers the current value of collateral, credit quality of any guarantees, the loan structure, and other factors when evaluating whether an individual loan or lease is impaired. other factors may include the geography and industry of the borrower, size and financial condition of the borrower, cash flow and leverage of the borrower, and the bancorps evaluation of the borrowers management. smaller balance homogenous loans or leases that are collectively evaluated for impairment are not included in the following tables.
the following tables summarize the bancorps impaired loans and leases (by class) that were subject to individual review, which includes all portfolio loans and leases restructured in a tdr as of december 31:
(a)                                    includes $869, $485 and $420, respectively, of commercial, residential mortgage and consumer tdrs on accrual status; $214, $33 and $63, respectively, of commercial, residential mortgage and consumer tdrs on nonaccrual status.
(b)                                     excludes five restructured nonaccrual loans at december 31, 2014 associated with a consolidated vie, in which the bancorp has no continuing credit risk due to the risk being assumed by a third party, with an unpaid principal balance of $28, a recorded investment of $28, and an allowance of $10.

109  fifth third bancorp notes to consolidated financial statements nonperforming assets nonperforming assets include nonaccrual loans and leases for which ultimate collectability of the full amount of the principal and/or interest is uncertain; commercial and credit card tdrs which have not yet met the requirements to be classified as a performing asset; consumer tdrs which are 90 days past due based on the restructured terms unless the loan is both well-secured and in the process of collection; and certain other assets, including oreo and other repossessed property. the following table summarizes the bancorps nonperforming loans and leases, by class, as of december 31:
(a)            excludes $21 of restructured nonaccrual loans at december 31, 2014 and 2013 associated with a consolidated vie in which the bancorp has no continuing credit risk due the risk being assumed by a third party.

(d)   excludes $71 and $77 of oreo related to government insured loans at december 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively.
troubled debt restructurings if a borrower is experiencing financial difficulty, the bancorp may consider, in certain circumstances, modifying the terms of their loan to maximize collection of amounts due. within each of the bancorps loan classes, tdrs typically involve either a reduction of the stated interest rate of the loan, an extension of the loans maturity date(s) with a stated rate lower than the current market rate for a new loan with similar risk, or in limited circumstances, a reduction of the principal balance of the loan or the loans accrued interest. modifying the terms of a loan may result in an increase or decrease to the alll depending upon the terms modified, the method used to measure the alll for a loan prior to modification, and whether any charge-offs were recorded on the loan before or at the time of modification. refer to the alll section of note 1 for information on the bancorps alll methodology. upon modification of a loan, the bancorp measures the related impairment as the difference between the estimated future cash flows expected to be collected on the modified loan, discounted at the original effective yield of the loan, and the carrying value of the loan. the resulting measurement may result in the need for minimal or no valuation allowance because it is probable that all cash flows will be collected under the modified terms of the loan. in addition, if the stated interest rate was increased in a tdr, the cash flows on the modified loan, using the pre-modification interest rate as the discount rate, often exceed the recorded investment of the loan. conversely, upon a modification that reduces the stated interest rate on a loan, the bancorp recognizes an impairment loss as an increase to the alll.
if a tdr involves a reduction of the principal balance of the loan or the loans accrued interest, that amount is charged-off to the alll. as of december 31, 2014 and 2013, the bancorp had $89 million and $86 million in line of credit and letter of credit commitments, respectively, to lend additional funds to borrowers whose terms have been modified in a tdr.
110  fifth third bancorp notes to consolidated financial statements the following tables provide a summary of loans modified in a tdr by the bancorp during the years ended december 31:

(b)   represents number of loans post-modification.
(c)                                            excludes five loans modified in a tdr during the year ended december 31, 2013 associated with a consolidated vie in which the bancorp has no continuing credit risk due to the risk being assumed by a third party. the tdr had a recorded investment of $29 at modification, alll increased $7 upon modification, and a charge-off of $2 was recognized upon modification.
the bancorp considers tdrs that become 90 days or more past due under the modified terms as subsequently defaulted. for commercial loans not subject to individual review for impairment, loss rates that are applied for purposes of determining the allowance include historical losses associated with subsequent defaults on loans previously modified in a tdr. for consumer loans, the bancorp performs a qualitative assessment of the adequacy of the consumer alll by comparing the consumer alll to forecasted consumer losses over the projected loss emergence period (the forecasted losses include the impact of subsequent defaults of consumer tdrs). when a residential mortgage, home equity, auto or other consumer loan that has been modified in a tdr subsequently defaults, the present value of expected cash flows used in the measurement of the potential impairment loss is generally limited to the expected net proceeds from the sale of the loans underlying collateral and any resulting impairment loss is reflected as a charge-off or an increase in alll. the bancorp fully reserves for credit card loans modified in a tdr that subsequently default.
111  fifth third bancorp notes to consolidated financial statements the following tables provide a summary of subsequent defaults that occurred during the years ended december 31, 2014 and 2013 and within 12 months of the restructuring date:

7. bank premises and equipment the following is a summary of bank premises and equipment at december 31:
at december 31, 2014 and 2013, land and improvements included $165 million and $196 million, respectively, associated with parcels of undeveloped land intended for future branch expansion. the bancorp monitors changing customer preferences associated with the channels it uses for banking transactions to evaluate the efficiency, competitiveness and quality of the customer service experience of its retail transaction network. as part of this ongoing assessment the bancorp may determine that it is no longer fully committed to maintaining full-service branches at certain of its existing banking center locations. similarly, the bancorp may also determine that it is no longer fully committed to building banking centers on certain parcels of land which had previously been held for future branch expansion. in these circumstances, the bancorp performs an assessment of the recoverability of these long-lived assets. impairment losses associated with such assessments and lower of cost or market adjustments were $20 million, $6 million and $21 million for the years ended december 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. the recognized impairment losses were recorded in other noninterest income in the consolidated statements of income. the bancorps assessment of the recoverability of these asset groups requires the exercise of judgment in projecting the extent and nature of their future use and the related cash flows which may be impacted by unanticipated events or circumstances.
gross occupancy expense for cancelable and noncancelable leases, which is included in net occupancy expense in the consolidated statements of income, was $100 million in 2014, $98 million in 2013 and $99 million in 2012, which was reduced by rental income from leased premises of $17 million in 2014, $16 million in 2013 and $17 million in 2012. the bancorps subsidiaries have entered into a number of noncancelable operating and capital lease agreements with respect to bank premises and equipment.
the following table provides the annual future minimum payments under noncancelable operating leases and capital leases at december 31, 2014:

8. goodwill business combinations entered into by the bancorp typically include the acquisition of goodwill. acquisition activity includes acquisitions in the respective period in addition to purchase accounting adjustments related to previous acquisitions. during the fourth quarter of 2008, the bancorp determined that the commercial banking and consumer lending reporting units goodwill carrying amounts exceeded their associated implied fair values by $750 million and $215 million, respectively. the resulting $965 million goodwill impairment charge was recorded in the fourth quarter of 2008 and represents the total amount of accumulated impairment losses as of december 31, 2014.
changes in the net carrying amount of goodwill, by reporting unit, for the years ended december 31, 2014 and 2013 were as follows:
($ in millions)                                 commercial   branch        consumer         investment   total banking   banking       lending            advisors net carrying value as of december 31, 2012            $613         1,655          -                148        2,416
net carrying value as of december 31, 2013            $613         1,655          -                148        2,416
net carrying value as of december 31,                 $613         1,655          -                148        2,416
the bancorp completed its annual goodwill impairment test as of september 30, 2014 by performing a qualitative assessment of goodwill at the reporting unit level to determine whether any indicators of impairment existed. in performing this qualitative assessment, the bancorp evaluated events and circumstances since the last impairment analysis, macroeconomic conditions, banking industry and market conditions, and key financial metrics of the bancorp as well as reporting unit and overall bancorp financial performance. after assessing the totality of the events and circumstances, the bancorp determined that it was not more likely than not that the fair value of each of its reporting units was less than its carrying amounts and, therefore, the first and second steps of the quantitative goodwill impairment test were deemed unnecessary.

9. intangible assets intangible assets consist of core deposit intangibles, customer lists, non-compete agreements and cardholder relationships. intangible assets are amortized on either a straight-line or an accelerated basis over their estimated useful lives. intangible assets have an estimated remaining weighted-average life at december 31, 2014 of 4.5 years.
the details of the bancorps intangible assets are shown in the following table:
($ in millions)               gross carrying   accumulated       valuation        net carrying amount   amortization      allowance              amount as of december 31, 2014
as of december 31, 2013
as of december 31, 2014, all of the bancorps intangible assets were being amortized. amortization expense recognized on intangible assets for the years ended december 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012 was $4 million, $8 million and $13 million, respectively.
the bancorps projections of amortization expense shown below are based on existing asset balances as of december 31, 2014. future amortization expense may vary from these projections. estimated amortization expense for the years ending december 31, 2015 through 2019 is as follows:

10. variable interest entities the bancorp, in the normal course of business, engages in a variety of activities that involve vies, which are legal entities that lack sufficient equity to finance their activities, or the equity investors of the entities as a group lack any of the characteristics of a controlling interest. the primary beneficiary of a vie is generally the enterprise that has both the power to direct the activities most significant to the economic performance of the vie and the obligation to absorb losses or receive benefits that could potentially be significant to the vie. for certain investment funds, the primary beneficiary is the enterprise that will absorb a majority of the funds expected losses or receive a majority of the funds expected residual returns. the bancorp evaluates its interest in certain entities to determine if these entities meet the definition of a vie and whether the bancorp is the primary beneficiary and should consolidate the entity based on the variable interests it held both at inception and when there is a change in circumstances that requires a reconsideration. if the bancorp is determined to be the primary beneficiary of a vie, it must account for the vie as a consolidated subsidiary. if the bancorp is determined not to be the primary beneficiary of a vie but holds a variable interest in the entity, such variable interests are accounted for under the equity method of accounting or other accounting standards as appropriate.
consolidated vies the following tables provide a summary of the classifications of consolidated vie assets, liabilities and noncontrolling interests included in the consolidated balance sheets as of:
automobile loan securitization in securitization transactions that occurred during 2014 and 2013, the bancorp transferred an aggregate amount of $3.8 billion and $1.3 billion, respectively, in consumer automobile loans to bankruptcy remote trusts which were deemed to be vies. the primary purposes of the vies were to issue asset-backed securities with varying levels of credit subordination and payment priority, as well as residual interests, and to provide the bancorp with access to liquidity for its originated loans. the bancorp retained residual interests in the vies and, therefore, has an obligation to absorb losses and a right to receive benefits from the vies that could potentially be significant to the vies. in addition, the bancorp retained servicing rights for the underlying loans and, therefore, holds the power to direct the activities of the vies that most significantly impact the economic performance of the vies. as a result, the bancorp concluded that it is the primary beneficiary of the vies and, therefore, has consolidated these vies. the assets of the vies are restricted to the settlement of the notes and other obligations of the vies. third-party holders of the notes do not have recourse to the general assets of the bancorp.
the economic performance of the vies is most significantly impacted by the performance of the underlying loans. the principal risks to which the vies are exposed include credit risk and prepayment risk. the credit and prepayment risks are managed through credit enhancements in the form of reserve accounts, overcollateralization, excess interest on the loans and the subordination of certain classes of asset-backed securities to other classes.
cdc investments cdc, a wholly owned indirect subsidiary of the bancorp, was created to invest in projects to create affordable housing, revitalize business and residential areas, and preserve historic landmarks.
116  fifth third bancorp notes to consolidated financial statements cdc generally co-invests with other unrelated companies and/or individuals and typically makes investments in a separate legal entity that owns the property under development. the entities are usually formed as limited partnerships and llcs, and cdc typically invests as a limited partner/investor member in the form of equity contributions. the economic performance of the vies is driven by the performance of their underlying investment projects as well as the vies ability to operate in compliance with the rules and regulations necessary for the qualification of tax credits generated by equity investments. typically, the general partner or managing member will be the party that has the right to make decisions that will most significantly impact the economic performance of the entity. the bancorps subsidiaries serve as the managing member of certain llcs invested in business revitalization projects. the bancorp has provided an indemnification guarantee to the investor member of these llcs related to the qualification of tax credits generated by the investor members investment. accordingly, the bancorp concluded that it is the primary beneficiary and, therefore, has consolidated these vies. as a result, the investor members interests in these vies are presented as noncontrolling interests in the bancorps consolidated financial statements. this presentation includes reporting separately the equity attributable to the noncontrolling interests in the consolidated balance sheets and consolidated statements of changes in equity and reporting separately the comprehensive income attributable to the noncontrolling interests in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income and the net income attributable to the noncontrolling interests in the consolidated statements of income. the bancorps maximum exposure related to these indemnifications at december 31, 2014 and 2013 was $24 million and $21 million, respectively, which is based on an amount required to meet the investor members defined target rate of return.
non-consolidated vies the following tables provide a summary of assets and liabilities carried on the consolidated balance sheets related to non-consolidated vies for which the bancorp holds an interest, but is not the primary beneficiary of the vie, as well as the bancorps maximum exposure to losses associated with its interests in the entities as of:
cdc investments as noted previously, cdc typically invests in vies as a limited partner or investor member in the form of equity contributions. the bancorp has determined that it is not the primary beneficiary of these vies because it lacks the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of the underlying project or the vies ability to operate in compliance with the rules and regulations necessary for the qualification of tax credits generated by equity investments. this power is held by the general partners/managing members who exercise full and exclusive control of the operations of the vies. accordingly, the bancorp accounts for these investments under the equity method of accounting.
the bancorps funding requirements are limited to its invested capital and any additional unfunded commitments for future equity contributions. the bancorps maximum exposure to loss as a result of its involvement with the vies is limited to the carrying amounts of the investments, including the unfunded commitments. the carrying amounts of these investments, which are included in other assets in the consolidated balance sheets, and the liabilities related to the unfunded commitments, which are included in other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets, are included in the previous tables for all periods presented. the bancorp has no other liquidity arrangements or obligations to purchase assets of the vies that would expose the bancorp to a loss. in certain arrangements, the general partner/managing member of the vie has guaranteed a level of projected tax credits to be received by the limited partners/investor members, thereby minimizing a portion of the bancorps risk.
private equity investments the bancorp, through a wholly owned subsidiary, invests as a limited partner in private equity funds which provide the bancorp an opportunity to obtain higher rates of return on invested capital, while also creating cross-selling opportunities for the bancorps commercial products. each of the limited partnerships has an unrelated third-party general partner responsible for appointing the fund manager. the bancorp has not been appointed fund manager for any of these private equity funds. the funds finance primarily all of their activities from the partners capital contributions and investment returns. under the vie consolidation guidance still applicable to the funds, the bancorp has determined that it is not the primary beneficiary of the funds because it does not absorb a majority of the funds expected losses or receive a majority of the funds expected residual returns. therefore, the bancorp accounts for its investments in these limited partnerships under the equity method of accounting.
the bancorp is exposed to losses arising from negative performance of the underlying investments in the private equity funds. as a limited partner, the bancorps maximum exposure to loss is limited to the carrying amounts of the investments plus unfunded commitments. the carrying amounts of these
117 fifth third bancorp notes to consolidated financial statements investments, which are included in other assets in the consolidated balance sheets, are included in the previous tables. also, as of december 31, 2014 and 2013, the unfunded commitment amounts to the funds were $78 million and $90 million, respectively. the bancorp made capital contributions of $27 million and $31 million to private equity funds during 2014 and 2013, respectively. additionally, in response to the issuance of the volcker rule in the fourth quarter of 2013, the bancorp recognized $4 million of otti on its investments in private equity funds during 2013. the bancorp recognized no otti on its investments in private equity funds during 2014. refer to note 27 for further information.
loans provided to vies the bancorp has provided funding to certain unconsolidated vies sponsored by third parties. these vies are generally established to finance certain consumer and small business loans originated by third parties. the entities are primarily funded through the issuance of a loan from the bancorp or syndication through which the bancorp is involved. the sponsor/administrator of the entities is responsible for servicing the underlying assets in the vies. because the sponsor/administrator, not the bancorp, holds the servicing responsibilities, which include the establishment and employment of default mitigation policies and procedures, the bancorp does not hold the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of the entity and, therefore, is not the primary beneficiary.
the principal risk to which these entities are exposed is credit risk related to the underlying assets. the bancorps maximum exposure to loss is equal to the carrying amounts of the loans and unfunded commitments to the vies. the bancorps outstanding loans to these vies, included in commercial loans in the consolidated balance sheets, are included in the previous tables for all periods presented. as of december 31, 2014 and 2013, the bancorps unfunded commitments to these entities were $859 million and $962 million, respectively. the loans and unfunded commitments to these vies are included in the bancorps overall analysis of the alll and reserve for unfunded commitments, respectively. the bancorp does not provide any implicit or explicit liquidity guarantees or principal value guarantees to these vies.
automobile loan securitization in march of 2013, the bancorp recognized an immaterial loss on the securitization and sale of certain automobile loans with a carrying amount of approximately $509 million. the securitization and the resulting sale of all underlying securities qualified for sale accounting. the bancorp has concluded that it is not the primary beneficiary of the trust because it has neither the obligation to absorb losses of the entity that could potentially be significant to the vie nor the right to receive benefits from the entity that could potentially be significant to the vie. the bancorp is not required and does not currently intend to provide any additional financial support to the trust. investors and creditors only have recourse to the assets held by the trust. the interest the bancorp holds in the vie relates to servicing rights that are included in the consolidated balance sheets. the maximum exposure to loss is equal to the carrying value of the servicing asset.
restructured loans as part of loan restructuring efforts, the bancorp received equity capital from certain borrowers to facilitate the restructuring of the borrowers loans. these borrowers meet the definition of a vie because the bancorp was involved in their refinancing and because their equity capital at risk was insufficient to fund ongoing operations. the bancorp accounted for its equity capital investments in these vies under the equity method or cost method of accounting based on its percentage of ownership and ability to exercise significant influence.
the bancorps maximum exposure to loss as a result of its involvement with these vies was limited to the equity capital investments, the principal and accrued interest on the outstanding loans, and any unfunded commitments. the bancorp had outstanding loans to these vies included in commercial loans in the consolidated balance sheets. the bancorp had no unfunded loan commitments to these vies as of december 31, 2014 and 2013. the loans to these vies are included in the bancorps overall analysis of the alll. the bancorp does not provide any implicit or explicit liquidity guarantees or principal value guarantees to these vies.

11. sales of receivables and servicing rights automobile loan securitization in march of 2013, the bancorp recognized an immaterial loss on the securitization and sale of certain automobile loans with a carrying amount of approximately $509 million. the bancorp utilized a securitization trust to facilitate the securitization process. the trust issued asset-backed securities in the form of notes and equity certificates, with varying levels of credit subordination and payment priority. the bancorp does not hold any of the notes or equity certificates issued by the trust, and the investors in these securities have no credit recourse to the bancorps assets for failure of debtors to pay when due. as part of the sale, the bancorp obtained servicing responsibilities and recognized a servicing asset with an initial fair value of $6 million.
residential mortgage loan sales the bancorp sold fixed and adjustable rate residential mortgage loans during 2014, 2013 and 2012. in those sales, the bancorp obtained servicing responsibilities and the investors have no recourse to the bancorps other assets for failure of debtors to pay when due. the bancorp receives annual servicing fees based on a percentage of the outstanding balance. the bancorp identifies classes of servicing assets based on financial asset type and interest rates.
information related to residential mortgage loan sales and the bancorps mortgage banking activity, which is included in mortgage banking net revenue in the consolidated statements of income, for the years ended december 31 is as follows:
servicing rights the following table presents changes in the servicing rights related to residential mortgage and automobile loans for the years ended december 31:

amortization expense recognized on servicing rights for the years ended december 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012 was $121 million, $168 million and $186 million, respectively. the bancorps projections of amortization expense shown below are based on existing asset balances as of december 31, 2014. future amortization expense may vary from these projections.
temporary impairment or impairment recovery, affected through a change in the msr valuation allowance, is captured as a component of mortgage banking net revenue in the consolidated statements of income. the bancorp maintains a non-qualifying hedging strategy to manage a portion of the risk associated with changes in the value of the msr portfolio. this strategy includes the purchase of free-standing derivatives and various available-for-sale securities. the interest income, mark-to-market adjustments and gain or loss from sale activities associated with these portfolios are expected to economically hedge a portion of the change in value of the msr portfolio caused by fluctuating discount rates, earnings rates and prepayment speeds. the fair value of the servicing asset is based on the present value of expected future cash flows.

as of december 31, 2014 and 2013, the key economic assumptions used in measuring the interests in residential mortgage loans that continued to be held by the bancorp at the date of sale or securitization resulting from transactions completed during the years ended december 31 were as follows:
servicing rights              fixed                       6.6                    11.3 %                  10.0 %         n/a                                 7.3                  9.1 %                  10.2 %         n/a servicing rights              adjustable                  3.7                      22.3                    11.7         n/a                                 3.6                   22.8                    11.5         n/a based on historical credit experience, expected credit losses for residential mortgage loan servicing assets have been deemed immaterial, as the bancorp sold the majority of the underlying loans without recourse. at december 31, 2014 and 2013, the bancorp serviced $65.4 billion and $69.2 billion, respectively, of residential mortgage loans for other investors. the value of msrs that continue to be held by the bancorp is subject to credit, prepayment and interest rate risks on the sold financial assets.
at december 31, 2014, the sensitivity of the current fair value of residual cash flows to immediate 10%, 20% and 50% adverse changes in prepayment speed assumptions and immediate 10% and 20% adverse changes in other assumptions are as follows:
prepayment                                                                   residual servicing speed assumption                                                             cash flows impact of adverse weighted-                               impact of adverse change                                                         change on fair fair      average life (in                        on fair value                                              discount              value
(a)   the impact of the weighted-average default rate on the current fair value of residual cash flows for all scenarios is immaterial.
these sensitivities are hypothetical and should be used with caution. as the figures indicate, changes in fair value based on these variations in the assumptions typically cannot be extrapolated because the relationship of the change in assumption to the change in fair value may not be linear. the bancorp believes variations of these levels are reasonably possible; however, there is the potential that adverse changes in key assumptions could be even greater. also, in the previous table, the effect of a variation in a particular assumption on the fair value of the interests that continue to be held by the bancorp is calculated without changing any other assumption; in reality, changes in one factor may result in changes in another (for example, increases in market interest rates may result in lower prepayments), which might magnify or counteract these sensitivities.

12. derivative financial instruments the bancorp maintains an overall risk management strategy that incorporates the use of derivative instruments to reduce certain risks related to interest rate, prepayment and foreign currency volatility. additionally, the bancorp holds derivative instruments for the benefit of its commercial customers and for other business purposes. the bancorp does not enter into unhedged speculative derivative positions.
the bancorps interest rate risk management strategy involves modifying the repricing characteristics of certain financial instruments so that changes in interest rates do not adversely affect the bancorps net interest margin and cash flows. derivative instruments that the bancorp may use as part of its interest rate risk management strategy include interest rate swaps, interest rate floors, interest rate caps, forward contracts, options and swaptions. interest rate swap contracts are exchanges of interest payments, such as fixed-rate payments for floating-rate payments, based on a stated notional amount and maturity date. interest rate floors protect against declining rates, while interest rate caps protect against rising interest rates. forward contracts are contracts in which the buyer agrees to purchase, and the seller agrees to make delivery of, a specific financial instrument at a predetermined price or yield. options provide the purchaser with the right, but not the obligation, to purchase or sell a contracted item during a specified period at an agreed upon price. swaptions are financial instruments granting the owner the right, but not the obligation, to enter into or cancel a swap.
prepayment volatility arises mostly from changes in fair value of the largely fixed-rate msr portfolio, mortgage loans and mortgage-backed securities. the bancorp may enter into various free-standing derivatives (principal-only swaps, interest rate swaptions, interest rate floors, mortgage options, tbas and interest rate swaps) to economically hedge prepayment volatility. principal-only swaps are total return swaps based on changes in the value of the underlying mortgage principal-only trust. tbas are a forward purchase agreement for a mortgage-backed securities trade whereby the terms of the security are undefined at the time the trade is made.
foreign currency volatility occurs as the bancorp enters into certain loans denominated in foreign currencies. derivative instruments that the bancorp may use to economically hedge these foreign denominated loans include foreign exchange swaps and forward contracts.
the bancorp also enters into derivative contracts (including foreign exchange contracts, commodity contracts and interest rate contracts) for the benefit of commercial customers and other business purposes. the bancorp may economically hedge significant exposures related to these free-standing derivatives by entering into offsetting third-party contracts with approved, reputable counterparties with substantially matching terms and currencies. credit risk arises from the possible inability of counterparties to meet the terms of their contracts. the bancorps exposure is limited to the replacement value of the contracts rather than the notional, principal or contract amounts. credit risk is minimized through credit approvals, limits, counterparty collateral and monitoring procedures.
the bancorps derivative assets include certain contractual features in which the bancorp requires the counterparties to provide collateral in the form of cash and securities to offset changes in the fair value of the derivatives, including changes in the fair value due to credit risk of the counterparty. as of december 31, 2014 and 2013, the balance of collateral held by the bancorp for derivative assets was $830 million and $514 million, respectively. the credit component negatively impacting the fair value of derivative assets associated with customer accommodation contracts as of december 31, 2014 and 2013 was $16 million and $12 million, respectively.
in measuring the fair value of derivative liabilities, the bancorp considers its own credit risk, taking into consideration collateral maintenance requirements of certain derivative counterparties and the duration of instruments with counterparties that do not require collateral maintenance. when necessary, the bancorp posts collateral primarily in the form of cash and securities to offset changes in fair value of the derivatives, including changes in fair value due to the bancorps credit risk. as of december 31, 2014 and 2013, the balance of collateral posted by the bancorp for derivative liabilities was $574 million and $559 million, respectively. certain of the bancorps derivative liabilities contain credit-risk related contingent features that could result in the requirement to post additional collateral upon the occurrence of specified events. as of december 31, 2014 and 2013, the fair value of the additional collateral that could be required to be posted as a result of the credit-risk related contingent features being triggered was immaterial to the bancorps consolidated financial statements. the posting of collateral has been determined to remove the need for further consideration of credit risk. as a result, the bancorp determined that the impact of the bancorps credit risk to the valuation of its derivative liabilities was immaterial to the bancorps consolidated financial statements.
the bancorp holds certain derivative instruments that qualify for hedge accounting treatment and are designated as either fair value hedges or cash flow hedges. derivative instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment, or for which hedge accounting is not established, are held as free-standing derivatives. all customer accommodation derivatives are held as free-standing derivatives.
the fair value of derivative instruments is presented on a gross basis, even when the derivative instruments are subject to master netting arrangements. derivative instruments with a positive fair value are reported in other assets in the consolidated balance sheets while derivative instruments with a negative fair value are reported in other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets. cash collateral payables and receivables associated with the derivative instruments are not added to or netted against the fair value amounts. for further information on offsetting derivatives, refer to note 13 of the notes to consolidated financial statements.

122  fifth third bancorp notes to consolidated financial statements fair value hedges the bancorp may enter into interest rate swaps to convert its fixed-rate funding to floating-rate. decisions to convert fixed-rate funding to floating are made primarily through consideration of the asset/liability mix of the bancorp, the desired asset/liability sensitivity and interest rate levels. as of december 31, 2014 and 2013, certain interest rate swaps met the criteria required to qualify for the shortcut method of accounting. based on this shortcut method of accounting treatment, no ineffectiveness is assumed. for interest rate swaps that do not meet the shortcut requirements, an assessment of hedge effectiveness using regression analysis was performed and such swaps were accounted for using the long-haul method. the long-haul method requires a quarterly assessment of hedge effectiveness and measurement of ineffectiveness. for interest rate swaps accounted for as a fair value hedge using the long-haul method, ineffectiveness is the difference between the changes in the fair value of the interest rate swap and changes in fair value of the related hedged item attributable to the risk being hedged. the ineffectiveness on interest rate swaps hedging fixed-rate funding is reported within interest expense in the consolidated statements of income.
the following table reflects the change in fair value of interest rate contracts, designated as fair value hedges, as well as the change in fair value of the related hedged items attributable to the risk being hedged, included in the consolidated statements of income:

hedged cash flow hedges the bancorp may enter into interest rate swaps to convert floating-rate assets and liabilities to fixed rates or to hedge certain forecasted transactions. the assets or liabilities may be grouped in circumstances where they share the same risk exposure that the bancorp desires to hedge. the bancorp may also enter into interest rate caps and floors to limit cash flow variability of floating rate assets and liabilities. as of december 31, 2014, all hedges designated as cash flow hedges were assessed for effectiveness using regression analysis. ineffectiveness is generally measured as the amount by which the cumulative change in the fair value of the hedging instrument exceeds the present value of the cumulative change in the hedged items expected cash flows attributable to the risk being hedged. ineffectiveness is reported within other noninterest income in the consolidated statements of income. the effective portion of the cumulative gains or losses on cash flow hedges are reported within aoci and are reclassified from aoci to current period earnings when the forecasted transaction affects earnings. as of december 31, 2014, the maximum length of time over which the bancorp is hedging its exposure to the variability in future cash flows is 60 months.
reclassified gains and losses on interest rate contracts related to commercial and industrial loans are recorded within interest income in the consolidated statements of income. as of december 31, 2014 and 2013, $23 million and $13 million, respectively, of net deferred gains, net of tax, on cash flow hedges were recorded in aoci in the consolidated balance sheets. as of december 31, 2014, $33 million in net deferred gains, net of tax, recorded in aoci are expected to be reclassified into earnings during the next twelve months. this amount could differ from amounts actually recognized due to changes in interest rates, hedge de-designations, and the addition of other hedges subsequent to december 31, 2014.
during 2014 and 2013, there were no gains or losses reclassified from accumulated aoci into earnings associated with the discontinuance of cash flow hedges because it was probable that the original forecasted transaction would no longer occur by the end of the originally specified time period or within the additional period of time as defined by u.s. gaap.
the following table presents the pretax net gains (losses) recorded in the consolidated statements of income and the consolidated statements of comprehensive income relating to derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges:

free-standing derivative instruments  risk management and other business purposes as part of its overall risk management strategy relative to its mortgage banking activity, the bancorp may enter into various free-standing derivatives (principal-only swaps, interest rate swaptions, interest rate floors, mortgage options, tbas and interest rate swaps) to economically hedge changes in fair value of its largely fixed-rate msr portfolio. principal-only swaps hedge the mortgage-libor spread because these swaps appreciate in value as a result of tightening spreads. principal-only swaps also provide prepayment protection by increasing in value when prepayment speeds increase, as opposed to msrs that lose value in a faster prepayment environment. receive fixed/pay floating interest rate swaps and swaptions increase in value when interest rates do not increase as quickly as expected.
the bancorp enters into forward contracts and mortgage options to economically hedge the change in fair value of certain residential mortgage loans held for sale due to changes in interest rates. irlcs issued on residential mortgage loan commitments that will be held for sale are also considered free-standing derivative instruments and the interest rate exposure on these commitments is economically hedged primarily with forward contracts. revaluation gains and losses from free-standing derivatives related to mortgage banking activity are recorded as a component of mortgage banking net revenue in the consolidated statements of income.
additionally, as part of the bancorps overall risk management strategy with respect to minimizing significant fluctuations in earnings and cash flows caused by interest rate and prepayment volatility, the bancorp may enter into free-standing derivative instruments (options, swaptions and interest rate swaps). the gains
123 fifth third bancorp notes to consolidated financial statements and losses on these derivative contracts are recorded within other noninterest income in the consolidated statements of income.
in conjunction with the initial sale of the bancorps 51% interest in vantiv holding, llc, the bancorp received a warrant and issued a put option, which are accounted for as free-standing derivatives. the put option expired as a result of the vantiv, inc. ipo in march of 2012. refer to note 27 for further discussion of significant inputs and assumptions used in the valuation of the warrant.
in conjunction with the sale of visa, inc. class b shares in 2009, the bancorp entered into a total return swap in which the bancorp will make or receive payments based on subsequent changes in the conversion rate of the class b shares into class a shares. this total return swap is accounted for as a free-standing derivative. refer to note 27 for further discussion of significant inputs and assumptions used in the valuation of this instrument.
the net gains (losses) recorded in the consolidated statements of income relating to free-standing derivative instruments used for risk management and other business purposes are summarized in the following table:

free-standing derivative instruments  customer accommodation the majority of the free-standing derivative instruments the bancorp enters into are for the benefit of its commercial customers. these derivative contracts are not designated against specific assets or liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets or to forecasted transactions and, therefore, do not qualify for hedge accounting. these instruments include foreign exchange derivative contracts entered into for the benefit of commercial customers involved in international trade to hedge their exposure to foreign currency fluctuations and commodity contracts to hedge such items as natural gas and various other derivative contracts. the bancorp may economically hedge significant exposures related to these derivative contracts entered into for the benefit of customers by entering into offsetting contracts with approved, reputable, independent counterparties with substantially matching terms. the bancorp hedges its interest rate exposure on commercial customer transactions by executing offsetting swap agreements with primary dealers. revaluation gains and losses on interest rate, foreign exchange, commodity and other commercial customer derivative contracts are recorded as a component of corporate banking revenue in the consolidated statements of income.
the bancorp enters into risk participation agreements, under which the bancorp assumes credit exposure relating to certain underlying interest rate derivative contracts. the bancorp only enters into these risk participation agreements in instances in which the bancorp has participated in the loan that the underlying interest rate derivative contract was designed to hedge. the bancorp will make payments under these agreements if a customer defaults on its obligation to perform under the terms of the underlying interest rate derivative contract. as of december 31, 2014 and 2013, the total notional amount of the risk participation agreements was $1.1 billion and $1.2 billion, respectively, and the fair value was a liability of $2 million at december 31, 2014 and $3 million at december 31, 2013, which is included in interest rate contracts for customers. as of december 31, 2014, the risk participation agreements had an average remaining life of 2.6 years.
the bancorps maximum exposure in the risk participation agreements is contingent on the fair value of the underlying interest rate derivative contracts in an asset position at the time of default. the bancorp monitors the credit risk associated with the underlying customers in the risk participation agreements through the same risk grading system currently utilized for establishing loss reserves in its loan and lease portfolio.
risk ratings of the notional amount of risk participation agreements under this risk rating system are summarized in the following table:

13. offsetting derivative financial instruments the bancorps derivative transactions are generally governed by isda master agreements and similar arrangements, which include provisions governing the setoff of assets and liabilities between the parties. when the bancorp has more than one outstanding derivative transaction with a single counterparty, the setoff provisions contained within these agreements generally allow the non-defaulting party the right to reduce its liability to the defaulting party by amounts eligible for setoff, including the collateral received as well as eligible offsetting transactions with that counterparty, irrespective of the currency, place of payment, or booking office. the bancorps policy is to present its derivative assets and derivative liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets on a gross basis, even when provisions allowing for setoff are in place.

commitments to extend credit commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend, typically having fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses that may require payment of a fee. since many of the commitments to extend credit may expire without being drawn upon, the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash flow requirements. the bancorp is exposed to credit risk in the event of nonperformance by the counterparty for the amount of the contract. fixed-rate commitments are also subject to market risk resulting from fluctuations in interest rates and the bancorps exposure is limited to the replacement value of those commitments. as of december 31, 2014 and 2013, the bancorp had a reserve for unfunded commitments, including letters of credit, totaling $135 million and $162 million, respectively, included in other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets. the bancorp monitors the credit risk associated with commitments to extend credit using the same risk rating system utilized within its loan and lease portfolio.
risk ratings under this risk rating system are summarized in the following table as of december 31:
letters of credit standby and commercial letters of credit are conditional commitments issued to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party and expire as summarized in the following table as of december 31, 2014:
(a)   includes $88 and $17 issued on behalf of commercial customers to facilitate trade payments in u.s. dollars and foreign currencies which expire less than one year and between one and five years, respectively.

130 fifth third bancorp notes to consolidated financial statements risk ratings under this risk rating system are summarized in the following table as of december 31:
at december 31, 2014 and 2013, the bancorp had outstanding letters of credit that were supporting certain securities issued as vrdns. the bancorp facilitates financing for its commercial customers, which consist of companies and municipalities, by marketing the vrdns to investors. the vrdns pay interest to holders at a rate of interest that fluctuates based upon market demand. the vrdns generally have long-term maturity dates, but can be tendered by the holder for purchase at par value upon proper advance notice. when the vrdns are tendered, a remarketing agent generally finds another investor to purchase the vrdns to keep the securities outstanding in the market. as of december 31, 2014 and 2013, total vrdns in which the bancorp was the remarketing agent or were supported by a bancorp letter of credit were $1.7 billion and $2.1 billion of which fts acted as the remarketing agent to issuers on $1.4 billion and $1.8 billion, respectively. as remarketing agent, fts is responsible for finding purchasers for vrdns that are put by investors. the bancorp issued letters of credit, as a credit enhancement, to $1.2 billion and $1.5 billion of the vrdns remarketed by fts, in addition to $247 million and $300 million in vrdns remarketed by third parties at december 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. these letters of credit are included in the total letters of credit balance provided in the previous table.
forward contracts to sell mortgage loans the bancorp enters into forward contracts to economically hedge the change in fair value of certain residential mortgage loans held for sale due to changes in interest rates. the outstanding notional amounts of these forward contracts are included in the summary of significant commitments table for all periods presented.
noncancelable lease obligations and other commitments the bancorps subsidiaries have entered into a number of noncancelable lease agreements. the minimum rental commitments under noncancelable lease agreements are shown in the summary of significant commitments table. the bancorp has also entered into a limited number of agreements for work related to banking center construction and to purchase goods or services.
contingent liabilities private mortgage reinsurance for certain mortgage loans originated by the bancorp, borrowers may be required to obtain pmi provided by third-party insurers. in some instances, these insurers cede a portion of the pmi premiums to the bancorp, and the bancorp provides reinsurance coverage within a specified range of the total pmi coverage. the bancorps reinsurance coverage typically ranges from 5% to 10% of the total pmi coverage. the bancorps maximum exposure in the event of nonperformance by the underlying borrowers is equivalent to the bancorps total outstanding reinsurance coverage, which was $29 million at december 31, 2014 and $37 million at december 31, 2013. as of december 31, 2014 and 2013, the bancorp maintained a reserve of $2 million and $10 million, respectively, related to exposures within the reinsurance portfolio which was included in other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets. during 2009, the bancorp suspended the practice of providing reinsurance of pmi for newly originated mortgage loans.
legal claims there are legal claims pending against the bancorp and its subsidiaries that have arisen in the normal course of business. refer to note 18 for additional information regarding these proceedings.
guarantees the bancorp has performance obligations upon the occurrence of certain events under financial guarantees provided in certain contractual arrangements as discussed in the following sections.
residential mortgage loans sold with representation and warranty provisions conforming residential mortgage loans sold to unrelated third parties are generally sold with representation and warranty provisions. a contractual liability arises only in the event of a breach of these representations and warranties and, in general, only when a loss results from the breach. the bancorp may be required to repurchase any previously sold loan or indemnify (make whole) the investor or insurer for which the representation or warranty of the bancorp proves to be inaccurate, incomplete or misleading.
the bancorp establishes a residential mortgage repurchase reserve related to various representations and warranties that reflects managements estimate of losses based on a combination of factors. the bancorps estimation process requires management to make subjective and complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain, such as, future demand expectations, economic factors and the specific characteristics of the loans subject to repurchase. such factors incorporate historical investor audit and repurchase demand rates, appeals success rates, historical loss severity and any additional information obtained from the gses regarding future mortgage repurchase and file request criteria. at the time of a loan sale, the bancorp records a representation and warranty reserve at the estimated fair value of the bancorps guarantee and continually updates the reserve during the life of the loan as losses in excess of the reserve become probable and reasonably estimable. the provision for the estimated fair value of the representation and warranty guarantee arising from the loan sales is recorded as an adjustment to the gain on sale, which is included in other noninterest income at the time of sale. updates to the reserve are recorded in other noninterest expense.
during the fourth quarter of 2013, the bancorp settled certain repurchase claims related to mortgage loans originated and sold to fhlmc prior to january 1, 2009 for $25 million, after paid claim credits and other adjustments. the settlement removes the bancorps responsibility to repurchase or indemnify fhlmc for representation and warranty violations on any loan sold prior to january 1, 2009 except in limited circumstances.
as of december 31, 2014 and 2013, the bancorp maintained reserves related to loans sold with representation and warranty provisions totaling $35 million and $44 million, respectively, included in other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets.
131 fifth third bancorp notes to consolidated financial statements the bancorp uses the best information available to it in estimating its mortgage representation and warranty reserve, however, the estimation process is inherently uncertain and imprecise and, accordingly, losses in excess of the amounts accrued as of december 31, 2014, are reasonably possible. the bancorp currently estimates that it is reasonably possible that it could incur losses related to mortgage representation and warranty provisions in an amount up to approximately $57 million in excess of amounts reserved. this estimate was derived by modifying the key assumptions discussed above to reflect managements judgment regarding reasonably possible adverse changes to those assumptions. the actual repurchase losses could vary significantly from the recorded mortgage representation and warranty reserve or this estimate of reasonably possibly losses, depending on the outcome of various factors, including those noted above.
during 2014 and 2013, the bancorp paid $11 million and $64 million, respectively, in the form of make whole payments and repurchased $59 million and $89 million, respectively, in outstanding principal of loans to satisfy investor demands. total repurchase demand requests during 2014 and 2013 were $97 million and $263 million, respectively. total outstanding repurchase demand inventory was $7 million at december 31, 2014 compared to $46 million at december 31, 2013.

residential mortgage loans sold with credit recourse the bancorp sold certain residential mortgage loans in the secondary market with credit recourse. in the event of any customer default, pursuant to the credit recourse provided, the bancorp is required to reimburse the third party. the maximum amount of credit risk in the event of nonperformance by the underlying borrowers is equivalent to the total outstanding balance. in the event of nonperformance, the bancorp has rights to the underlying collateral value securing the loan. the outstanding balances on these loans sold with credit recourse were $548 million and $579 million at december 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively, and the delinquency rates were 4.0% at december 31, 2014 and 4.4% at december 31, 2013. the bancorp maintained an estimated credit loss reserve on these loans sold with credit recourse of $11 million at december 31, 2014 and $16 million at december 31, 2013 recorded in other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets. to determine the credit loss reserve, the bancorp used an approach that is consistent with its overall approach in estimating credit losses for various categories of residential mortgage loans held in its loan portfolio.
margin accounts fts, a subsidiary of the bancorp, guarantees the collection of all margin account balances held by its brokerage clearing agent for the benefit of its customers. fts is responsible for payment to its brokerage clearing agent for any loss, liability, damage, cost or expense incurred as a result of customers failing to comply with margin or margin maintenance calls on all margin accounts. the margin account balance held by the brokerage clearing agent was $13 million at december 31, 2014 and $12 million at december 31, 2013. in the event of any customer default, fts has rights to the underlying collateral provided. given the existence of the underlying collateral provided and negligible historical credit losses, the bancorp does not maintain a loss reserve related to the margin accounts.
long-term borrowing obligations the bancorp had certain fully and unconditionally guaranteed long-term borrowing obligations issued by wholly-owned issuing trust entities of $62 million as of december 31, 2014.
visa litigation the bancorp, as a member bank of visa prior to visas reorganization and ipo (the ipo) of its class a common shares (the class a shares) in 2008, had certain indemnification obligations pursuant to visas certificate of incorporation and by-laws and in accordance with their membership agreements. in accordance with visas by-laws prior to the ipo, the bancorp could have been required to indemnify visa for the bancorps
132 fifth third bancorp notes to consolidated financial statements proportional share of losses based on the pre-ipo membership interests. as part of its reorganization and ipo, the bancorps indemnification obligation was modified to include only certain known litigation (the covered litigation) as of the date of the restructuring. this modification triggered a requirement for the bancorp to recognize a liability equal to the fair value of the indemnification liability.
in conjunction with the ipo, the bancorp received 10.1 million of visas class b common shares (the class b shares) based on the bancorps membership percentage in visa prior to the ipo. the class b shares are not transferable (other than to another member bank) until the later of the third anniversary of the ipo closing or the date which the covered litigation has been resolved; therefore, the bancorps class b shares were classified in other assets and accounted for at their carryover basis of $0. visa deposited $3 billion of the proceeds from the ipo into a litigation escrow account, established for the purpose of funding judgments in, or settlements of, the covered litigation. if visas litigation committee determines that the escrow account is insufficient, then visa will issue additional class a shares and deposit the proceeds from the sale of the class a shares into the litigation escrow account. when visa funds the litigation escrow account, the class b shares are subject to dilution through an adjustment in the conversion rate of class b shares into class a shares.
in 2009, the bancorp completed the sale of the class b shares and entered into a total return swap in which the bancorp will make or receive payments based on subsequent changes in the conversion rate of the class b shares into class a shares. the swap terminates on the later of the third anniversary of visas ipo or the date on which the covered litigation is settled. refer to note 27 for additional information on the valuation of the swap. the counterparty to the swap as a result of its ownership of the class b shares will be impacted by dilutive adjustments to the conversion rate of the class b shares into class a shares caused by any covered litigation losses in excess of the litigation escrow account. if actual judgments in, or settlements of, the covered litigation significantly exceed current expectations, then additional funding by visa of the litigation escrow account and the resulting dilution of the class b shares could result in a scenario where the bancorps ultimate exposure associated with the covered litigation (the visa litigation exposure) exceeds the value of the class b shares owned by the swap counterparty (the class b value). in the event the bancorp concludes that it is probable that the visa litigation exposure exceeds the class b value, the bancorp would record a litigation reserve liability and a corresponding amount of other noninterest expense for the amount of the excess. any such litigation reserve liability would be separate and distinct from the fair value derivative liability associated with the total return swap.
as of the date of the bancorps sale of the class b shares and through december 31, 2014, the bancorp has concluded that it is not probable that the visa litigation exposure will exceed the class b value. based on this determination, upon the sale of the class b shares, the bancorp reversed its net visa litigation reserve liability and recognized a free-standing derivative liability associated with the total return swap. the fair value of the swap liability was $49 million and $48 million at december 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. refer to notes 12 and 18 for further information.
after the bancorps sale of the class b shares, visa has funded additional amounts into the litigation escrow account which have resulted in further dilution in the conversion of class b shares into class a shares, and along with other terms of the total return swap, required the bancorp to make cash payments to the swap counterparty as follows:

18. legal and regulatory proceedings during april 2006, the bancorp was added as a defendant in a consolidated antitrust class action lawsuit originally filed against visa®, mastercard® and several other major financial institutions in the united states district court for the eastern district of new york. the plaintiffs, merchants operating commercial businesses throughout the u.s. and trade associations, claimed that the interchange fees charged by card-issuing banks were unreasonable and sought injunctive relief and unspecified damages. in addition to being a named defendant, the bancorp is also subject to a possible indemnification obligation of visa as discussed in note 17 and has also entered into judgment and loss sharing agreements with visa, mastercard and certain other named defendants. in october 2012, the parties to the litigation entered into a settlement agreement. the court entered a class settlement preliminary approval order in november 2012. pursuant to the terms of the settlement agreement, the bancorp paid $46 million into a class settlement escrow account. previously, the bancorp paid an additional $4 million in another settlement escrow in connection with the settlement of claims from plaintiffs not included in the class action. more than 7,900 merchants have requested exclusion from the class settlement. pursuant to the terms of the settlement agreement, 25% of the funds paid into the class settlement escrow account have been returned to the control of the defendants through class exclusion takedown payments. approximately 460 of the merchants who requested exclusion from the class have filed separate federal lawsuits against visa, mastercard and certain other defendants alleging similar antitrust violations. these opt-out federal lawsuits have been transferred to the united states district court for the eastern district of new york. the bancorp was not named as a defendant in any of the opt-out federal lawsuits, but may have obligations pursuant to indemnification arrangements and/or the judgment or loss sharing agreements noted above. in addition, one merchant filed a separate state court lawsuit against visa, mastercard and certain other defendants, including the bancorp, alleging similar antitrust violations. on january 14, 2014, the court entered a final order approving the class settlement. a number of merchants have filed appeals from that approval. on july 18, 2014, the court in which all but one of the opt-out federal lawsuits has been consolidated denied defendants motion to dismiss the complaints. several of the opt-out federal lawsuits have been resolved. refer to note 17 for further information.
in 2008, two cases were filed in the united states district court for the southern district of ohio against the bancorp and certain officers styled dudenhoeffer v fifth third bancorp et al. case no. 1:08-cv-538. the complaints alleged violations of erisa based on allegations similar to those set forth in the previously reported securities class action cases. the erisa actions were dismissed by the trial court, but the sixth circuit court of appeals reversed the trial court decision. the bancorp petitioned the united states supreme court to review and reverse the sixth circuit decision and sought a stay of proceedings in the trial court pending appeal. on december 13, 2013, the supreme court granted certiorari and agreed to hear the appeal. oral arguments were held on april 2, 2014 and on june 25, 2014 the supreme court unanimously vacated the sixth circuit decision and remanded the case for further proceedings consistent with the standards articulated in its decision. the supreme court issued its mandate remanding the case back to the sixth circuit court of appeals but no further proceedings have occurred.
in november 2014, a shareholder of the bancorp filed a shareholder derivative suit in the court of common pleas for hamilton county, ohio, against current and former members of the bancorps board of directors, the bancorps former chief financial officer and current executive vice president, daniel t. poston, the bancorps chief executive officer, kevin t. kabat, and, nominally, the bancorp. the suit alleges breach of fiduciary duty, waste of corporate assets and unjust enrichment in connection with the bancorps alleged violations of federal and state securities laws, among other charges, in relation to its administrative settlement with the united states securities and exchange commission announced on december 4, 2013 to resolve the previously reported investigation of the bancorps historical accounting and reporting with respect to certain commercial loans that were sold or reclassified as held for sale by the bancorp in the fourth quarter of 2008. the suit seeks, among other things, unspecified monetary damages, disgorgement of profits, certain corporate governance and personnel actions and compliance and disclosure changes. on january 16, 2015 a motion to dismiss the complaint was filed on behalf of all defendants. the impact of the final disposition of this lawsuit cannot be assessed at this time.
the bancorp and its subsidiaries are not parties to any other material litigation. however, there are other litigation matters that arise in the normal course of business. while it is impossible to ascertain the ultimate resolution or range of financial liability with respect to these contingent matters, management believes any resulting liability from these other actions would not have a material effect upon the bancorps consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
the bancorp and/or its affiliates are involved in information-gathering requests, reviews, investigations and proceedings (both formal and informal) by various governmental regulatory agencies and law enforcement authorities, as well as self-regulatory bodies regarding their respective businesses. additional matters will likely arise from time to time. any of these matters may result in material adverse consequences to the bancorp, its affiliates and/or their respective directors, officers and other personnel, including adverse judgments, findings, settlements, fines, penalties, orders, injunctions or other actions, amendments and/or restatements of the bancorps sec filings and/or financial statements, as applicable, and/or determinations of material weaknesses in our disclosure controls and procedures. investigations by regulatory authorities may from time to time result in civil or criminal referrals to law enforcement authorities such as the department of justice or a united states attorney. among other matters, the bancorp has been cooperating with the department of justice, the department of housing and urban development and the federal housing finance authority in civil investigations regarding compliance with requirements relating to certain federal housing agency-insured loans and certain loans sold to government sponsored entities originated by affiliates of the bancorp. the investigations could lead to liability under the federal false claims act and/or the federal financial institutions reform, recovery and enforcement act of 1989, which allow up to treble and other special damages substantially in excess of actual losses. additionally, the bancorp is also cooperating with an investigation by the department of justice to determine whether the bank engaged in any discriminatory practices in connection with the banks indirect automobile loan portfolio. any claim resulting from this investigation could include direct and indirect damages and civil money penalties.
the bancorp is party to numerous claims and lawsuits as well as threatened or potential actions or claims concerning matters arising from the conduct of its business activities. the outcome of claims or litigation and the timing of ultimate resolution are inherently difficult to predict. the following factors, among others, contribute to this lack of predictability: plaintiff claims often include significant legal uncertainties, damages alleged by plaintiffs are often unspecified or overstated, discovery may not have started or may not be complete and material facts may be disputed or
134  fifth third bancorp notes to consolidated financial statements unsubstantiated. as a result of these factors, the bancorp is not always able to provide an estimate of the range of reasonably possible outcomes for each claim. a reserve for a potential litigation loss is established when information related to the loss contingency indicates both that a loss is probable and that the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. any such reserve is adjusted from time to time thereafter as appropriate to reflect changes in circumstances. the bancorp also determines, when possible (due to the uncertainties described above), estimates of reasonably possible losses or ranges of reasonably possible losses, in excess of amounts reserved. under u.s. gaap, an event is reasonably possible if the chance of the future event or events occurring is more than remote but less than likely and an event is remote if the chance of the future event or events occurring is slight. thus, references to the upper end of the range of reasonably possible loss for cases in which the bancorp is able to estimate a range of reasonably possible loss mean the upper end of the range of loss for cases for which the bancorp believes the risk of loss is more than slight. for matters where the bancorp is able to estimate such possible losses or ranges of possible losses, the bancorp currently estimates that it is reasonably possible that it could incur losses related to legal and regulatory proceedings including the matters discussed above in an aggregate amount up to approximately $105 million in excess of amounts reserved, with it also being reasonably possible that no losses will be incurred in these matters. the estimates included in this amount are based on the bancorps analysis of currently available information, and as new information is obtained the bancorp may change its estimates.
for these matters and others where an unfavorable outcome is reasonably possible but not probable, there may be a range of possible losses in excess of the established reserve that cannot be estimated. based on information currently available, advice of counsel, available insurance coverage and established reserves, the bancorp believes that the eventual outcome of the actions against the bancorp and/or its subsidiaries, including the matters described above, will not, individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on the bancorps consolidated financial position. however, in the event of unexpected future developments, it is possible that the ultimate resolution of those matters, if unfavorable, may be material to the bancorps results of operations for any particular period, depending, in part, upon the size of the loss or liability imposed and the operating results for the applicable period.

19. related party transactions the bancorp maintains written policies and procedures covering related party transactions to principal shareholders, directors and executives of the bancorp. these procedures cover transactions such as employee-stock purchase loans, personal lines of credit, residential secured loans, overdrafts, letters of credit and increases in indebtedness. such transactions are subject to the bancorps normal underwriting and approval procedures. prior to approving a loan to a related party, compliance risk management must review and determine whether the transaction requires approval from or a post notification to the bancorps board of directors. at december 31, 2014 and 2013, certain directors, executive officers, principal holders of bancorp common stock, associates of such persons, and affiliated companies of such persons were indebted, including undrawn commitments to lend, to the bancorps banking subsidiary.
commitments to lend, net of participations:
executive officers                                                                      3           2
outstanding balance on loans, net of participations and undrawn commitments           $63          86
the commitments to lend are in the form of loans and guarantees for various business and personal interests. this indebtedness was incurred in the ordinary course of business on substantially the same terms, including interest rates and collateral, as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with unrelated parties. this indebtedness does not involve more than the normal risk of repayment or present other features unfavorable to the bancorp.
on june 30, 2009, the bancorp completed the sale of a majority interest in its processing business, vantiv holding, llc. advent international acquired an approximate 51% interest in vantiv holding, llc for cash and a warrant. the bancorp retained the remaining approximate 49% interest in vantiv holding, llc.
during the first quarter of 2012, vantiv, inc. priced an ipo of its shares and contributed the net proceeds to vantiv holding, llc for additional ownership interests. as a result of this offering, the bancorps ownership of vantiv holding, llc was reduced to approximately 39%. the impact of the capital contributions to vantiv holding, llc and the resulting dilution in the bancorps interest resulted in a gain of $115 million recognized by the bancorp in the first quarter of 2012.
the following table provides a summary of the sales transactions that impacted the bancorps ownership interest in vantiv holding, llc after the initial ipo:
(a)    the bancorps remaining investment in vantiv holding, llc of $394 as of december 31, 2014 was accounted for as an equity method investment in the bancorps consolidated financial statements.
as of december 31, 2014, the bancorp continued to hold approximately 43 million class b units of vantiv holding, llc and a warrant to purchase approximately 20.4 million class c non-voting units of vantiv holding, llc, both of which may be exchanged for class a common stock of vantiv, inc. on a one for one basis or at vantiv, inc.s option for cash. in addition, the bancorp holds approximately 43 million class b common shares of vantiv, inc. the class b common shares give the bancorp voting rights, but no economic interest in vantiv, inc. the voting rights attributable to the class b common shares are limited to 18.5% of the voting power in vantiv, inc. at any time other than in connection with a stockholder vote with respect to a change in control in vantiv, inc. these securities are subject to certain terms and restrictions.
the bancorp recognized $48 million, $77 million and $61 million respectively, in noninterest income as part of its equity method investment in vantiv holding, llc for the years ended december 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012 and received cash distributions totaling $23 million, $40 million and $30 million during 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively.
the bancorp and vantiv holding, llc have various agreements in place covering services relating to the operations of vantiv holding, llc. the services provided by the bancorp to vantiv holding, llc were initially required to support vantiv holding, llc as a standalone entity during the deconversion period. the majority of services previously provided by the bancorp to support vantiv holding, inc. as a standalone entity are no longer necessary and are now limited to certain general business resources. vantiv holding, llc paid the bancorp $1 million for these services for the years ended december 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. other services provided to vantiv holding, llc by the bancorp, have continued beyond the deconversion period, include clearing, settlement and sponsorship. vantiv holding, llc paid the bancorp $44 million for these services for the year ended december 31, 2014 and $34 million for the years ended december 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively. in addition to the previously mentioned services, the bancorp entered into an agreement under which vantiv holding, llc will provide processing services to the bancorp. the total amount of fees relating to the processing services provided to the bancorp by vantiv holding, llc totaled $83 million, $88
136 fifth third bancorp notes to consolidated financial statements million and $83 million for the years ended december 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively.
as part of the initial sale, vantiv holding, llc assumed loans totaling $1.25 billion owed to the bancorp, which were refinanced in 2010 into a larger syndicated loan structure that included the bancorp. the outstanding balance of loans to vantiv holding, llc was $204 million and $348 million at december 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. interest income relating to the loans was $5 million, $7 million and $11 million, respectively, for the years ended december 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012 and is included in interest and fees on loans and leases in the consolidated statements of income. vantiv holding, llcs line of credit was $50 million as of december 31, 2014 and 2013. vantiv holding, llc did not draw upon its line of credit during the years ended december 31, 2014 or 2013.
20. income taxes the bancorp and its subsidiaries file a consolidated federal income tax return. the following is a summary of applicable income taxes included in the consolidated statements of income for the years ended december 31:
deferred income tax expense (benefit):
state taxes, net of federal benefit                       1.4                 1.2                 1.7
unrealized stock-based compensation benefits                -                 0.3                 0.8
tax-exempt income in the rate reconciliation table includes interest on municipal bonds, interest on tax-exempt lending, income/charges on life insurance policies held by the bancorp, and certain gains on sales of leases that are exempt from federal taxation.
the following table provides a reconciliation of the beginning and ending amounts of the bancorps unrecognized tax benefits:
unrecognized tax benefits at january 1                                 $7           18               14
lapse of applicable statute of limitations                              -           (1   )           (1   )
unrecognized tax benefits at december 31(a)                           $11            7               18
(a)   amounts represent unrecognized tax benefits that if recognized would affect the annual effective tax rate.
the bancorps unrecognized tax benefits as of december 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012 relate to state income tax exposures from taking tax positions where the bancorp believes it is likely that, upon examination, a state will take a position contrary to the position taken by the bancorp.
while it is reasonably possible that the amount of the unrecognized tax benefits with respect to certain of the bancorps uncertain tax positions could increase or decrease during the next 12 months, the bancorp believes it is unlikely that its unrecognized tax benefits will change by a material amount during the next 12 months.
137  fifth third bancorp notes to consolidated financial statements deferred income taxes are comprised of the following items at december 31:
state net operating losses                                           18                  22
at december 31, 2014 and 2013, the bancorp had recorded deferred tax assets of $18 million and $22 million, respectively, related to state net operating loss carryforwards. the deferred tax assets relating to state net operating losses (primarily resulting from leasing operations) are presented net of specific valuation allowances of $19 million at december 31, 2014 and 2013. if these carryforwards are not utilized, they will expire in varying amounts through 2034.
the bancorp has determined that a valuation allowance is not needed against the remaining deferred tax assets as of december 31, 2014 or 2013. the bancorp considered all of the positive and negative evidence available to determine whether it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will ultimately be realized and, based upon that evidence, the bancorp believes it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets recorded at december 31, 2014 and 2013 will ultimately be realized. the bancorp reached this conclusion as the bancorp has taxable income in the carryback period and it is expected that the bancorps remaining deferred tax assets will be realized through the reversal of its existing taxable temporary differences and its projected future taxable income.
the irs is currently examining the bancorps 2010 and 2011 federal income tax returns. the statute of limitations for the bancorps federal income tax returns remains open for tax years
2010-2014. on occasion, as various state and local taxing jurisdictions examine the returns of the bancorp and its subsidiaries, the bancorp may agree to extend the statute of limitations for a short period of time. otherwise, with the exception of a few states with insignificant uncertain tax positions, the statutes of limitations for state income tax returns remain open only for tax years in accordance with each states statutes.
any interest and penalties incurred in connection with income taxes are recorded as a component of income tax expense in the consolidated financial statements. during the years ended december 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, the bancorp recognized an immaterial amount of interest expense in connection with income taxes. at december 31, 2014 and 2013, the bancorp had accrued interest liabilities, net of the related tax benefits, of $1 million. no material liabilities were recorded for penalties related to income taxes.
retained earnings at december 31, 2014 and 2013 included $157 million in allocations of earnings for bad debt deductions of former thrift subsidiaries for which no income tax has been provided. under current tax law, if certain of the bancorps subsidiaries use these bad debt reserves for purposes other than to absorb bad debt losses, they will be subject to federal income tax at the current corporate tax rate.
21. retirement and benefit plans the bancorps qualified defined benefit plans benefits were frozen in 1998, except for grandfathered employees. the bancorps other retirement plans consist of nonqualified, supplemental retirement plans, which are funded on an as needed basis. a majority of these plans were obtained in acquisitions from prior years. the bancorp recognizes the overfunded and underfunded status of its pension plans as an asset and liability in the consolidated balance sheets.
the overfunded and underfunded amounts recognized in other assets and other liabilities, respectively, on the consolidated balance sheets were as follows as of december 31:
prepaid benefit cost            $-                       6
accrued benefit liability            (52   )           (27   )

(a)   for further information on fair value hierarchy levels, refer to note 1.
the following is a description of the valuation methodologies used for instruments measured at fair value, as well as the general classification of such instruments pursuant to the valuation hierarchy.
equity securities the plan measures common stock using quoted prices which are available in an active market and classifies these investments within level 1 of the valuation hierarchy.
mutual and exchange traded funds all of the plans mutual and exchange traded funds are publicly traded. the plan measures the value of these investments using the funds quoted prices that are available in an active market and classifies these investments within level 1 of the valuation hierarchy. where quoted prices are not available, the plan measures the fair value of these investments based on the redemption price of units held, which is based on the current fair value of the funds underlying assets. unit values are determined by dividing the funds net assets at fair value by its units outstanding at the valuation dates to obtain the investments net asset value. therefore, these investments are classified within level 2 of the valuation hierarchy.
140  fifth third bancorp notes to consolidated financial statements debt securities where quoted prices are available in an active market, securities are classified within level 1 of the valuation hierarchy. level 1 securities include u.s. treasury obligations and federal agency securities. if quoted market prices are not available, then fair values are estimated using pricing models, quoted prices of securities with similar characteristics, or dcfs. examples of such instruments, which are classified within level 2 of the valuation hierarchy, include agency mortgage-backed securities, non-agency mortgage-backed securities and corporate bonds.
plan assumptions the plan assumptions are evaluated annually and are updated as necessary. the discount rate assumption reflects the yield on a portfolio of high quality fixed-income instruments that have a similar duration to the plans liabilities. the expected long-term rate of return assumption reflects the average return expected on the assets invested to provide for the plans liabilities. in determining the expected long-term rate of return, the bancorp evaluated actuarial and economic inputs, including long-term inflation rate assumptions and broad equity and bond indices long-term return projections, as well as actual long-term historical plan performance. in 2014, the bancorp updated the mortality assumption which resulted in an increase of $14 million to the projected benefit obligation.
for measuring benefit obligations at year end:
rate of compensation increase                         n/a(a)          4.00          4.00
for measuring net periodic benefit cost:
rate of compensation increase                         n/a(a)          4.00          5.00
(a)   since the bancorps qualified defined benefit plans benefits were frozen in 1998, except for grandfathered employees, the rate of compensation increase is no longer applicable beginning in 2014 since minimal grandfathered employees are still accruing benefits.
lowering both the expected rate of return on the plan assets and the discount rate by 0.25% would have increased the 2014 pension expense by approximately $1 million.
based on the actuarial assumptions, the bancorp expects to contribute $4 million to the plan in 2015. estimated pension benefit payments, which reflect expected future service, are $22 million in 2015, $21 million in 2016, $19 million in 2017, $18 million in 2018 and $16 million in 2019. the total estimated payments for the years 2020 through 2024 is $80 million.
investment policies and strategies the bancorps policy for the investment of plan assets is to employ investment strategies that achieve a range of weighted-average target asset allocations relating to equity securities (including the bancorps common stock), fixed-income securities (including federal agency obligations, corporate bonds and notes), alternative strategies (including traditional mutual funds, precious metals and commodities) and cash.
the following table provides the bancorps targeted and actual weighted-average asset allocations by asset category for the years ended december 31:
alternative strategies                       8-18          12         7
(a)   includes mutual and exchange traded funds.
the risk tolerance for the plan is determined by management to be moderate to aggressive, recognizing that higher returns involve some volatility and that periodic declines in the portfolios value are tolerated in an effort to achieve real capital growth. there were no significant concentrations of risk associated with the investments of the bancorps benefit and retirement plan at december 31, 2014 and 2013.
permitted asset classes of the plan include cash and cash equivalents, fixed-income (domestic and non-u.s. bonds), equities (u.s., non-u.s., emerging markets and reits), equipment leasing, precious metals, commodity transactions and mortgages. the plan utilizes derivative instruments including puts, calls, straddles or other option strategies, as approved by management. per erisa, the bancorps common stock cannot exceed 10% of the fair value of plan assets.
fifth third bank, as trustee, is expected to manage the plan assets in a manner consistent with the plan agreement and other regulatory, federal and state laws. the fifth third bank pension, profit sharing and medical plan committee (the committee) is the plan administrator. the trustee is required to provide to the committee monthly and quarterly reports covering a list of plan assets, portfolio performance, transactions and asset allocation. the trustee is also required to keep the committee apprised of any

the bancorp entered into a number of accelerated share repurchase transactions during 2012, 2013 and 2014. as part of these transactions, the bancorp entered into forward contracts in which the final number of shares delivered at settlement was based generally on a discount to the average daily volume weighted average price of the bancorps common stock during the term of these repurchase agreements. the accelerated share repurchases were treated as two separate transactions (i) the acquisition of treasury shares on the acquisition date and (ii) a forward contract indexed to the bancorps stock.
146  fifth third bancorp notes to consolidated financial statements the following table presents a summary of the bancorps accelerated share repurchase transactions that were entered into or settled during 2012, 2013 and 2014. for more information on a subsequent event related to capital actions refer to note 31 of the notes to consolidated financial statements.
24. stock-based compensation the bancorp has historically emphasized employee stock ownership. the following table provides detail of the number of shares to be issued upon exercise of outstanding stock-based awards and remaining shares available for future issuance under all of the bancorps equity compensation plans as of december 31, 2014:
plan category (shares in thousands)                  number of shares to be      weighted-average      shares available for issued upon exercise        exercise              future issuance price equity compensation plans approved by shareholders                                                                  30,786 (a)

(a)   under the 2014 incentive compensation plan, 36 million shares of stock were authorized for issuance as incentive and nonqualified stock options, sars, restricted stock and restricted stock units, performance units and performance rsas.
(b)   the number of shares to be issued upon exercise will be determined at vesting based on the difference between the grant price and the market price at the date of exercise.
(c)                           excludes 0.3 million outstanding options awarded under plans assumed by the bancorp in connection with certain mergers and acquisitions. the bancorp has not made any awards under these plans and will make no additional awards under these plans. the weighted-average exercise price of the outstanding options is $13.76 per share.
(e)   the number of shares to be issued is dependent upon the bancorp achieving certain predefined performance targets and ranges from zero shares to approximately 2 million shares.
(f)         represents remaining shares of fifth third common stock under the bancorps 1993 stock purchase plan, as amended and restated, including an additional 1.5 million shares approved by shareholders on march 28, 2007 and an additional 12 million shares approved by shareholders on april 21, 2009.
stock-based awards are eligible for issuance under the bancorps incentive compensation plan to key employees and directors of the bancorp and its subsidiaries. the incentive compensation plan was approved by shareholders on april 15, 2014, and authorized the issuance of up to 36 million shares, including 16 million shares for full value awards, as equity compensation and provides for incentive and nonqualified stock options, sars, rsas and restricted stock units, and performance shares. full value awards are defined as awards with no cash outlay for the employee to obtain the full value. based on total stock-based awards outstanding (including stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock and performance units) and shares remaining for future grants under the 2014 incentive compensation plan, the potential dilution to which the bancorps shareholders of common stock are exposed due to the potential that stock-based compensation will be awarded to executives, directors or key employees of the bancorp is 10%. sars, restricted stock, stock options and performance units outstanding represent seven percent of the bancorps issued shares at december 31, 2014.
all of the bancorps stock-based awards are to be settled with stock. the bancorp has historically used treasury stock to settle stock-based awards, when available. sars, issued at fair value based on the closing price of the bancorps common stock on the date of grant, have up to ten-year terms and vest and become exercisable either ratably or fully over a four year period of continued employment. the bancorp does not grant discounted sars or stock options, re-price previously granted sars or stock options, or grant reload stock options. restricted stock award grants vest after four years, or ratably over three or four years of continued employment and include dividend and voting rights. stock options were previously issued at fair value based on the closing price of the bancorps common stock on the date of grant, have up to ten-year terms and vested and became fully exercisable ratably over a three or four year period of continued employment. performance unit awards have three-year cliff vesting terms with market conditions as defined by the plan. all of the bancorps executive stock-based awards contain an annual performance hurdle of two percent return on tangible common equity. if this threshold is not met all awards
147  fifth third bancorp notes to consolidated financial statements that would vest in the next year are forfeited. the bancorp met this threshold as of december 31, 2014.
stock-based compensation expense was $83 million, $78 million and $69 million for the years ended december 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively, and is included in salaries, wages, and incentives in the consolidated statements of income. the total related income tax benefit recognized was $30 million, $28 million and $24 million for the years ended december 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively.
stock appreciation rights the bancorp uses assumptions, which are evaluated and revised as necessary, in estimating the grant-date fair value of each sar grant.
expected volatility                 35%            36%            37%
risk-free interest rate            2.0%           1.0%           1.2%
the expected life is generally derived from historical exercise patterns and represents the amount of time that sars granted are expected to be outstanding. the expected volatility is based on a combination of historical and implied volatilities of the bancorps common stock. the expected dividend yield is based on annual dividends divided by the bancorps stock price. annual dividends are based on projected dividends, estimated using an expected long-term dividend payout ratio, over the estimated life of the awards. the risk-free interest rate for periods within the contractual life of the sars is based on the u.s. treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant.
the grant-date fair value of sars is measured using the black-scholes option-pricing model. the weighted-average grant-date fair value of sars granted was $6.53, $4.56 and $4.23 per share for the years ended 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. the total grant-date fair value of sars that vested during 2014, 2013 and 2012 was $34 million, $29 million, and $22 million, respectively.
at december 31, 2014, there was $57 million of stock-based compensation expense related to nonvested sars not yet recognized. the expense is expected to be recognized over a remaining weighted-average period of approximately 2.4 years.

based compensation expense related to nonvested restricted stock not yet recognized. the expense is expected to be recognized over a remaining weighted-average period of approximately 2.6 years.

149  fifth third bancorp notes to consolidated financial statements other stock-based compensation the bancorps board of directors previously approved the use of phantom stock units as part of its compensation for executives in connection with changes made in reaction to the tarp compensation rules. on february 22, 2011, the bancorp redeemed its series f preferred stock held by the u.s. treasury under the cpp. as a result of this redemption, the last payment of phantom stock occurred in april of 2011. the phantom stock units were issued under the bancorps 2008 incentive compensation plan. the number of phantom stock units was determined each pay period by dividing the amount of salary to be paid in phantom stock units for that pay period, by the reported closing price of the bancorps common stock on the pay date for such pay period. the phantom stock units vested immediately on issuance. phantom stock was expensed based on the number of outstanding units multiplied by the closing price of the bancorps stock at period end. the phantom stock units did not include any rights to receive dividends or dividend equivalents. phantom stock units issued on or before june 12, 2010 were settled in cash upon the earlier to occur of june 15, 2011 or the executives death. units issued thereafter were settled in cash with 50% settled on june 15, 2012 and 50% settled on june 15, 2013. the amount paid on settlement of the phantom stock units was equal to the total amount of phantom stock units settled at the reported closing price of the bancorps common stock on the settlement date. under the phantom stock program, no phantom stock units were granted during the years ended december 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012. no phantom stock units were settled during the year ended december 31, 2014 and 200,130 and 199,813 phantom stock units were settled during the years ended december 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively.
performance units are payable contingent upon the bancorp achieving certain predefined performance targets over the three-year measurement period. awards granted during 2014, 2013 and 2012 will be entirely settled in stock. the performance targets are based on the bancorps performance relative to a defined peer group. during 2014, 2013 and 2012, 322,567, 348,595, and 344,741 performance units, respectively, were granted by the bancorp. these awards were granted at a weighted-average grant-date fair value of $15.61, $16.15 and $14.36 per unit during 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively.
the bancorp sponsors a stock purchase plan that allows qualifying employees to purchase shares of the bancorps common stock with a 15% match. during the years ended december 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, there were 599,101, 690,039 and 827,709 shares, respectively, purchased by participants and the bancorp recognized stock-based compensation expense of $1 million in each of the respective years.

26. earnings per share the following table provides the calculation of earnings per share and the reconciliation of earnings per share and earnings per diluted share for the years ended december 31:
effect of dilutive securities:
shares are excluded from the computation of net income per diluted share when their inclusion has an anti-dilutive effect on earnings per share. the diluted earnings per share computation for 2014, 2013 and 2012 excludes 13 million, 24 million, and 36 million, respectively, of sars and an immaterial amount, 1 million, and 5 million, respectively, of stock options because their inclusion would have been anti-dilutive.
the diluted earnings per share computation for the year ended december 31, 2014 excludes the impact of the forward contract related to the october 23, 2014 accelerated share repurchase transaction. based on the average daily volume-weighted average price of the bancorps common stock during the fourth quarter of 2014, the counterparty to the transaction would have been required to deliver additional shares for the settlement of the forward contract as of december 31, 2014, and thus the impact of the accelerated share repurchase transaction would have been anti-dilutive to earnings per share.
the diluted earnings per share computation for the year ended december 31, 2013 excludes the impact of the forward contracts related to the november 18, 2013 and december 13, 2013 accelerated share repurchase transactions. based upon the average daily volume-weighted average price of the bancorps common stock during the fourth quarter of 2013, the counterparty to the transactions would have been required to deliver additional shares for the settlement of the forward contracts as of december 31, 2013, and thus the impact of the two accelerated share repurchase transactions would have been anti-dilutive to earnings per share.
the diluted earnings per share computation for the year ended december 31, 2012 excludes the impact of the forward contracts related to the november 6, 2012 and december 14, 2012 accelerated share repurchase transactions. based upon the average daily volume-weighted average price of the bancorps common stock during the fourth quarter of 2012, the counterparty to the transactions would have been required to deliver additional shares for the settlement of the forward contracts as of december 31, 2012, and thus the impact of the two accelerated share repurchase transactions would have been anti-dilutive to earnings per share.

27. fair value measurements the bancorp measures certain financial assets and liabilities at fair value in accordance with u.s. gaap, which defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. u.s. gaap also establishes a fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three broad levels. the fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (level 1) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (level 3). a financial instruments categorization within the fair value hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the instruments fair value measurement. for more information regarding the fair value hierarchy and how the bancorp measures fair value, refer to note 1.
assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis the following tables summarize assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis, including residential mortgage loans held for sale for which the bancorp has elected the fair value option as of:

the following is a description of the valuation methodologies used for significant instruments measured at fair value, as well as the general classification of such instruments pursuant to the valuation hierarchy.
available-for-sale and other and trading securities where quoted prices are available in an active market, securities are classified within level 1 of the valuation hierarchy. level 1 securities include government bonds and exchange traded equities. if quoted market prices are not available, then fair values are estimated using pricing models, quoted prices of securities with similar characteristics, or dcfs. examples of such instruments, which are classified within level 2 of the valuation hierarchy, include federal agencies, obligations of states and political subdivisions, agency residential mortgage-backed securities, agency and non-agency commercial mortgage-backed securities and asset-backed securities and other debt securities. corporate bonds are included in asset-backed securities and other debt securities in the previous table. federal agencies, obligations of states and political subdivisions, agency residential mortgage-backed securities, agency and non-agency commercial mortgage-backed securities and asset-backed securities and other debt securities are generally valued using a market approach based on observable prices of securities with similar characteristics.
residential mortgage loans held for sale for residential mortgage loans held for sale for which the fair value election has been made, fair value is estimated based upon mortgage-backed securities prices and spreads to those prices or, for certain arm loans, dcf models that may incorporate the anticipated portfolio composition, credit spreads of asset-backed securities with similar collateral and market conditions. the anticipated portfolio composition includes the effect of interest rate spreads and discount rates due to loan characteristics such as the state in which the loan was originated, the loan amount and the arm margin. residential mortgage loans held for sale that are valued based on mortgage-backed securities prices are classified within level 2 of the valuation hierarchy as the valuation is based on
154 fifth third bancorp notes to consolidated financial statements external pricing for similar instruments. arm loans classified as held for sale are also classified within level 2 of the valuation hierarchy due to the use of observable inputs in the dcf model. these observable inputs include interest rate spreads from agency mortgage-backed securities market rates and observable discount rates.
residential mortgage loans residential mortgage loans held for sale that are reclassified to held for investment are transferred from level 2 to level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. it is the bancorps policy to value any transfers between levels of the fair value hierarchy based on end of period fair values.
for residential mortgage loans reclassified from held for sale to held for investment, the fair value estimation is based on mortgage-backed securities prices, interest rate risk and an internally developed credit component. therefore, these loans are classified within level 3 of the valuation hierarchy. an adverse change in the loss rate or severity assumption would result in a decrease in fair value of the related loan. the secondary marketing department, which reports to the bancorps chief operating officer, in conjunction with the consumer credit risk department, which reports to the bancorps chief risk officer, are responsible for determining the valuation methodology for residential mortgage loans held for investment. the secondary marketing department reviews loss severity assumptions quarterly to determine if adjustments are necessary based on decreases in observable housing market data. this group also reviews trades in comparable benchmark securities and adjusts the values of loans as necessary. consumer credit risk is responsible for the credit component of the fair value which is based on internally developed loss rate models that take into account historical loss rates and loss severities based on underlying collateral values.
derivatives exchange-traded derivatives valued using quoted prices and certain over-the-counter derivatives valued using active bids are classified within level 1 of the valuation hierarchy. most of the bancorps derivative contracts are valued using dcf or other models that incorporate current market interest rates, credit spreads assigned to the derivative counterparties and other market parameters and, therefore, are classified within level 2 of the valuation hierarchy. such derivatives include basic and structured interest rate, foreign exchange and commodity swaps and options. derivatives that are valued based upon models with significant unobservable market parameters are classified within level 3 of the valuation hierarchy. at december 31, 2014 and 2013, derivatives classified as level 3, which are valued using models containing unobservable inputs, consisted primarily of a warrant associated with the initial sale of the bancorps 51% interest in vantiv holding, llc to advent international and a total return swap associated with the bancorps sale of visa, inc. class b shares. level 3 derivatives also include irlcs, which utilize internally generated loan closing rate assumptions as a significant unobservable input in the valuation process.
the warrant allows the bancorp to purchase approximately 20 million incremental nonvoting units in vantiv holding, llc at an exercise price of $15.98 per unit and requires settlement under certain defined conditions involving change of control. the fair value of the warrant is calculated in conjunction with a third party valuation provider by applying black-scholes option valuation models using probability weighted scenarios which contain the following inputs: vantiv, inc. stock price, strike price per the warrant agreement and several unobservable inputs, such as expected term, expected volatility, and expected dividend rate.
for the warrant, an increase in the expected term (years) and the expected volatility assumptions would result in an increase in the fair value; conversely, a decrease in these assumptions would result in a decrease in the fair value. the accounting and treasury departments, both of which report to the bancorps chief financial officer, determined the valuation methodology for the warrant. accounting and treasury review changes in fair value on a quarterly basis for reasonableness based on changes in historical and implied volatilities, expected terms, probability weightings of the related scenarios, and other assumptions.
under the terms of the total return swap, the bancorp will make or receive payments based on subsequent changes in the conversion rate of the visa, inc. class b shares into class a shares. additionally, the bancorp will make a quarterly payment based on visas stock price and the conversion rate of the visa, inc. class b shares into class a shares until the date on which the covered litigation is settled. the fair value of the total return swap was calculated using a dcf model based on unobservable inputs consisting of managements estimate of the probability of certain litigation scenarios, the timing of the resolution of the covered litigation and visa litigation loss estimates in excess, or shortfall, of the bancorps proportional share of escrow funds.
an increase in the loss estimate or a delay in the resolution of the covered litigation would result in an increase in fair value; conversely, a decrease in the loss estimate or an acceleration of the resolution of the covered litigation would result in a decrease in fair value. the accounting and treasury departments determined the valuation methodology for the total return swap. accounting and treasury review the changes in fair value on a quarterly basis for reasonableness based on visa stock price changes, litigation contingencies, and escrow funding.
the net fair value asset of the irlcs at december 31, 2014 was $12 million. immediate decreases in current interest rates of 25 bps and 50 bps would result in increases in the fair value of the irlcs of approximately $5 million and $9 million, respectively. immediate increases of current interest rates of 25 bps and 50 bps would result in decreases in the fair value of the irlcs of approximately $5 million and $11 million, respectively. the decrease in fair value of irlcs due to immediate 10% and 20% adverse changes in the assumed loan closing rates would be approximately $1 million and $2 million, respectively, and the increase in fair value due to immediate 10% and 20% favorable changes in the assumed loan closing rates would be approximately $1 million and $2 million, respectively. these sensitivities are hypothetical and should be used with caution, as changes in fair value based on a variation in assumptions typically cannot be extrapolated because the relationship of the change in assumptions to the change in fair value may not be linear.
the secondary marketing department and the consumer line of business finance department, which reports to the bancorps chief financial officer, are responsible for determining the valuation methodology for irlcs. secondary marketing, in conjunction with a third party valuation provider, periodically review loan closing rate assumptions and recent loan sales to determine if adjustments are needed for current market conditions not reflected in historical data.

commercial loans held for sale during 2014 and 2013, the bancorp transferred $28 million and $5 million, respectively, of commercial loans from the portfolio to loans held for sale that upon transfer were measured at lower of cost or fair value. these loans had fair value adjustments in 2014 and 2013 totaling $10 million and $4 million, respectively, and were generally based on appraisals of the underlying collateral and were therefore, classified within level 3 of the valuation hierarchy. additionally, during 2014 and 2013 there were fair value adjustments on existing commercial loans held for sale of $2 million and $3 million, respectively. the fair value adjustments were also based on appraisals of the underlying collateral and were therefore classified within level 3 of the valuation hierarchy. an adverse change in the fair value of the underlying collateral would result in a decrease in the fair value measurement.
the accounting department determines the procedures for valuation of commercial hfs loans which may include a comparison to recently executed transactions of similar type loans. a monthly review of the portfolio is performed for reasonableness. quarterly, appraisals approaching a year old are updated and the real estate valuation group, which reports to the chief risk officer, in conjunction with the commercial line of business review the third party appraisals for reasonableness. additionally, the commercial line of business finance department, which reports to the bancorp chief financial officer, in conjunction with accounting review all loan appraisal values, carrying values and vintages.
residential mortgage loans held for sale during 2014, the bancorp transferred $720 million of restructured residential mortgage loans from the portfolio to loans held for sale that upon transfer were measured at lower of cost or fair value using significant unobservable inputs. these loans had fair value adjustments in 2014 totaling $87 million. the fair value adjustments were based on estimated third-party valuations utilizing recent sales data from similar transactions. broker opinion statements were also obtained as additional evidence to support the third-party valuations. the treasury department worked with the third-party advisor to estimate the fair value adjustments. the discounts taken were intended to represent the perspective of a market participant, considering among other things, required investor returns which include liquidity discounts reflected in similar bulk transactions. an adverse change in the fair value of the underlying collateral would result in a decrease in the fair value measurement.
commercial loans held for investment during 2014 and 2013, the bancorp recorded nonrecurring impairment adjustments to certain commercial and industrial, commercial mortgage and commercial construction loans held for investment. larger commercial loans included within aggregate borrower relationship balances exceeding $1 million that exhibit probable or observed credit weaknesses are subject to individual review for impairment. the bancorp considers the current value of collateral, credit quality of any guarantees, the guarantors liquidity and willingness to cooperate, the loan structure and other factors when evaluating whether an individual loan is impaired. when the loan is collateral dependent, the fair value of the loan is generally based on the fair value of the underlying collateral supporting the loan and therefore these loans were classified within level 3 of the valuation hierarchy. in cases where the carrying value exceeds the fair value, an impairment loss is recognized.
an adverse change in the fair value of the underlying collateral would result in a decrease in the fair value measurement. the fair values and recognized impairment losses are reflected in the previous table. commercial credit risk, which reports to the chief risk officer, is responsible for preparing and reviewing the fair value estimates for commercial loans held for investment.
msrs mortgage interest rates decreased during the year ended december 31, 2014 and the bancorp recognized temporary impairment in certain classes of the msr portfolio and the carrying value was adjusted to the fair value. the bancorp recognized a recovery of temporary impairment on servicing rights during the year ended december 31, 2013. msrs do not trade in an active, open market with readily observable prices. while sales of msrs do occur, the precise terms and conditions typically are not readily available. accordingly, the bancorp estimates the fair value of msrs using internal dcf models with certain unobservable inputs, primarily prepayment speed assumptions, discount rates and weighted average lives, resulting in a classification within level 3 of the valuation hierarchy. refer to note 11 for further information on the assumptions used in the valuation of the bancorps msrs. the secondary marketing department and treasury department are responsible for determining the valuation methodology for msrs. representatives from secondary marketing, treasury, accounting and risk management are responsible for reviewing key assumptions used in the internal dcf model. two external
159  fifth third bancorp notes to consolidated financial statements valuations of the msr portfolio are obtained from third parties that use valuation models in order to assess the reasonableness of the internal dcf model. additionally, the bancorp participates in peer surveys that provide additional confirmation of the reasonableness of key assumptions utilized in the msr valuation process and the resulting msr prices.
oreo during 2014 and 2013, the bancorp recorded nonrecurring adjustments to certain commercial and residential real estate properties classified as oreo and measured at the lower of carrying amount or fair value. these nonrecurring losses are primarily due to declines in real estate values of the properties recorded in oreo. for the years ended december 31, 2014 and 2013, these losses include $12 million and $19 million, respectively, recorded as charge-offs, on new oreo properties transferred from loans during the respective periods and $14 million and $26 million, respectively, recorded as negative fair value adjustments on oreo in other noninterest income subsequent to their transfer from loans. as discussed in the following paragraphs, the fair value amounts are generally based on appraisals of the property values, resulting in a classification within level 3 of the valuation hierarchy. in cases where the carrying amount exceeds the fair value, less costs to sell, an impairment loss is recognized. the previous tables reflect the fair value measurements of the properties before deducting the estimated costs to sell.
the real estate valuation department, which reports to the chief risk officer, is solely responsible for managing the appraisal process and evaluating the appraisal for all commercial properties transferred to oreo. all appraisals on commercial oreo properties are updated on at least an annual basis.
the real estate valuation department reviews the bpo data and internal market information to determine the initial charge-off on residential real estate loans transferred to oreo. once the foreclosure process is completed, the bancorp performs an interior inspection to update the initial fair value of the property. these properties are reviewed at least every 30 days after the initial interior inspections are completed. the asset manager receives a monthly status report for each property which includes the number of showings, recently sold properties, current comparable listings and overall market conditions.
bank premises the bancorp monitors consumer preferences for banking interactions and related customer behavior patterns in an effort to ensure that its retail distribution network is both responsive to such trends and efficient. as part of this ongoing assessment, the bancorp determined that certain components of its bank premises would no longer be held for or used for their intended purposes and therefore these properties were written down to their lower of cost or market value. at least annually thereafter, the bancorp will review these properties for market fluctuations. the fair value amounts were generally based on appraisals of the property values, resulting in a classification within level 3 of the valuation hierarchy. for further information, refer to note 7.
private equity investment funds the volcker rule, was approved by the respective federal agencies on december 10, 2013 and prohibits the bancorp from retaining an interest in certain of its private equity fund investments. therefore, while the bancorp has not approved a formal plan to sell any of the private equity funds, the bancorp has determined that it may be forced to sell certain of these funds prior to their scheduled redemption dates to comply with the volcker rule conformance period. as a result, the bancorp has performed nonrecurring fair value measurements on a fund by fund basis to determine whether otti exists. the bancorp estimated the fair value of a fund by using the net asset value reported by the fund manager, and in some cases, applying an estimated market discount to the reported net asset value of the fund. because the length of time until the investment will become redeemable is generally not certain, these funds were classified within level 3 of the valuation hierarchy. the bancorp recognized $4 million of otti on its investments in private equity funds during 2013. the bancorp recognized no otti on its investments in private equity funds during 2014. an adverse change in the reported net asset values or estimated market discounts where applicable, would result in a decrease in the fair value estimate. in cases where the carrying value exceeds the fair value, an impairment loss is recognized. the bancorps private equity department, which reports to the chief operating officer, in conjunction with accounting, is responsible for preparing and reviewing the fair value estimates.
fair value option the bancorp elected to measure certain residential mortgage loans held for sale under the fair value option as allowed under u.s. gaap. electing to measure residential mortgage loans held for sale at fair value reduces certain timing differences and better matches changes in the value of these assets with changes in the value of derivatives used as economic hedges for these assets. managements intent to sell residential mortgage loans classified as held for sale may change over time due to such factors as changes in the overall liquidity in markets or changes in characteristics specific to certain loans held for sale. consequently, these loans may be reclassified to loans held for investment and maintained in the bancorps loan portfolio. in such cases, the loans will continue to be measured at fair value.
fair value changes recognized in earnings for instruments held at december 31, 2014 and 2013 for which the fair value option was elected as well as the changes in fair value of the underlying irlcs, included gains of $26 million and $20 million, respectively. these gains are reported in mortgage banking net revenue in the consolidated statements of income.
valuation adjustments related to instrument-specific credit risk for residential mortgage loans measured at fair value negatively impacted the fair value of those loans by $2 million at both december 31, 2014 and 2013. interest on residential mortgage loans measured at fair value is accrued as it is earned using the effective interest method and is reported as interest income in the consolidated statements of income.

162  fifth third bancorp notes to consolidated financial statements held-to-maturity securities the bancorps held-to-maturity securities are primarily composed of instruments that provide income tax credits as the economic return on the investment. the fair value of these instruments is estimated based on current u.s. treasury tax credit rates.
loans held for sale fair values for commercial loans held for sale were valued based on executable bids when available, or on dcf models incorporating appraisals of the underlying collateral, as well as assumptions about investor return requirements and amounts and timing of expected cash flows. fair values for residential mortgage loans held for sale were valued based on estimated third-party valuations utilizing recent sales data from similar transactions. broker opinion statements were also obtained as additional evidence to support the third-party valuations. fair values for other consumer loans held for sale were based on contractual values upon which the loans may be sold to a third party, and approximate their carrying value.
portfolio loans and leases, net fair values were estimated by discounting future cash flows using the current market rates of loans to borrowers with similar credit characteristics, similar remaining maturities, prepayment speeds and loss severities.
long-term debt fair value of long-term debt was based on quoted market prices, when available, or a dcf calculation using libor/swap interest rates and, in some cases, fifth third credit and/or debt instrument spreads for new issuances with similar terms.

28. certain regulatory requirements and capital ratios the principal source of income and funds for the bancorp (parent company) are dividends from its subsidiaries. the dividends paid by the bancorps banking subsidiary are subject to regulations and limitations prescribed by the appropriate state and federal supervisory authorities. the bancorps nonbank subsidiaries are also limited by certain federal and state statutory provisions and regulations covering the amount of dividends that may be paid in any given year.
the bancorps banking subsidiary must maintain cash reserve balances when total reservable deposit liabilities are greater than the regulatory exemption. these reserve requirements may be satisfied with vault cash and balances on deposit with the frb. in 2014 and 2013, the banking subsidiary was required to maintain average cash reserve balances of $1.7 billion and $1.6 billion, respectively.
the board of governors of the federal reserve system issued capital adequacy guidelines pursuant to which it assesses the adequacy of capital in examining and supervising a bhc and in analyzing applications to it under the bhca of 1956, as amended. these guidelines include quantitative measures that assign risk weightings to assets and off-balance sheet items, as well as define and set minimum regulatory capital requirements. all bank holding companies are required to maintain tier i capital (core capital) of at least four percent of risk-weighted assets (tier i risk-based capital ratio), total capital (tier i plus tier ii capital) of at least eight percent of risk-weighted assets (total risk-based capital ratio), and tier i capital of at least three percent of adjusted quarterly average assets (tier i leverage ratio). failure to meet the minimum capital requirements can initiate certain actions by regulators that could have a direct material effect on the consolidated financial statements of the bancorp.
tier i capital consists principally of shareholders equity including tier i qualifying trups. it excludes unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale securities and unrecognized pension actuarial gains and losses and prior service cost, goodwill, certain other intangibles and unrealized gains and losses on cash flow hedges. the revised regulatory capital rules known as basel iii will phase out the inclusion of certain trups as a component of tier i capital when the rules become effective for the bancorp beginning january 1, 2015. under these provisions, these trups would qualify as a component of tier ii capital. at december 31, 2014, the bancorps tier i capital included $60 million of trups representing approximately 5 bps of risk-weighted assets. tier ii capital consists principally of term subordinated debt and, subject to limitations, allowances for credit losses.
assets and credit equivalent amounts of off-balance sheet items are assigned to one of several broad risk categories, according to the obligor, guarantor or nature of collateral. the aggregate dollar value of the amount of each category is multiplied by the associated risk weighting of that category. the resulting weighted values from each of the risk categories in sum is the total risk-weighted assets. quarterly average assets for this purpose do not include goodwill and any other intangible assets and other investments that the frb determines should be deducted from tier i capital.
the board of governors of the federal reserve system issued capital adequacy guidelines for banking subsidiaries substantially similar to those adopted for bank holding companies, as described previously. in addition, the federal banking agencies have issued substantially similar regulations to implement the system of prompt corrective action established by section 38 of the fdia. under the regulations, a bank generally shall be deemed to be well-capitalized if it has a total risk-based capital ratio of 10% or more, a tier i risk-based capital ratio of six percent or more, a tier i leverage ratio of five percent or more and is not subject to any written capital order or directive. if an institution becomes undercapitalized, it would become subject to significant additional oversight, regulations and requirements as mandated by the fdia.
the bancorp and its banking subsidiary, fifth third bank, had tier i risk-based capital, total risk-based capital and tier i leverage ratios above the well-capitalized levels at december 31, 2014 and 2013. as of december 31, 2014, the most recent notification from the frb categorized the bancorp and its banking subsidiary as well-capitalized under the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action. to continue to qualify for financial holding company status pursuant to the gramm-leach-bliley act of 1999, the bancorps banking subsidiary must, among other things, maintain well-capitalized capital ratios.
the following table presents capital and risk-based capital and leverage ratios for the bancorp and its banking subsidiary at december 31:

30.  business segments the bancorp reports on four business segments: commercial banking, branch banking, consumer lending and investment advisors. results of the bancorps business segments are presented based on its management structure and management accounting practices. the structure and accounting practices are specific to the bancorp; therefore, the financial results of the bancorps business segments are not necessarily comparable with similar information for other financial institutions. the bancorp refines its methodologies from time to time as managements accounting practices and businesses change.
the bancorp manages interest rate risk centrally at the corporate level by employing an ftp methodology. this methodology insulates the business segments from interest rate volatility, enabling them to focus on serving customers through loan originations and deposit taking. the ftp system assigns charge rates and credit rates to classes of assets and liabilities, respectively, based on expected duration and the u.s. swap curve. matching duration allocates interest income and interest expense to each segment so its resulting net interest income is insulated from interest rate risk. in a rising rate environment, the bancorp benefits from the widening spread between deposit costs and wholesale funding costs. however, the bancorps ftp system credits this benefit to deposit-providing businesses, such as branch banking and investment advisors, on a duration-adjusted basis. the net impact of the ftp methodology is captured in general corporate and other.
the bancorp adjusts the ftp charge and credit rates as dictated by changes in interest rates for various interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities and by the review of the estimated durations for the indeterminate-lived deposits. the credit rate provided for demand deposit accounts is reviewed annually based upon the account type, its estimated duration and the corresponding fed funds, u.s. swap curve or swap rate. the credit rates for several deposit products were reset january 1, 2014 to reflect the current market rates and updated market assumptions. these rates were generally higher than those in place during 2013, thus net interest income for deposit providing businesses was positively impacted during 2014.
the business segments are charged provision expense based on the actual net charge-offs experienced by the loans and leases owned by each segment. provision expense attributable to loan and lease growth and changes in alll factors are captured in general corporate and other. the financial results of the business segments include allocations for shared services and headquarters expenses. additionally, the business segments form synergies by taking advantage of cross-sell opportunities and when funding operations, by accessing the capital markets as a collective unit.
the results of operations and financial position for the years ended december 31, 2013 and 2012 were adjusted to reflect the transfer of certain customers and bancorp employees from branch banking to commercial banking, effective january 1, 2014. in addition, the 2013 and 2012 balances were adjusted to reflect a change in internal allocation methodology.
the following is a description of each of the bancorps business segments, and the products and services they provide to their respective client bases.
commercial banking offers credit intermediation, cash management and financial services to large and middle-market businesses and government and professional customers. in addition to the traditional lending and depository offerings, commercial banking products and services include global cash management, foreign exchange and international trade finance, derivatives and capital markets services, asset-based lending, real estate finance, public finance, commercial leasing and syndicated finance.

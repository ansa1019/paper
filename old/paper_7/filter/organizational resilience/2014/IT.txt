business measurements we believe the following business measurements are important performance indicators for our business segments:
business segment   business measurements research           contract value represents the value attributable to all of our subscription-related research products that recognize revenue on a ratable basis. contract value is calculated as the annualized value of all subscription research contracts in effect at a specific point in time, without regard to the duration of the contract.
client retention rate represents a measure of client satisfaction and renewed business relationships at a specific point in time. client retention is calculated on a percentage basis by dividing our current clients, who were also clients a year ago, by all clients from a year ago.
wallet retention rate represents a measure of the amount of contract value we have retained with clients over a twelve-month period. wallet retention is calculated on a percentage basis by dividing the contract value of clients, who were clients one year earlier, by the total contract value from a year earlier, excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange. when wallet retention exceeds client retention, it is an indication of retention of higher-spending clients, or increased spending by retained clients, or both.
consulting         consulting backlog represents future revenue to be derived from in-process consulting, measurement and strategic advisory services engagements.
utilization rate represents a measure of productivity of our consultants. utilization rates are calculated for billable headcount on a percentage basis by dividing total hours billed by total hours available to bill.
average annualized revenue per billable headcount represents a measure of the revenue generating ability of an average billable consultant and is calculated periodically by multiplying the average billing rate per hour times the utilization percentage times the billable hours available for one year.
events             number of events represents the total number of hosted events completed during the period.
number of attendees represents the total number of people who attend events.
executive summary of operations and financial position we have executed a consistent growth strategy since 2005 to drive double-digit annual revenue and earnings growth. the fundamentals of our strategy include a focus on creating extraordinary research content, delivering innovative and highly differentiated product offerings, building a strong sales capability, providing world class client service with a focus on client engagement and retention, and continuously improving our operational effectiveness.
we had total revenues of $2.021 billion in 2014, an increase of 13% over 2013 on a reported basis and 14% adjusted for foreign exchange impact. diluted earnings per share increased by $.10 per share, or 5%, to $2.03 per share in 2014.
research revenues rose 14% year-over-year, to $1.445 billion in 2014, and the contribution margin was 69%, the same as 2013. at december 31, 2014, research contract value was $1.603 billion, an increase of 13% over december 31, 2013 on a reported basis and 14% adjusted for the impact of foreign exchange. enterprise client retention was 85% and enterprise wallet retention was 106% at december 31, 2014.
consulting revenues in 2014 increased 11% when compared to 2013, while the gross contribution margin was 34%, the same as 2013. consultant utilization was 68% for 2014 compared to 64% in 2013, and we had 535 billable consultants at december 31, 2014 compared to 509 at year-end 2013. backlog decreased 3% year-over-year, to $102.6 million at december 31, 2014.
events revenues increased 14% year-over-year, to $227.7 million, and 16% adjusted for foreign currency impact. the segment contribution margin was 49% in 2014, a 3 point increase over 2013. we held 61 events in 2014 compared to 64 in 2013, while the number of attendees increased 9% year-over-year, to over 49,000.
for a more detailed discussion of our results, see the segment results section below.
cash flow from our operating activities was $346.8 million in 2014, an increase of 10% compared to 2013. we continue to focus on maximizing shareholder value, and in 2014 we repurchased 5.9 million of our outstanding common shares. we ended 2014 with $365.3 million in cash and cash equivalents. we refinanced our existing credit facility during the fourth quarter of 2014 to take advantage of favorable market conditions, provide for additional liquidity, and extend the maturity of our debt. our total borrowing capacity under the new arrangement is $1.5 billion, which consists of a $400.0 million term loan and a $1.1 billion revolving credit arrangement. the new facility has a five year maturity. at december 31, 2014, approximately $1.1 billion was available for borrowing under the revolver. we believe that we have adequate liquidity to meet our currently anticipated needs.
the company completed three business acquisitions in 2014 (the "2014 acquisitions"). these include software advice, inc., which assists customers with software purchases; market visio oy, a finnish company and former sales agent for gartner research in finland and russia; and sircleit, inc., a provider of cloud-based search technology that identifies subject-matter experts. note 2 - acquisitions in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10-k provides additional information regarding the 2014 acquisitions. the operating results of these acquisitions have been included in our consolidated and segment operating results beginning on their respective dates of acquisition. the results of these businesses were not material to our consolidated or segment results for the year ended december 31, 2014.
fluctuations in quarterly results our quarterly and annual revenue, operating income, and cash flow fluctuate as a result of many factors, including: the timing of our symposium/itxpo series, which are normally held during the fourth calendar quarter, as well as other events; the timing and amount of new business generated; the mix between domestic and international business; changes in market demand for our products and services; changes in foreign currency rates; the timing of the development, introduction and marketing of our new products and services; competition in the industry; general economic conditions; and other factors which are beyond our control. the potential fluctuations in our operating income could cause period-to-period comparisons of operating results not to be meaningful and could provide an unreliable indication of future operating results and cash flows.
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements requires the application of appropriate accounting policies and the use of estimates. our significant accounting policies are described in note 1 in the notes to consolidated financial statements. management considers the policies discussed below to be critical to an understanding of our financial statements because their application requires complex and subjective management judgments and estimates. specific risks for these critical accounting policies are described below.
the preparation of our financial statements also requires us to make estimates and assumptions about future events. we develop our estimates using both current and historical experience, as well as other factors, including the general economic environment and actions we may take in the future. we adjust such estimates when facts and circumstances dictate. however, our estimates may involve significant uncertainties and judgments and cannot be determined with precision. in addition, these estimates are based on our best judgment at a point in time and as such these estimates may ultimately differ from actual results. on-going changes in our estimates could be material and would be reflected in the company's financial statements in future periods.
revenue recognition - revenue is recognized in accordance with the requirements of u.s. gaap and sec staff accounting bulletin no. 104, revenue recognition ("sab 104"). revenue is only recognized once all required criteria for revenue recognition have been met. revenue by significant source is accounted for as follows:
•   consulting revenues are principally generated from fixed fee and time and material engagements. revenues from fixed fee contracts are recognized on a proportional performance basis. revenues from time and materials engagements are recognized as work is delivered and/or services are provided. revenues related to contract optimization contracts are contingent in nature and are only recognized upon satisfaction of all conditions related to their payment.
•   events revenues are deferred and then recognized upon the completion of the related symposium, conference or exhibition.
the majority of research contracts are billable upon signing, absent special terms granted on a limited basis from time to time. all research contracts are non-cancelable and non-refundable, except for government contracts that may have cancellation or fiscal funding clauses. it is our policy to record the entire amount of the contract that is billable as a fee receivable at the time the contract is signed with a corresponding amount as deferred revenue, since the contract represents a legally enforceable claim.
uncollectible fees receivable - we maintain an allowance for losses which is composed of a bad debt allowance and a sales reserve. provisions are charged against earnings, either as a reduction in revenues or an increase to expense. the measurement of likely and probable losses and the allowance for losses is based on historical loss experience, aging of outstanding receivables, an assessment of current economic conditions and the financial health of specific clients. this evaluation is inherently judgmental and requires estimates. these valuation reserves are periodically re-evaluated and adjusted as more information about the ultimate collectability of fees receivable becomes available. circumstances that could cause our valuation reserves to increase include changes in our clients' liquidity and credit quality, other factors negatively impacting our clients' ability to pay their obligations as they come due, and the effectiveness of our collection efforts.
goodwill and other intangible assets - the company evaluates recorded goodwill in accordance with financial accounting standards board (fasb) accounting standards codification (asc) topic 350, which requires goodwill to be assessed for impairment at least annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. in addition, an impairment evaluation of our amortizable intangible assets may also be performed on a periodic basis should events or circumstances indicate potential impairment. if we determine that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its related carrying amount, we must recognize an impairment charge against earnings. among the factors we consider important that could trigger an impairment review are the following:
•   significant under-performance relative to historical or projected future operating results;
•   significant changes in the manner of our use of acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business;
•   significant negative industry or general economic trends;
•   our market capitalization relative to net book value.
the annual assessment of the recoverability of recorded goodwill can be based on either a quantitative or qualitative assessment or a combination of the two. both methods require the use of estimates which in turn contain judgments and assumptions regarding future trends and events. as a result, both the precision and reliability of the resulting estimates are subject to uncertainty. in 2014, we completed the required annual goodwill impairment test utilizing a qualitative approach. based on this assessment, the company believes the fair values of the company's reporting units continue to exceed their respective carrying amounts. see note 1 - business and significant accounting policies in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional discussion.
accounting for income taxes - the company uses the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. we estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions where we operate. this process involves estimating our current tax expense together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes. these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities, which are included within our consolidated balance sheets. in assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, management considers if it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. we consider the availability of loss carryforwards, projected reversal of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in making this assessment. the company recognizes the tax
benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not the tax position will be sustained based on the technical merits of the position.
accounting for stock-based compensation - the company accounts for stock-based compensation in accordance with fasb asc topics 505 and 718, as interpreted by sec staff accounting bulletins no. 107 ("sab no. 107") and no. 110 ("sab no. 110"). the company recognizes stock-based compensation expense, which is based on the fair value of the award on the date of grant, over the related service period, net of estimated forfeitures (see note 8 - stock-based compensation in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding stock-based compensation).
determining the appropriate fair value model and calculating the fair value of stock compensation awards requires the input of certain complex and subjective assumptions, including the expected life of the stock compensation award and the company's common stock price volatility. in addition, determining the appropriate amount of associated periodic expense requires management to estimate the rate of employee forfeitures and the likelihood of achievement of certain performance targets. the assumptions used in calculating the fair value of stock compensation awards and the associated periodic expense represent management's best estimates, but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of judgment. as a result, if factors change and the company deems it necessary in the future to modify the assumptions it made or to use different assumptions, or if the quantity and nature of the company's stock-based compensation awards changes, then the amount of expense may need to be adjusted and future stock compensation expense could be materially different from what has been recorded in the current period.
restructuring and other accruals - we may record accruals for severance costs, costs associated with excess facilities that we have leased, contract terminations, asset impairments, and other costs as a result of on-going actions we undertake to streamline our organization, reposition certain businesses and reduce ongoing costs. estimates of costs to be incurred to complete these actions, such as future lease payments, sublease income, the fair value of assets, and severance and related benefits, are based on assumptions at the time the actions are initiated. these accruals may need to be adjusted to the extent actual costs differ from such estimates. in addition, these actions may be revised due to changes in business conditions that we did not foresee at the time such plans were approved.
we also record accruals during the year for our various employee cash incentive programs. amounts accrued at the end of each reporting period are based on our estimates and may require adjustment as the ultimate amount paid for these incentives are sometimes not known with certainty until after year end.
results of operations consolidated results
the following table presents the changes in selected line items in our consolidated statements of operations for the two years ended december 31, 2014 (in thousands):
cost of services &amp; product development                     797,933                                       713,484                             (84,449          )             (12           )
amortization of intangibles                                      8,226                                         5,446                              (2,780          )             (51           )
operating income                                               286,162                                       275,492                              10,670                          4
total revenues for the twelve months ended december 31, 2014 increased $237.2 million, or 13%, compared to the twelve months ended december 31, 2013. total revenues increased 14% excluding the unfavorable impact of foreign currency. revenues increased in all three of our business segments and across all geographic regions.
events             227,707                 198,945                      28,762                         14
please refer to the section of this md&a below entitled "segment results" for a further discussion of revenues and results by segment.
cost of services and product development ("cos") expense increased 12% in 2014 compared to 2013, or $84.4 million, to $797.9 million compared to $713.5 million in 2013. the impact of foreign currency exchange for the full year was not significant. the increase was primarily due to higher payroll and related benefits costs from additional headcount, which increased 12%. the headcount increase reflects our continued investment in our research business and includes the additional employees resulting from the 2014 acquisitions. cos as a percentage of revenues was 39% in the 2014 period compared to 40% in the 2013 period.
selling, general and administrative ("sg&a") expense increased by $115.6 million in 2014, or 15%, to $876.1 million compared to $760.5 million in 2013. excluding the favorable impact of foreign currency exchange, sg&a expense increased 16% year-over-year. the increase was primarily due to higher payroll and related benefits costs from additional headcount, higher sales commissions, and merit salary increases. the increased headcount includes our investment in additional quota-bearing sales associates, which increased to 1,881 at december 31, 2014, a 14% increase over year-end 2013.
amortization of intangibles increased 51% year-over-year due to the intangibles arising from the 2014 acquisitions.
acquisition and integration charges was $21.9 million in 2014 compared to $0.3 million in 2013. these charges are directly-related to our acquisitions and primarily include amounts accrued for payments contingent on the achievement of certain employment conditions, legal, consulting, and severance costs.
operating income increased $10.7 million year-over-year, or 4%, to $286.2 million in 2014 from $275.5 million in 2013. the increased operating income was attributable to higher segment contributions from our research and events businesses. operating income as a percentage of revenues was 14% in 2014 and 15% in 2013.
other expense, net was $0.6 million in 2014 and $0.2 million in 2013. these expenses primarily consisted of net foreign currency exchange gains and losses.
provision for income taxes was $90.9 million in 2014 compared to $83.6 million in 2013 and the effective tax rate was 33.1% for 2014 compared to 31.4% for 2013. the higher effective tax rate in 2014 was primarily due to the impact of certain favorable items in 2013, as well as the unfavorable mix of pretax income by jurisdiction in 2014 which was partially offset by foreign tax credit benefits in 2014. the favorable items in 2013 included the enactment of certain beneficial legislation in 2013, the release of tax reserves due to audit settlements, and increased tax exempt income.
during 2014, the internal revenue service closed its audit of the company's 2011 and 2010 federal income tax returns. the resolution of the audit did not have a material adverse effect on the company's consolidated financial position, cash flows, or results of operations.
net income was $183.8 million in 2014 and $182.8 million in 2013, an increase of 1%, as the increased operating income in 2014 was substantially offset by additional income tax charges. diluted earnings per share increased 5% year-over-year, to $2.03 in 2014, primarily due to a lower number of weighted-average shares outstanding.
the following table presents the changes in selected line items in our consolidated statements of operations for the two years ended december 31, 2013 (in thousands):
cost of services &amp; product development                     713,484                                   659,067                                (54,417          )              (8           )
amortization of intangibles                                      5,446                                     4,402                                 (1,044          )             (24           )
operating income                                               275,492                                   245,707                                 29,785                         12
total revenues for the twelve months ended december 31, 2013 increased $168.4 million, or 10%, compared to the twelve months ended december 31, 2012. total revenues increased 11% excluding the unfavorable impact of foreign currency. revenues increased in all three of our business segments and across all of our geographic regions.
events             198,945                $173,768                      25,177                         14
please refer to the section of this md&a below entitled "segment results" for a further discussion of revenues and results by segment.
cost of services and product development ("cos") expense increased 8% in 2013 compared to 2012, or $54.4 million, to $713.5 million compared to $659.1 million in 2012. the increase was primarily due to higher payroll and related benefits costs from additional headcount as we continued to invest to support the growth in our business, and to a lesser extent, merit salary increases. we also had higher conference costs due to an increase in the number of events, a double-digit increase in the number of exhibitors at our events, and the upgrading of facilities in several locations to support anticipated growth in the
events business. these additional costs were partially offset by the favorable impact of foreign currency. cos as a percentage of revenues was 40% in the 2013 period compared to 41% in the 2012 period.
selling, general and administrative ("sg&a") expense increased by $81.6 million in 2013, or 12%, to $760.5 million compared to $678.8 million in 2012. the increase was primarily due to higher payroll and related benefits costs, which was partially offset by favorable foreign currency impact. the higher payroll and benefit cost was primarily driven by our investment in additional headcount, and to a lesser extent, higher sales commissions and merit salary increases. the increased headcount includes additional quota-bearing sales associates, which increased to 1,643 at december 31, 2013, a 16% increase over year-end 2012.
depreciation expense increased 14% in 2013 compared to 2012, primarily due to additional depreciation on leasehold improvements from two renovated buildings on our stamford headquarters campus being placed into service during 2013.
amortization of intangibles increased 24% year-over-year due to a full year of amortization in 2013 of the intangible assets recorded from the ideas international acquisition in mid-2012.
operating income increased $29.8 million year-over-year, or 12%, to $275.5 million in 2013 from $245.7 million in 2012. the increased operating income was primarily attributable to a substantially higher segment contribution from our research segment. operating income as a percentage of revenues was 15% for both periods.
other expense, net was $0.2 million in 2013 and $1.3 million in 2012. these expenses primarily consisted of net foreign currency exchange gains and losses.
provision for income taxes was $83.6 million in 2013 compared to $69.7 million in 2012 and the effective tax rate was 31.4% for 2013 compared to 29.6% for 2012. the higher effective tax rate in 2013 was primarily attributable to a change in the annual mix of pre-tax income by jurisdiction as well as the impact of certain state tax credits recognized in 2012.
in 2013 the company closed the internal revenue service ("irs") audit of its 2008 and 2009 federal income tax returns. the resolution of the audit did not have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial position, cash flows, or results of operations of the company. in late 2013 the company received notice that the irs would conduct an audit of the company's 2010 and 2011 tax years.
the american taxpayer relief act of 2012 (the "2012 tax act") was enacted in january of 2013 and contained beneficial tax provisions for the company which applied retroactively to 2012. however, since the 2012 tax act was passed in 2013, approximately $1.5 million of tax benefits relating to its retroactive application were recorded by the company in early 2013.
net income was $182.8 million in 2013 and $165.9 million in 2012, an increase of $16.9 million, or 10%, primarily due to the higher operating income, which was partially offset by higher income tax charges. diluted earnings per share increased 12% year-over-year due to the higher net income and to a lesser extent a lower number of weighted-average shares outstanding.
segment results we evaluate reportable segment performance and allocate resources based on gross contribution margin. gross contribution is defined as operating income excluding certain cost of services and product development charges, sg&a, depreciation, acquisition and integration charges, and amortization of intangibles. gross contribution margin is defined as gross contribution as a percentage of revenues.

consulting revenues increased 11% year-over-year and 12% when adjusted for the impact of foreign exchange. the increase was primarily due to higher core consulting revenues and to a lesser extent, higher contract optimization revenues. contract optimization revenues can fluctuate from period to period but are generally about 10-15% of total annual consulting segment revenues. the gross contribution margin was 34% for both periods. backlog decreased $3.5 million, or 3%, year-over-year, to $102.6 million at december 31, 2014.
consulting revenues increased 3% year-over-year and 4% when adjusted for the impact of foreign exchange. the increase was due to higher contract optimization revenue. the increased contract optimization revenues were partially offset by slightly lower core consulting and strategic advisory ("sas") revenues. the gross contribution margin declined by 2 points due to higher payroll and benefit costs from additional headcount and merit salary increases, and to a lesser extent, lower utilization in core consulting. backlog increased $3.4 million, or 3%, year-over-year, to $106.1 million at december 31, 2013.

events revenues increased $28.8 million when comparing 2014 to 2013, or 14%. excluding the impact of foreign currency translation, revenues increased 16% year-over-year. we held 61 events in 2014, consisting of 59 ongoing events and 2 new events, compared to 64 events in 2013. five events that were held in 2013 were discontinued in 2014. the year-over-year revenue increase was primarily attributable to higher exhibitor revenue at our ongoing events and to a lesser extent, higher attendee revenue. the overall number of attendees increased 9%, while the number of exhibitors increased 10%. average revenue per attendee rose 6% and average revenue per exhibitor increased 9%. the gross contribution margin increased 3 points year-over-year.
events revenues increased $25.2 million when comparing 2013 to 2012, or 14%, but excluding the impact of foreign currency translation, revenues increased 15% year-over-year. we held 64 events in 2013, consisting of 58 ongoing events and 6 new events, compared to 62 events in 2012. the year-over-year revenue increase was primarily attributable to higher exhibitor revenue at our ongoing events. the overall number of attendees declined slightly while the number of exhibitors increased 11%. average revenue per attendee rose 15% and average revenue per exhibitor increased 6%. the gross contribution margin was flat year-over-year at 46%.
liquidity and capital resources we finance our operations primarily through cash generated from our operating activities. for 2014, we had operating cash flow of $346.8 million, which was the highest in the company's history and represented an increase of 10% over 2013. our operating cash flow has been continuously enhanced by the leverage characteristics of our subscription-based business model as well as our focus on operational efficiencies. revenues in our research segment, which increased 14% in 2014 compared to 2013, constituted 72% and 71% of our total revenues in 2014 and 2013, respectively. the majority of our research contracts renew annually and typically are paid in advance, and combined with a strong customer retention rate and high incremental margins, has generally resulted in strong growth in operating cash flow each year. our cash flow generation has also benefited from our continuing efforts to improve the operating efficiencies of our businesses as well as a focus on the optimal management of our working capital as we increase our sales volume.
we had over $365.0 million of cash and cash equivalents at year-end 2014. we refinanced our debt in 2014 to take advantage of favorable market conditions and we had approximately $1.1 billion of available borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility at year-end 2014. we believe that our consistently strong operating cash flow, as well as our existing cash balances and our available borrowing capacity, provide us with adequate liquidity to meet our currently anticipated needs.
our cash and cash equivalents are held in numerous locations throughout the world. at december 31, 2014, $305.0 million of our cash and cash equivalents was held outside the u.s. approximately 61% of the cash and cash equivalents held overseas represents unremitted earnings of our non-u.s subsidiaries. under u.s. accounting rules, no provision for income taxes that may result from the remittance of such earnings is required if the company intends to reinvest such funds overseas. our current plans do not demonstrate a need to repatriate these undistributed earnings to fund our u.s. operations or otherwise satisfy the liquidity needs of our u.s operations. we intend to reinvest these earnings in our non-u.s. operations, except in instances in which the repatriation of these earnings would result in minimal additional tax. as a result, the company has not recognized additional income tax expense that may result from the remittance of these earnings. however, should our liquidity needs change or we decide to repatriate some or all of these unremitted earnings, we may be required to accrue additional taxes which could have a material effect on our consolidated financial position, cash flows, and results of operations.
changes in cash and cash equivalents the following disclosure summarizes and explains the changes in our cash and cash equivalents for the three years ended december 31, 2014 (in thousands):
cash provided by operating activities                    $346,779                                      $315,654                             $31,125                             $315,654                                      $279,813                             $35,841
effects of exchange rate changes (1)                      (34,020             )                          (1,163             )               (32,857        )                      (1,163             )                           4,543                              (5,706        )
(1)   during 2014, a number of foreign currencies in which we hold cash weakened relative to the u.s. dollar. as a result, the effects of exchange rates had a significant impact on the december 31, 2014 cash and cash equivalent balance.
operating operating cash flow increased by $31.1 million, or 10%, when comparing 2014 to 2013. the increase was primarily due to additional cash collections in our research and events businesses and other positive working capital changes. partially offsetting the additional collections were higher cash payments for bonuses, commissions, and income taxes.
investing we used an additional $126.3 million of cash in our investing activities in 2014 compared to 2013, principally due to the 2014 acquisitions, in which we paid a total of $109.9 million (net of the cash acquired), and an additional $14.4 million was placed in escrow. the company used both existing cash and additional borrowings to finance the 2014 acquisitions. we also used an additional $2.0 million in cash for capital expenditures in the 2014 period.
financing we used $208.7 million of cash in our financing activities during 2014 compared to $153.9 million of cash used in 2013. during 2014, the company used $432.0 million of cash for share repurchases, which was partially offset by $195.4 million of net proceeds from debt issuance and related debt issuance costs and $28.0 million from employee share-based activity. during 2013 the company used $182.0 million of cash for share repurchases and $4.0 million for debt refinancing fees, which was partially offset by $32.0 million from employee share-based activities.
operating operating cash flow increased by $35.8 million, or 13%, when comparing 2013 to 2012. the increase was primarily due to higher net income in the 2013 period, as well as additional receivable collections and other positive working capital changes. these increases were partially offset by additional cash payments in the 2013 period for bonus, commissions, and income taxes, and we also had lower cash reimbursements in the 2013 period related to the completion of the renovation of our stamford headquarters facility.
investing cash used in our investing activities declined by $18.2 million in 2013 compared to 2012. the decrease was primarily due to $10.3 million of cash used in 2012 for the acquisition of ideas international and to a lesser extent, higher capital expenditures in 2012.
capital expenditures were $36.5 million in 2013 compared to $44.3 million in 2012, which included $7.7 million and $17.0 million, respectively, that were paid for the renovation of our stamford headquarters facility. the company's total expenditures on the renovation were approximately $34.2 million. the company received a total of $25.0 million of reimbursements from the facility landlord for the renovation, of which $3.0 million was received in 2013, $13.0 million in 2012, and $9.0 million in 2011, which were recorded in operating cash flows.
financing we used $154.0 million of cash in our financing activities in 2013 compared to $73.0 million in 2012, an increase in cash used of $81.0 million, primarily due to share repurchases. we used $182.0 million of cash in 2013 for share repurchases compared to $111.0 million in 2012. we also had lower cash proceeds from employee share-based activity in the 2013 period, and we also paid $4.0 million of fees related to our debt refinancing in the 2013 period.
2014 credit agreement the company has a five-year credit arrangement that it entered into in december 2014 that provides for a $400.0 million term loan and a $1.1 billion revolving credit facility (the "2014 credit agreement"). under the revolving credit facility, amounts may be borrowed, repaid, and re-borrowed through the maturity date of the agreement in december 2019. the term and revolving facilities may be increased, at the company's option, by up to an additional $500.0 million in the aggregate. as of december 31, 2014, the company had $400.0 million outstanding under the term facility and zero under the revolver. see note 5 - debt in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the 2014 credit agreement.
off-balance sheet arrangements through december 31, 2014, we have not entered into any off-balance sheet arrangements or transactions with unconsolidated entities or other persons.
contractual cash commitments the company has certain contractual commitments that require future cash payments. the following table summarizes these contractual cash commitments due after december 31, 2014 (in thousands):
operating leases (3)                                35,230                    51,445                  35,535                     100,960                 223,170

(2)   the company's $5.0 million state of connecticut economic development loan is included in the due in more than 5 years category since it has a 10 year maturity. interest payments on the loan have been calculated based on the contractual fixed rate of interest of 3%. under certain circumstances, part or all of this debt may be forgiven by the state. see note 5 - debt in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.
(3)   the company leases various facilities, furniture, autos, and computer equipment. these leases expire between 2015 and 2028. see note 1 - business and significant accounting policies in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on the company's leases.
(4)   represents the company's liability to participants in its supplemental deferred compensation arrangement (see note 13 - employee benefits in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information). amounts payable to active employees whose payment date is unknown have been included in the due in more than 5 years category since the company cannot determine when the amounts will be paid.
(5)   includes interest and penalties. in addition to the amount presented in the table, the company also has recorded liabilities of $19.9 million for unrecognized tax benefits and $2.9 million for related potential interest and penalties. we are uncertain as to when or if such amounts may be settled.

(1)   the aggregate of the four quarters' basic and diluted earnings per common share may not equal the reported full calendar year amounts due to the effects of share repurchases, dilutive equity compensation, and rounding.
recently issued accounting standards accounting rules issued by the various u.s. standard setting and governmental authorities that have not yet become effective and may impact our consolidated financial statements in future periods are described below, together with our assessment of the potential impact they may have on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures in future periods:
revenue recognition in may 2014, the fasb issued accounting standards update (asu) no. 2014-09, "revenue from contracts with customers" ("asu no. 2014-09"). asu no. 2014-09 is intended to clarify the principles for recognizing revenue by: removing inconsistencies and weaknesses in revenue recognition requirements; providing a more robust framework for addressing revenue issues; improving comparability of revenue recognition practices across entities, industries, jurisdictions and capital markets; and providing more useful information to users of financial statements through improved revenue disclosure requirements. the provisions of the new rule are effective for gartner on january 1, 2017. early adoption is not permitted. we continue to evaluate the impact of asu no. 2014-09.
discontinued operations in may 2014, the fasb issued asu no. 2014-08, reporting discontinued operations and disclosures of disposals of components of an entity ("asu 2014-08"), which changes the criteria for determining which disposal transactions can be presented as discontinued operations and modifies related disclosure requirements. under the new guidance, a discontinued operation is defined as a disposal of a component or group of components that is disposed of or is classified as held for sale and represents a strategic shift that has (or will have) a major effect on an entity's operations and financial results. the company adopted the new rule on january 1, 2015 and it did not have an impact on the company's consolidated financial statements.
the fasb also continues to work on a number of significant accounting rules which may impact the company's accounting and disclosures in future periods. since these rules have not yet been issued, the effective dates and potential impact are unknown.

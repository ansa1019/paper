overview the impact of the acquisition of the remaining equity interests in our affiliate samsung corning precision materials, now known as corning precision materials, combined with strong business performance in the environmental technologies and optical communications segments, drove an increase in sales of 24% in the year ended december 31, 2014, when compared to the same period last year.  net income increased significantly in 2014, up 26%, driven by the net gain on our yen-denominated hedging program, the consolidation of corning precision materials, the positive impact of the change in the contingent consideration fair value resulting from the acquisition, an increase in equity earnings from dow corning and higher net income in the environmental technologies and optical communications segments.  the increase was offset somewhat by price declines outpacing volume increases in the display technologies segment, the negative impact of the depreciation of the japanese yen against the u.s. dollar, several tax-related items and the net loss on several acquisition-related items.
net sales in the year ended december 31, 2014 were $9,715 million, compared to $7,819 million in the year ended december 31, 2013.  when compared to 2013, the change in net sales was driven by the following items:
·   an increase of $1.3 billion in the display technologies segment, driven by the consolidation of corning precision materials, which increased sales by $1.8 billion, and an increase in volume that was slightly more than 10% in percentage terms, offset somewhat by price declines in the mid-teens in percentage terms and the negative impact of the japanese yen versus the u.s. dollar exchange rate in the amount of $373 million;
·   an increase in net sales in the optical communications segment in the amount of $326 million, driven by an increase in sales of carrier network products in the amount of $254 million, largely due to growth in north america and europe, the $53 million impact of a small acquisition and the consolidation of an investment due to a change in control which occurred at the end of the second quarter of 2013 and an increase of $72 million in enterprise network products. these increases were offset slightly by a $52 million decrease in optical fiber sales in china; and
·   an increase of $173 million in the environmental technologies segment, due mainly to an increase in demand for our heavy duty diesel products, driven by new governmental regulations in europe and china and increased demand for class 8 vehicles in north america.
for the year ended december 31, 2014, we generated net income of $2.5 billion or $1.73 per share compared to net income of $2 billion or $1.34 per share for 2013.  when compared to last year, the increase in net income was due to the following items (amounts presented after tax):
·   the positive net impact of our yen-denominated hedge programs, driven by the weakening of the japanese yen in 2014, in the amount of $560 million;
·   the impact of the consolidation of corning precision materials, as well as cost reductions and efficiencies gained through synergies;
·   the change in the contingent consideration fair value resulting from the acquisition in the amount of $194 million;
·   an increase of $56 million in equity earnings from dow corning, driven by corning's share of a gain in the amount of $393 million from the reduction in the implant liability, favorable tax adjustments of $46 million and an increase in business results in both the silicone and polysilicon segments, offset by corning's share of a charge taken related to the abandonment of a polycrystalline silicon facility in the amount of $465 million; and
·   a $50 million increase in net income in the environmental technologies segment, driven by an increase in demand for our diesel and automotive products and improved manufacturing efficiency.
the increase in net income for the year ended december 31, 2014 was offset somewhat by the following items (amounts presented after-tax):
·   the impact of several tax-related items in the amount of $231 million, including changes in deferred tax valuation allowances of $150 million, $46 million of tax expense related to out-of-period transfer pricing adjustments and the absence of a tax benefit in the amount of $54 million recorded in the first quarter of 2013 related to the impact of the american taxpayer relief act enacted on january 3, 2013 retroactive to 2012;
·   the net impact of several acquisition-related items in the amount of $72 million;
·   the negative impact from the japanese yen versus the u.s. dollar exchange rate in the amount of $210 million; and
corning remains committed to a strategy of growing through global innovation.  this strategy has served us well.  our key priorities for 2014 were similar to those in prior years:  protect our financial health and invest in the future.  during 2014, we made the following progress on these priorities:
protecting financial health our financial position remained sound and we delivered strong cash flows from operating activities.  significant items in 2014 included the following:
·   we ended the year with $6.1 billion of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments, an increase from the december 31, 2013 balance of $5.2 billion, well above our debt balance at december 31, 2014 of $3.3 billion. the increase in cash was driven by the consolidation of corning precision materials, the cash received from samsung display for the additional issuance of preferred stock in connection with the acquisition and strong operating cash flow, offset by the cash paid for our share repurchases.
·   our debt to capital ratio of 13% at december 31, 2014 was consistent with our ratio at december 31, 2013.
·   operating cash flow for the year was $4.7 billion, an increase of $1.9 billion when compared to december 31, 2013, driven by a dividend in the amount of approximately $1.6 billion from samsung corning precision materials distributed subsequent to the acquisition of the remaining equity interests of the affiliate.
investing in our future corning is one of the world's leading innovators in materials science.  for more than 160 years, corning has applied its unparalleled expertise in specialty glass, ceramics, and optical physics to develop products that have created new industries and transformed people's lives.  although our spending level for research, development and engineering decreased slightly from 9% of sales in 2013 to 8% of sales in 2014, we maintained our innovation strategy focused on growing our existing businesses, developing opportunities adjacent or closely related to our existing technical and manufacturing capabilities, and investing in long-range opportunities in each of our market segments.  we continue to work on new products, including glass substrates for high performance displays and lcd applications, precision glass for advanced displays, emissions control products for cars, trucks, and off-road vehicles, products that accelerate drug discovery and manufacturing and the optical fiber, cable and hardware and equipment that enable fiber-to-the-premises, and next generation data centers.  in addition, we are focusing on wireless solutions for diverse venue applications, such as distributed antenna systems, fiber-to-the cell site and fiber-to-the antenna.  we have focused our research, development and engineering spending to support the advancement of new product attributes for our corning® gorilla® glass suite of products.  we will continue to focus on adjacent glass opportunities which leverage existing materials or manufacturing processes, including corning® willowtm glass, our ultra-slim flexible glass substrate for use in next-generation consumer electronic technologies.
capital spending totaled $1.1 billion in 2014, slightly above the amount spent in 2013.  spending in 2014 was driven primarily by the display technologies segment, and focused on finishing line optimization and tank rebuilds.  we expect our 2015 capital expenditures to be approximately $1.3 billion to $1.4 billion.  we anticipate approximately $650 million will be allocated to our display technologies segment.
corporate outlook we expect 2015 to produce another year of sales increases in our optical communications, life sciences, specialty materials and environmental technologies segments, and for the lcd retail glass market and corning's glass volume to grow.  we believe the overall lcd glass retail market in 2015 will increase in the high-single digits, driven by the combination of an increase in retail sales of lcd televisions and the demand for larger television screen sizes.  we anticipate a rise in global demand for corning's carrier network products, combined with growth of enterprise network products, will increase sales in our optical communications segment.  we believe sales of corning gorilla glass will improve in 2015, as we expect price declines to be moderate and volume to improve in line with the increase in the handheld market.  and we expect another strong year of manufacturing process improvements and cost reductions, which, in combination with sales growth, will deliver overall earnings growth for corning.  we remain confident that our strategy to grow through global innovation, while preserving our financial stability, will enable our continued long-term success.

net sales corning's net sales in the year ended december 31, 2014 improved in all of our segments, increasing by $1,896 million to $9,715 million, when compared to the same period in 2013, driven by the following events:
·   display technologies increased by $1.3 billion, due to the consolidation of corning precision materials, which increased sales by $1.8 billion, and an increase in volume that was slightly more than 10% in percentage terms, offset somewhat by price declines in the mid-teens and the negative impact of the japanese yen versus the u.s. dollar exchange rate in the amount of $373 million;
·   optical communications increased by $326 million, driven by an increase in sales of carrier network products in the amount of $254 million, largely due to growth in north america and europe, up $113 million and $46 million, respectively, the impact of a full year of sales from a small acquisition and the consolidation of an investment due to a change in control that occurred at the end of the second quarter of 2013, which added $53 million, and an increase of $72 million in enterprise network products. these increases were offset slightly by a $52 million decrease in optical fiber sales in china;
·   an increase of $173 million in the environmental technologies segment, due mainly to an increase in demand for our heavy duty diesel products, driven by new governmental regulations in europe and china, and increased demand for class 8 vehicles in north america. automotive substrate sales were also strong, increasing 9%, due to increased demand in europe and china;
·   specialty materials improved by $35 million, driven by an increase in sales of advanced optics products. corning gorilla glass sales remained consistent with the prior year, with volume increases offset by an unfavorable shift in product mix and price declines; and
·   life science increased by $11 million, driven by growth in north america and china, up $12 million and $5 million, respectively.
for the year ended december 31, 2013, net sales remained relatively consistent when compared to the year ended december 31, 2012, with higher sales in the optical communications and life sciences segments offset by declines in the display technologies, environmental technologies and specialty materials segments.  the change in net sales was largely driven by the following:
·   optical communications sales increased by $196 million, driven by an increase in sales of our carrier products in the amount of $163 million, largely due to the ramp-up of the fiber-to-the-premises initiative in australia, which increased by $28 million, an increase of $23 million in sales of wireless products and higher sales of fiber and cable products in north america, china and europe, up $52 million, $33 million and $26 million, respectively. also included in the increase in sales of carrier products is the impact of a small acquisition completed in the second quarter of 2013 and the consolidation of an investment due to a change in control, which added approximately $53 million in 2013;
·   net sales increased by $194 million in the life sciences segment, driven by the impact of the acquisition of the discovery labware business in the fourth quarter of 2012;
·   display technologies segment sales were lower, driven by price declines in the mid-teens and the impact of the depreciation of the japanese yen versus the u.s. dollar offsetting volume increases in the mid-twenties in percentage terms;
·   environmental technologies segment sales decreased, driven by a decline of 9% for diesel products;
·   net sales declined by $176 million in the specialty materials segment, driven by a 17% decline in sales of corning gorilla glass.
in 2014, 2013 and 2012, sales into international markets accounted for 77%, 74% and 77%, respectively, of total net sales.
cost of sales the types of expenses included in the cost of sales line item are: raw materials consumption, including direct and indirect materials; salaries, wages and benefits; depreciation and amortization; production utilities; production-related purchasing; warehousing (including receiving and inspection); repairs and maintenance; inter-location inventory transfer costs; production and warehousing facility property insurance; rent for production facilities; and other production overhead.
gross margin for 2014, gross margin dollars increased by $728 million when compared to 2013, driven largely by the consolidation of corning precision materials, combined with an increase of $102 million in the environmental technologies segment from higher volume and improved manufacturing efficiencies.  gross margin as a percentage of net sales decreased when compared to the same period last year, due primarily to the impact of the depreciation of the japanese yen versus the u.s. dollar in the amount of $333 million, price declines in the mid-teens in percentage terms in our display technologies segment, higher pension expense of approximately $50 million and the impact of inventory builds in 2013 in the optical communications and specialty materials segments that did not repeat in 2014.
for 2013, gross margin dollars and as a percentage of sales increased when compared to 2012, led by a decrease in pension expense in the amount of $150 million driven by a 100 basis point increase in the discount rate used to value our u.s. pension liability and an increase of 6% in the specialty materials segment, resulting from improvements in manufacturing efficiency and cost reduction programs.  the depreciation of the japanese yen versus the u.s. dollar and price declines in the display technologies segment partially offset the increase.
selling, general, and administrative expenses selling, general, and administrative expenses for the year ended december 31, 2014 increased by $85 million when compared to 2013.  the increase was largely driven by the consolidation of corning precision materials, which added $90 million, an increase in pension expense of approximately $27 million, an increase of $38 million in share-based and performance-based compensation expenses and an increase of approximately $90 million in acquisition-related costs, including $72 million of post-combination compensation expense, offset somewhat by the positive impact of a contingent consideration fair value adjustment of $249 million.  as a percentage of net sales, selling, general and administrative expenses were 12%, considerably lower than the same period in 2013, largely due to the contingent consideration fair value adjustment more than offsetting the increase in selling, general, and administrative expenses resulting from the acquisition.
selling, general, and administrative expenses for 2013 decreased by $79 million when compared to 2012.  this decrease was largely driven by a decrease in pension expense in the amount of $76 million driven by a 100 basis point increase in the discount rate used to value our u.s. pension liability, cost control measures implemented in our segments and a decline in variable compensation in the amount of $27 million, offset somewhat by an increase in costs in the optical communications, specialty materials and life sciences segments.  as a percentage of net sales, these expenses decreased when compared to the same period last year.
the types of expenses included in the selling, general and administrative expenses line item are: salaries, wages and benefits; travel; professional fees; and depreciation and amortization, utilities, and rent for administrative facilities.
research, development and engineering expenses for the year ended december 31, 2014, research, development, and engineering expenses increased by $105 million when compared to the same period last year, driven by the consolidation of corning precision materials, which added $69 million, an increase of approximately $30 million in new business development spending and $20 million of additional pension expense.  we continue to focus on new product development in areas such as glass substrates for high performance displays in our display technologies segment, wireless solutions for diverse venue applications in the optical communications segment and advancement of new product attributes for our corning gorilla glass suite of products in our specialty materials segment.  as a percentage of net sales, research, development and engineering expenses declined slightly, from 9% in 2013 to 8% in 2014, reflecting cost control measures implemented in 2014.
for the year ended december 31, 2013, research, development, and engineering expenses decreased by $59 million when compared to the same period last year, driven by a decrease in pension expense in the amount of $47 million driven by a 100 basis point increase in the discount rate used to value our u.s. pension liability and declines in our display technologies and environmental technologies segments of $19 million and $11 million, respectively, offset slightly by higher costs in the optical communications, specialty materials and life sciences segments.  as a percentage of net sales, research, development and engineering expenses declined slightly in the year ended december 31, 2013, when compared to the same period in 2012.
restructuring, impairment, and other charges and credits corning recorded restructuring, impairment, and other charges and credits in 2014, 2013 and 2012, which affect the comparability of our results for the periods presented.  additional information on restructuring and asset impairment is found in note 2 (restructuring, impairment and other charges) to the consolidated financial statements.  a description of those charges and credits follows:
2014 activity for the year ended december 31, 2014, we recorded charges of $71 million for workforce reductions, asset disposals and write-offs, and exit costs for restructuring activities with total cash expenditures estimated to be $51 million.  annualized savings from these actions are estimated to be approximately $94 million and will be reflected largely in selling, general, and administrative expenses.
2013 activity to better align our 2014 cost position in several of our businesses, corning implemented a global restructuring plan within several of our segments in the fourth quarter of 2013, consisting of workforce reductions, asset disposals and write-offs, and exit costs.  we recorded charges of $67 million, before tax, associated with these actions, with total cash expenditures expected to be approximately $40 million.
2012 activity in response to uncertain global economic conditions, and the potential for slower growth in many of our businesses in 2013, corning implemented a corporate-wide restructuring plan in the fourth quarter of 2012.  we recorded charges of $89 million, before tax, which included costs for workforce reductions, asset write-offs and exit costs.  total cash expenditures associated with these actions were approximately $49 million, and spending for employee-related costs was completed in 2013.
the specialty materials segment recorded an impairment charge in the fourth quarter of 2011 in the amount of $130 million, before tax, related to certain assets used in the production of large cover glass due to sales that were significantly below our expectations.  in the fourth quarter of 2012, after reassessing the large cover glass business, corning concluded that the large cover glass market was developing differently in 2012 than our expectations, demand for larger-sized cover glass was declining, and the market for this type of glass was instead targeting smaller gen size products.  additionally, in the fourth quarter of 2012, our primary customer of large cover glass notified corning of its decision to exit from this display market.  based on these events, we recorded an additional impairment charge in the fourth quarter of 2012 in the amount of $44 million, before tax.  this impairment charge represents a write-down of assets specific to the glass-strengthening process for large size cover glass to their fair market values, and includes machinery and equipment used in the ion exchange process.
asbestos litigation in 2014, we recorded a decrease to our asbestos litigation liability of $9 million compared to an increase of $19 million in 2013 and $14 million in 2012.
our asbestos litigation liability was estimated to be $681 million at december 31, 2014, compared with an estimate of $690 million at december 31, 2013.  the entire obligation is classified as a non-current liability as installment payments for the cash portion of the obligation are not planned to commence until more than 12 months after the proposed amended pcc plan is ultimately effective, and a portion of the obligation will be fulfilled through the direct contribution of corning's investment in pce (currently recorded as a non-current other equity method investment).

equity in earnings of affiliated companies the following provides a summary of equity earnings of affiliated companies (in millions):
equity earnings of affiliated companies decreased in the twelve months ended december 31, 2014, when compared to the same period last year, reflecting the acquisition and consolidation of samsung corning precision materials, offset somewhat by an increase in equity earnings from dow corning.
dow corning the following table provides a summary of equity earnings from dow corning, by component (in millions):
beginning in the latter half of 2011, and continuing into 2012, dow corning began experiencing unfavorable industry conditions at its consolidated subsidiary hemlock, a producer of high purity polycrystalline silicon for the semiconductor and solar industries, driven by over-capacity at all levels of the solar industry supply chain.  this over-capacity led to significant declines in polycrystalline spot prices in the fourth quarter of 2011, and prices remained depressed throughout 2012.  in 2013, markets stabilized, but prices remain significantly below historical levels.
due to the conditions and uncertainties during 2012 described above, sales volume declined and production levels of certain operating assets were reduced.  as a result, in the fourth quarter of 2012, dow corning determined that a polycrystalline silicon plant expansion previously delayed since the fourth quarter of 2011 would no longer be economically viable and made the decision to abandon this expansion activity.  the abandonment resulted in an impairment charge of $57 million, before tax, for corning's share of the write down in the value of these construction-in-progress assets.  further, the startup of another polycrystalline silicon plant expansion that was expected to begin production in 2013 was delayed and its assets were idled.
in july 2012, the mofcom initiated antidumping and countervailing duty investigations of imports of solar-grade polycrystalline silicon products from the u.s. and south korea based on a petition filed by chinese solar-grade polycrystalline silicon producers.  the petition alleged that producers within these countries exported solar-grade polycrystalline silicon to china at less than fair value and that production of solar-grade polycrystalline silicon in the u.s. has been subsidized by the u.s. government.  on july 18, 2013, mofcom announced its preliminary determination that china's solar-grade polycrystalline silicon industry suffered material damage because of dumping by producers in the u.s. and korea.  the chinese authorities imposed provisional antidumping duties on producers in the u.s. and korea ranging from 2.4% to 57.0%, including duties of 53.3% on future imports of solar-grade polycrystalline silicon product from the dow corning subsidiary into china.  on september 16, 2013, the chinese authorities imposed provisional countervailing duties of 6.5% on solar grade polycrystalline silicon products from the dow corning subsidiary.  on january 20, 2014, mofcom issued a final determination.  the final determination resulted in no change to the antidumping duties, and the countervailing duties were reduced to 2.1%.  the requirement for customers to pay provisional duties on imports from solar-grade polycrystalline silicon producers became effective on july 24, 2013 for the antidumping duties and on september 20, 2013 for the countervailing duties, adjusted for the final determination.  dow corning will not be subject to duties for previous sales.
in december 2014, dow corning determined its polycrystalline silicon plant expansion which was delayed in the fourth quarter of 2012, would not be economically viable and made the decision to permanently abandon the assets.  this decision was made after review of sustained adverse market conditions and continued oversupply, the cost of operating the facility and the ongoing impact of tariffs on polycrystalline silicon imported into china.  the decision to permanently cease use of these assets resulted in dow corning taking a pre-tax charge of approximately $1.5 billion in the fourth quarter of 2014 (corning's share after-tax: $465 million).  as a result of the significant change in the use of this asset, dow corning assessed whether the carrying value of all polycrystalline silicon assets might be impaired.  dow corning's estimates of future undiscounted cash flows indicated the polycrystalline silicon asset group was recoverable.
in may 1995, dow corning filed for bankruptcy protection to address pending and claimed liabilities arising from breast implant product lawsuits.  on june 1, 2004, dow corning emerged from chapter 11 with a plan of reorganization (the "plan") which provided for the settlement or other resolution of implant claims.  under the plan, dow corning established and agreed to fund a products liability settlement program (the "settlement facility").  the plan contains a cap on the amount of payments required from dow corning to fund the settlement facility.  inclusive of insurance, dow corning has paid approximately $1.8 billion to the settlement facility, and approximately $1.3 billion has been paid to claimants out of the settlement facility.  dow corning's recorded liability related to implant matters ("implant liability") was approximately $1.7 billion at september 30, 2014, representing dow corning's estimated remaining obligation for future funding of the settlement facility.
during the fourth quarter of 2014, dow corning, with the assistance of a third-party advisor, developed an estimate of the future implant liability based on evidence that the actual funding required for the settlement facility is expected to be lower than the full funding cap set forth in the plan.  on december 12, 2014, dow corning reduced its implant liability by approximately $1.3 billion (corning's share after-tax: $393 million).  previously, the implant liability was based on the full funding cap set forth in the plan.  the revised implant liability reflects dow corning's best estimate of its remaining obligations under the plan.  should events or circumstances occur in the future which change dow corning's estimate of the remaining funding obligations, the implant liability will be revised.  this adjustment does not affect dow corning's commitment or ability to fulfill its obligations under the settlement, and all claims that qualify under the settlement will be paid according to the terms of the plan.
·   an increase in equity earnings of $487 million in the silicones segment, driven by the gain resulting from the reduction of the implant liability in the amount of $393 million, favorable tax adjustments in the amount of $46 million and a decrease in tax expense, offset somewhat by a $5 million decrease in the amount of gains recorded on the mark-to-market of a derivative instrument; and
·   an decrease in equity earnings of $431 million in the polysilicon segment, driven by corning's share of dow corning's charge for the abandonment of a polycrystalline silicon plant expansion in the amount of $465, offset slightly by higher volume, the absence of $11 million in restructuring charges incurred in the first half of 2013, a gain in the amount of $6 million related to energy tax credits and the settlement of a long-term sales agreement in the first quarter of 2014 in the amount of $9 million.
·   in the silicones segment, a gain of $20 million associated with the termination of a long-term sales agreement, the positive impact of the recognition of a derivative instrument in the amount of $16 million, the absence of the 2012 restructuring charge of $30 million, coupled with cost reduction resulting from these actions, and lower variable compensation costs. the increase in earnings was partially offset by the negative impact of price declines and weaker demand in asia and the americas; and
·   in the polysilicon segment, the absence of the impairment charge of $57 million recorded in 2012 related to the abandonment of a polycrystalline silicon plant expansion, offset by corning's share of restructuring charges at hemlock in the amount of $11 million and the absence of the gain of $10 million associated with the resolution of a contract dispute.
"other income, net" in corning's consolidated statements of income includes the following (in millions):

beginning in the first quarter of 2014, due to the acquisition and consolidation of samsung corning precision materials (now corning precision materials), royalty income from corning precision materials is no longer recognized in corning's consolidated statement of income.
included in the line item foreign currency transaction and hedge gains, net, for the years ended december 31, 2014 and 2013 is the impact of purchased collars and average forward contracts which hedge our translation exposure resulting from movements in the japanese yen against the u.s. dollar and its impact on our net earnings.  in the years ended december 31, 2014 and 2013, we recorded net pre-tax gains on our yen-denominated hedging programs in the amount of $1,406 million and $435 million, respectively, which included $344 million and $110 million of realized gains, respectively.  these gains were driven by the mark-to-market valuation of the purchased collars and average forward contracts, and occurred due to the depreciation in the 2014 and 2013 exchange rates for the japanese yen versus the u.s. dollar of 14% and 22%, respectively.  the gross notional value outstanding for purchased collars and average rate forward contracts was $9.8 billion at december 31, 2014 and $6.8 billion at december 31, 2013.  refer to item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risks for additional details.
in the second quarter of 2014, following the acquisition, we entered into a portfolio of zero cost collars to hedge our exposure to movements in the korean won and its impact on our net earnings.  these zero cost collars have a gross notional value outstanding at december 31, 2014 of $2.3 billion, and began settling quarterly in the third quarter of 2014 and will conclude at the end of 2015.  the net pre-tax loss on these zero cost collars, which is also included in the line item foreign currency transaction and hedge gains, net, was $37 million for the twelve months ended december 31, 2014, and included $6 million of realized losses.
income before income taxes income before income taxes for the year ended december 31, 2014, was negatively impacted by the depreciation of the japanese yen versus the u.s. dollar in the amount of $297 million.
the effective income tax rate for 2014 differed from the u.s. statutory rate of 35% primarily due to the following items:
·   rate differences on income (loss) of consolidated foreign companies, including the benefit of excess foreign tax credits attributable to a taxable intercompany loan made to the u.s., and
·   the impact of equity in earnings of nonconsolidated affiliates reported in the financials, net of tax.
partially offsetting the benefits above is a $177 million charge attributable to a change in judgment on the realizability of certain foreign deferred taxes assets in germany and japan.
the effective income tax rate for 2013 differed from the u.s. statutory rate of 35% primarily due to the following items:
·   rate differences on income (loss) of consolidated foreign companies;
·   the impact of equity in earnings of nonconsolidated affiliates reported in the financials, net of tax;
·   the benefit of tax incentives in foreign jurisdictions, primarily taiwan; and
·   tax benefit of $54 million for the impact of the american taxpayer relieve act enacted on january 3, 2013 and made retroactive to 2012.
partially offsetting the benefits above is a $48 million charge attributable to a change in the judgment regarding the realizability of certain foreign and state deferred tax assets.
corning has valuation allowances on certain shorter-lived deferred tax assets such as those represented by capital loss and state tax net operating loss carry forwards, as well as other foreign net operating loss carryforwards, because we cannot conclude that it is more likely than not that we will earn income of the character or amount required to utilize these assets before they expire.  the amount of u.s. and foreign deferred tax assets that have remaining valuation allowances at december 31, 2014 and 2013 was $298 million and $286 million, respectively.
corning continues to indefinitely reinvest substantially all of its foreign earnings, with the exception of approximately $10 million of current earnings that have very low or no tax cost associated with their repatriation.  our current analysis indicates that we have sufficient u.s. liquidity, including borrowing capacity, to fund foreseeable u.s. cash needs without requiring the repatriation of foreign cash.  one time or unusual items that may impact our ability or intent to keep our foreign earnings and cash indefinitely reinvested include significant u.s. acquisitions, stock repurchases, shareholder dividends, changes in tax laws, derivative contract settlements or the development of tax planning ideas that allow us to repatriate earnings at minimal or no tax cost, and/or a change in our circumstances or economic conditions that negatively impact our ability to borrow or otherwise fund u.s. needs from existing u.s. sources.  as of december 31, 2014, taxes have not been provided on approximately $10.3 billion of accumulated foreign unremitted earnings that are expected to remain invested indefinitely.  while it remains impracticable to calculate the tax cost of repatriating our total unremitted foreign earnings, such cost could be material to the results of operations of corning in a particular period.
our foreign subsidiary in taiwan operates under various tax holiday arrangements.  the nature and extent of such arrangements vary, and the benefits of such arrangements phase out through 2018.  the impact of the tax holidays on our effective rate is a reduction in the rate of 0.4, 1.2 and 1.7 percentage points for 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively.
while we expect the amount of unrecognized tax benefits to change in the next 12 months, we do not expect the change to have a significant impact on the results of operations or our financial position.
refer to note 6 (income taxes) to the consolidated financial statements for further details regarding income tax matters.
net income attributable to corning incorporated as a result of the items discussed above, net income and per share data was as follows (in millions, except per share amounts):
foreign currency translation adjustments and other                                          (1,073)               (682)               (179)
unamortized (losses) gains and prior service costs for postretirement benefit plans           (281)                 392                 (1)
other comprehensive loss, net of tax (note 17)                                              (1,351)               (312)               (120)
for the year ended december 31, 2014, comprehensive income decreased by $528 million when compared to the same period in 2013, driven by an increase in unamortized losses for postretirement benefit plans and the negative impact of the change in foreign currency translation adjustments, offset by an increase of $511 million in net income attributable to corning incorporated.
the increase in unamortized losses for postretirement benefit plans in the amount of $673 million is driven mainly by changes to the discount rate and mortality assumptions used to value corning's u.s. pension and postretirement medical and life benefit plan ("opeb") obligations and the benefit plan obligations of our equity affiliate dow corning at december 31, 2014.  corning and dow corning adopted the society of actuaries mortality table rp-2014 published in october, 2014, along with an updated improvement scale, and the discount rate for our u.s. benefit plans decreased between 75 and 100 basis points.  at december 31, 2014, the decrease in discount rates and the change in the mortality assumption for our u.s. plans led to an actuarial after-tax loss of approximately $281 million versus a gain in 2013 of $392 million.  the loss of $281 million occurring in 2014 included the impact to our u.s. pension and opeb plans from the mortality table change in the amount of $88 million, the impact of $89 million from changes in other actuarial assumptions and $124 million from our equity affiliate dow corning, offset by reclassifications to the income statement of $20 million after-tax related to u.s. non-qualified and international pension plans.  because the actuarial loss for our u.s qualified pension plan did not fall outside of the corridor, which is defined as equal to 10% of the greater of the benefit obligation or the market-related value of plan assets at the beginning of the year, it was recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income ("aoci") and did not impact net income for the year ended december 31, 2014.
the increase in the loss on foreign currency translation adjustments for the year ended december 31, 2014 in the amount of $391 million was driven by the following items:  1) the increase in the loss in the translation of corning's consolidated subsidiaries in the amount of $65 million, which resulted primarily from the depreciation of the japanese yen to u.s. dollar translation rate during 2014; 2) the increase in the loss in the translation of corning's equity method investments in the amount of $190 million; and 3) the reclassification of a gain to net income in the amount of $136 million related to the acquisition of samsung corning precision materials.
for the year ended december 31, 2013, comprehensive income increased by $133 million, when compared to the same period in 2012, driven by an increase in net income attributable to corning incorporated and an increase in unamortized gains for postretirement benefit plans, offset partially by the increase in the loss on foreign currency translation adjustments.
the increase in the amount of unamortized gains for postretirement benefit plans is due to an increase of between 75 and 100 basis points in the discount rates used to value corning's u.s. pension and postretirement medical and life benefit plan ("opeb") obligations and the benefit plan obligations of our equity affiliate dow corning.  at december 31, 2013, the increase in discount rates led to an actuarial after-tax gain of $392 million.  because this gain did not fall outside of the corridor, which is defined as equal to 10% of the greater of the benefit obligation or the market-related value of plan assets at the beginning of the year, the gain was recorded in aoci and did not impact net income for the year ended december 31, 2013.
the increase in the loss on foreign currency translation adjustments for the year ended december 31, 2013 in the amount of $503 million was driven by the following items:  1) the increase in the loss in the translation of corning's consolidated subsidiaries in the amount of $317 million, which resulted primarily from the depreciation of the japanese yen to u.s. dollar translation rate during 2013; 2) the increase in the loss in the translation of corning's equity method investments in the amount of $238 million, which is attributed to the change in the korean won to u.s. dollar translation rate during 2013, which impacted our equity affiliate samsung corning precision materials; and 3) the absence of the 2012 reclassification of a gain to net income in the amount of $52 million related to the gain on the liquidation of a foreign subsidiary.
core performance measures in managing the company and assessing our financial performance, we supplement certain measures provided by our consolidated financial statements with measures adjusted to exclude certain items, to arrive at core performance measures.  we believe reporting core performance measures provides investors greater transparency to the information used by our management team to make financial and operational decisions.  net sales, equity in earnings of affiliated companies, and net income are adjusted to exclude the impacts of changes in the japanese yen and korean won, the impact of the purchased and zero cost collars, average forward contracts and other yen-related transactions, acquisition-related costs, the 2013 results of the polysilicon business of our equity affiliate dow corning corporation, discrete tax items, restructuring and restructuring-related charges, certain litigation and regulatory expenses, pension mark-to-market adjustments, and other items which do not reflect on-going operating results of the company or our equity affiliates.  management discussion and analysis on our reportable segments has also been adjusted for these items.  these measures are not prepared in accordance with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles ("gaap").  we believe investors should consider these non-gaap measures in evaluating our results as they are more indicative of our core operating performance and how management evaluates our operational results and trends.  these measures are not, and should not be viewed as a substitute for u.s. gaap reporting measures.  for a reconciliation of non-gaap performance measures and a further discussion of the measures, please see "reconciliation of non-gaap measures" below.

core net sales corning's core net sales in the year ended december 31, 2014 improved in all of our segments, increasing by $2,269 million to $10,217 million, when compared to the same period in 2013.  driving the growth in core net sales are the following items:
·   display technologies increased by $1.7 billion, due to the consolidation of corning precision materials, which increased sales by $1.9 billion, and an increase in volume that was slightly more than 10% in percentage terms, offset somewhat by price declines in the mid-teens;
·   optical communications increased by $326 million, driven by an increase in sales of carrier network products in the amount of $254 million, largely due to growth in north america and europe, up $113 million and $46 million, respectively, the impact of a full year of sales from a small acquisition and the consolidation of an investment due to a change in control that occurred at the end of the second quarter of 2013, which added $53 million, and an increase of $72 million in enterprise network products. these increases were offset slightly by a $52 million decrease in optical fiber sales in china;
·   an increase of $173 million in the environmental technologies segment, due mainly to an increase in demand for our heavy duty diesel products, driven by new governmental regulations in europe and china, and increased demand for class 8 vehicles in north america. automotive substrate sales were also strong, increasing 9%, on increased demand in europe and china;
·   specialty materials improved by $35 million, driven by an increase in sales of advanced optics products. corning gorilla glass sales remained consistent with the prior year, with volume increases offset by an unfavorable shift in product mix and price declines; and
·   life sciences increased by $11 million, driven by growth in north america and china, up $12 million and $5 million, respectively.
for the year ended december 31, 2013, core net sales increased by 5% when compared to the same period in 2012.  higher net core sales in the display technologies, optical communications and life sciences segments were offset slightly by declines in the environmental technologies and specialty materials segments.  the change in core net sales was driven by the following events:
·   in the display technologies segment, volume increases in the mid-twenties in percentage terms more than offset price declines in the mid-teens, which drove an increase in core sales of $173 million, or 7%;
·   optical communications increased by $196 million, driven by an increase in sales of our carrier products in the amount of $163 million, largely due to the ramp-up of the fiber-to-the-premises initiative in australia, which increased by $28 million, an increase of $23 million in sales of wireless products and higher sales of cable products in north america, china and europe, up $52 million, $33 million and $26 million, respectively;
·   an increase in the life sciences segment of $194 million, driven by the impact of the acquisition of the discovery labware business in the fourth quarter of 2012;
·   in the environmental technologies segment, while automotive product sales remained relatively consistent with the prior year, core sales of our diesel products declined by 9%; and
·   a decline of $176 million in the specialty materials segment, due to a 17% decline in corning gorilla glass sales.

core equity earnings from dow corning increased in the twelve months ended december 31, 2014, when compared to the same period in 2013, driven by higher earnings in both the silicones and polysilicon segments.  driving the increase was a decrease in tax expense in the silicones segment and higher volume and improved manufacturing performance in the polysilicon segment.
core equity earnings of affiliated companies declined by 17% in the year ended december 31, 2013, when compared to the same period in 2012.  equity earnings from samsung corning precision materials decreased by $130 million, or 24%, driven primarily by price declines in the mid-teens in percentage terms and higher taxes due to the expiration of tax holidays in the amount of $54 million.  slightly offsetting the decline were manufacturing improvements in the amount of $28 million.  core equity earnings from dow corning were relatively consistent in the twelve months ended december 31, 2013, when compared to the same period in 2012, with lower prices and weaker demand for silicone products in europe and china and higher interest expense offset by a reduction in costs as a result of restructuring actions implemented in the fourth quarter of 2012.
·   the impact of the consolidation of corning precision materials and the resulting cost reductions and efficiencies gained through synergies;
·   an increase of $57 million in the environmental technologies segment, driven by an increase in demand for our diesel products and improved manufacturing efficiency; and
·   an increase of $35 million in the optical communications segment, driven by higher sales of carrier network and enterprise network products.
the increase in core earnings for the year ended december 31, 2014 was offset somewhat by price declines in the mid-teens in percentage terms outpacing an increase in volume slightly higher than 10% in our display technologies segment.
·   higher core earnings in the optical communications, life sciences, environmental technologies and display technologies segments in the amounts of $59 million, $44 million, $11 million and $7 million, respectively; and
·   lower operating expenses in the amount of $49 million, driven by a decrease in variable compensation and cost control measures implemented by our segments.
included in core earnings for the years ended december 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012 is net periodic pension expense in the amount of $74 million, $37 million and $63 million, respectively, which excludes the annual pension mark-to-market adjustments.  in 2014, 2013 and 2012, the mark-to-market adjustments were a pre-tax loss in the amount of $29 million, a gain in the amount of $30 million and a loss in the amount of $217 million, respectively.  refer to note 13 (employee retirement plans) to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.

items which we exclude from gaap measures to arrive at core performance measures are as follows:
(1)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              constant-currency adjustments:
constant-yen: because a significant portion of corning's lcd glass business revenues and manufacturing costs are denominated in japanese yen, management believes it is important to understand the impact on core earnings of translating yen into dollars. presenting results on a constant-yen basis mitigates the translation impact of the japanese yen, and allows management to evaluate performance period over period, analyze underlying trends in our businesses, and establish operational goals and forecasts. as of december 31, 2014, we used an internally derived management rate of ¥93, which is aligned to our yen portfolio of purchased collars and average rate forwards, and have recast all periods presented based on this rate in order to effectively remove the impact of changes in the japanese yen.
constant-won: following the acquisition of samsung corning precision materials and because a significant portion of samsung corning precision materials'(now corning precision materials) costs are denominated in korean won, management believes it is important to understand the impact on core earnings from translating won into dollars. presenting results on a constant-won basis mitigates the translation impact of the korean won, and allows management to evaluate performance period over period, analyze underlying trends in our businesses, and establish operational goals and forecasts without the variability caused by the fluctuations caused by changes in the rate of this currency. we use an internally derived management rate of 1,100, which is consistent with historical prior period averages of the won. we have not recast prior periods presented as the impact is not material to corning in those periods.
(2)   purchased and zero cost collars, average forward contracts and other yen-related transactions: we have excluded the impact of our yen-denominated purchased collars, average forward contracts, and other yen-related transactions for each period presented. additionally, we are also excluding the impact of our portfolio of korean won-denominated zero cost collars which we entered into in the second quarter of 2014. by aligning an internally derived rate with our portfolio of purchased collars and average forward contracts, and excluding other yen-related transactions and the constant-currency adjustments, we have materially mitigated the impact of changes in the japanese yen and korean won.
(3)   results of dow corning's consolidated subsidiary, hemlock semiconductor: in 2013, we excluded the results of dow corning's consolidated subsidiary, hemlock semiconductor, a producer of polycrystalline silicon, to remove the operating and non-operating items and events which have caused severe unpredictability and instability in earnings beginning in 2012. these events were primarily driven by the macro-economic environment. specifically, the negative impact of the determination by the chinese ministry of commerce ("mofcom"), which imposed provisional anti-dumping duties on solar-grade polysilicon imports from the united states, and the impact of asset write-offs, offset by the benefit of large payments required under hemlock semiconductor customers' "take-or-pay" contracts, are events that are unrelated to dow corning's core operations, and that have, or could have, significant impacts to this business. beginning in 2014, due to the stabilization of the polycrystalline silicon industry, we will no longer exclude the operating results of hemlock semiconductor from core performance measures.
(4)   acquisition-related costs: these expenses include intangible amortization, inventory valuation adjustments and external acquisition-related deal costs.
(5)   discrete tax items and other tax-related adjustments: this represents the removal of discrete adjustments attributable to changes in tax law and changes in judgment about the realizability of certain deferred tax assets, as well as other non-operational tax-related adjustments, including the tax effect of a transfer pricing out of period adjustment in 2014. this item also includes the income tax effects of adjusting from gaap earnings to core earnings.
(6)   litigation, regulatory and other legal matters: includes amounts related to the pittsburgh corning corporation (pcc) asbestos litigation, adjustments to our estimated liability for environmental-related items and the settlement of litigation related to a small acquisition.
(7)   restructuring, impairment and other charges. this amount includes restructuring, impairment and other charges, as well as other expenses and disposal costs not classified as restructuring expense.
(8)   liquidation of subsidiary: the partial impact of non-restructuring related items due to the decision to liquidate a consolidated subsidiary that is not significant.
(9)   equity in earnings of affiliated companies: these adjustments relate to items which do not reflect expected on-going operating results of our affiliated companies, such as restructuring, impairment and other charges and settlements under "take-or-pay" contracts.
(10)   impacts from the acquisition of samsung corning precision materials: pre-acquisition gains and losses on previously held equity investment and other gains and losses related to the acquisition, including post-combination expenses, fair value adjustments to the indemnity asset related to contingent consideration and the impact of the withholding tax on a dividend from samsung corning precision materials.
(11)   pension mark-to-market adjustment: mark-to-market pension gains and losses, which arise from changes in actuarial assumptions and the difference between actual and expected returns on plan assets and discount rates. management believes that pension actuarial gains and losses are primarily financing activities that are more reflective of changes in current conditions in global financial markets, and are not directly related to the underlying performance of our businesses. for further information on the actuarial assumptions and plan assets referenced above, see management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations, under critical accounting estimates - employee retirement plans, and note 13, employee retirement plans, of notes to the consolidated financial statements.
(12)   gain on change in control of equity investment: gain as a result of certain changes to the shareholder agreement of an equity company, resulting in corning having a controlling interest that requires consolidation of this investment.
(13)   loss on repurchase of debt: in 2012, corning recorded a loss on the repurchase of $13 million of our 8.875% senior unsecured notes due 2021, $11 million of our 8.875% senior unsecured notes due 2016, and $51 million of our 6.75% senior unsecured notes due 2013.
(14)   accumulated other comprehensive income: in 2012, corning recorded a translation capital gain on the liquidation of a foreign subsidiary.
·   environmental technologies - manufactures ceramic substrates and filters for automotive and diesel applications.
·   specialty materials - manufactures products that provide more than 150 material formulations for glass, glass ceramics and fluoride crystals to meet demand for unique customer needs.
all other reportable segments that do not meet the quantitative threshold for separate reporting have been grouped as "all other".  this group is primarily comprised of development projects and results for new product lines.
we prepared the financial results for our segments on a basis that is consistent with the manner in which we internally disaggregate financial information to assist in making internal operating decisions.  we included the earnings of equity affiliates that are closely associated with our reportable segments in the respective segment's net income.  we have allocated certain common expenses among our reportable segments differently than we would for stand-alone financial information prepared in accordance with u.s. gaap.  the display technologies, optical communications, environmental technologies, specialty materials and life sciences segments include non-gaap measures which are not prepared in accordance with gaap.  we believe investors should consider these non-gaap measures in evaluating our results as they are more indicative of our core operating performance and with how management evaluates our operational results and trends.  these measures are not, and should not be viewed as a substitute for gaap reporting measures.  for a reconciliation of non-gaap performance measures to the most directly comparable gaap financial measure, please see "reconciliation of non-gaap measures" below.  segment net income may not be consistent with measures used by other companies.  the accounting policies of our reportable segments are the same as those applied in the consolidated financial statements.

when compared to the same period last year, the increase of $1,306 million in net sales in the year ended december 31, 2014, was due to the acquisition of the remaining equity interests of our affiliate samsung corning precision materials, and the consolidation of this entity, which added $1.8 billion in net sales.  this impact was somewhat offset by price declines in the mid-teens in percentage terms, which more than offset an increase in volume that was slightly more than 10% in percentage terms, and the depreciation of the japanese yen versus the u.s. dollar, which adversely impacted net sales by $373 million.
·   the impact of the acquisition of corning precision materials and the resulting cost reductions gained through synergies;
·   the fair value adjustment of the contingent consideration resulting from the acquisition of corning precision materials in the amount of $194 million; and
·   improvements in manufacturing efficiency of $46 million.
the increase in net income was partially offset by the following items:
·   the impact of price declines in the mid-teens in percentage terms that more than offset the increase in volume;
·   the absence of the $67 million gain from our yen-denominated cash flow hedging program;
·   the increase in transaction and acquisition-related costs related to the acquisition of corning precision materials in the amounts of $73 million and $29 million, respectively; and
·   an increase of $34 million in restructuring, impairment and other charges.
in 2013, net sales in the display technologies segment declined in the amount of $364 million when compared to 2012, primarily due to the impact of the depreciation of the japanese yen versus the u.s. dollar in the amount of $537 million and price declines in the mid-teens in percentage terms, offset somewhat by an increase in volume in the mid-twenties.  the increase in volume was driven by higher sales of larger-sized lcd televisions, defined as greater than 40 inches, which increased by nearly 100% in 2013, and higher sales in mobile computing products, including tablets and smart phones.  additionally, during the fourth quarter of 2013, we renewed the agreements with key customers that we had announced in the fourth quarter of 2012, which stabilize corning's share at each of the customers and maintain a fixed relationship between corning's pricing and competitive pricing at that customer.
when compared to 2012, the $335 million decrease in equity earnings from samsung corning precision materials in 2013 reflected the impact of the depreciation of the japanese yen versus the u.s. dollar in the amount of $201 million and price declines in the mid-teens in percentage terms.  volume remained relatively consistent in 2013 when compared to the levels in 2012.  manufacturing improvements in the amount of $28 million were more than offset by higher taxes in the amount of $54 million, driven by the partial expiration of a korean tax holiday and $28 million of asset write-offs and disposals.
when compared to 2012, the decrease in net income of $322 million in the display technologies segment in 2013 reflects the impact of the depreciation of the japanese yen versus the u.s. dollar in the amount of $479 million and the impact of price declines in the mid-teens in percentage terms.  these declines were partially offset by an increase in volume in the mid-twenties in percentage terms, the impact of gains realized on our purchased collars and average rate forwards in the amount of $90 million and cost reduction programs.
core performance
when compared to the same period last year, the increase in core net sales of $1,680 million, or 63%, in the year ended december 31, 2014, was due to the acquisition of the remaining equity interests of our affiliate corning precision materials, and the consolidation of this entity, which added $1.9 billion in net sales.  this impact was somewhat offset by price declines in the mid-teens in percentage terms, which more than offset an increase in volume that was slightly more than 10% in percentage terms.
core earnings in the display technologies segment increased by $137 million, or 11%, in the year ended december 31, 2014, when compared to the same period last year.  the increase was driven by the positive impact of the acquisition of corning precision materials and the resulting cost reductions gained through synergies, coupled with improvements in manufacturing efficiency of $46 million, partially offset by the impact of price declines in the mid-teens in percentage terms that more than offset the increase in volume.
in 2013, our display technologies segment regained positive momentum, as demonstrated by the increase in core net sales of 7%, when compared to core net sales in 2012, which declined by 7% when compared to 2011.  during 2013, volume improvements in the mid-twenties in percentage terms more than outpaced price declines in the mid-teens.  the increase in volume was driven by higher sales of larger-sized lcd televisions, defined as greater than 40 inches, which increased by nearly 100% in 2013, and higher sales in mobile computing products, including tablets and smart phones.  additionally, during the fourth quarter of 2013, we renewed the agreements with key customers that we had announced in the fourth quarter of 2012, which stabilize corning's share at each of the customers and maintain a fixed relationship between corning's pricing and competitive pricing at that customer.
when compared to 2012, the decrease in core equity earnings from samsung corning precision materials in 2013 reflected relatively consistent volume and price declines in the mid-teens in percentage terms.  manufacturing improvements in the amount of $28 million were more than offset by higher taxes in the amount of $54 million, driven by the partial expiration of a korean tax holiday.
when compared to 2012, the increase in core earnings in the display technologies segment in 2013 reflects an increase in volume in the mid-twenties in percentage terms and the impact of cost reduction programs, partially offset by price declines in the mid-teens in percentage terms and the impact of lower equity earnings.
other information the display technologies segment has a concentrated customer base comprised of lcd panel and color filter makers primarily located in japan, south korea, china and taiwan.  in 2014, three customers of the display technologies segment, which individually accounted for more than 10% of segment net sales, accounted for a combined 61% of total segment sales.  in 2013, four customers of the display technologies segment, which individually accounted for more than 10% of segment net sales, accounted for a combined 94% of total segment sales.  in 2012, three customers of the display technologies segment, which individually accounted for more than 10% of segment net sales, accounted for a combined 63% of total segment sales.  our customers face the same global economic dynamics as we do in this market.  our near-term sales and profitability would be impacted if any of these significant customers were unable to continue to purchase our products.
in addition, prior to consolidation, samsung corning precision materials' sales were concentrated across a small number of its customers.  in 2013 and 2012, sales to two lcd panel makers located in south korea accounted for approximately 93% of samsung corning precision materials sales in each of those two years.
corning has invested to expand capacity to meet the projected demand for lcd glass substrates.  in 2014, 2013 and 2012, capital spending in this segment was approximately $400 million, $350 million and $850 million, respectively.  we expect capital spending for 2015 to be approximately $650 million.
corning anticipates another year of growth in the lcd glass market in 2015, with retail demand up high-single digits in percentage terms, as measured in square feet.  we believe that supply chain inventory levels remain healthy and industry glass supply appears aligned with overall demand.
in the first quarter of 2015, corning anticipates lcd glass volume in its display technologies segment will be consistent to down slightly on a sequential basis, following a very strong fourth quarter performance.  this is in line with normal seasonality in the business.  quarterly glass price declines are expected to be moderate again.
the end market demand for lcd televisions, monitors and notebooks is dependent on consumer retail spending, among other factors.  we are cautious about the potential negative impact that economic conditions, particularly a global economic recession, excess market capacity and world political tensions could have on consumer demand.  while the lcd industry has grown, economic volatility along with consumer preferences for panels of differing sizes, prices, or other factors may lead to pauses in market growth.  therefore, it is possible that glass manufacturing capacity may exceed demand from time to time but we believe that we have sufficient manufacturing flexibility to adjust to fluctuations in demand.  we may incur further charges in this segment to reduce our workforce and consolidate capacity.  in addition, changes in foreign exchange rates, principally the japanese yen, will continue to impact the sales and profitability of this segment.  in order to mitigate this risk, corning entered into a series of foreign exchange contracts to hedge our exposure to movements in the japanese yen and its impact on our earnings.

in the twelve months ended december 31, 2014, net sales of the optical communications segment increased by $326 million, or 14%, when compared to the same period in 2013, driven by a $254 million increase in sales of our carrier network products.  specifically, the following items impacted sales within the carrier network products group in the year ended december 31, 2014:
·   higher sales of cable and hardware and equipment products primarily used in fiber-to-the-home solutions in north america and europe, up $113 million and $46 million, respectively;
·   the impact of a full year of sales from a small acquisition and the consolidation of an investment due to a change in control which occurred at the end of the second quarter of 2013, which added approximately $53 million; and
·   an increase of $11 million in sales of optical fiber, driven by higher sales in north america and europe, partially offset by a decrease in china.
sales of enterprise network products also increased in the twelve months ended december 31, 2014, up $72 million, when compared to the same period in 2013, due to strong sales in all regions of the world, led by an increase in sales of data center and lan products in europe and north america, up $21 million and $20 million, respectively, and an increase of $16 million in wireless products sales.
net income increased by $6 million, or 3%, in 2014, when compared to 2013.  the significant increase in volume for carrier network products in north america and europe and an increase in worldwide enterprise network product volume were somewhat offset by price declines in fiber and cable products, $17 million of additional operating expenses driven by two small acquisitions and the absence of the inventory build we experienced in the first half of 2013.  an increase in restructuring charges of $9 million, an increase of $22 million in the amount of the pension mark-to-market adjustment and the absence of the $11 million gain on change in control of an equity company that occurred in the second quarter of 2013 also negatively impacted the results of this segment.
in 2013, net sales of the optical communications segment increased when compared to 2012, driven by an increase of $163 million in the carrier network market.  driving the growth in carrier network products are the following items:
·   the ramp-up of the fiber-to-the-premises initiative in australia, which increased sales by $28 million;
·   an increase of $23 million in sales of wireless products;
·   higher sales of cable products in north america, china and europe, up $52 million, $33 million and $26 million, respectively;
·   the impact of a small acquisition and the consolidation of an investment due to a change in control, which added approximately $53 million in 2013; and
·   offsetting the increase in sales of carrier network products in 2013 was a decline in sales of optical fiber, driven by lower demand for single-mode fiber in china, europe and north america.
sales in the enterprise network market increased by $33 million in the year ended 2013, when compared to 2012, driven by higher sales of data center products in north america.
the increase in net income in 2013 when compared to 2012 reflects an increase in volume in carrier and enterprise network products, improved manufacturing performance and the implementation of strong spending controls and cost reduction initiatives, combined with an increase of $20 million on the gain in 2013 versus a loss in 2012 on the mark-to-market of our defined benefit pension plans, a reduction of $23 million in restructuring charges and a gain of $11 million on the change in control of an equity company.  this increase was somewhat offset by an increase in acquisition-related costs of $8 million and lower volume in optical fiber, lower price and a less favorable mix of products sales in 2013.
movements in foreign exchange rates did not significantly impact the results of this segment in the years ended december 31, 2014 and 2013.
core performance
when compared to the same period last year, core earnings in the twelve months ended december 31, 2014 increased by $35 million, or 18%, when compared to 2013.  the significant increase in volume for carrier network products in north america and europe and an increase in worldwide enterprise network product volume were somewhat offset by price declines in fiber and cable products, $17 million of additional operating expenses driven by two small acquisitions and the absence of the inventory build we experienced in the first half of 2013.
the increase in core earnings in 2013 when compared to 2012 reflects an increase in volume in carrier and enterprise network products, improved manufacturing performance and the implementation of strong spending controls and cost reduction initiatives, offset by lower volume in optical fiber, lower price and a less favorable mix of products sales in 2013.  movements in foreign exchange rates did not significantly impact the results of this segment.
the optical communications segment has a concentrated customer base.  in the years ended december 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, one customer, which individually accounted for more than 10% of segment net sales, accounted for 11%, 10% and 12%, respectively, of total segment net sales.
optical communications segment sales in the first quarter of 2015 are expected to increase by more than 10 percent when compared to the first quarter of 2014, as the segment continues its strong overall performance.

in the twelve months ended december 31, 2014, net sales of this segment increased by $173 million, or 19%, when compared to the same period in 2013, driven by higher sales across all product lines.  driving the increase was higher demand for our heavy duty diesel products propelled by new governmental regulations in europe and china and increased demand for class 8 vehicles in north america.  sales of light-duty diesel products also improved due to higher volume in europe.  automotive substrate product sales increased due to higher demand in europe and china.
when compared to the same period last year, net income in the twelve months ended december 31, 2014 improved significantly, up $50 million, or 38%, driven by improvements in manufacturing efficiency and strong volume gains across both automotive and diesel product lines.  improving market conditions for heavy-duty diesel products in europe, china and north america and higher european sales of light-duty diesel products, combined with an increase in automotive vehicle builds, drove the increase.  higher costs associated with facility expansion projects and an increase in the pension mark-to-market adjustment somewhat offset the increase in net income.
when compared to 2012, net sales in the environmental technologies segment decreased in 2013, due to lower sales of light-duty diesel filters and heavy-duty diesel products.  demand for light-duty diesel vehicles which use our filters declined due to weak economic conditions in europe.  heavy-duty diesel product sales were lower due to the decline in the production of class 8 vehicles in north america.  net sales of this segment in 2013 were not materially impacted by movements in foreign exchange rates when compared to 2012.
although net sales declined in 2013 when compared to 2012, net income increased by 18%, driven by significantly improved manufacturing performance for our automotive and heavy-duty diesel products, and lower operating expenses.  net income also included an increase of $8 million due to the positive change in the mark-to-market of our defined benefit pension plans.
movements in foreign exchange rates did not significantly impact the results of this segment in the years ended december 31, 2014 and 2013.
core performance
when compared to the same period last year, core earnings in the twelve months ended december 31, 2014 increased by $57 million, or 44%, driven by improvements in manufacturing efficiency and strong volume gains across both automotive and diesel product lines.  improving market conditions for heavy-duty diesel products in europe, china and north america and higher european sales of light-duty diesel products, combined with an increase in automotive vehicle builds, drove the increase.  higher costs associated with facility expansion projects somewhat offset the increase in net income
although net sales declined in 2013 when compared to 2012, core earnings increased by 9%, driven by significantly improved manufacturing performance for our automotive and heavy-duty diesel products, and lower operating expenses.
the environmental technologies segment sells to a concentrated customer base of catalyzer and emission control systems manufacturers, who then sell to automotive and diesel engine manufacturers.  although our sales are to the emission control systems manufacturers, the use of our substrates and filters is generally required by the specifications of the automotive and diesel vehicle or engine manufacturers.  for 2014, 2013, and 2012, net sales to three customers, which individually accounted for more than 10% of segment sales, accounted for 88%, 87% and 86%, respectively, of total segment sales.  while we are not aware of any significant customer credit issues with our direct customers, our near-term sales and profitability would be impacted if any individual customers were unable to continue to purchase our products.
we anticipate that environmental technologies sales in the first quarter of 2015 will be consistent when compared to the first quarter of 2014.

the specialty materials segment manufactures products that provide more than 150 material formulations for glass, glass ceramics and fluoride crystals to meet demand for unique customer needs.  consequently, this segment operates in a wide variety of commercial and industrial markets that include display optics and components, semiconductor optics components, aerospace and defense, astronomy, ophthalmic products, telecommunications components and a protective cover glass that is optimized for portable display devices.
net sales for the twelve months ended december 31, 2014 in the specialty materials segment increased by $35 million, or 3%, when compared to the same period in 2013, driven by higher sales of our advanced optics and commercial optics products.  although corning gorilla glass volume increased by 23%, net sales remained consistent with the prior year, driven by an unfavorable shift in product mix and price declines.  additionally, although volume increased in 2014 when compared to 2013, the growth did not meet our expectations due to the flat market for tablets.
when compared to the same period last year, the decrease in net income for the twelve months ended december 31, 2014 was driven by the absence of the inventory build we experienced in the first half of 2013, the write-off a trade receivable balance in the amount of $8 million and price declines for corning gorilla glass.  partially offsetting the decrease was an increase in volume for both corning gorilla glass and advanced optics products and the impact of costs reductions as a result of restructuring actions.
net sales for the year ended december 31, 2013 decreased in the specialty materials segment when compared to 2012, due to a 17% decline in sales of corning gorilla glass.  although retail demand for products using our corning gorilla glass has increased in 2013, supply chain variability, during which we experienced robust sales of this glass in the latter half of 2012, resulted in a supply chain contraction throughout 2013.  advanced optics products sales increased slightly in the year ended december 31, 2013, driven by the beginning of a business recovery.
although net sales declined by 13% in the year ended december 31, 2013, net income increased by 36%, when compared to 2012, due to strong cost controls, lower restructuring charges, manufacturing cost reduction initiatives and the beginning of the advanced optics products business recovery, which partially offset the lower sales of corning gorilla glass.  the depreciation of the japanese yen versus the u.s. dollar positively impacted net income by approximately $27 million in the year ended december 31, 2013, when compared to the same period in the prior year.
movements in foreign exchange rates did not significantly impact the results of this segment in the years ended december 31, 2014 and 2013.
core performance
when compared to the same period last year, the decrease in core earnings in the twelve months ended december 31, 2014 was driven by the absence of the inventory build we experienced in the first half of 2013, price declines for corning gorilla glass and higher production costs.  partially offsetting the decrease was an increase in volume for both corning gorilla glass and advanced optics products and the impact of costs reductions as a result of restructuring actions.
although core net sales declined by 13% in the year ended december 31, 2013, core earnings decreased by only 2%, when compared to 2012, due to strong cost controls, manufacturing cost reduction initiatives and the beginning of the advanced optics products business recovery, which partially offset the lower sales of corning gorilla glass.
for 2014 and 2013, three customers of the specialty materials segment, which individually accounted for more than 10% of segment sales, accounted for 51% and 47%, respectively, of total segment sales.  for 2012, two customers of the specialty materials segment, which individually accounted for more than 10% of segment sales, accounted for 54% of total segment sales.
in the first quarter of 2015, specialty materials segment sales are expected to increase by approximately 10% when compared to the first quarter of 2014, as a result of increased gorilla glass demand for products launched in the third and fourth quarters of 2014.

net sales for the year ended december 31, 2014 increased by $11 million when compared to the same period in the prior year.  higher sales in north america and china, up $12 million and $5 million, respectively, were offset slightly by lower sales in australia.  net income remained consistent when compared to the same period in 2013, driven by less favorable product mix and higher operating expenses which were offset by higher volume and lower acquisition-related costs due to the completion of the integration of discovery labware business.
net sales for the year ended december 31, 2013 increased when compared to the same period last year, due to the impact of the acquisition of the discovery labware business completed in the fourth quarter of 2012, which increased net sales by $192 million.  net sales of the segment's existing lines remained relatively consistent.
when compared to the same period in 2012, net income in the year ended december 31, 2013 increased substantially, driven by a $38 million improvement attributable to the impact of the discovery labware acquisition and the positive impact of $7 million on the change in the mark-to-market of our defined benefit pension plans.  offsetting the gains from discovery labware and the pension mark-to-market were an increase in acquisition-related costs of $6 million and higher restructuring charges.
movements in foreign exchange rates did not significantly impact the results of this segment in the years ended december 31, 2014 and 2013.

all other segments that do not meet the quantitative threshold for separate reporting have been grouped as "all other."  this group is primarily comprised of the results of corning precision materials' non-lcd business and new product lines and development projects that involve the use of various technologies for new products such as advanced flow reactors and adjacency businesses in pursuit of thin, strong glass.  this segment also includes results for certain corporate investments such as eurokera and keraglass equity affiliates, which manufacture smooth cooktop glass/ceramic products.
the increase in net sales of this segment in the year ended december 31, 2014 reflects the consolidation of the corning precision materials' non-lcd business as a result of the acquisition.  the increase in the net loss of this segment reflects higher spending for development projects which were not part of the segment in the year ended december 31, 2013.
the increase in segment net loss in 2013 when compared to 2012 was driven by the write-down of assets to their fair value in the amount of $36 million in samsung corning precision materials' non-lcd glass business, the absence of the 2012 gain on the sale of assets in samsung corning precision materials' non-lcd glass business, and restructuring costs of $5 million associated with our global restructuring program implemented in the fourth quarter of 2013, partially offset by lower research, development and engineering expenses on development projects.  the increase in core net loss in 2013 reflects the absence of the 2012 gain on the sale of assets in samsung corning precision materials' non-lcd glass business and a decline in research, development and engineering expenses for development projects.
liquidity and capital resources financing and capital structure the following items impacted corning's financing and capital structure during 2014 and 2013:
·   in the third quarter of 2014, we amended and restated our existing revolving credit facility. the amended facility provides a $2 billion unsecured multi-currency line of credit and expires on september 30, 2019. at december 31, 2014, there were no outstanding amounts under this credit facility. the facility includes affirmative and negative covenants that corning must comply with, including a leverage (debt to capital ratio) financial covenant. as of december 31, 2014, we were in compliance with all of the covenants.
·   in the first quarter of 2013, we amended and restated our then-existing revolving credit facility. the 2013 amended facility provided a $1 billion unsecured multi-currency line of credit that would have expired in march 2018. this facility was terminated when we entered into the amended and restated $2 billion facility in the third quarter of 2014.
·   in the first quarter of 2013, corning repaid the aggregate principal amount and accrued interest outstanding on the credit facility entered into in the second quarter of 2011 that allowed corning to borrow up to chinese renminbi (rmb) 4 billion. the total amount repaid was approximately $500 million. upon repayment, this facility was terminated.
·   in the second quarter of 2013, the company established a commercial paper program on a private placement basis, pursuant to which we may issue short-term, unsecured commercial paper notes up to a maximum aggregate principal amount outstanding at any time of $1 billion. under this program, the company may issue the notes from time to time and will use the proceeds for general corporate purposes. the maturities of the notes will vary, but may not exceed 390 days from the date of issue. the interest rates will vary based on market conditions and the ratings assigned to the notes by credit rating agencies at the time of issuance. the company's revolving credit facility is available to support obligations under the commercial paper program, if needed. at december 31, 2013, we did not have any outstanding commercial paper.
·   in the fourth quarter of 2013, we issued $250 million of 3.70% senior unsecured notes that mature on november 15, 2023. the net proceeds of approximately $248 million were used for general corporate purposes.
·   in the fourth quarter of 2013, we recorded a financing obligation in the approximate amount of $230 million for a new lcd glass substrate facility in china.
common stock dividends on december 3, 2014, corning's board of directors declared a 20% increase in the quarterly common stock dividend, which increased the quarterly dividend from $0.10 to $0.12 per common share, beginning with the dividend to be paid in the first quarter of 2015.  this increase marks the fourth dividend increase since october 2011.
fixed rate cumulative convertible preferred stock, series a on january 15, 2014, corning designated a new series of its preferred stock as fixed rate cumulative convertible preferred stock, series a, par value $100 per share, and issued 1,900 shares of preferred stock at an issue price of $1 million per share, for an aggregate issue price of $1.9 billion, to samsung display in connection with the acquisition of its equity interests in samsung corning precision materials.  corning also issued to samsung display an additional 400 shares of fixed rate cumulative convertible preferred stock at closing, for an aggregate issue price of $400 million in cash.
dividends on the preferred stock are cumulative and accrue at the annual rate of 4.25% on the per share issue price of $1 million.  the dividends are payable quarterly as and when declared by the company's board of directors.  the preferred stock ranks senior to our common stock with respect to payment of dividends and rights upon liquidation.  the preferred stock is not redeemable except in the case of a certain deemed liquidation event, the occurrence of which is under the control of the company.  the preferred stock is convertible at the option of the holder and the company upon certain events, at a conversion rate of 50,000 shares of corning's common stock per one share of preferred stock, subject to certain anti-dilution provisions.  as of december 31, 2014, the preferred stock has not been converted, and none of the anti-dilution provisions have been triggered.  following the seventh anniversary of the closing of the acquisition, the preferred stock will be convertible, in whole or in part, at the option of the holder.  the company has the right, at its option, to cause some or all of the shares of preferred stock to be converted into common stock, if, for 25 trading days (whether or not consecutive) within any period of 40 consecutive trading days, the closing price of common stock exceeds $35 per share.  if the aforementioned right becomes exercisable before the seventh anniversary of the closing, the company must first obtain the written approval of the holders of a majority of the preferred stock before exercising its conversion right.  the preferred stock does not have any voting rights except as may be required by law.
capital spending capital spending totaled $1.1 billion in 2014, slightly above the amount spent in 2013.  spending in 2014 was driven primarily by the display technologies segment, and focused on finishing line optimization and tank rebuilds.  we expect our 2015 capital expenditures to be approximately $1.3 billion to $1.4 billion.  approximately $650 million will be allocated to our display technologies segment.
cash flows summary of cash flow data (in millions):
net cash provided by operating activities   $4,709              $2,787              $3,206
net cash provided by operating activities increased significantly in the year ended december 31, 2014, when compared to the same period last year, due to a dividend of approximately $1.6 billion received from samsung corning precision materials, an increase in net income of $511 million and the cash inflows from inventory movements.  although net inventory increased by $52 million due to the acquisition, which added $121 million, this inventory was acquired through the issuance of preferred stock.  cash outflows for inventory declined by $120 million in the base display technologies and specialty materials segments in 2014 when compared to 2013, offset somewhat by an increase of approximately $50 million, driven by spending for new business development, and increases in the optical communications and life sciences segments.
net cash used in investing activities decreased slightly in the year ended december 31, 2014, when compared to the same period last year, driven by a decrease in investments in unconsolidated entities, the realized gains on our yen-denominated purchased collars and the absence of the premium paid for our yen-denominated purchased collars in 2013, offset by an increase in short-term investments.
net cash used in financing activities in the year ended december 31, 2014 increased when compared to the same period last year, driven by our share repurchase programs and the absence of the proceeds received in 2013 from the issuance of long-term debt, somewhat offset by cash received from the issuance of preferred stock and the absence of the retirement of long-term debt in the first quarter of 2013.
net cash provided by operating activities decreased in the year ended december 31, 2013, when compared to the same period last year, largely due to a decrease in dividends received from affiliated companies and the unfavorable impact of changes in working capital, driven by the following items:
·   higher incentive compensation payments of approximately $100 million, driven by the pay-out of the initial year of the executive cash-based performance plan and an increase in performance-driven incentives;
·   an increase in foreign tax payments in the amount of $114 million, driven by higher withholding tax in taiwan; and
·   an increase in fiber and cable inventory in the optical communications segment in the amount of $111 million, due to a decline in sales in china, europe and north america.
a decline in accounts receivable in the display technologies, optical communications and specialty materials segments somewhat offset these unfavorable impacts.
net cash used in investing activities declined in 2013, when compared to 2012, due to a decrease in capital spending, lower business acquisition spending and the liquidation of short-term investments, offset by the premium related to our purchased collars.
net cash used in financing activities increased in 2013 when compared to the same period last year, driven primarily by the absence of the issuance of long-term debt in the first quarter of 2012, higher share repurchases, the retirement of long-term debt in the first quarter of 2013, and higher dividend payments.
defined benefit pension plans we have defined benefit pension plans covering certain domestic and international employees.  our largest single pension plan is corning's u.s. qualified plan.  at december 31, 2014, this plan accounted for 77% of our consolidated defined benefit pension plans' projected benefit obligation and 86% of the related plans' assets.
we have historically contributed to the u.s. qualified pension plan on an annual basis in excess of the irs minimum requirements.  in 2014, we made voluntary cash contributions of $85 million to our domestic defined benefit pension plan and $45 million to our international pension plans.  in 2013, we did not contribute to our domestic defined benefit pension plan and contributed $5 million to our international pension plans.  in 2012, we made voluntary cash contributions of $75 million to our domestic defined benefit pension plan and $30 million to our international pension plans.  although we will not be subject to any mandatory contributions in 2015, we anticipate making voluntary cash contributions of up to $65 million to our u.s. pension plan and up to $28 million to our international pension plans in 2015.

restructuring for the year ended december 31, 2014, we recorded charges of $71 million for workforce reductions, asset disposals and write-offs, and exit costs for restructuring activities with total cash expenditures estimated to be $51 million.
in the fourth quarter of 2013, corning implemented a global restructuring plan within several of our segments, consisting of workforce reductions, asset disposals and write-offs, and exit costs.  we recorded charges of $67 million associated with these actions, with total cash expenditures expected to be approximately $40 million.
in 2012, we recorded a charge of $89 million associated with a corporate-wide restructuring plan to reduce our global workforce in response to anticipated lower sales in 2013.  the charge included costs for workforce reductions, asset disposals and write-offs, and exit costs.  total cash expenditures associated with these actions are expected to be approximately $49 million primarily related to termination benefits, and were largely finalized in 2013.
during 2014, 2013 and 2012, we made payments of $39 million, $35 million and $15 million, respectively, related to employee severance and other exit costs resulting from restructuring actions.  refer to note 2 (restructuring, impairment and other charges) to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.

management assessment of liquidity we ended the fourth quarter of 2014 with approximately $6.1 billion of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments.  the company has adequate sources of liquidity and we are confident in our ability to generate cash to meet existing or reasonably likely future cash requirements.  our cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments are held in various locations throughout the world and are generally unrestricted.  although approximately 68% of the consolidated amount was held outside of the u.s. at december 31, 2014, we have sufficient u.s. liquidity, including borrowing capacity, to fund foreseeable u.s. cash needs without requiring the repatriation of foreign cash.  we utilize a variety of tax effective financing strategies to ensure that our worldwide cash is available in the locations in which it is needed.
from time to time, we may issue debt, the proceeds of which may be used for general corporate purposes or to refinance certain debt maturities.  additionally, to manage interest rate exposure, the company, from time to time, enters into interest rate swap agreements.  in the fourth quarter of 2014, the company entered into interest rate swap agreements to hedge against the variability in cash flows due to changes in the benchmark interest rate related to an anticipated issuance.  the instruments were designated as cash flow hedges.
on june 24, 2013, the company established a commercial paper program on a private placement basis, pursuant to which we may issue short-term, unsecured commercial paper notes up to a maximum aggregate principal amount outstanding at any time of $1 billion.  under this program, the company may issue the notes from time to time and will use the proceeds for general corporate purposes.  the maturities of the notes will vary, but may not exceed 390 days from the date of issue.  the interest rates will vary based on market conditions and the ratings assigned to the notes by credit rating agencies at the time of issuance.  the company's revolving credit facility is available to support obligations under the commercial paper program, if needed.  at december 31, 2014, we did not have any outstanding commercial paper under this program.
share repurchase programs on october 31, 2013, as part of the share repurchase program announced on april 24, 2013 (the "2013 repurchase program"), corning entered into an accelerated share repurchase ("asr") agreement with jp morgan chase bank, national association, london branch ("jpmc").  under the asr agreement with jpmc, corning agreed to purchase $1 billion of its common stock, in total, with an initial delivery by jpmc of 47.1 million shares based on the current market price, and payment of $1 billion made by corning to jpmc.  the payment to jpmc was recorded as a reduction to shareholders' equity, consisting of an $800 million increase in treasury stock, which reflects the value of the initial 47.1 million shares received upon execution, and a $200 million decrease in other-paid-in capital, which reflects the value of the stock held back by jpmc pending final settlement.  on january 28, 2014, the asr agreement with jpmc was completed.  corning received an additional 10.5 million shares on january 31, 2014 to settle the asr agreement.  in total, corning purchased 57.6 million shares based on the average daily volume weighted-average price of corning's common stock during the term of the asr agreement with jpmc, less a discount.
in addition to the shares repurchased through the asr agreement, we repurchased 61.3 million shares of common stock on the open market for approximately $1.0 billion, as part of the 2013 repurchase program.  this program was executed between the second quarter of 2013 and the first quarter of 2014, with a total of 118.9 million shares repurchased for approximately $2 billion.
on march 4, 2014, as part of the $2 billion share repurchase program announced on october 22, 2013 and made effective concurrent with the closing of corning's acquisition of samsung corning precision materials on january 15, 2014 (the "2014 repurchase program"), corning entered into an asr agreement with citibank n.a. ("citi").  under the asr agreement with citi, corning agreed to purchase $1.25 billion of its common stock, with an initial delivery by citi of 52.5 million shares based on the current market price, and payment of $1.25 billion made by corning to citi.  on may 28, 2014, the asr agreement with citi was completed, and corning received an additional 8.7 million shares to settle the asr agreement.  in total, corning repurchased 61.2 million shares based on the average daily volume weighted-average price of corning's common stock during the term of the asr agreement with citi, less a discount.
in addition to the shares repurchased through the asr agreement, in the year ended december 31, 2014, we repurchased 36.9 million shares of common stock on the open market for approximately $750 million, as part of the 2014 repurchase program.  this program was completed in the fourth quarter of 2014, with a total of 98.2 million shares repurchased for approximately $2 billion.
on december 3, 2014, corning's board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to $1.5 billion shares of common stock between the date of announcement and december 31, 2016.  no shares were repurchased under this program between the date of authorization and december 31, 2014.
other we complete comprehensive reviews of our significant customers and their creditworthiness by analyzing their financial strength at least annually or more frequently for customers where we have identified a measure of increased risk.  we closely monitor payments and developments which may signal possible customer credit issues.  we currently have not identified any potential material impact on our liquidity resulting from customer credit issues.
our major source of funding for 2015 and beyond will be our operating cash flow and our existing balances of cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments and proceeds from any issuances of debt.  we believe we have sufficient liquidity for the next several years to fund operations, share repurchase programs, acquisitions, the asbestos litigation, research and development, capital expenditures, scheduled debt repayments and dividend payments.
corning also has access to a $2 billion unsecured committed revolving credit facility.  this credit facility includes a leverage ratio financial covenant.  the required leverage ratio, which measures debt to total capital, is a maximum of 50%.  at december 31, 2014, our leverage using this measure was 13% and we are in compliance with the financial covenant.
our debt instruments contain customary event of default provisions, which allow the lenders the option of accelerating all obligations upon the occurrence of certain events.  in addition, some of our debt instruments contain a cross default provision, whereby an uncured default in excess of a specified amount on one debt obligation of the company, also would be considered a default under the terms of another debt instrument.  as of december 31, 2014, we were in compliance with all such provisions.
management is not aware of any known trends or any known demands, commitments, events or uncertainties that will result in or that are reasonably likely to result in a material increase or decrease in our liquidity.  in addition, other than items discussed, there are no known material trends, favorable or unfavorable, in our capital resources and no expected material changes in the mix and relative cost of such resources.
purchased collars and average rate forwards in the first quarter of 2013, corning executed a series of purchased collars that expire quarterly across a two-year period to hedge its translation exposure resulting from movements in the japanese yen against the u.s. dollar.  these derivatives are not designated as accounting hedges and changes in fair value are recorded in other income immediately.  the fair value of these derivative contracts are recorded as either assets (gain position) or liabilities (loss position) on the consolidated balance sheet.
beginning in the second quarter of 2013 and continuing throughout 2014, corning entered into a series of average rate forwards with no associated premium, which hedge the translation impact of japanese yen on corning's projected 2015 net income and a significant portion of corning's projected 2016 and 2017 net income.  like the purchased collars, these contracts settle quarterly, and are not designated as accounting hedges.  in the years ended december 31, 2014 and 2013, we recorded pre-tax net gains of $1,406 million and $435 million, respectively, related to changes in the fair value of the purchased collars and average rate forward contracts, offset slightly by premium expense.  included in these amounts are realized gains of $344 million and $110 million, respectively, for the years ended december 31, 2014 and 2013.  the gross notional value outstanding for purchase collars and average rate forwards which hedge our exposure to the japanese yen at december 31, 2014 and 2013 was $9.8 billion and $6.8 billion, respectively.
in the second quarter of 2014, following the acquisition, we entered into a portfolio of zero cost collars to hedge our translation exposure resulting from movements in the korean won and its impact on our net earnings.  these zero cost collars have a gross notional value outstanding at december 31, 2014 of $2.3 billion, and began settling quarterly in the third quarter of 2014 and will conclude at the end of 2015.  in the year ended december 31, 2014, we recorded a pre-tax net loss of $37 million related to changes in the fair value of these zero cost collars, which included $6 million in realized losses.
gains and losses related to purchased collars and average rate forwards are recorded in earnings in the other income, net line of the consolidated statements of income.
off balance sheet arrangements off balance sheet arrangements are transactions, agreements, or other contractual arrangements with an unconsolidated entity for which corning has an obligation to the entity that is not recorded in our consolidated financial statements.
corning's off balance sheet arrangements include guarantee contracts.  at the time a guarantee is issued, the company is required to recognize a liability for the fair value or market value of the obligation it assumes.  in the normal course of our business, we do not routinely provide significant third-party guarantees.  generally, third-party guarantees provided by corning are limited to certain financial guarantees, including stand-by letters of credit and performance bonds, and the incurrence of contingent liabilities in the form of purchase price adjustments related to attainment of milestones.  these guarantees have various terms, and none of these guarantees are individually significant.
refer to note 14 (commitments, contingencies, and guarantees) to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.
for variable interest entities, we assess the terms of our interest in each entity to determine if we are the primary beneficiary.  the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity is the party that absorbs a majority of the entity's expected losses, receives a majority of its expected residual returns, or both, as a result of holding variable interests, which are the ownership, contractual, or other pecuniary interests in an entity that change with changes in the fair value of the entity's net assets excluding variable interests.
corning has identified one entity that qualifies as a variable interest entity.  this entity is not considered to be significant to corning's consolidated statements of position.
corning does not have retained interests in assets transferred to an unconsolidated entity that serve as credit, liquidity or market risk support to that entity.

(4)   the estimate of interest payments assumes interest is paid through the date of maturity or expiration of the related debt, based upon stated rates in the respective debt instruments.
(5)   at december 31, 2014, $8 million was included on our balance sheet related to uncertain tax positions. of this amount, we are unable to estimate when $6 million of that amount will become payable.
(6)   purchase obligations are enforceable and legally binding obligations which primarily consist of raw material and energy-related take-or-pay contracts.
we are required, at the time a guarantee is issued, to recognize a liability for the fair value or market value of the obligation it assumes.  in the normal course of our business, we do not routinely provide significant third-party guarantees.  generally, third-party guarantees provided by corning are limited to certain financial guarantees, including stand-by letters of credit and performance bonds, and the incurrence of contingent liabilities in the form of purchase price adjustments related to attainment of milestones.  these guarantees have various terms, and none of these guarantees are individually significant.
we believe a significant majority of these guarantees and contingent liabilities will expire without being funded.
environment corning has been named by the environmental protection agency (the agency) under the superfund act, or by state governments under similar state laws, as a potentially responsible party for 15 active hazardous waste sites.  under the superfund act, all parties who may have contributed any waste to a hazardous waste site, identified by the agency, are jointly and severally liable for the cost of cleanup unless the agency agrees otherwise.  it is corning's policy to accrue for its estimated liability related to superfund sites and other environmental liabilities related to property owned by corning based on expert analysis and continual monitoring by both internal and external consultants.  at december 31, 2014 and 2013, corning had accrued approximately $42.5 million (undiscounted) and $15 million (undiscounted), respectively, for its estimated liability for environmental cleanup and related litigation.  based upon the information developed to date, management believes that the accrued reserve is a reasonable estimate of the company's liability and that the risk of an additional loss in an amount materially higher than that accrued is remote.
critical accounting estimates the preparation of financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported therein.  the estimates that required us to make difficult, subjective or complex judgments, including future projections of performance and relevant discount rates, are set forth below.
impairment of assets held for use we are required to assess the recoverability of the carrying value of long-lived assets when an indicator of impairment has been identified.  we review our long-lived assets in each quarter to assess whether impairment indicators are present.  we must exercise judgment in assessing whether an event of impairment has occurred.
manufacturing equipment includes certain components of production equipment that are constructed of precious metals, primarily platinum and rhodium.  these metals are not depreciated because they have very low physical losses and are repeatedly reclaimed and reused in our manufacturing process over a very long useful life.  precious metals are reviewed for impairment as part of our assessment of long-lived assets.  this review considers all of the company's precious metals that are either in place in the production process; in reclamation, fabrication, or refinement in anticipation of re-use; or awaiting use to support increased capacity.  precious metals are only acquired to support our operations and are not held for trading or other non-manufacturing related purposes.
examples of events or circumstances that may be indicative of impairments include, but are not limited to:
·   a significant decrease in the market price of an asset;
·   a significant change in the extent or manner in which a long-lived asset is being used or in its physical condition;
·   a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate that could affect the value of the asset, including an adverse action or assessment by a regulator;
·   an accumulation of costs significantly in excess of the amount originally expected for the acquisition or construction of an asset;
·   a current-period operating or cash flow loss combined with a history of operating or cash flow losses or a projection or forecast that demonstrates continuing losses associated with the use of an asset; and
·   a current expectation that, more likely than not, an asset will be sold or otherwise disposed of significantly before the end of its previously estimated useful life.
for purposes of recognition and measurement of an impairment loss, a long-lived asset or assets is grouped with other assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities.  we must exercise judgment in assessing the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities.  for the majority of our reportable segments, we concluded that locations or businesses which share production along the supply chain must be combined in order to appropriately identify cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities.
for long-lived assets, when impairment indicators are present, we compare estimated undiscounted future cash flows, including the eventual disposition of the asset group at market value, to the assets' carrying value to determine if the asset group is recoverable.  this assessment requires the exercise of judgment in assessing the future use of and projected value to be derived from the assets to be held and used.  assessments also consider changes in asset utilization, including the temporary idling of capacity and the expected timing for placing this capacity back into production.  if there is an impairment, a loss is recorded to reflect the difference between the assets' fair value and carrying value.  this may require judgment in estimating future cash flows and relevant discount rates and residual values in estimating the current fair value of the impaired assets to be held and used.
for an asset group that fails the test of recoverability described above, the estimated fair value of long-lived assets is determined using an "income approach", "market approach", "cost approach", or a combination of one or more of these approaches as appropriate for the particular asset group being reviewed.  all of these approaches start with the forecast of expected future net cash flows including the eventual disposition at market value of long-lived assets, and also considers the fair market value of all precious metals if appropriate for the asset group being reviewed.  some of the more significant estimates and assumptions in our analysis include: market size and growth, market share, projected selling prices, manufacturing cost and discount rate.  our estimates are based upon our historical experience, our commercial relationships, and available external information about future trends.  we believe fair value assessments are most sensitive to market growth and the corresponding impact on volume and selling prices and that these are also more subjective than manufacturing cost and other assumptions.  the company believes its current assumptions and estimates are reasonable and appropriate.
in the event the current net book value of an asset group is found to be greater than the net present value of the cash flows derived from the asset group, we determine the actual fair market value of long-lived assets with the assistance from valuation appraisals conducted by third parties.  the results of these valuations generally represent the fair market value of the asset group that will remain after any necessary impairment adjustments have been recorded.  the impairment charge will be allocated to assets within the asset group on a relative fair value basis.
at december 31, 2014 and december 31, 2013, the carrying value of precious metals was higher than the fair market value by $222 million and $164 million, respectively.  these precious metals are utilized by the display technologies and specialty materials segments.  corning believes these precious metal assets to be recoverable due to the significant positive cash flow in both segments.  the potential for impairment exists in the future if negative events significantly decrease the cash flow of these segments.  such events include, but are not limited to, a significant decrease in demand for products or a significant decrease in profitability in our display technologies or specialty materials segments.
in the fourth quarter of 2011, the specialty materials segment recorded an impairment charge in the amount of $130 million related to certain assets used in the production of large cover glass due to sales that were significantly below our expectations.  in the fourth quarter of 2012, after reassessing the large cover glass business, corning concluded that the large cover glass market was developing differently in 2012 than our expectations, and demand for larger-sized cover glass was declining, and the market for this type of glass was instead targeting smaller gen size products.  additionally, in the fourth quarter of 2012, our primary customer of large cover glass notified corning of its decision to exit from this display market.  based on these events, we recorded an additional impairment charge in the fourth quarter of 2012 in the amount of $44 million, before tax.  this impairment charge represents a write-down of assets specific to the glass-strengthening process for large size cover glass to their fair market values, and includes machinery and equipment used in the ion exchange process.  additional information on the asset impairment is found in note 2 (restructuring, impairment and other charges) to the consolidated financial statements.
impairment of goodwill we are required to make certain subjective and complex judgments in assessing whether an event of impairment of goodwill has occurred, including assumptions and estimates used to determine the fair value of our reporting units.
corning's goodwill relates primarily to the display technologies, optical communications, specialty materials and life sciences operating segments.  on a quarterly basis, management performs a qualitative assessment of factors in each reporting unit to determine whether there have been any triggering events.  the two-step impairment test is required only if we conclude that it is more likely than not that a reporting unit's fair value is less than its carrying amount.  we perform a detailed, two-step process every three years if no indicators suggest a test should be performed in the interim.  we use this calculation as quantitative validation of the step-zero qualitative process that is performed during the intervening periods and does not represent an election to perform the two-step process in place of the step-zero review.
the following summarizes our qualitative process to assess our goodwill balances for impairment:
·   we assess qualitative factors in each of our reporting units which carry goodwill to determine whether it is necessary to perform the first step of the two-step quantitative goodwill impairment test.
·   the following events and circumstances are considered when evaluating whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount:
o   macroeconomic conditions, such as a deterioration in general economic conditions, fluctuations in foreign exchange rates and/or other developments in equity and credit markets;
o   market capital in relation to book value;
o   industry and market considerations, such as a deterioration in the environment in which an entity operates, material loss in market share and significant declines in product pricing;
o   cost factors, such as an increase in raw materials, labor or other costs;
o   overall financial performance, such as negative or declining cash flows or a decline in actual or forecasted revenue;
o   other relevant entity-specific events, such as material changes in management or key personnel; and
o   events affecting a reporting unit, such as a change in the composition or carrying amount of its net assets including acquisitions and dispositions.
the examples noted above are not all-inclusive, and the company will consider other relevant events and circumstances that affect the fair value of a reporting unit in determining whether to perform the first step of the goodwill impairment test.
our two-step goodwill recoverability assessment is based on our annual strategic planning process.  this process includes an extensive review of expectations for the long-term growth of our businesses and forecasted future cash flows.  our valuation method is an "income approach" using a discounted cash flow model in which cash flows anticipated over several periods, plus a terminal value at the end of that time horizon, are discounted to their present value using an appropriate rate of return.  our estimates are based upon our historical experience, our current knowledge from our commercial relationships, and available external information about future trends.
display technologies goodwill for the display technologies segment is tested at the reporting unit level which is also the operating segment level.  on a quarterly basis in 2014, management performed a qualitative assessment of factors and determined there had not been any triggering events which would indicate that the display technologies reporting unit's fair value is less than its carrying amount.
optical communications goodwill for the optical communications segment is tested at the reporting unit level which is also the operating segment level.  on a quarterly basis in 2014, management performed a qualitative assessment of factors and determined there had not been any triggering events which would indicate that the optical communications reporting unit's fair value is less than its carrying amount.
in addition to assessing qualitative factors each quarter, we performed a quantitative goodwill recoverability test in 2012 for this reporting unit.  the results of our impairment test indicated that the fair value of the reporting unit exceeded its book value by a significant amount.  a discount rate of 9% was used in 2012.  we determined a range of discount rates between 7% and 11% would not have affected our conclusion.
specialty materials goodwill for the specialty materials segment is tested at the reporting unit level, which is one level below an operating segment, as goodwill is the result of transactions associated with certain businesses within this operating segment.  there is only one reporting unit with goodwill within this operating segment.  on a quarterly basis in 2014, management performed a qualitative assessment of factors and determined there had not been any triggering events which would indicate that the specialty materials reporting unit's fair value is less than its carrying amount.
in addition to assessing qualitative factors each quarter, we performed a quantitative goodwill recoverability test in 2012 for this reporting unit.  the results of our impairment test indicated that the fair value of the reporting unit exceeded its book value by a significant amount.  a discount rate of 8% was used in 2012.  we determined a range of discount rates between 6% and 10% would not have affected our conclusion.  additionally, the asset impairment which occurred in the fourth quarter of 2012 did not cause a triggering event for goodwill impairment in this reporting unit because the cash flow related to this lower level asset group is not material to this reporting unit.
life sciences goodwill for the life sciences segment is tested at the reporting unit level which is also the operating segment level.  on a quarterly basis in 2014, management performed a qualitative assessment of factors and determined there had not been any triggering events which would indicate that the life sciences reporting unit's fair value is less than its carrying amount.
in addition to assessing qualitative factors each quarter, we performed a quantitative goodwill recoverability test in 2012 for this reporting unit.  the results of our impairment test indicated that the fair value of the reporting unit exceeded its book value by a significant amount.  a discount rate of 7% was used in 2012.  we determined a range of discount rates between 5% and 9% would not have affected our conclusion.
restructuring charges and impairments resulting from restructuring actions we are required to assess whether and when a restructuring event has occurred and in which periods charges related to such events should be recognized.  we must estimate costs of plans to restructure including, for example, employee termination costs.  restructuring charges require us to exercise judgment about the expected future of our businesses, of portions thereof, their profitability, cash flows and in certain instances eventual outcome.  the judgment involved can be difficult, subjective and complex in a number of areas, including assumptions and estimates used in estimating the future profitability and cash flows of our businesses.
restructuring events often give rise to decisions to dispose of or abandon certain assets or asset groups which, as a result, require impairment.  we are required to carry assets to be sold or abandoned at the lower of cost or fair value.  we must exercise judgment in assessing the fair value of the assets to be sold or abandoned.
income taxes we are required to exercise judgment about our future results in assessing the realizability of our deferred tax assets.  inherent in this estimation process is the requirement for us to estimate future book and taxable income and possible tax planning strategies.  these estimates require us to exercise judgment about our future results, the prudence and feasibility of possible tax planning strategies, and the economic environments in which we do business.  it is possible that actual results will differ from assumptions and require adjustments to allowances.
corning accounts for uncertain tax positions in accordance with fasb asc topic 740, income taxes.  as required under fasb asc topic 740, we only record tax benefits for technical positions that we believe have a greater than 50% likelihood of being sustained on their technical merits and then only to the extent of the amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon settlement.  in estimating these amounts, we must exercise judgment around factors such as the weighting of the tax law in our favor, the willingness of a tax authority to aggressively pursue a particular position, or alternatively, consider a negotiated compromise, and our willingness to dispute a tax authorities assertion to the level of appeal we believe is required to sustain our position.  as a result, it is possible that our estimate of the benefits we will realize for uncertain tax positions may change when we become aware of new information affecting these judgments and estimates.
equity method investments in october 2013, corning announced that it was entering into a series of strategic and financial agreements with samsung display which would result in corning obtaining full ownership of samsung corning precision materials.  as part of this agreement, in the fourth quarter of 2013, corning acquired the minority interests of three shareholders in samsung corning precision materials for $506 million, which included payment for the transfer of non-operating assets and the pro-rata portion of cash on samsung corning precision materials balance sheet at september 30, 2013.  the resulting transfer of shares to corning increased corning's ownership percentage of samsung corning precision materials from 50% to 57.5%.  because this transaction did not result in a change in control based on the governing articles of this entity, corning did not consolidate this entity as of december 31, 2013.  the remaining transactions were completed on january 15, 2014, which increased corning's ownership to 100% and resulted in consolidation of the entity beginning in the first quarter of 2014.  this organization was integrated into corning's display technologies segment in 2014.  refer to note 8 (acquisition) to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.
at december 31, 2014 and 2013, the carrying value of our equity method investments was $1.8 billion and $5.5 billion, respectively.  in 2014, our largest equity method investment, dow corning, comprised 74% of the balance.  in 2013, prior to the acquisition and consolidation of samsung corning precision materials, our largest equity method investments, dow corning and samsung corning precision materials, comprised approximately 93% of the balance.  we review our equity method investments for indicators of impairment on a periodic basis or if events or circumstances change to indicate the carrying amount may be other-than-temporarily impaired.  when such indicators are present, we then perform an in-depth review for impairment.  an impairment assessment requires the exercise of judgment related to key assumptions such as forecasted revenue and profitability, forecasted tax rates, foreign currency exchange rate movements, terminal value assumptions, historical experience, our current knowledge from our commercial relationships, and available external information about future trends.  as of december 31, 2014 and 2013, we have not identified any instances where the carrying values of our equity method investments were not recoverable.
fair value measures as required, corning uses two kinds of inputs to determine the fair value of assets and liabilities: observable and unobservable.  observable inputs are based on market data or independent sources, while unobservable inputs are based on the company's own market assumptions.  once inputs have been characterized, we prioritize the inputs used to measure fair value into one of three broad levels.  characterization of fair value inputs is required for those accounting pronouncements that prescribe or permit fair value measurement.  in addition, observable market data must be used when available and the highest-and-best-use measure should be applied to non-financial assets.  corning's major categories of financial assets and liabilities required to be measured at fair value are short-term and long-term investments, certain pension asset investments and derivatives.  these categories use observable inputs only and are measured using a market approach based on quoted prices in markets considered active or in markets in which there are few transactions.
derivative assets and liabilities may include interest rate swaps and forward exchange contracts that are measured using observable quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities.  in arriving at the fair value of corning's derivative assets and liabilities, we have considered the appropriate valuation and risk criteria, including such factors as credit risk of the relevant party to the transaction.  amounts related to credit risk are not material.
as a result of the acquisition of samsung corning precision materials, the company has contingent consideration that was measured using unobservable (level 3) inputs.  this contingent consideration arrangement potentially requires additional consideration to be paid between the parties in 2018: one based on projections of future revenues generated by the business of corning precision materials for the period between the acquisition date and december 31, 2017, which is subject to a cap of $665 million; and another based on the volumes of certain sales during the same period, which is subject to a separate cap of $100 million.  the fair value of the potential receipt of the contingent consideration in 2018 in the amount of $196 million recognized on the acquisition date was estimated by applying an option pricing model using the company's projection of future revenues generated by corning precision materials.  changes in the fair value of the contingent consideration in future periods are valued using an option pricing model and are recorded in corning's results in the period of the change.  as of december 31, 2014, the fair value of the potential receipt of the contingent consideration in 2018 is estimated to be $445 million.  corning recorded a pre-tax adjustment in the year ended december 31, 2014 in the amount of $249 million to reflect the increase in the fair value which is mainly due to the movement in foreign exchange rate.
probability of litigation outcomes we are required to make judgments about future events that are inherently uncertain.  in making determinations of likely outcomes of litigation matters, we consider the evaluation of legal counsel knowledgeable about each matter, case law, and other case-specific issues.  see part ii - item 3. legal proceedings for a discussion of the material litigation matters we face.  the most significant matter involving judgment is the liability for asbestos litigation.  there are a number of factors bearing upon our potential liability, including the inherent complexity of a chapter 11 filing, our history of success in defending asbestos claims, our assessment of the strength of our corporate veil defenses, and our continuing dialogue with our insurance carriers and the claimants' representatives.  the proposed asbestos resolution (amended pcc plan) is subject to a number of contingencies.  as noted in part ii - item 3. legal proceedings, the district court's affirmation of the amended pcc plan faces objections by certain parties.  for these and other reasons, corning's liability for these asbestos matters may be subject to changes in subsequent quarters.  the estimate of the cost of resolving the non-pcc asbestos claims may also be subject to change as developments occur.  management continues to believe that the likelihood of the uncertainties surrounding these proceedings causing a material adverse impact to corning's financial statements is remote.
other possible liabilities we are required to make judgments about future events that are inherently uncertain.  in making determinations of likely outcomes of certain matters, including certain tax planning and environmental matters, these judgments require us to consider events and actions that are outside our control in determining whether probable or possible liabilities require accrual or disclosure.  it is possible that actual results will differ from assumptions and require adjustments to accruals.
pension and other postretirement employee benefits (opeb)
corning offers employee retirement plans consisting of defined benefit pension plans covering certain domestic and international employees and postretirement plans that provide health care and life insurance benefits for eligible retirees and dependents.  the costs and obligations related to these benefits reflect the company's assumptions related to general economic conditions (particularly interest rates), expected return on plan assets, rate of compensation increase for employees and health care trend rates.  the cost of providing plan benefits depends on demographic assumptions including retirements, mortality, turnover and plan participation.
costs for our defined benefit pension plans consist of two elements:  1) on-going costs recognized quarterly, which are comprised of service and interest costs, expected return on plan assets and amortization of prior service costs; and 2) mark-to-market gains and losses outside of the corridor, where the corridor is equal to 10% of the greater of the benefit obligation or the market-related value of plan assets at the beginning of the year, which are recognized annually in the fourth quarter of each year.  these gains and losses result from changes in actuarial assumptions for discount rates and the differences between actual and expected return on plan assets.  any interim remeasurements triggered by a curtailment, settlement or significant plan changes, as well as any true-up to the annual valuation, are recognized as a mark-to-market adjustment in the quarter in which such event occurs.
costs for our opeb plans consist of on-going costs recognized quarterly, and are comprised of service and interest costs, amortization of prior service costs and amortization of actuarial gains and losses.  we recognize the actuarial gains and losses resulting from changes in actuarial assumptions for discount rates as a component of stockholders' equity on our consolidated balance sheets on an annual basis and amortize them into our operating results over the average remaining service period of employees expected to receive benefits under the plans, to the extent such gains and losses are outside of the corridor.
while management believes that the assumptions used are appropriate, differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions may affect corning's employee pension and other postretirement obligations, and current and future expense.
as of december 31, 2014, the projected benefit obligation (pbo) for u.s. pension plans was $3,222 million.
the following information illustrates the sensitivity to a change in certain assumptions for u.s. pension plans:
change in assumption                    effect on 2015       effect on pre-tax pension   december 31, 2014
25 basis point increase in expected return on assets   - 7 million the above sensitivities reflect the impact of changing one assumption at a time.  note that economic factors and conditions often affect multiple assumptions simultaneously and the effects of changes in key assumptions are not necessarily linear.  these changes in assumptions would have no effect on corning's funding requirements.
in addition, at december 31, 2014, a 25 basis point decrease in the discount rate would decrease stockholders' equity by $116 million before tax, and a 25 basis point increase in the discount rate would increase stockholders' equity by $113 million.  in addition, the impact of greater than a 25 basis point decrease in discount rate would not be proportional to the first 25 basis point decrease in the discount rate.
the following table illustrates the sensitivity to a change in the discount rate assumption related to corning's u.s. opeb plans:
change in assumption             effect on 2015       effect on pre-tax opeb    december 31, 2014
* accumulated postretirement benefit obligation (apbo).
the above sensitivities reflect the impact of changing one assumption at a time.  note that economic factors and conditions often affect multiple assumptions simultaneously and the effects of changes in key assumptions are not necessarily linear.
revenue recognition the company recognizes revenue when it is realized or realizable and earned.  in certain instances, revenue recognition is based on estimates of fair value of deliverables as well as estimates of product returns, allowances, discounts, and other factors.  these estimates are supported by historical data.  corning also has contractual arrangements with certain customers in which we recognize revenue on a completed contract basis.  revenues under the completed-contract method are recognized upon substantial completion, defined as acceptance by the customer and compliance with performance specifications as agreed upon in the contract, which in certain instances require estimates and judgments in the determining the timing of substantial completion of the contract. while management believes that the estimates used are appropriate, differences in actual experience or changes in estimates may affect corning's future results.
share-based compensation share-based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense over the requisite service period.  determining the fair value of stock-based awards at the grant date requires judgment, including estimating expected dividends.  in addition, judgment is also required in estimating the amount of share-based awards that are expected to be forfeited.  if actual results differ significantly from these estimates, share-based compensation expense and our results of operations could be impacted.

recent developments nyse acquisition and related transactions on november 13, 2013, we completed our acquisition of 100% of nyse for $11.1 billion, comprised of cash consideration of $2.7 billion and 42.4 million shares of our common stock, and their results are included in our consolidated results effective from the acquisition date. refer to note 3 to our consolidated financial statements and related notes, which are included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10-k, for more information on this acquisition.
initial public offering and sale of euronext on june 24, 2014, we sold an aggregate 65.8 million shares of common stock of euronext, representing 94% of all outstanding shares, in three transactions. the three transactions include our sale of 42.2 million shares of euronext common stock in an initial public offering, or ipo, at €20 per share, 23.4 million shares of euronext common stock to a group of european institutional investors at €19.20 per share, and 0.2 million shares of euronext common stock to eligible euronext employees at €16 per share. on december 9, 2014, we sold our remaining 4.2 million shares of euronext common stock, representing 6% of the outstanding shares of euronext, for €95 million ($118 million). we no longer hold any shares of euronext stock and these four transactions generated an aggregate €1.5 billion ($2.1 billion) of net cash proceeds for us. the net cash proceeds received included cash of $220 million distributed from euronext as part of the separation of euronext from us. euronext was comprised of the continental european-based exchanges acquired by us as part of the nyse acquisition.
due to the sale of a controlling interest in euronext in june 2014, we de-consolidated the assets and liabilities of euronext as of the ipo date and included the financial results of euronext in discontinued operations in the consolidated financial statements. see "- discontinued operations" below. we used the cash proceeds from the ipo and sale of euronext shares to repay debt. see "- debt" below. also, refer to note 16 to our consolidated financial statements and related notes, which are included elsewhere in this annual
report on form 10-k, for more information on the ipo and sale of euronext and the presentation of the results as discontinued operations.
liffe transition to ice futures europe we successfully transitioned all of the liffe futures and options contracts to ice futures europe during the year ended december 31, 2014. these products are now made available for trading on ice futures europe via the ice trading platform. the clearing transition of the liffe products to ice clear europe was completed in july 2013.
nyse technologies divestitures nyse previously operated a commercial technology business, nyse technologies, which offered transaction, data and infrastructure services, and managed solutions for market participants. during the year ended december 31, 2014, we sold nyfix, metabit and wombat, three companies that comprised nyse technologies. these sales completed our previously announced intention to divest non-core nyse technologies assets.

•   total revenues, less transaction-based expenses, increased $1.494 billion, or 93%, for the year ended december 31, 2014, from the comparable period in 2013, primarily due to an increase of $1.461 billion in revenues, less transaction-based expenses, recognized relating to the inclusion of nyse, including $1.669 billion in nyse revenues, less transaction-based expenses, for the year ended december 31, 2014 versus $208 million in nyse revenues, less transaction-based expenses, for the period from november 13, 2013 to december 31, 2013. total revenues, less transaction-based expenses, increased $235 million, or 17%, for the year ended december 31, 2013, from the comparable period in 2012, primarily due to $208 million in revenues, less transaction-based expenses, recognized relating to the inclusion of nyse subsequent to our acquisition on november 13, 2013. see "- revenues" below for further information on the nyse revenues as well as a discussion of the other changes in revenues. total revenues, less transaction-based expenses, exclude euronext and nyse technologies revenues which are included in income from discontinued operations discussed below.
•   total operating expenses increased $836 million, or 103%, for the year ended december 31, 2014, from the comparable period in 2013, primarily due to an increase of $756 million in expenses recognized relating to the inclusion of nyse, net of integration costs ($1.007 billion in nyse expenses for the year ended december 31, 2014, including $123 million in integration costs, versus $171 million in nyse expenses for the period from november 13, 2013 to december 31, 2013, including $43 million in integration costs). total operating expenses increased $272 million, or 51%, for the year ended december 31, 2013, from the comparable period in 2012, primarily due to $171 million in expenses recognized relating to the inclusion of nyse subsequent to its acquisition on november 13, 2013. acquisition-related transaction and integration costs also increased $124 million for the year ended december 31, 2013, from the comparable period in 2012, primarily relating to our acquisition and integration of nyse (including $43 million in acquisition-related transaction and integration costs incurred directly at nyse and included in the $171 million nyse expense number discussed above). see "- operating expenses" below for further information on the nyse expenses as well as a discussion of the other increases in expenses. total operating expenses exclude euronext and nyse technologies operating expenses which are included in income from discontinued operations discussed below.
•   other income (expense), net includes a $4 million net gain on the remaining sale of our 6% ownership in euronext and $25 million in equity income from our equity investment in the options clearing corporation, or occ, during the year ended december 31, 2014. other income (expense), net includes a $190 million impairment loss on our cetip investment and a $51 million expense relating to the early payoff of outstanding debt during the year ended december 31, 2013. other expense, net, also increased in each of the last two years primarily due to increases in our interest expense resulting from increases in our total debt outstanding during the years ended december 31, 2014 and 2013. the increases in the other expenses was partially offset by an increase in dividend income received relating to our investment in cetip. see "- non-operating income (expenses)" below.
•   income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of tax, for the years ended december 31, 2014 and 2013 include the results of euronext and nyse technologies subsequent to the nyse acquisition on november 13, 2013. see "- discontinued operations" below.
factors affecting our results the business environments in which we operate directly affect our results of operations. our results have been and will continue to be affected by many factors, including the level of trading activity in our markets, which during any period is significantly influenced by general market conditions; competition; price volatility; market share and the pace of industry consolidation; broad trends in the brokerage and finance industry; price levels and price volatility; the number and financial health of companies listed on nyse's cash markets; geopolitical events; weather and disasters; real and perceived supply and demand imbalances; availability of capital; changing technology in the financial services industry; and legislative and regulatory changes; among other factors. in particular, in recent years, the business environment has been characterized by increasing competition among global markets for trading volumes and listings; the globalization of exchanges, customers and competitors; market participants' demand for speed, capacity and reliability, which requires continuing investment in technology; and increasing competition for market data revenues. price volatility increases the need to hedge price risk and creates the need for the exchange of risk between market participants. market liquidity is one of the primary market attributes for attracting and maintaining customers and is an important indicator of a market's strength. the maintenance and growth of our revenues could also be impacted if we face increased pressure on pricing.
the implementation of new regulations may impact participation in our markets. generally, legislative and regulatory bodies in the united states and europe have expressed increased concern regarding derivatives markets when underlying commodity prices rise. as a result, legislative and regulatory actions may change the way we conduct our business and may create uncertainty for market participants, which could affect trading volumes. in particular, many of the proposed changes are still being implemented, and final regulations have not yet been adopted or significant uncertainties and ambiguities remain around adopted regulations. in addition, many market participants are still determining how they will respond to these regulations. as a result, it is
difficult to predict all of the effects that the legislation and its implementing regulations will have on us. however, it may possibly result in increased costs and the expenditure of significant resources.
low interest rates and uncertainty in the u.s. financial markets continued to reflect the impact of a slow economic recovery. equity market indices became increasingly volatile in the later part of 2014. economic uncertainty in the european union may also continue to negatively affect global financial markets. in addition, economic uncertainty has continued to affect our clients' activities, business models and technology spending over the last several years. we expect that all of these factors will continue to impact our businesses. we have diversified our business so that we are less subject to the reduction in volatility, trading activity or participation in any one asset class. in addition, we have increased our portion of non-transaction and clearing revenues from 13% in 2012 to 39% in 2014. we continue to focus on our strategy to broaden and diversify our revenue streams, as well as on our company-wide expense reduction initiatives in connection with our acquisition of nyse in order to mitigate these uncertainties.
we also periodically make adjustments to our contract specifications. changes to contracts are generally aimed at making the contracts more relevant to more customers and their evolving hedging needs or are required based on changes to the underlying commodity and may result in fluctuations in trading volume in the near term, with the objective of making the contract more relevant to our customers over the long term. in 2014, we transitioned our gasoil contract to a low-sulphur gasoil contract, and that transition was completed in january 2015. these and other factors could cause our revenues to fluctuate from period to period and these fluctuations may affect the reliability of period to period comparisons of our revenues and operating results.
segment reporting we previously operated as a single reportable business segment as of december 31, 2013, the ice segment. as of march 31, 2014, we operated as two business segments, the ice segment and the euronext segment, which was reflective of how our chief operating decision maker reviewed and operated the business. following the ipo and de-consolidation of euronext in june 2014, we reverted to one business segment as this is reflective of how our chief operating decision maker reviewed and operated the business as of june 30, 2014 and for all subsequent periods.

transaction and clearing fees, net a majority of our revenue is derived from transaction and clearing fees. our transaction and clearing fees are reported on a net basis, except for the transaction-based expenses discussed below, and consist of fees collected from our derivatives trading and clearing and, subsequent to our acquisition of nyse on november 13, 2013, from our u.s. cash trading and u.s. equity options businesses. in our derivatives markets, we earn transaction and clearing fees from both counterparties to each contract that is traded and/or cleared. revenues for per-contract fees are driven by the number of trades executed and fees charged per contract. the amount of our per-contract transaction and clearing fees will depend upon many factors, including, but not limited to, market conditions, transaction and clearing volume, pricing, product mix and new product introductions. because transaction and clearing fees are assessed on a per-contract or notional value basis, revenues and profitability fluctuate with changes in contract volume but not to the same degree due to product mix and pricing. see "- factors affecting our results" above.
in our derivatives markets, following our acquisition of nyse, we recognize transaction and clearing fee revenues from executing and clearing trades based on interest rate, agriculture and equity derivatives futures and options. trading volume in european interest rate products is primarily driven by volatility resulting from expectations for changes in the level and term structure of short-term interest rates and in economic data, and trading in equity derivatives, including equity indexes and single stock futures, is primarily driven by volatility.
we also receive transaction fee revenues from u.s. equity and equity options markets, including the new york stock exchange, nyse arca, nyse mkt and nyse amex options. this revenue includes routing fees related to orders in our markets which are routed to other market for execution.
our u.s. equities markets pay fees to the sec pursuant to section 31 of the exchange act. these section 31 fees are designed to recover the government's costs of supervising and regulating the securities markets and securities professionals. we (or occ on our behalf), in turn, collect activity assessment fees, which are included in transaction and clearing fees in our
consolidated statements of income, from member organizations clearing or settling trades on the u.s. equities and options exchanges and recognize these amounts when invoiced. the activity assessment fees are designed so that they are equal to the section 31 fees which are included in transaction-based expenses in our consolidated statements of income. as a result, activity assessment fees and section 31 fees do not have an impact on our net income. activity assessment fees received are included in cash at the time of receipt and, as required by law, the amount due to the sec is remitted semi-annually and recorded as an accrued liability until paid. as of december 31, 2014, the accrued liability related to the un-remitted sec section 31 fees was $137 million.
certain energy futures and options volumes and related revenues have declined or remained flat for the year ended december 31, 2014, from the comparable period in 2013. these energy contracts include north american natural gas and power futures and options contracts and gasoil futures and options contracts. gasoil is a key refined oil products benchmark in europe and asia, which underwent transition to a new specification during 2014.
natural gas revenue declined 6% and volume declined 22% for the year ended december 31, 2014, from the comparable period in 2013, and natural gas revenue declined 15% and volume declined 18% for the year ended december 31, 2013, from the comparable period in 2012. the relatively lower decreases in revenues, compared to the volume decreases, was driven by growth in european natural gas volume, which has a higher transaction fee as compared to the north american natural gas contract, where volume declined significantly year over year. decreased north american natural gas volume was primarily due to continued low volatility and low price levels, which produced muted trading activity in comparison to the record volume levels established during the year ended december 31, 2012. in addition, moderate commodity demand due to muted economic growth, regulatory uncertainty and strong natural gas supply reduced the demand for trading and hedging during 2014 and 2013.
in 2014, ice brent crude futures and options contracts produced the eighteenth consecutive year of record volume. the brent crude futures contract is relied upon by a broad range of global market participants, including oil producing nations and multinational companies, to price and hedge their crude oil production and consumption. based on traded volume in our brent and wti crude futures contracts, we had 54%, 55% and 56% market share of the global crude futures contracts volume for the years ended december 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. other oil revenue and volume grew due to the launch of new global oil and refined product contracts as demand for clearing oil contracts rose.
power futures and options volumes decreased 11% for the year ended december 31, 2014, from the comparable period in 2013, and decreased 8% for the year ended december 31, 2013, compared with the comparable period in 2012. the 3% increase in power futures and options revenues for the year ended december 31, 2014, compared to the volume decreases, were driven by increased european power volume, which has a higher transaction fee as compared to the north american power contract, where volume declined due to low price volatility.
cds trade execution revenues at creditex and ice swap trade were $64 million, $66 million and $78 million for the years ended december 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. the notional value of the underlying cds traded was $1.0 trillion, $904.4 billion and $1.1 trillion for the years ended december 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. the cds execution business remains muted due to financial reform implementation and a general lack of volatility in corporate credit markets.
total cds clearing revenues at ice clear credit and ice clear europe were $97 million, $79 million and $66 million for the years ended december 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. during the years ended december 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, ice clear credit and ice clear europe cleared $13.7 trillion, $10.7 trillion and $10.2 trillion, respectively, of cds notional value. cds clearing activity by investment funds, asset managers, and other buy side market participants has continued to increase due to regulatory mandates, the expansion of products made available for clearing and the benefits derived from portfolio margining.
our transaction and clearing fees are presented net of rebates. we recorded rebates of $631 million, $511 million and $372 million for the years ended december 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. we offer rebates in certain of our markets primarily to support market liquidity and trading volume by providing qualified participants in those markets a discount to the applicable commission rate. such rebates are calculated based on volumes traded. the increase in the rebates is due primarily to the rebates relating to the addition of liffe derivatives markets following the nyse acquisition, an increase in the number of participants in the rebate programs offered on various contracts and an increase in the number of rebate programs.

(1) the north american monthly power futures and options contracts included in the table above (and in the open interest table below) have been adjusted for all periods presented to be sized in megawatts, which resulted in a larger post-conversion contract size for each futures and options contract, a decrease in volume of contracts traded and included in open interest, and a higher rate per contract.
(2) subsequent to our acquisition of nyse on november 13, 2013, agricultural and metals and interest rates and other financial futures and options rates per contract include liffe agricultural, metals, interest rates, u.s. equity derivatives and equity indexes products.
open interest is the aggregate number of contracts (long or short) that clearing members hold either for their own account or on behalf of their clients. open interest refers to the total number of contracts that are currently open - in other words, contracts that have been traded but not yet liquidated by either an offsetting trade, exercise, expiration or assignment. open interest is also a measure of the future activity remaining to be closed out in terms of the number of contracts that members and their clients continue to hold in the particular contract and by the number of contracts held for each contract month listed by the exchange. the following table presents our year-end open interest for our futures and options contracts (in millions, except for percentages).

data services fees we generate revenues from the dissemination of our market data to a variety of users. subscribers can obtain access to our market data services either directly or through third-party distributors. in our derivatives markets, market data fees primarily relate to subscription fees charged for user and license access from data vendors and from the end users, view only market data access, direct access services, terminal access, daily indexes and end of day reports. in addition, we provide a service in our derivatives markets to independently establish market price validation curves whereby participant companies subscribe to receive consensus market valuations.
we earn user and license revenues that we receive from data vendors through the distribution of real-time and historical futures prices and other futures market data derived from trading in our futures markets. during the years ended december 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, we recognized $88 million, $62 million and $64 million, respectively, in market data user and license fees from data vendors. during the years ended december 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, we recognized $87 million, $85 million and $69 million, respectively, in market data access fees. we charge a market data access fee for access to our electronic platform and the increases for the last two years relate to more users and fee increases implemented in 2012 and 2013 related to enhanced data offerings. with the addition of liffe's markets, we also offer real-time and historical futures prices and other futures market data in additional markets, including interest rate futures.
our data services fee revenues also increased during the year ended december 31, 2014 following our october 7, 2014 acquisition of superderivatives, a leading provider of risk management analytics, financial market data and valuation services. we recognized $12 million in superderivatives data services revenues during the year ended december 31, 2014, subsequent to our acquisition. the acquisition is intended to accelerate our multi-asset class clearing, risk management and market data strategy.
we now earn data services fees relating to our u.s. equity market data services. we collect cash trading market data fees principally for consortium-based data products and, to a lesser extent, for nyse proprietary data products. consortium-based data fees are dictated as part of the securities industry plans and charged to vendors based on their redistribution of data. consortium-based data revenues from the dissemination of market data (net of administrative costs) are distributed to participating markets on the basis of a formula set by the sec under regulation nms. last sale prices and quotes in new york stock exchange-listed, nyse mkt-listed, and nyse arca-listed securities are disseminated through "tape a" and "tape b," which constitute the majority of our u.s. revenues from consortium-based market data revenues. we also receive a share of the revenues from "tape c," which represents data related to trading of certain securities that are listed on nasdaq. our proprietary products make market data available to subscribers covering activity that takes place solely on our u.s. markets, independent of activity on other markets, and includes depth of book information, historical price information and corporate action information. we also offer nyse realtime reference prices, which allows internet and media organizations to buy real-time, last-sale market data from nyse and provide it broadly and free of charge to the public.
nyse data services fees include fees from secured financial transaction infrastructure, or sfti, which is a physical network infrastructure that connects our markets and other major market centers with numerous market participants in the united states and europe and allows those participants to receive data feeds. sfti is a redundant network that supports a range of nyse services and third-party content and connects all nms market centers in the united states.
during the year ended december 31, 2014 and for the period from november 13, 2013 to december 31, 2013, we recognized data services fee revenues from nyse derivative market data services, u.s. securities trading market data services and sfti fees of $430 million and $57 million, respectively. data services fee revenues exclude euronext data services fee revenues, which are included in income from discontinued operations. see "- discontinued operations" below.
listing fees following our nyse acquisition, we recognize listing fee revenues in our securities markets from two types of fees applicable to companies listed on our u.s. securities exchanges - listing fees and annual fees. listing fees consist of two components: original listing fees and fees related to other corporate-related actions. original listing fees, subject to a minimum and maximum amount, are based on the number of shares that a company initially lists. original listing fees, however, are generally not applicable to companies that transfer to one of our u.s. securities exchanges from another market, except for companies transferring to nyse mkt from the over-the-counter market. other corporate action related fees are paid by listed companies in connection with corporate actions involving the issuance of new shares to be listed, such as stock splits, rights issues and sales of additional securities, as well as mergers and acquisitions, which are subject to a minimum and maximum fee.
original listing fees are recognized as revenue on a straight-line basis over estimated service periods of nine years for nyse and five years for nyse arca and nyse mkt. other corporate action listing fees are recognized as revenue on a straight-line basis over estimated service periods of six years for nyse and three years for nyse arca and nyse mkt. unamortized balances are recorded as deferred revenue in our consolidated balance sheet. we have determined that, at the time of our acquisition of nyse, we did not have a legal performance obligation relating to these listing fees. therefore, in connection with purchase accounting and in accordance with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles, or u.s. gaap, we assigned a fair value of zero to the nyse unamortized deferred revenue balances relating to the listing fees as of the acquisition date of november 13, 2013 (the historical original listing fees deferred revenue balance as of that date was $486 million). the listing fees unamortized deferred revenue balance as of december 31, 2014 of $81 million relates to original and other corporate action listing fees incurred and billed and not yet recognized as revenue subsequent to the november 13, 2013 acquisition through december 31, 2014.
annual fees are charged based on the number of outstanding shares of listed u.s. companies at the end of the prior year. non-u.s. companies pay fees based on the number of listed securities issued or held in the united states. annual fees are recognized as revenue on a pro rata basis over the calendar year.
fees we receive from nyse governance services are included in listing fee revenues. nyse governance services is a leading provider of corporate governance, risk and compliance services to a diverse set of customers, including a number of those listed on the nyse. the true office acquisition is included in with nyse governance services.
other revenues prior to our acquisition of nyse, other revenues related to various fees for services provided to our customers, including ice chat and ice options analytics subscription fees, ice endex membership fees, agricultural grading and certification fees, regulatory penalties and fines, interest income on certain clearing margin deposits and, during 2013 it included liffe clearing fees (liffe clearing fees are now recorded in transaction and clearing revenues). following our acquisition, other revenues also primarily include technology services revenues, fees for facilities, regulatory fees charged to member organizations of our u.s. securities exchanges, listed company service fees, and designated market maker service fees.
in addition to the nyse other revenues, the increase in other revenues for the year ended december 31, 2013, from the comparable period in 2012, is primarily due to revenues that we recorded following the whentech acquisition in september 2012 and the ice endex acquisition in march 2013, a reduction in the net interest paid to clearing members for their cash margin deposits at ice clear europe and the fees that we recognized relating to the clearing services agreement for ice clear europe to provide clearing services to nyse liffe from july 1, 2013 to november 12, 2013. the interest paid to clearing members is recorded as a reduction to other revenues. effective january 1, 2013, ice clear europe no longer pays clearing members basis points on certain cash margin deposits.
for the years ended december 31, 2014 and 2013, we have reclassified certain revenues in other revenues to data services fee revenues and to listing fee revenues. the revenues reclassified to data services fees include our sfti network revenues and our colocation service revenues and were $202 million and $32 million for the years ended december 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. the revenues reclassified to listing fees include our nyse governance services revenues and were $30 million and $4 million for the years ended december 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively.
transaction-based expenses see "- revenues - transaction and clearing fees, net" above, for information on the section 31 fees that are included in transaction-based expenses. we incur liquidity payments made to cash trading customers and routing charges made to other exchanges that are included in transaction-based expenses.
we incur routing charges when we do not have the best bid or offer in the market for a security that a customer is trying to buy or sell on one of our u.s. securities exchanges. in that case, we route the customer's order to the external market center that displays the best bid or offer. the external market center charges us a fee per share (denominated in tenths of a cent per share) for routing to its system. additionally, we include costs incurred due to erroneous trade execution within routing as transaction-based expenses. furthermore, nyse arca incurs clearance, brokerage and related transaction expenses and per trade service fees paid to exchanges for trade execution. section 31 fees and routing fees collected from customers are recorded on a gross basis as a component of transaction and clearing fee revenue. refer to note 2 to our consolidated financial statements and related notes, which are included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10-k, for more information on our revenue recognition policies.
operating expenses total operating expenses exclude euronext and nyse technologies operating expenses, which are included in income from discontinued operations. see "- discontinued operations" below. the majority of our operating expenses do not vary directly with changes in our contract volume, except for certain technology and communication expenses and a portion of our compensation expense that is tied directly to our financial performance, as discussed below.
the following table presents our operating expenses (dollars in millions):

we expect our operating expenses to decrease in the near term from the year ended december 31, 2014 operating expense level in connection with our integration of nyse, and then to increase in absolute terms in future periods in connection with the growth of our business and to vary from year to year based on the type and level of our acquisitions and other investments.
compensation and benefits expenses compensation and benefits expense is our most significant expense and includes non-capitalized employee wages, bonuses, non-cash or stock compensation, certain severance costs, benefits and employer taxes. the bonus component of our compensation and benefits expense is based on both our financial performance and the individual employee performance and the performance-based restricted stock compensation expense is also based on our financial performance. therefore, our compensation and benefits expense will vary year to year based on our financial performance and by fluctuations in the number of employees.
compensation and benefits expenses increased for the last two years primarily due to increases in employee headcount. our employee headcount increased primarily due to the nyse acquisition, internal hiring relating to the nyse integration, our other acquisitions and hiring for clearing, technology, regulation and compliance. headcount increased from 1,077 employees as of december 31, 2012 to 1,133 employees as of december 31, 2013 (excluding the nyse employees), an increase of 5% compared to the prior year, and increased to 1,650 employees as of december 31, 2014 (excluding the nyse employees), an increase of 46% compared to the prior year.
as of december 31, 2014, we had 1,252 nyse employees, compared to 3,099 nyse employees as of december 31, 2013. the decrease in the nyse employees during the year ended december 31, 2014 is primarily related to the reduction of the euronext employees following the ipo on june 24, 2014, of which there were 1,049 euronext employees as of december 31, 2013, the sale of nyse technologies and employee terminations in connection with the integration of nyse. we recognized $290 million and $46 million in compensation and benefits expenses relating to nyse during the years ended december 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively, subsequent to our acquisition on november 13, 2013.
non-cash compensation expenses recognized in our consolidated financial statements for employee stock options and restricted stock were $82 million, $56 million and $52 million for the years ended december 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. the increase for the year ended december 31, 2014 primarily relates to a greater number of employees receiving non-cash awards due to the headcount increases discussed above.
we incurred non-nyse related employee severance costs of $4 million, $7 million and $7 million for the years ended december 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. the higher employee severance during 2013 and 2012 primarily related to broker severance at creditex and severance during 2012 relating to our closure of the ice futures u.s. open outcry trading floor. in addition, we recorded $99 million and $44 million in nyse employee severance costs during the years ended december 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively, with such costs included in the acquisition-related transaction and integration costs discussed below.
technology and communication expenses technology support services consist of costs for running our wholly-owned data centers, hosting costs paid to third-party data centers, and maintenance of our computer hardware and software required to support our technology. these costs are driven by system capacity, functionality and redundancy requirements. communication expenses consist of costs for network connection for our electronic platforms, telecommunications costs, and fees paid for access to external market data. this expense also includes licensing and other fee agreement expenses which may be impacted by growth in electronic contract volume, our capacity
requirements, changes in the number of telecommunications hubs and connections with customers to access our electronic platforms directly.
technology and communication expenses increased the last two years, compared to the prior year, primarily due to the inclusion of nyse expenses following our acquisition, acquisitions and growth in various contract volumes. we recognized $132 million and $13 million in technology and communication expenses relating to nyse during the years ended december 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively.
professional services expenses this expense includes fees for consulting services received on strategic and technology initiatives, temporary labor as well as regulatory, legal and accounting fees. this expense may fluctuate as a result of changes in consulting and technology services and regulatory, accounting and legal proceedings.
professional services expenses increased the last two years, compared to the prior year, primarily due to the inclusion of nyse expenses following our acquisition. we recognized $135 million and $23 million in professional services expenses relating to nyse during the years ended december 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. professional services expenses also increased for the year ended december 31, 2014 due to costs incurred at ice futures singapore as we transitioned the exchange and clearing infrastructures to our trading and clearing platforms, and professional fees incurred for emir implementation.
the increases in professional services expenses during the year ended december 31, 2014 were partially offset by decreases in professional services expenses during the fourth quarter of 2014 relating to a credit we received from the financial industry regulatory authority, or finra, and a reduction in expenses related to the termination of certain services agreements and related agreements, or slas, with euronext.
financial, operational and sales practice oversight of the members of our u.s. securities exchanges is generally conducted by finra. in addition, finra performs the market surveillance and related enforcement functions for our u.s. securities exchanges, pursuant to an agreement with us, although our u.s. securities exchanges retain ultimate regulatory responsibility for the regulatory functions performed by finra under that agreement. finra charges our u.s. securities exchanges throughout the year based on their estimated costs for these services and then trues up the charge at year end to actual costs incurred. based on the actual finra charges incurred to us during 2014 versus what we were accruing, we recorded a credit of $7 million during the fourth quarter of 2014. in january 2016, nyse regulation plans to take over market surveillance, investigation and enforcement functions for nyse equity and options markets from finra.
in connection with the euronext ipo, euronext and ice entered into a series of slas to ensure that euronext and ice (including liffe) had continuity in operating their respective businesses through the separation. the majority of the slas relating to euronext operational support and transition services provided to liffe until its transition to ice futures europe were terminated in november 2014.
rent and occupancy expenses this expense consists of costs related to leased and owned property including rent, maintenance, real estate taxes, utilities and other related costs. we have significant operations located in atlanta, new york and london with smaller offices located throughout the world. rent and occupancy expenses increased the last two years, compared to the prior year, primarily due to the inclusion of nyse expenses following our acquisition. we recognized $56 million and $10 million in rent and occupancy expenses relating to nyse during the years ended december 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively . additionally, we incurred $7 million in duplicate rent expenses and lease termination costs relating to the consolidation of multiple new york office locations that occurred during the year ended december 31, 2013.
acquisition-related transaction and integration costs we incurred $129 million in acquisition-related transaction and integration costs during the year ended december 31, 2014, primarily relating to our integration of nyse and the acquisitions of smx, superderivatives, hch and true office. see "- recent developments" above. of this amount, $6 million was related to fees for investment banking advisors, lawyers, accountants, tax advisors and public relations firms, and other external costs directly related to the transactions. the remaining $123 million was for nyse integration costs incurred during the year ended december 31, 2014, primarily relating to employee termination costs, costs incurred relating to the euronext ipo and sale, costs incurred relating to the sale of nyse technologies, and professional services costs.
we incurred $143 million in acquisition-related transaction and integration costs during the year ended december 31, 2013, primarily relating to our acquisition and integration of nyse and ice endex. of this amount, $97 million was related to fees for investment banking advisors, lawyers, accountants, tax advisors and public relations firms, and other external costs directly related to the transactions. the remaining $46 million was for nyse integration costs incurred during the year ended december 31, 2013, primarily relating to employee termination costs, costs incurred relating to the euronext ipo, deal-related bonuses and professional services costs. we incurred acquisition-related transaction costs during the year ended december 31, 2012 primarily relating to our pending acquisitions of nyse and ice endex and our acquisition of whentech.
we expect to continue to explore and pursue various potential acquisitions and other strategic opportunities to strengthen our competitive position and support our growth. as a result, we will incur acquisition-related transaction costs in future periods. see "- non-u.s. gaap financial measures" below.
selling, general and administrative expenses this expense relates to expenses from marketing, advertising, public relations, insurance, dues and subscriptions, travel and entertainment, taxes other than income taxes and other general and administrative costs. selling, general and administrative expenses increased the last two years, compared to the prior year, primarily due to the inclusion of nyse expenses following our acquisition. we recognized $88 million and $11 million in selling, general and administrative expenses relating to nyse during the years ended december 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. selling, general and administrative expenses also increased for the year ended december 31, 2014, from the comparable period in 2013, primarily related to costs from our other acquisitions, due to an accrual made in anticipation of the outcome of certain regulatory proceedings, and increases in certain expenses related to taxes other than income taxes, travel and entertainment and insurance.
depreciation and amortization expenses depreciation and amortization expense results from depreciation of long-lived assets such as buildings, leasehold improvements, planes, furniture, fixtures and equipment over their estimated useful lives. this expense includes amortization of intangible assets obtained in our acquisitions of businesses, as well as on various licensing agreements, over their estimated useful lives. intangible assets subject to amortization consist primarily of customer relationships, trading products with finite lives, technology and the russell licensing rights. this expense also includes amortization of internally developed and purchased software over their estimated useful lives.
we recorded amortization expenses on the intangible assets acquired as part of our acquisitions, as well as on the russell licensing agreement intangible assets, of $151 million, $76 million and $69 million for the years ended december 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. the increases during the years ended december 31, 2014 and 2013 primarily relate to amortization expenses recorded on the nyse intangible assets. we recognized $84 million and $10 million in amortization expenses on the nyse intangible assets during the years ended december 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively.
we recorded depreciation expenses on our fixed assets of $182 million, $80 million and $62 million for the years ended december 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. the increases during the years ended december 31, 2014 and 2013 primarily relate to depreciation expenses recorded on the nyse fixed assets. we recognized $98 million and $16 million in depreciation expenses on the nyse fixed assets during the years ended december 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. depreciation expenses also increased for each of the past two years primarily due to additional depreciation expenses recorded on increased fixed asset additions and capitalized internally developed software, including the building we purchased in atlanta, georgia in july 2013 for $38 million and real estate expenditures during 2014 relating to the atlanta and new york headquarters. see "- cash flow - investing activities" below.
non-operating income (expenses)
income and expenses incurred through activities outside of our core operations are considered non-operating. the following tables present our non-operating income (expenses) (dollars in millions):
2014                                                                2013                     change   2013                         2012          change other income (expense):
the increases in interest expense over the last two years are primarily due to an increase in the overall amount of debt outstanding during each of the periods, primarily relating to debt incurred for and from the nyse acquisition. see "- debt" below.
we recognized interest and investment income of $7 million, $3 million and $2 million for the years ended december 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. interest and investment income is recorded in other income and the increase primarily relates to an increase in our short-term investments during the year ended december 31, 2014.
we account for our investment in cetip as an available-for-sale investment and it is classified as a long-term investment in our consolidated balance sheet. during the year ended december 31, 2013, we recorded an impairment of our cetip investment for $190 million, which was recorded as other expense. refer to note 5 to our consolidation financial statements and related notes, which are included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10-k, for more information on this impairment. we recognized dividend income received relating to our cetip investment in other income, which was $23 million, $8 million and $5 million for the years ended december 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively.
on october 16, 2013, following the issuance of $1.4 billion in senior notes (as defined below), we prepaid our private senior notes (as defined below) representing $400 million aggregate principal amount. in connection with the early payoff of the private senior notes, we incurred $51 million in expenses, which was recorded as other expense during the year ended december 31, 2013. see "- debt" below.
in connection with our acquisition of nyse, we obtained a 40% ownership in occ and we recorded our investment in occ as an equity method investment. we recognized $25 million in equity income related to this investment during the year ended december 31, 2014 as other income. for a description of this investment, see note 15 to our consolidated financial statements and related notes, which are included elsewhere is this annual report on form 10-k and see "- future capital requirements" below.
we incurred foreign currency transaction losses of $2 million, $2 million and $4 million for the years ended december 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. foreign currency gains and losses are recorded in other income (expense) and relate to the settlement of foreign currency assets, liabilities and payables that occur through our foreign operations that are received in non-functional currencies due to the increase or decrease in the period-end foreign currency exchange rates between periods.
on june 24, 2014, we sold 94% of all outstanding shares of euronext in an ipo. on december 9, 2014, we sold the remaining 4.2 million shares of euronext common stock, representing 6% of the outstanding shares of euronext, for €95 million ($118 million), including a realized net gain of $4 million, which was recognized in other income for the year ended december 31, 2014. the $4 million net gain included a stock price gain of $15 million based on the difference in the euronext stock price from the ipo date to the date of sale on december 9, 2014, less $11 million in foreign currency translation losses relating to the decrease in the value of the euro relative to the u.s. dollar during this same period of time. see "- discontinued operations" below.
for consolidated subsidiaries in which our ownership is less than 100%, and for which we have control over the assets, liabilities and management of the entity, the outside stockholders' interests are shown as non-controlling interests. as of december 31, 2012, non-controlling interest related to the operating results of our cds clearing subsidiaries in which non-ice limited partners held a 45.5% net profit sharing interest. during the year ended december 31, 2013, we purchased 3% of the net profit sharing interest in our cds clearing subsidiaries from various non-ice limited partners and the remaining non-ice limited partners hold a 42.5% net profit sharing interest as of december 31, 2014 and 2013. in connection with our acquisition of nyse,
we have non-controlling interest related to various minority ownership interests held in our majority owned subsidiary, nyse amex options. in connection with our 79% acquisition of the derivatives and spot gas business of the former apx-endex in march 2013, gasunie's 21% ownership is included in the non-controlling interest line subsequent to the acquisition date. in connection with our 75% acquisition of hch in december 2014, abn amro clearing bank n.v.'s 25% ownership is included in the non-controlling interest line subsequent to the acquisition date. the increase in the net income attributable to non-controlling interests for the last two years, compared to the prior year, is primarily related to these new non-controlling interests and the increase in the cds clearing revenues the last two years. see "- revenues - transaction and clearing fees" above.
income tax provision consolidated income tax expense was $402 million, $184 million and $228 million for the years ended december 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. the change in consolidated income tax expense between years is primarily due to the change in our pre-tax income and the change in our effective tax rate each year. our effective tax rate was 29%, 37% and 29% for the years ended december 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. the effective tax rates for the years ended december 2014 and 2012 are lower than the statutory federal rate primarily due to favorable foreign tax rate differentials, partially offset by state income taxes. favorable foreign income tax rate differentials result primarily from lower tax rates in the united kingdom, the netherlands and various other lower tax jurisdictions. the effective tax rate for the year ended december 31, 2013 is higher than the statutory federal rate primarily due to the non-tax deductible impairment loss on the cetip investment along with state income taxes and other items. other items are primarily driven by non-tax deductible transaction costs relating to the nyse acquisition.
discontinued operations due to the sale of a controlling interest in euronext and the sales of the three companies comprising nyse technologies (nyfix, metabit and wombat), we de-consolidated the assets and liabilities of euronext (as of the june 24, 2014 ipo date) and nyse technologies (as of the sales dates) and included the financial results of these entities in discontinued operations in our consolidated financial statements effective from the nyse acquisition date of november 13, 2013. see "- recent developments" above and refer to note 16 to our consolidated financial statements and related notes, which are included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10-k, for more information on our discontinued operations disclosures.
the results below include external advisory costs and professional services costs related to the sales of euronext and nyse technologies of $51 million and $2 million for the years ended december 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively, which have been included with acquisition-related transaction and integration costs, below, from discontinued operations. the results below also include deal-related compensation and severance costs related to the sales of euronext and nyse technologies of $42 million and $19 million for the years ended december 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively, which have also been included with acquisition-related transaction and integration costs, below, from discontinued operations. further, the income tax provision for discontinued operations for the year ended december 31, 2013 is primarily from the impact of certain foreign tax law changes that occurred after our acquisition of nyse on euronext's tax assets and liabilities.
we used the cash proceeds from the sale of euronext to repay debt. we used the net cash proceeds from the sale of nyse technologies to repay debt, invest in growth initiatives, pursue strategic investments and return capital to shareholders via dividends and share repurchases. results of discontinued operations were as follows for the years ended december 31, 2014 and 2013 (in millions):

(1) we acquired nyse on november 13, 2013 and have included their financial results in our results of operations for all periods subsequent to the acquisition date. the consolidated statements of income data for euronext, nyfix, metabit and wombat for the periods subsequent to the acquisition of nyse, through their disposition, are included in income from discontinued operations, net of tax. see "- discontinued operations" above.
(2) for the first three quarters of 2014, we have reclassified section 31 fees related to our u.s. equity options revenues to show them gross, with a corresponding offset in transaction-based expenses.
(3) for the years ended december 31, 2014 and 2013, we have reclassified certain revenues in other revenues to data services fee revenues and to listing fee revenues. the revenues reclassified to data services fees include our sfti network revenues and our colocation service revenues and the revenues reclassified to listing fees include our nyse governance services revenues.
(4) for the first three quarters of 2014, we have reclassified certain costs related to nyse to better represent our views on operating expenses.
(5) other income (expense), net for the three months ended december 31, 2014 includes a net $4 million gain on the remaining sale of our 6% ownership in euronext and $25 million in other income from our occ equity method investment. other expense, net for the three months ended december 31, 2013 includes a $190 million impairment loss on our cetip investment and a $51 million expense relating to the early payoff of outstanding debt. see "- non-operating income (expense)" above.
liquidity and capital resources we have financed our operations, growth and cash needs primarily through income from operations and borrowings under our various debt facilities. our principal capital requirements have been to fund capital expenditures, working capital, strategic
acquisitions and investments, stock repurchases and the continued development of our electronic trading and clearing platforms. we believe that our cash on hand and cash flows from operations will be sufficient to repay our outstanding debt as it matures. in the future, we may need to incur additional debt or issue additional equity securities, which we may be unable to do or to do on favorable terms. we used the cash proceeds from the euronext ipo and sale to repay debt and we used the net cash proceeds from the sale of nyse technologies to repay debt, invest in growth initiatives, pursue strategic investments and return capital to shareholders via dividends and share repurchases. see "- recent developments" above and "- debt" and "- future capital requirements" below.
on november 13, 2013, we acquired nyse in a stock and cash transaction. we paid cash consideration of $2.7 billion and issued an aggregate number of shares of common stock of 42.4 million shares to nyse stockholders. the cash consideration was funded from cash on hand, $1.4 billion of net proceeds received in october 2013 in connection with our public offering and sale of senior notes and $400 million of borrowings under our revolving facility (as defined below). we refinanced the new borrowings under our revolving facility and the $450 million borrowed under the 364 day facility (as defined below) through the issuance of a commercial paper program. see "- debt" below.
upon maturity of old issuances of commercial paper and to the extent old issuances are not repaid by cash on hand, we are exposed to the rollover risk of not being able to issue new commercial paper. in order to mitigate the rollover risk, we maintain an undrawn backstop bank revolving credit facility for an aggregate amount equaling at any time the amount issued under our commercial paper program. in case we would not be able to issue new commercial paper, we could draw on the backstop revolving facility, which would result in higher interest expense. see "- debt" below.
consolidated cash and cash equivalents were $652 million and $961 billion as of december 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively, and short term investments were $1.2 billion and $74 million as of december 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. we had $379 million and $324 million in long-term investments as of december 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively, and $626 million and $438 million in short-term and long-term restricted cash and investments as of december 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. we consider all short-term, highly liquid investments with remaining maturity dates of three months or less at the time of purchase to be cash equivalents. we classify all investments with original maturity dates in excess of three months but less than one year as short-term investments and all investments that we intend to hold for more than one year as long-term investments. cash and investments that are not available for general use, either due to regulatory requirements or through restrictions in specific agreements, are classified as restricted cash and investments.
the €969 million ($1.2 billion) in short-term investments as of december 31, 2014 represented euro-denominated term deposit investments at various banks each with a maturity date of june 25, 2015 to cover the maturity of the nyse eur notes on june 30, 2015. see "- debt" below. the increase in the long-term investments is due to an increase in our cetip investment's fair value. the restricted cash and investments increase primarily related to a contribution to the ice clear u.s. guaranty fund as of january 1, 2014 in connection with ice clear u.s.'s recognition as a third party qccp, cash escrow set aside for the superderivatives acquisition and increases in the regulatory capital of ice clear europe and ice futures europe due to additional costs incurred at both of these companies due to growth of these businesses.
as of december 31, 2014, the amount of unrestricted cash held by our non-u.s. subsidiaries was $426 million. while we consider our non-u.s. earnings to be indefinitely reinvested overseas, if these cash balances are needed for our operations in the united states, any repatriation by way of dividend may be subject to both u.s. federal and state income taxes, as adjusted for any non-u.s. tax credits. however, we do not have any current needs or foreseeable plans to repatriate cash by way of dividends from our non-u.s. subsidiaries.
our cash and cash equivalents and financial investments are managed as a global treasury portfolio of non-speculative financial instruments that are readily convertible into cash, such as overnight deposits, term deposits, money market funds, mutual funds for treasury investments, short duration fixed income investments and other money market instruments, thus ensuring high liquidity of financial assets. we may invest a portion of our cash in excess of short-term operating needs in investment-grade marketable debt securities, including government or government sponsored agencies and corporate debt securities.
certain of these investments, with an original maturity of greater than three months, will be classified as available-for-sale in accordance with relevant accounting standards. available-for-sale investments are carried at their fair values with unrealized gains and losses, reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income. realized gains and losses, and declines in value deemed to be other-than-temporary on available-for-sale investments, are recognized currently in earnings. we do not have any investments classified as held-to-maturity or trading.
during the years ended december 31, 2014 and 2012, we repurchased 3,231,484 shares and 416,858 shares, respectively, of our outstanding common stock at a cost of $645 million and $53 million, respectively. these repurchases were completed under a stock repurchase plan authorized by our board of directors. the shares repurchased are held in treasury stock. we did not repurchase any shares during the year ended december 31, 2013. as of december 31, 2014, the remaining board authorization permits repurchases of up to $405 million of our common stock with no fixed expiration date.
in september 2014, we entered into a rule 10b5-1 trading plan permitting open market repurchases of our common stock based on certain parameters described in the trading plan. we expect to fund any remaining share repurchases with a combination of cash on hand, future cash flows and by borrowing under our credit facilities and our commercial paper program. the timing and extent of any future repurchases that are not made pursuant to the trading plan under rule 10b5-1 are at our discretion and will depend upon market conditions, amount authorized by our board of directors, our stock price, our target debt ratio and corporate debt rating, and our strategic growth initiatives at that time. we may discontinue the stock repurchases at any time or may enter into a new rule 10b5-1 trading plan in the future. in addition, our board of directors may increase or decrease the amount of capacity we have for repurchases from time to time.
cash flow the following tables present the major components of net increases (decreases) in cash and cash equivalents (in millions):

operating activities net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations primarily consists of net income adjusted for certain non-cash items, including depreciation and amortization and the effects of changes in working capital. fluctuations in net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations is primarily attributable to increases and decreases in our net income between periods and, to a lesser extent, due to fluctuations in working capital. the $749 million increase in net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations for the year ended december 31, 2014, from the comparable period in 2013, is primarily due to the $685 million increase in our net income from continuing operations, primarily relating to the increase of $435 million in net income from the inclusion of nyse ($465 million in nyse net income from continuing operations for the year ended december 31, 2014 versus $30 million in nyse net income from continuing operations for the period from november 13, 2013 to december 31, 2013). see "- consolidated financial highlights" above.
investing activities consolidated net cash provided by (used in) investing activities from continuing operations for the years ended december 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012 primarily relates to cash paid for acquisitions, cash proceeds from the ipo and sale of euronext and the sale of nyse technologies, purchases of term deposits and available-for-sale investments, increases in the restricted cash and investment balances, and capital expenditures and capitalized software development costs.
we paid cash for acquisitions, net of cash acquired, of $577 million, $2.2 billion and $18 million, respectively, for the years ended december 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, primarily relating to the superderivatives, smx, hch and true office acquisitions during the year ended december 31, 2014, the nyse and ice endex acquisitions during the year ended december 31, 2013 and the whentech acquisition during the year ended december 31, 2012. we received net cash proceeds from the ipo and sale of euronext shares and the sale of nyse technologies of $2.3 billion for the year ended december 31, 2014. see "-recent developments" above.

calculations of the six months of operating expenditures. the restricted cash increase in 2012 primarily related to mandated changes in the calculations of regulatory capital at ice futures europe and ice clear europe as well as additional costs incurred at both of these companies due to growth of these businesses.
capital expenditures were $172 million, $134 million and $32 million for the years ended december 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively, and we had capitalized software development expenditures of $78 million, $45 million and $36 million for the years ended december 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. the capital expenditures primarily relate to hardware purchases to continue the development and expansion of our electronic platforms and clearing houses, the purchase of a corporate aircraft, the purchase of a building in atlanta georgia to serve as our headquarters and leasehold improvements associated with the new and renovated office spaces in atlanta, new york and london. the software development expenditures primarily relate to the continued development and expansion of our electronic platforms and clearing houses.

2014 credit facility on april 3, 2014, we entered into a $3.0 billion senior unsecured revolving credit facility, or the 2014 credit facility. the 2014 credit facility matures on april 3, 2019. no amounts were outstanding under the 2014 credit facility as of december 31, 2014. of the $3.0 billion that is available for borrowing under the 2014 credit facility, $905 million is required to back-stop the amount outstanding under our commercial paper program as of december 31, 2014 and $303 million is reserved for our clearing houses. the amount required to back stop the commercial paper program will fluctuate as we increase or decrease our commercial paper borrowings. the remaining $1.8 billion as of december 31, 2014 is available to us to use for working capital and general corporate purposes.
in november 2011, we entered into senior unsecured credit facilities in the aggregate amount of $2.6 billion, or the 2011 credit facilities. the 2011 credit facilities consisted of (i) an aggregate $500 million five-year senior unsecured term loan facility, or the term loan facility, and (ii) an aggregate $2.1 billion five-year senior unsecured multicurrency revolving credit facility, or the revolving facility. in october 2013, we borrowed $900 million under the revolving facility, of which $400 million was used to pay
the cash portion of the purchase price for our acquisition of nyse while the remaining $500 million was used to pay off the outstanding commercial paper obligations of nyse, as well as to fund certain deal related fees and expenses. in december 2013, we repaid the $900 million borrowed under the revolving facility with the proceeds from the issuance of commercial paper and with cash on hand. in connection with us entering into the 2014 credit facility on april 3, 2014, the 2011 credit facilities were terminated and the $367 million outstanding under the term loan facility was repaid through the issuance of new commercial paper.
private senior notes simultaneous with entering into the 2011 credit facilities, we also entered into a note purchase agreement providing for the sale of $400 million aggregate principal amount of senior notes, consisting of $200 million of our 4.13% senior notes, tranche a, due november 9, 2018 and $200 million of our 4.69% senior notes, tranche b, due november 9, 2021, or collectively, the private senior notes. in october 2013, following the issuance of the senior notes, we prepaid the $400 million aggregate principal amount of private senior notes. in connection with the early payoff of the private senior notes, we incurred $51 million in expenses relating to a $49 million pre-payment to the private senior notes investors and an associated $2 million write off of the related debt issuance costs. the $51 million expense was recorded as other expense in the accompanying consolidated statement of income for the year ended december 31, 2013. to fund the pre-payment of the private senior notes and the associated pre-payment expenses, we borrowed $450 million in october 2013 under the 364 day facility.
364 day facility in july 2013, we entered into a $600 million 364 day senior unsecured revolving credit facility, or the 364 day facility. the 364 day facility was available for working capital and general corporate purposes. in october 2013, we borrowed $450 million under the 364 day facility to fund the pre-payment of the private senior notes. in december 2013, we repaid the $450 million borrowed under the 364 day facility with the proceeds from the issuance of commercial paper. in connection with us entering into the 2014 credit facility, the 364 day facility was terminated in april 2014, at which time no amounts were outstanding under the 364 day facility.
senior notes in october 2013, we issued $600 million aggregate principal amount of 2.50% senior unsecured fixed rate notes due october 2018, or the 2018 senior notes, and $800 million aggregate principal amount of 4.00% senior unsecured fixed rate notes due october 2023, or the 2023 senior notes, together with the 2018 senior notes, the senior notes. we used the net proceeds from the senior notes offering to finance, together with cash on hand and $400 million borrowed in october 2013 under the revolving facility, the $2.7 billion cash portion of the purchase price of the acquisition of nyse.
nyse notes in connection with the acquisition of nyse, we assumed the outstanding nyse debt instruments, which included $850 million of 2.0% senior unsecured fixed rate notes due in october 2017, or the nyse usd notes, and €920 million ($1.1 billion) of 5.375% senior unsecured fixed rate notes due in june 2015, or the nyse eur notes, and together with the nyse usd notes, the nyse notes. upon closing of the euronext ipo, we elected to set aside sufficient euro-denominated cash from the proceeds to effectively pre-fund the maturity of the nyse eur notes and the related final interest coupon payment, both due on june 30, 2015. in connection with this, in july 2014, we placed €969 million ($1.2 billion) of the cash proceeds from the euronext ipo in term deposits at various banks each with a maturity date of june 25, 2015 to cover the €920 million ($1.1 billion) principal and the €49 million ($60 million) final interest coupon payment due on june 30, 2015. these deposits are classified as short-term investments in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of december 31, 2014. the balance of the cash proceeds received in connection with the euronext ipo were converted to u.s. dollars and used to repay outstanding commercial paper.
commercial paper program in december 2013, we entered into a u.s. dollar commercial paper program, or the commercial paper program. the commercial paper program is currently backed by the borrowing capacity available under the 2014 credit facility, equal to the amount of the commercial paper that is issued and outstanding at any given point in time. the effective interest rate of commercial paper issuances does not materially differ from short term interest rates (such as usd libor). the fluctuation of these rates due to market conditions may impact our interest expense. as of december 31, 2014, the weighted average interest rate on the $905 million outstanding under the commercial paper program was 0.26% per annum, with a weighted average maturity of 24 days.
we used the net proceeds from the notes issued under the commercial paper program, along with cash on hand, to repay the $900 million borrowed under the revolving facility and the $450 million borrowed under the 364 day facility during the year ended december 31, 2013. we used net proceeds from notes issued under the commercial paper program during the year ended december 31, 2014 to repay the $367 million that was outstanding under the term loan facility upon termination of the term loan facility in april 2014, to fund certain of our acquisitions, and to repurchase our common stock during the year ended december 31, 2014. we repaid a portion of the amounts outstanding under the commercial paper program during the year ended december 31, 2014 using a
combination of the cash proceeds received from the ipo and sale of euronext, the sale of nyse technologies and cash flows from operations.
guarantees in connection with our acquisition of nyse on november 13, 2013, ice, intercontinental exchange holdings, inc. and nyse established various guarantees to protect against structural subordination of each entities' existing indebtedness. each of intercontinental exchange holdings, inc. and nyse are our wholly-owned subsidiaries, and each fully and unconditionally guaranteed, on an unsecured and unsubordinated basis, the payment of principal, premium, if any, and interest of ice's senior notes and, following its establishment, the commercial paper program. similarly, ice and intercontinental exchange holdings, inc. each fully and unconditionally guaranteed, on an unsecured and unsubordinated basis, the payment of principal, premium, if any, and interest of the nyse notes. finally, ice and nyse each fully and unconditionally guaranteed, on an unsecured and unsubordinated basis, the payment of principal, premium, if any, and interest of the 2011 credit facilities and the 364 day facility. all of the guarantees are joint and several with all other guarantees and indebtedness. ice's guarantees, as a standalone entity, will remain in place until each applicable debt obligation has been satisfied.
upon the termination of the 2011 credit facilities and the 364 day facility, intercontinental exchange holdings, inc.'s guarantees were no longer required and therefore intercontinental exchange holdings, inc.'s guarantees were automatically released in accordance with their terms on april 3, 2014. in connection with our entry into the 2014 credit facility, nyse agreed to guarantee the 2014 credit facility as a subsidiary guarantor. for as long as nyse remains a guarantor of the 2014 credit facility, it will remain a guarantor of the senior notes and the commercial paper program. we expect that nyse's guarantee of the 2014 credit facility, the senior notes and the commercial paper program will be released when the nyse notes have been repaid, as the 2014 credit facility provides that nyse's guarantee will be released in accordance with their terms if certain conditions are satisfied, including compliance with the covenant limiting the amount of indebtedness of non-obligor subsidiaries and an investment-grade credit rating.
committed repo to provide a tool to liquidate margin and guaranty fund deposits held in the form of high quality sovereign debt, ice clear europe, ice clear credit and ice clear u.s. have entered into committed repurchase agreement facilities, or committed repo. each of these clearing houses is seeking to increase both the amount and the number of counterparties to its existing committed repo facilities. as of december 31, 2014, ice clear europe had $350 million in committed repo, ice clear credit had $100 million and ice clear u.s. had $200 million. as of january 9, 2015, ice clear europe increased its committed repo to $450 million and ice clear u.s. increased its committed repo to $250 million. the ice clear europe committed repo is available in u.s. dollars, euro and pound sterling, the ice clear credit committed repo is available in u.s. dollars and euro and the ice clear u.s. committed repo is available in u.s. dollars.
the committed repo arrangements provide these three clearing houses with an additional liquidity tool that may be utilized in the event there is a need to convert high quality sovereign debt into cash on a same-day basis during a market disruption that makes it difficult to sell and settle such sovereign debt on a same-day basis.
multicurrency payment facility ice clear u.s. requires its clearing members to meet non-u.s. dollar payment obligations in the currency of the obligation. ice clear u.s. also accepts foreign currencies as collateral to satisfy original margin requirements for those contracts which are denominated in a foreign currency. in addition, in order to meet its obligation to make settlement payments in all relevant currencies, ice clear u.s. uses its own capital to purchase the relevant foreign currencies as determined by its daily liquidity calculations. in the event a clearing member were to fail to make payment in a non-usd currency, ice clear u.s. will use the applicable foreign currency posted to satisfy original margin requirements in addition to the applicable foreign currency held by ice clear u.s. in order to meet its settlement obligations in such currency.
future capital requirements our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including the rate of our trading and clearing volume growth, strategic plans and acquisitions, required technology and clearing initiatives, regulatory requirements, the timing and introduction of new products and enhancements to existing products, the geographic mix of our business, and the continuing market acceptance of our electronic trading and clearing platforms. we currently expect to make aggregate operational capital expenditures and to incur capitalized software development costs ranging between $165 million and $175 million for the year ended december 31, 2015, which we believe will support the enhancement of our technology and the continued expansion of our businesses. in addition, we currently expect between $70 million to $80 million in capital expenditures during 2015, on leasehold improvement expenditures, primarily associated with our nyse headquarters in new york.
our board of directors has adopted a quarterly dividend declaration policy providing that the declaration of any dividends will be determined quarterly by the board or audit committee of the board of directors taking into account such factors as our evolving business model, prevailing business conditions and our financial results and capital requirements, without a predetermined annual net income payout ratio. during the year ended december 31, 2014, we paid a quarterly dividend of $0.65 per share per quarter of our common stock for an aggregate payout of $299 million, which includes the payment of dividend equivalents. on february 5, 2015, we announced a $0.65 per share dividend for the first quarter of 2015 with the dividend payable on march 31, 2015 to shareholders of record as of march 17, 2015 (the ex-dividend date will be march 13, 2015).
as of december 31, 2014, we had $4.3 billion in outstanding debt. we currently have $3.0 billion available for borrowing under our 2014 credit facility. after factoring in the $905 million currently required to backstop the commercial paper program and the $303 million reserved for our clearing houses as discussed above, $1.8 billion of our 2014 credit facility is currently available for general corporate purposes. see "- debt" above.
the 2014 credit facility and the commercial paper program are currently the only significant agreements or arrangements that we have with third parties for liquidity and capital resources. in the event of any strategic acquisitions, mergers or investments, or if we are required to raise capital for any reason or desire to return capital to our stockholders, we may incur additional debt, issue additional equity to raise the necessary funds, repurchase additional shares of our common stock or pay a dividend. however, we cannot provide assurance that such financing or transactions will be available or successful, or that the terms of such financing or transactions will be favorable to us. we have used and intend to use the cash proceeds from the euronext ipo to repay debt. we have used the net cash proceeds from the sales of nyfix, metabit and wombat to invest in growth initiatives, pursue strategic investments, return capital to shareholders via dividends and share repurchases and repay debt. see "- recent developments" above.
in connection with our acquisition of nyse, we assumed nyse's pension plans covering its u.s. and certain european operations. the benefit accrual for the u.s. operations pension plan is frozen. following the euronext ipo in june 2014, there are no longer any nyse european operations covered by the pension plans. during the year ended december 31, 2014, we contributed $51 million to our pension plans. our practice is to fund our frozen defined benefit pension plan each year at a level above the minimum required contribution but within tax deductible limits. based on actuarial projections, we estimate that a contribution of $10 million in 2015 will allow us to meet our funding goal. however, the actual contribution is contingent on the actual plan performance relative to assumptions.
prior to our acquisition, nyse completed the sale of a significant equity interest in nyse amex options, one of its two u.s. options exchanges, to seven external investors. under the terms of the sale, the external investors have the option to require us to repurchase a portion of its equity interest on an annual basis over the course of five years, which began in 2011. we currently own 84% of nyse amex options and the remaining 16% of the outstanding shares of nyse amex options, currently valued at $125 million, can be put back to us by the external investors in 2015 and these shares are recorded as redeemable non-controlling interest as of december 31, 2014.
we are obligated to contribute an aggregate of $100 million to the ice clear credit guaranty fund and the ice clear europe cds guaranty fund and have already contributed $50 million to the ice clear credit guaranty fund and $28 million to the ice clear europe cds guaranty fund as of december 31, 2014. we are obligated to contribute an additional $22 million to the ice clear europe cds guaranty fund as of october 7, 2015, two years from the launch of cds client clearing at ice clear europe.
we own ice futures europe, and in connection with the nyse acquisition, liffe administration and management, or liffe, both of which operate as u.k. recognized investment exchanges. as u.k. recognized investment exchanges, ice futures europe and liffe are required by the financial conduct authority in the united kingdom to restrict the use of the equivalent of six months of operating expenditures, subject to certain deductions, in cash or cash equivalents or investments at all times. as of december 31, 2014 the regulatory capital for ice futures europe and liffe was $57 million and $114 million, respectively. such amounts are reflected as short-term restricted cash and investments in the consolidated balance sheet as of december 31, 2014. in november 2014, we completed the transition of liffe's contracts to ice futures europe. while liffe still has a regulated status, we expect to apply for a de-recognition order in 2015, which will result in the release of the $114 million in regulatory capital and an increase in our cash and cash equivalents. at this time, we do not expect the regulatory capital at ice futures europe to increase during 2015 from $57 million as this balance already takes into account the higher post-liffe migration cost base.
as a u.k. recognized clearing house, ice clear europe is required by the bank of england in the united kingdom to restrict the use of the equivalent of six months of operating expenditures, subject to certain deductions, in cash or cash equivalents or investments at all times. as of december 31, 2014, this amount for ice clear europe was $87 million and is reflected as short-term restricted cash and investments in the consolidated balance sheet as of december 31, 2014. when emir becomes effective, which is currently anticipated during the first half of 2015, the bank of england restricted cash capital requirements for ice clear europe will be superseded by the emir capital requirements, which would require an increase in the liquid regulatory capital requirements of $136 million. we also expect ice clear europe's regulatory capital to increase by an additional $45 million to $50 million during the second quarter of 2015 in connection with the growth of our clearing business and costs at ice clear europe. these regulatory capital increases will be satisfied by way of additional restricted cash through our cash on hand.
in connection with our acquisition of nyse, we obtained a 40% ownership in occ. occ serves as a clearing house for securities options, security futures, commodity futures and options on futures traded on various independent exchanges. occ clears securities options traded on nyse arca and nyse mkt. occ is regulated by the sec as a registered clearing agency and by the cftc as a derivatives clearing organization. occ is developing a new capital plan, which is scheduled to be finalized during the first quarter of 2015, subject to regulatory and occ shareholders' approvals, which would potentially raise $150 million in equity capital from occ's shareholders, including $60 million to be contributed by nyse. in exchange for the equity capital from its shareholders, occ would, subject to determination by its board of directors and compliance with legal requirements, commit to pay an annual dividend to its shareholders equal to the after-tax income of occ, in excess of the amount required to maintain its target capital requirement and satisfy other capital requirements, and after refunds to its clearing members equal to 50% of distributable earnings before tax. in addition, under the occ new capital plan, the occ shareholders would commit to contribute up to $200 million in additional equity capital if certain capital thresholds are breached, including up to $80 million to be contributed by nyse. unless and until such $200 million capital contribution is repaid to the shareholders, occ would not declare any dividends and would not pay refunds to its clearing members. see "- non-operating income (expenses)" above.
non-u.s. gaap financial measures we use non-u.s. gaap measures internally to evaluate our performance and in making financial and operational decisions. when viewed in conjunction with our u.s. gaap results and the accompanying reconciliation, we believe that our presentation of these measures provides investors with greater transparency and a greater understanding of factors affecting our financial condition and results of operations than u.s. gaap measures alone. in addition, we believe the presentation of these measures is useful to investors for period-to-period comparison of results because the items described below are not reflective of our core business performance. these financial measures are not in accordance with, or an alternative to, u.s. gaap financial measures and may be different from non-u.s. gaap measures used by other companies. we use these adjusted results because we believe they more clearly highlight trends in our business that may not otherwise be apparent when relying solely on u.s. gaap financial measures, since these measures eliminate from our results specific financial items that have less bearing on our core operating performance. we strongly recommend that investors review the u.s. gaap financial measures included in this annual report on form 10-k, including our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto.

we include acquisition-related transaction costs as part of our core business expenses, except for those that are directly related to the announcement, closing, financing or termination of a transaction. however, we are including all of the acquisition-related transaction and integration costs relating to our acquisition of nyse as non-u.s. gaap adjustments given the size of the acquisition,
including a loss of $4 million for the year ended december 31, 2014 in connection with pension plan settlements made for early termination lump-sum payments made in 2014. we are also showing as non-u.s. gaap adjustments our amortization of acquisition-related intangibles, as excluding these non-cash expenses provides greater clarity regarding our financial strength and cash operating results.
during the year and three months ended december 31, 2014, in addition to the adjustments for the nyse acquisition-related integration costs and the amortization of the acquisition-related intangibles, we also include as adjustments the net gain on the sale of our 6% remaining ownership in euronext and the income recognized on our occ equity investment. during the year and three months ended december 31, 2013, in addition to the adjustments for the nyse acquisition-related transaction and integration costs and the amortization of the acquisition-related intangibles, we also include as adjustments the impairment loss recorded on our equity investment in cetip, the banker success fee relating to the acquisition of ice endex, the expense relating to the early payoff of outstanding debt, the impact of certain foreign tax law changes that occurred during the fourth quarter of 2013 and the duplicate rent expenses and lease termination costs we incurred as we consolidated multiple new york office locations in the current year. during the year and three months ended december 31, 2012, we include as adjustments the nyse acquisition-related transaction costs and amortization of the acquisition-related intangibles. for additional information on these items, refer to our consolidated financial statements and related notes, which are included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10-k and "- operating expenses" and "-non-operating income (expenses)" above.
off-balance sheet arrangements we do not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities, which have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes.
contractual obligations and commercial commitments the following table presents, for the periods indicated, our contractual obligations (which we intend to fund from operations) and commercial commitments as of december 31, 2014 (in millions):
additional funding of ice clear europe's guaranty fund under emir and other regulatory requirements         186                 186                     -             -                     -

we have excluded from the contractual obligations and commercial commitments table above $47.5 billion in cash margin deposits and guaranty fund liabilities. clearing members of ice clear europe, ice clear u.s., ice clear credit, ice clear canada, tcc and hch are required to deposit original margin and variation margin and to make deposits to a guaranty fund. the cash deposits made to these margin accounts and to the guaranty fund are recorded in the consolidated balance sheet as current assets with corresponding current liabilities to the clearing members that deposited them. see note 12 to our consolidated financial statements and related notes that are included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10-k for additional information on our clearing houses and the margin deposits and guaranty funds' liabilities.
we have also excluded unrecognized tax benefits, or utbs, from the contractual obligations and commercial commitments table above. as of december 31, 2014, our cumulative utbs were $145 million. interest and penalties related to utbs were $45 million as of december 31, 2014. we are under continuous examination by various tax authorities. we are unable to make a reasonable estimate of the periods of cash settlement because it is not possible to reasonably predict, the amount of tax, interest and penalties, if any, that might be assessed by a tax authority or the timing of an assessment or payment. it is also not possible to reasonably predict whether or not the applicable statutes of limitations might expire without us being examined by any particular tax authority. see note 11 to our consolidated financial statements and related notes that are included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10-k for additional information on our utbs.
as of december 31, 2014, in connection with our acquisition of nyse, we have obligations related to our pension and other benefit programs. the date of payment under these obligations cannot be determined and have been excluded from the table above. see note 14 to our consolidated financial statements and related notes that are included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10-k for additional information on our pension and other benefit programs.
prior to our acquisition, nyse completed the sale of a significant equity interest in nyse amex options, one of its two u.s. options exchanges, to seven external investors. under the terms of the sale, the external investors have the option to require us to repurchase a portion of their equity interest on an annual basis over the course of five years, which began in 2011. since the likelihood of us acquiring the non-controlling interest in the future is probable, the full redemption fair value has been recorded as mezzanine equity and we have classified the related balance as "redeemable non-controlling interest" in our consolidated balance sheet. we currently own 84% of nyse amex options and the remaining 16% of the outstanding shares of nyse amex options, currently valued at $125 million, can be put back to us by the external investors in 2015 and these shares are recorded as redeemable non-controlling interest as of december 31, 2014. however, we cannot estimate whether the external investors will elect to exercise their remaining put options and it has been excluded from the table above. see note 13 to our consolidated financial statements and related notes that are included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10-k for additional information on the redeemable non-controlling interest.
in connection with our acquisition of nyse, we obtained a 40% ownership in occ. occ is developing a new capital plan, which is scheduled to be finalized during the first quarter of 2015, subject to occ's regulatory and occ shareholders' approvals, which would potentially raise $150 million in equity capital from occ's shareholders, including $60 million to be contributed by nyse. in addition, under the occ new capital plan, the occ shareholders would commit to contribute up to $200 million in additional equity capital if certain capital thresholds are breached, including up to $80 million to be contributed by nyse. however, we cannot estimate whether the occ new capital plan will be approved and for how much and the $60 million initial contribution and the potential $80 million additional contribution from us has been excluded from the table above. see "- future capital requirements" above.
new and recently adopted accounting pronouncements refer to note 2 to our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10-k for information on the new and recently adopted accounting pronouncements that are applicable to us.
critical accounting policies we have identified the policies below as critical to our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations. the impact of, and any associated risks related to, these policies on our business operations is discussed throughout "management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations". for a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies, see note 2 to our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10-k. our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with u.s. gaap. the preparation of financial statements in conformity with these accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities, and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, at the date of our financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
we evaluate our estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis, including those related to the accounting matters described below. we base our estimates and judgments on our historical experience and other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances when we make these estimates and judgments. based on these factors, we make estimates and judgments about, among other things, the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from market prices or other independent sources and about the recognition and characterization of our revenues and expenses. the values and results based on these estimates and judgments could differ significantly under different assumptions or conditions and could change materially in the future.
we believe that the following critical accounting policies, among others, affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements and could materially increase or decrease our reported results, assets and liabilities.
goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets we have significant intangible assets related to goodwill and other acquired intangible assets. in connection with our acquisitions, assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recorded at their estimated fair values. goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price of our acquisitions over the fair value of identifiable net assets acquired, including other identified intangible assets. we recognize specifically identifiable intangibles when a specific right or contract is acquired. our determination of the fair value of the intangible assets and whether or not these assets are impaired requires us to make significant judgments and requires us to use
significant estimates and assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows. if we change our strategy or if market conditions shift, our judgments may change, which may result in adjustments to recorded asset balances. as of december 31, 2014, we had goodwill of $8.5 billion and net other intangible assets of $7.8 billion relating to our acquisitions, our purchase of trademarks and internet domain names from various third parties, and the russell licensing agreement. of these amounts, $6.1 billion in goodwill and $7.0 billion of other intangible assets relates to our acquisition of nyse on november 13, 2013. we do not amortize goodwill or other intangible assets with indefinite useful lives. intangible assets with finite useful lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives.
in performing the purchase price allocation, we consider, among other factors, the intended future use of acquired assets, analysis of historical financial performance and estimates of future performance of the acquired business. at the acquisition date, a preliminary allocation of the purchase price is recorded based upon a preliminary valuation. we continue to review and validate estimates, assumptions and valuation methodologies underlying the preliminary valuation during the measurement period. accordingly, these estimates and assumptions are subject to change, which could have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. the measurement period ends as soon as we receive the information about facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date or we learn that more information is not obtainable, which usually does not exceed one year from the date of acquisition.
our goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets are evaluated for impairment annually in our fiscal fourth quarter or more frequently if conditions exist that indicate that the value may be impaired. we test our goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level. these impairment evaluations are performed by comparing the carrying value of the goodwill reporting unit or other indefinite-lived intangibles to its estimated fair value. we allocate goodwill to reporting units based on the reporting unit expected to benefit from the business combination. subsequent to our acquisition of nyse, we identified five reporting units: our futures reporting unit, our cds reporting unit, our cash listings reporting unit, our euronext reporting unit and our technology reporting unit. the cash listings, euronext and technology reporting units were added as part of our nyse acquisition on november 13, 2013. as a result of the ipo of euronext and the sale of nyse technologies during the year ended december 31, 2014, we currently have three reporting units: our futures reporting unit, our cds reporting unit and our cash listings reporting unit.
goodwill impairment testing consists of a two-step methodology. the initial step requires us to determine the fair value of each reporting unit and compare it to the carrying value, including goodwill and other intangible assets, of such reporting unit. if the fair value exceeds the carrying value, no impairment loss is recognized and the second step, which is a calculation of the impairment, is not performed. however, if the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, an impairment charge is recorded equal to the extent that the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value. for annual goodwill impairment testing, we have the option to first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, including goodwill and other intangible assets. if we conclude that this is the case, we must perform the two-step methodology described above. otherwise, we can skip the two-step methodology and do not need to perform any further testing. for annual indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment testing, we also have the option to first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible assets is less than its carrying amount.
application of the impairment test requires judgment, including the identification of reporting units, assignment of assets and liabilities to reporting units, assignment of goodwill to reporting units, and determination of the fair value of each reporting unit. we have historically determined the fair value of our reporting units based on various valuation techniques, including discounted cash flow analysis and a multiple of earnings approach. in assessing whether goodwill and other intangible assets are impaired, we must make estimates and assumptions regarding future cash flows, long-term growth rates of our business, operating margins, discount rates, weighted average cost of capital and other factors to determine the fair value of our assets. these estimates and assumptions require management's judgment, and changes to these estimates and assumptions, as a result of changing economic and competitive conditions, could materially affect the determination of fair value and/or impairment. the cash flows employed in the discounted cash flow analysis are based on our most recent budgets and business plans and, when applicable, various growth rates have been assumed for years beyond the current business plan period. future events could cause us to conclude that indicators of impairment exist for goodwill or other intangible assets. impairment may result from, among other things, deterioration in the performance of our business, adverse market conditions, adverse changes in applicable laws and regulations, competition, or the sale or disposition of a reporting unit. any resulting impairment loss could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations.
our impairment analysis has not resulted in any impairment of goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets through december 31, 2014. among our reporting units, the fair value of our cds reporting unit has been the closest to its carrying value in prior goodwill impairment analyses. our cds reporting unit includes the financial results and net assets of creditex, ice clear credit and the cds clearing business at ice clear europe. cds trade execution revenues at creditex have decreased the last several years. the cds execution business remains pressured due to financial reform implementation and a general lack of volatility in the corporate credit markets. however, the decline in cds trading revenues was offset by an increase in ice cds clearing, the listing of additional cleared cds products, and signing on new clearing members, along with a decrease in expenses at creditex. also, with the advent of mandatory clearing during 2013, cds clearing activity by investment funds, asset managers, and similar buy side market participants has increased significantly.
during the first step of the cds impairment review in the fourth quarter of 2014, we performed a discounted cash flow valuation to estimate the fair value of our cds reporting unit. the valuation of our cds reporting unit concluded that the fair value exceeded carrying value by $751 million, or 132% of the carrying value in the fourth quarter of 2014. as of december 31, 2014, the cds goodwill and other intangible assets balances were $476 million. the discount rate used in the cds discounted cash flow valuation is intended to reflect the risks inherent in the future cash flows of the cds reporting unit and was 9.2% in the fourth quarter 2014 review. a 10 basis point increase in the discount rate used would not have a material impact on our fair value of the cds reporting unit. a 10% decrease in the estimated discounted cash flows for the cds reporting unit would result in the fair value of the reporting unit exceeding the carrying value by $548 million.
given the current market conditions and continued economic and regulatory uncertainty, the fair value of our cds reporting unit may deteriorate and could result in the need to record an impairment charge in future periods. we continue to monitor potential triggering events in our cds reporting unit, including changes in the business and regulatory climate in which it operates, the current volatility in the capital markets, our recent operating performance and our financial projections. any changes in these factors could result in an impairment charge.
we are also required to evaluate other finite-lived intangible assets and property and equipment for impairment by determining whether events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets to be held and used may not be recoverable. if impairment indicators are present, then an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows produced by these long-lived assets is compared to the carrying value of those assets to determine if the asset is recoverable. if an asset is not recoverable, the loss is measured as the difference between fair value and carrying value of the impaired asset. fair value of these assets is based on various valuation techniques, including discounted cash flow analysis. our evaluation has not resulted in any impairment of other finite-lived intangible assets and property and equipment through december 31, 2014.
income taxes we are subject to income taxes in the united states and other foreign jurisdictions where we operate. the determination of our provision for income taxes and related accruals, deferred tax assets and liabilities requires significant judgment, the use of estimates, and the interpretation and application of complex tax laws. we recognize a current tax liability or tax asset for the estimated taxes payable or refundable on tax returns for the current year. we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of our assets and liabilities. we establish valuation allowances if we believe that it is more likely than not that some or all of our deferred tax assets will not be realized. deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using current enacted tax rates in effect for the years in which those temporary differences and carryforwards are expected to reverse.
we do not recognize a tax benefit unless we conclude that it is more likely than not that the benefit will be sustained on audit by the taxing authority based solely on the technical merits of the associated tax position. if the recognition threshold is met, we recognize a tax benefit measured at the largest amount of the tax benefit that, in our judgment, is greater than 50 percent likely to be realized. we recognize accrued interest and penalties related to uncertain income tax positions as income tax expense in the consolidated statements of income.
the undistributed earnings from our non-u.s. subsidiaries are considered to be indefinitely reinvested and, accordingly, no provision for u.s. federal and state income taxes has been made in our consolidated financial statements. a distribution of these non-u.s. earnings in the form of dividends, or otherwise, could subject us to both u.s. federal and state income taxes, as adjusted for non-u.s. tax credits, and withholding taxes payable to the various non-u.s. countries. determination of the amount of any unrecognized deferred income tax liability on these undistributed earnings is not practicable.
we operate within multiple domestic and foreign taxing jurisdictions and are subject to audit in these jurisdictions by domestic and foreign tax authorities. these audits include questions regarding our tax filing positions, including the timing and amount of deductions taken and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions. we record accruals for the estimated outcomes of these audits, and the accruals may change in the future due to new developments in each matter. at any point in time, many tax years are subject to or in the process of being audited by various taxing authorities. to the extent our estimates of settlements change or the final tax outcome of these matters is different from the amounts recorded, such differences will impact the income tax provision in the period in which such determinations are made. our income tax expense includes changes in our estimated liability for exposures associated with our various tax filing positions. determining the income tax expense for these potential assessments requires management to make assumptions that are subject to factors such as proposed assessments by tax authorities, changes in facts and circumstances, issuance of new regulations, and resolution of tax audits.
pension and other post-retirement employee benefits in connection with our acquisition of nyse, we assumed nyse's pension plans and other post-retirement employee benefit plans covering its u.s. and certain european operations. following the euronext ipo in june 2014, there are no longer any nyse european operations covered by the pensions plans and other post-retirement employee benefit plans. pension and other post-retirement employee benefits costs and liabilities are dependent on assumptions used in calculating such amounts. these assumptions include discount rates to measure future obligation and interest expense, mortality rates, health care cost trend rates, benefits earned, interest cost, expected return on assets, and other factors. in accordance with u.s. gaap, actual results that differ from the assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and, therefore, generally affect recognized expense and the recorded obligation in future periods. while we believe that the assumptions used are appropriate, differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions may affect our pension and other post-retirement obligations and future expense.
item 7 (a).     quantitative    and qualitative disclosures about market risk as a result of our operating and financing activities, we are exposed to market risks such as interest rate risk, foreign currency exchange rate risk and credit risk. we have implemented policies and procedures designed to measure, manage, monitor and report risk exposures, which are regularly reviewed by the appropriate management and supervisory bodies.
interest rate risk we have exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relating to our cash and cash equivalents, short-term and long-term investments, short-term and long-term restricted cash and investments, and indebtedness. as of december 31, 2014 and 2013, our cash and cash equivalents, short-term and long-term investments and short-term and long-term restricted cash and investments were $2.9 billion and $1.8 billion, respectively, of which $1.9 billion and $819 million, respectively, were denominated in brazilian reais, pounds sterling, euros or canadian dollars. of the $1.9 billion as of december 31, 2014, €969 million ($1.2 billion) represents euro-denominated cash that was placed in term deposits at various banks with a maturity date of june 25, 2015 to cover the maturity of the nyse euro notes on june 30, 2015. see item 7 "management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations - debt" included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10-k. our investment in cetip, which is recorded as an available-for-sale, long-term investment and was recorded in and is held in brazilian reais, was valued at $379 million as of december 31, 2014, including an unrealized gain of $55 million. changes in the fair value of the cetip investment is reflected in accumulated other comprehensive income and do not impact earnings, except to the extent that unrealized losses are deemed to be other than temporary. the remaining investments are denominated in u.s. dollars. we do not use our investment portfolio for trading or other speculative purposes. a hypothetical decrease in long-term interest rates to zero basis points would decrease annual pre-tax earnings by $3 million as of december 31, 2014, assuming no change in the amount or composition of our cash and cash equivalents, short-term and long-term investments and short-term and long-term restricted cash and investments.
as of december 31, 2014, we had $4.3 billion in outstanding debt, of which $1.4 billion relates to the senior notes and $2.0 billion relates to the nyse notes, both of which bear interest at fixed interest rates. the remaining amount outstanding of $905 million relates to the commercial paper program, which bears interest at fluctuating rates and, therefore, subjects us to interest rate risk. a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates relating to the amounts outstanding under the commercial paper program as of december 31, 2014 would decrease annual pre-tax earnings by $9 million, assuming no change in the volume or composition of our outstanding indebtedness and no hedging activity. the interest rates on our commercial paper program are currently reset on a daily, weekly or monthly basis. see item 7 "management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations - debt" included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10-k.
foreign currency exchange rate risk as an international business, we are subject to foreign currency exchange rate risk. we may experience gains or losses from foreign currency transactions in the future given that a significant part of our assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses are recorded in euros or pounds sterling. certain assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses of foreign subsidiaries are denominated in the local functional currency of such subsidiaries.
our exposure to foreign denominated earnings for the year ended december 31, 2014 is presented by primary foreign currency in the following table (in millions, except average rates and percentages):
euro                            pound sterling average exchange rate to the u.s. dollar for the year ended december 31, 2014   $1.3300                         $1.6481
average exchange rate to the u.s. dollar for the year ended december 31, 2013   $1.3282                         $1.5643

(1)   represents the impact of currency fluctuation for the year ended december 31, 2014 compared to the same period in the prior year.
nyse, which we acquired in november 2013, has a significant part of its assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses recorded in pounds sterling or euros. for the year ended december 31, 2014, 19% of our consolidated revenues, less transaction-based expenses, were denominated in pounds sterling or euros, and 18% of our consolidated expenses were denominated in pounds sterling or euros, respectively. these percentages do not include the euronext revenues and expenses, as they are included in discontinued operations. as the pound sterling or euro exchange rate changes, the u.s. equivalent of revenues and expenses denominated in foreign currencies changes accordingly.
we have foreign currency transaction risk related to the settlement of foreign currency denominated assets, liabilities and payables that occur through our operations, which are received in or paid in pounds sterling or euros, due to the increase or decrease in the foreign currency exchange rates between periods. we had foreign currency transaction losses of $2 million, $2 million and $4 million for the years ended december 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively, primarily attributable to the fluctuations of the pound sterling and euro relative to the u.s. dollar, which strengthened. a 10% adverse change in the underlying foreign currency exchange rates as of december 31, 2014 would result in a foreign currency transaction loss of $6 million, assuming no change in the composition of the foreign currency denominated assets, liabilities and payables and assuming no hedging activity.
we entered into foreign currency hedging transactions during the years ended december 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012 as economic hedges to hedge a portion of our foreign currency transaction exposure and may enter into additional hedging transactions in the future to help mitigate our foreign exchange risk exposure.
we have foreign currency translation risk equal to our net investment in our foreign subsidiaries. the financial statements of these subsidiaries are translated into u.s. dollars using a current rate of exchange, with gains or losses included in the cumulative translation adjustment account, a component of equity. our exposure to the net investment in foreign currencies is presented by primary foreign currencies in the table below (in millions):

the nyse eur notes of €920 million ($1.1 billion) no longer constitute a partial hedge of nyse's net euro investment in foreign entities following the ipo of euronext. the transaction gain or loss from the revaluation of the nyse eur notes on the u.s. dollar balance sheet of nyse holdings llc will be offset by the transaction gain or loss from the cash held in euros to repay the notes upon their maturity in june 2015, as discussed above.
as of december 31, 2014 and 2013, the portion of our equity attributable to accumulated other comprehensive income from foreign currency translation was $13 million and $143 million, respectively. as of december 31, 2014, we had net exposure of euro and pounds sterling of €601 million ($731 million) and £2.1 billion ($3.2 billion), respectively. based on december 31, 2014 net currency positions, a hypothetical 10% decrease of euro against u.s. dollar would negatively impact our equity by $73 million and a hypothetical 10% decrease of pound sterling against u.s. dollar would negatively impact our equity by $325 million. for the year ended december 31, 2014, currency exchange rate differences had a negative impact of $130 million on our consolidated equity.
credit risk we are exposed to credit risk in our operations in the event of a counterparty default. we limit our exposure to credit risk by rigorously selecting the counterparties with which we make our investments and execute agreements. credit risk is monitored by using exposure limits depending on ratings assigned by rating agencies as well as the nature and maturity of transactions. our investment objective is to invest in securities that preserve principal while maximizing yields, without significantly increasing risk. we seek to substantially mitigate credit risk associated with investments by ensuring that these financial assets are placed with governments, well-capitalized financial institutions and other creditworthy counterparties.
an ongoing review is performed to evaluate changes in the status of counterparties. in addition to the intrinsic creditworthiness of counterparties, our policies require diversification of counterparties (banks, financial institutions, bond issuers and funds) so as to avoid a concentration of risk.
clearing house cash deposits credit risk our clearing houses hold material amounts of clearing member cash deposits which are invested primarily to provide security of capital, but also which may generate interest income for our clearing members. refer to note 12 to our consolidated financial statements and related notes, which are included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10-k, for more information on the clearing houses cash deposits, which were $47.5 billion as of december 31, 2014. the following is a summary of the risks associated with this investment activity and how these risks are mitigated.
interest rate risk interest rate risk is the risk that interest rates rise causing the value of the purchased security to decline. if we were required to sell the security prior to its maturity, and interest rates had risen, the sale of the security might be made at a loss relative to its original purchase price. our clearing houses seek to manage this risk by making all of our cash deposit investments in sovereign debt reverse repurchase agreements that mature within 1 to 37 days. our clearing house investment guidelines require that a minimum of 50% of clearing member cash deposits are invested in sovereign debt reverse repurchase agreements that mature within one business day. efforts are made to invest the remaining 50% in sovereign debt reverse repurchase agreements that mature within 37 business days. if this is not possible, our policy allows for the investment of up to 50% of clearing member cash deposits in high quality sovereign debt (for example, u.s. treasury securities) and supranational debt instruments (euro cash deposits only) with the shortest possible time to maturity provided that no such direct investment in a sovereign debt or supranational instrument will have a time to maturity greater than 397 days (1.09 years).
security issuer risk security issuer risk is the risk that an issuer of a security defaults on its payment when the security matures. this risk is mitigated by investing clearing member cash deposits in high quality sovereign debt reverse repurchase agreements or direct investments in high quality sovereign and supranational debt issues. thus, the risk is mitigated because, in the event of a security issuer default, we are left with a highly marketable, liquid security.
investment counterparty risk investment counterparty risk is the risk that a reverse repurchase agreement counterparty or an investment adviser might become insolvent and, thus, fail to meet its obligations to our clearing houses. we mitigate this risk by only engaging in transactions with high credit quality reverse repurchase agreement counterparties and investment advisors.
when engaging in reverse repurchase agreements, our clearing houses take delivery of the underlying reverse repurchase securities in custody accounts that are under the control of our clearing house. additionally, the securities purchased subject to reverse repurchase have a market value greater than the reverse repurchase amount. the typical haircut received for high quality sovereign debt is 2% of the reverse repurchase amount. thus, in the event that a reverse repurchase counterparty defaults on its obligation to repurchase the underlying reverse repurchase securities, our clearing house will have possession of a security with a value greater than the reverse repurchase counterparty's obligation to our clearing house.
our clearing houses do not hold clearing member cash deposits or the underlying investments with any of our investment advisors. our clearing house property is held in custody accounts controlled by our clearing houses. our clearing houses' property is
each clearing house employs (or will employ) multiple investment advisors and custodians to ensure that in the event that a single investment adviser or custodian becomes unable to fulfill its role, additional investment advisors or custodians are available as back-ups.
cross-currency margin deposit risk each of our clearing houses, pursuant to their rules, may permit posting of cross-currency collateral to satisfy margin requirements (for example, accepting original margin deposits denominated in u.s. dollars to secure a japanese yen variation margin obligation). the risk exists that the value of the original margin currency provided to satisfy margin obligations declines in value resulting in an inability to make required variation margins in the appropriate currency. this risk is mitigated by applying a "haircut" to the original margin currency at a level sufficiently high enough to weather periods of high currency volatility. cross-currency balances are marked-to-market on a daily basis. should the value of the currency posted to satisfy margin requirements decline in value, the clearing member is required to increase its original margin deposit on a same-day basis.
impact of inflation we have not been adversely affected by inflation as technological advances and competition have generally caused prices for the hardware and software that we use for our electronic platforms to remain constant or to decline. in the event of inflation, we believe that we will be able to pass on any price increases to our participants, as the prices that we charge are not governed by long-term contracts.

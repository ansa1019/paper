item 7.   management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations
overview wabtec is one of the world's largest providers of value-added, technology-based products and services for the global rail industry. our products are found on virtually all u.s. locomotives, freight cars and passenger transit vehicles, as well as in more than 100 countries throughout the world. our products enhance safety, improve productivity and reduce maintenance costs for customers, and many of our core products and services are essential in the safe and efficient operation of freight rail and passenger transit vehicles. wabtec is a global company with operations in 20 countries. in 2014, about 50% of the company's revenues came from customers outside the u.s.
management review and future outlook wabtec's long-term financial goals are to generate cash flow from operations in excess of net income, maintain a strong credit profile while minimizing our overall cost of capital, increase margins through strict attention to cost controls and implementation of the wabtec performance system, and increase revenues through a focused growth strategy, including global and market expansion, new products and technologies, aftermarket products and services, and acquisitions. in addition, management evaluates the company's current operational performance through measures such as quality and on-time delivery.
the company monitors a variety of factors and statistics to gauge market activity. freight rail markets around the world are driven primarily by overall economic conditions and activity, while transit markets are driven primarly by government funding and passenger ridership.  changes in these market drivers can cause fluctuations in demand for wabtec's product and services.  unife projects growth of about 2.7% in the worldwide rail supply market over the next several years, with the highest expected growth rates in africa, the middle east, and latin america.
in north america, the aar compiles statistics that gauge the level of activity in the freight rail industry, including revenue ton-miles and carloadings, which are generally referred to as "rail traffic".  based on changes in rail traffic trends, railroads can increase or decrease purchases of new locomotives and freight cars.  in 2014, north american carloadings increased 4.4%, including a 5.4% increase in intermodal carloadings, while deliveries of new locomotives and new freight cars increased 15% and 27%, respectively. in 2015, we expect demand for new locomotives to be slightly lower than in 2014, while we expect demand for new freight cars to be higher. unife projects a growth rate of about 3.0% in north america.
in north america, the american public transportation association (apta) compiles ridership statistics and trends.  based on preliminary figures for 2014, ridership increased about 0.9% in the u.s. and about 1.4% in canada.  ridership provides fare box revenues to transit authorities, which use these funds, along with state and local money, primarily, for equipment maintenance.  in 2014, the u.s. congress passed a budget that is expected to increase spending on transit projects to $11 billion in 2015, an increase of about 2% from 2014 levels.  a majority of federal money is used by transit agencies to purchase new equipment or infrastructure.
wabtec continues to expand its presence in freight rail and passenger transit markets outside the u.s., particularly in europe, asia-pacific and south america. to gauge activity in these markets, we monitor trends in rail traffic and the spending plans of our customers.  in europe, the majority of the rail system serves the passenger transit market, which is larger than the transit market in the u.s., our presence in the u.k., germany and italy has positioned the company to take advantage of this market. unife projects the western european rail market to grow at about 2.0% in the next few years, with the united kingdom and france expected to invest in new rolling stock.  unife projects the market in asia-pacific, the world's second largest according to the study, to grow by 4.0% over the next several years, primarily reflecting strong spending in china in recent years.  other growth markets around the world, according to unife, include latin america, expected to grow at about 5.0%; and the commonwealth of independent states, expected to grow at about 1.0%.  through wholly owned subsidiaries and joint ventures, wabtec has a presence in every key freight rail and passenger transit market around the world.
in 2015 and beyond, general economic and market conditions in the united states and internationally will have an impact on our sales and operations. to the extent that these factors cause instability of capital markets, shortages of raw materials or component parts, longer sales cycles, deferral or delay of customer orders or an inability to market our products effectively, our business and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. in addition, we face risks associated with our four-point growth strategy including the level of investment that customers are willing to make in new technologies developed by the industry and the company, and risks inherent in global expansion. when necessary, we will modify our financial and operating strategies to reflect changes in market conditions and risks.

the following table shows the major components of the change in sales in 2014 from 2013:
change in sales by product line:
foreign exchange                                (12,233   )            23,394                11,161
net sales increased by $478.1 million to $3,044.5 million in 2014 from $2,566.4 million in 2013. the increase is due to sales related to acquisitions of $229.4 million, $184.7 million for specialty products and electronics sales from higher demand for freight original equipment products and aftermarket electronic products, and $84.2 million for brake products sales due to higher demand for original equipment products for freight customers and aftermarket brakes from certain transit authorities.  the increases were partially offset by lower sales for original equipment locomotives.  favorable foreign exchange increased sales $11.2 million.
freight segment sales increased by $333.4 million, or 23.8%, primarily due to a $184.5 million for specialty products and electronics sales from higher demand for freight original equipment rail products, positive train control electronics, and aftermarket rail products, acquisitions of $93.3 million, and $55.5 million for brake products due to higher demand for original equipment brakes.  unfavorable foreign exchange decreased sales $12.2 million.
transit segment sales increased by $144.7 million, or 12.4%, due to acquisitions of $136.1 million and $28.7 million from increased demand for aftermarket brakes from certain transit authorities.  these increases were partially offset by $39.9 million in lower sales for original equipment transit locomotives.  favorable foreign exchange increased net sales $23.4 million.
cost of sales and gross profit cost of sales increased by $306.1 million to $2,108.5 million in 2014 from $1,802.4 million in 2013.  cost of sales, as a percentage of sales was 69.3% in 2014 and 70.2% in 2013.
raw material costs were approximately 43% as a percentage of sales in 2014 and 2013. labor costs decreased to approximately 11% as a percentage of sales in 2014 from 12% in 2013. overhead costs as a percentage of sales decreased to approximately 14% in 2014 from 15% in 2013. freight segment raw material costs increased as a percentage of sales to approximately 42% in 2014 from 40% in 2013 due to the higher mix of revenue generated from freight and transit original equipment sales and aftermarket services, which have a higher raw material component as cost of sales. freight segment labor costs decreased from approximately 10% as a percentage of sales in 2014 from 11% in 2013, and overhead costs as a percentage of sales were approximately 13% in 2014 and 14% in 2013. transit segment raw material costs decreased as a percentage of sales to approximately 45% in 2014 from 46% in 2013, primarily due to lower original equipment locomotive sales, which have a higher raw material component. transit segment labor costs increased as a percentage of sales to approximately 13% in 2014 from 12% in 2013, and overhead costs remained unchanged at 15% for both 2014 and 2013. in general, overhead costs vary as a percentage of sales depending on product mix and changes in sales volume.
included in cost of sales is warranty expense. the provision for warranty expense is generally established for specific losses, along with historical estimates of customer claims as a percentage of sales, which can cause variability in warranty expense between quarters. warranty expense was $11.1 million higher in 2014 compared to 2013 due to increased sales.  as a percentage of sales, warranty expense was 0.6% in 2014 and 0.9% in 2013.
gross profit increased to $936.0 million in 2014 compared to $764.0 million in 2013, due to higher sales volume and the reasons discussed above.  for 2014 and 2013, gross profit, as a percentage of sales, was 30.7% and 29.8%, respectively.

freight segment operating expenses increased $30.8 million, or 19.5%, in 2014 but decreased 40 basis points to 10.9% of sales.  the increase primarily relates to $8.4 million of incremental operating expenses from acquisitions, $8.2 million in higher corporate allocations mainly due to increased incentive compensation expense, and $8.2 million for engineering attributable to the company concentrating resources on new product development.
transit segment operating expenses increased $43.6 million, or 28.5%, in 2014 and increased 190 basis points to 15.0% of sales.  the increase is primarily related to $33.9 million of incremental operating expenses related to acquisitions.  in addition, transit segment engineering expenses increased to support new product development.
corporate non-allocated operating expenses increased $7.7 million in 2014 primarily due to higher administrative costs associated with growing the business.
income from operations income from operations totaled $527.1 million or 17.3% of sales in 2014 compared to $437.3 million or 17.0% of sales in 2013. income from operations increased due to higher sales volume, partially offset by increased operating expenses discussed above.
interest expense, net overall interest expense, net, increased $2.2 million in 2014 due to due to higher debt balances resulting from acquisitions, partially offset by lower average interest rates.
income taxes the effective income tax rate was 30.8% and 30.6% in 2014 and 2013, respectively. in 2014, the positive effect of an increase in foreign income taxed at lower statutory rates was offset by tax reserves required for uncertain tax positions in several jurisdictions.
net income net income for 2014 increased $59.4 million to $351.7 million, compared to 2013. the increase in net income is due to higher sales volume and lower effective tax rate, partially offset by higher operating expenses.

segment operating expenses consist of specific segment costs such as, sales and marketing, information technology, insurance, and audit and tax fees, allocated corporate costs, and other segment specific discrete charges. corporate costs are allocated to the
freight and transit segments based on segment revenues. certain corporate departmental expenses are not allocated. allocated operating expenses decreased $2.1 million in 2013 compared to 2012, mostly due to a decrease in allocated legal expenses.
freight segment operating expenses increased $0.8 million in 2013 compared to 2012 because of $5.2 million of expenses from acquisitions, partially offset by a decrease of $4.0 million in expenses allocated to the operating segments. freight segment operating expenses were 11.3% and 10.5% of sales for 2013 and 2012, respectively.
transit segment operating expenses increased $25.4 million in 2013 compared to 2012 because of $12.2 million of expenses from acquisitions, and an increase of $1.8 million in expense allocated to the operating segments. in addition, transit segment selling, general and administrative expenses increased to support higher sales volumes.  transit segment operating expenses were 13.1% and 14.4% of sales for 2013 and 2012, respectively.
corporate non-allocated operating expenses decreased $1.8 million in 2013 compared to 2012 primarily due to a release of $2.8 million of certain allocated legal reserves for a court ruling, partially offset by an increase in certain non-allocated administrative expenses.
income from operations income from operations totaled $437.3 million or 17.0% of sales in 2013 compared to $392.3 million or 16.4% of sales in 2012. income from operations increased due to higher sales volume, partially offset by increased operating expenses discussed above.
other expense, net the company recorded foreign exchange losses of $3.5 million and $0.1 million in 2013 and 2012, respectively, due to the effect of currency exchange rate changes on intercompany transactions that are non u.s. dollar denominated and charged or credited to earnings.
income taxes the effective income tax rate was 30.6% and 33.3% in 2013 and 2012, respectively. the decrease in the effective rate is primarily due to retroactive extension of the r&d tax credit, an increase in foreign income taxed at lower statutory rates, and a benefit recorded for the enacted reduction of a foreign statutory tax rate.
net income net income for 2013 increased $40.5 million, compared to 2012. the increase in net income is due to higher sales volume and lower effective tax rate, partially offset by higher operating expenses.
liquidity and capital resources liquidity is provided by operating cash flow and borrowings under the company's unsecured credit facility with a consortium of commercial banks. the following is a summary of selected cash flow information and other relevant data:
operating activities               $472,385                  $235,653                  $237,438
payments of debt                          (493,819   )              (829,842   )              (311,457   )
operating activities. in 2014, 2013 and 2012, cash provided by operations was $472.4 million, $235.7 million and $237.4 million, respectively. in comparison to 2013, cash provided by operations in 2014 increased due to reduced working capital compared to the prior year, coupled with higher operating results. the major components of the higher cash inflows were as follows: a positive change in accounts receivable of $132.3 million as the number of days to collect cash decreased, a positive change in other accrued liabilities and customer deposits of $117.6 million, and a positive change in accrued income taxes due to payment timing.  these cash inflows were partially offset by the following cash outflows: an unfavorable change in accounts payable of $5.6 million due to payment timing, and an unfavorable change or increase of $90.1 million in inventory as the company held more inventory to support the higher backlog of orders in 2015.
in comparison to 2012, cash provided by operations in 2013 resulted from higher operating results offset by higher cash outflows for working capital. the major components of the higher cash outflows were as follows: a negative change in accounts receivable of $126.7 million as the number of days to collect cash increased slightly and sales increased, a negative change in customer deposits due to the completion of certain large contracts, and a $15.8 million payment in 2012 for a court ruling.  these cash outflows were partially offset by the following cash inflows: a favorable change in accounts payable of $60.9 million due to payment timing, and a favorable change or decrease of $58.6 million in inventory as our days' supply in inventory (dsi) decreased to 63 days from 72 days at the end of 2012 due to the completion of certain original equipment contracts.
investing activities. in 2014, 2013 and 2012, cash used in investing activities was $347.7 million, $258.7 million and $184.9 million, respectively. the major components of the cash outflow in 2014 were planned additions to property, plant, and equipment of $47.6 million for continued investments in our facilities and manufacturing processes and $300.4 million in net cash paid for acquisitions.  this compares to $41.2 million for property, plant, and equipment and $223.5 million in net cash paid for acquisitions.  refer to note 3 of the "notes to condensed consolidated financial statements" for additional information on acquisitions.
financing activities. in 2014, cash provided by financing activities was $25.5 million, which included $563.4 million in proceeds from the revolving credit facility debt, $493.4 million of repayments of debt on the revolving credit facility, $19.2 million of dividend payments and $26.8 million of wabtec stock repurchases. in 2013, cash provided by financing activities was $93.0 million, which included $711.6 million in proceeds from the revolving credit facility debt, proceeds of $247.4 million from the issuance of 4.375% senior notes, net of issuance costs, $679.6 million of repayments of debt on the revolving credit facility, and a $150.0 million payment for the maturity of the 2003 senior notes.

2013 refinancing credit agreement on december 19, 2013, the company amended its existing revolving credit facility with a consortium of commercial banks. this "2013 refinancing credit agreement" provides the company with a $800 million, five-year revolving credit facility. the company incurred approximately $1.0 million of deferred financing cost related to the 2013 refinancing credit agreement. the facility expires on december 19, 2018. the 2013 refinancing credit agreement borrowings bear variable interest rates indexed as described below. at december 31, 2013, the company had available bank borrowing capacity, net of $29.1 million of letters of credit, of approximately $500.9 million, subject to certain financial covenant restrictions.
under the 2013 refinancing credit agreement, the company may elect a base rate of interest for u.s. dollar denominated loans or, for certain currencies, an interest rate based on the london interbank offered rate ("libor") of interest, or other rates appropriate for such currencies (in any case, "the alternate rate"). the base rate adjusts on a daily basis and is the greater of the federal funds effective rate plus 0.5% per annum, the pnc, n.a. prime rate or the daily libor rate plus 100 basis points, plus a margin that ranges from 0 to 75 basis points. the alternate rate is based on the quoted rates specific to the applicable currency, plus a margin that ranges from 75 to 175 basis points. both the base rate and alternate rate margins are dependent on the company's consolidated total indebtedness to cash flow ratios. the current base rate margin is 0 basis points and the alternate rate margin is 100 basis points.
at december 31, 2014 the weighted average interest rate on the company's variable rate debt was 1.75%.  on january 12, 2012, the company entered into a forward starting interest rate swap agreement with a notional value of $150 million. the effective date of the interest rate swap agreement is july 31, 2013, and the termination date is november 7, 2016. the impact of the interest rate swap agreement converts a portion of the company's outstanding debt from a variable rate to a fixed-rate borrowing. during the term of the interest rate swap agreement the interest rate on the notional value will be fixed at 1.415% plus the alternate rate margin. on june 5, 2014, the company entered into a forward starting interest rate swap agreement with a notional value of $150.0 million.  the effective date of the interest rate swap agreement is november 7, 2016, and the termination date is december 19, 2018.  the impact of the interest rate swap agreement converts a portion of the company's outstanding debt from a variable rate to a fixed-rate borrowing.  during the term of the interest rate swap agreement the interest rate on the notional value will be fixed at 2.56% plus the alternate
rate margin.  as for the agreements, the company is exposed to credit risk in the event of nonperformance by the counterparties.  however, since only the cash interest payments are exchanged, exposure is significantly less than the notional amount.  the counterparties are large financial institutions with excellent credit ratings and history of performance.  the company currently believes the risk of nonperformance is negligible.
the 2013 refinancing credit agreement limits the company's ability to declare or pay cash dividends and prohibits the company from declaring or making other distributions, subject to certain exceptions. the 2013 refinancing credit agreement contains various other covenants and restrictions including the following limitations: incurrence of additional indebtedness; mergers, consolidations, sales of assets and acquisitions; additional liens; sale and leasebacks; permissible investments, loans and advances; certain debt payments; and imposes a minimum interest expense coverage ratio of 3.0 and a maximum debt to cash flow ratio of 3.25. the company does not expect that these measurements will limit the company in executing our operating activities.
2011 refinancing credit agreement on november 7, 2011, the company refinanced its existing revolving credit and term loan facility with a consortium of commercial banks. this "2011 refinancing credit agreement" provided the company with a $600 million, five-year revolving credit facility. the company incurred approximately $1.9 million of deferred financing cost related to the 2011 refinancing credit agreement. the facility was set to expire on november 7, 2016.
under the 2011 refinancing credit agreement, the company may have elected a base rate of interest or an interest rate based on the london interbank offered rate ("libor") of interest ("the alternate rate"). the base rate adjusted on a daily basis and was the greater of the federal funds effective rate plus 0.5% per annum, the pnc, n.a. prime rate or the daily libor rate plus 100 basis points plus a margin that ranged from 0 to 75 basis points. the alternate rate was based on quoted libor rates plus a margin that ranged from 75 to 175 basis points. both the base rate and alternate rate margins were dependent on the company's consolidated total indebtedness to cash flow ratios. the current base rate margin was 0 basis points and the alternate rate margin was 100 basis points.
in august 2013, the company issued $250.0 million of senior notes due in 2023 ("the 2013 notes").  interest on the 2013 notes accrues at a rate of 4.375% per annum and is payable semi-annually on february 15 and august 15 of each year.  the proceeds were used to repay debt outstanding under the company's existing credit agreement, and for general corporate purposes.  the principal balance is due in full at maturity.  the company incurred $2.6 million of deferred financing costs related to the issuance.
the 2013 notes are senior unsecured obligations of the company and rank pari passu with all existing and future senior debt and senior to all existing and future subordinated indebtedness of the company. the indenture under which the 2013 notes were issued contains covenants and restrictions which limit among other things, the following: the incurrence of indebtedness, payment of dividends and certain distributions, sale of assets, change in control, mergers and consolidations and the incurrence of liens.
the company is in compliance with the restrictions and covenants in the indenture under which the 2013 notes were issued and expects that these restrictions and covenants will not be any type of limiting factor in executing our operating activities.
in august 2003, the company issued $150.0 million of senior notes due in 2013 ("the 2003 notes"). the 2003 notes were issued at par. interest on the 2003 notes accrued at a rate of 6.875% per annum and was payable semi-annually on january 31 and july 31 of each year. the proceeds were used to repay debt outstanding under the company's existing credit agreement and for general corporate purposes. the company paid off the 2003 notes, which matured on july 31, 2013 utilizing available capacity under the 2011 refinancing credit agreement.

critical accounting estimates the preparation of the financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make judgments, estimates and assumptions regarding uncertainties that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses. areas of uncertainty that require judgments, estimates and assumptions include the accounting for allowance for doubtful accounts, inventories, the testing of goodwill and other intangibles for impairment, warranty reserves, pensions and other postretirement benefits, stock based compensation and tax matters. management uses historical experience and all available information to make these judgments and estimates, and actual results will inevitably differ from those estimates and assumptions that are used to prepare the company's financial statements at any given time. despite these inherent limitations, management believes that management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (md&a) and the financial statements and related footnotes provide a meaningful and fair perspective of the company. a discussion of the judgments and uncertainties associated with accounting for derivatives and environmental matters can be found in notes 2 and 18, respectively, in the "notes to consolidated financial statements" included in part iv, item 15 of this report.
a summary of the company's significant accounting policies is included in note 2 in the "notes to consolidated financial statements" included in part iv, item 15 of this report and is incorporated by reference herein. management believes that the application of these policies on a consistent basis enables the company to provide the users of the financial statements with useful and reliable information about the company's operating results and financial condition.
judgments and uncertainties  the allowance for doubtful accounts receivable reflects our best estimate of probable losses inherent in our receivable portfolio determined on the basis of historical experience, specific allowances for known troubled accounts and other currently available evidence.
effect if actual results differ from assumptions  if our estimates regarding the collectability of troubled accounts, and/or our actual losses within our receivable portfolio exceed our historical experience, we may be exposed to the expense of increasing our allowance for doubtful accounts.
description inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market and are reviewed to ensure that an adequate provision is recognized for excess, slow moving and obsolete inventories.
judgments and uncertainties cost is determined under the first-in, first-out (fifo) method. inventory costs include material, labor and overhead. the company compares inventory components to prior year sales history and current backlog and anticipated future requirements. to the extent that inventory parts exceed estimated usage and demand, a reserve is recognized to reduce the carrying value of inventory. also, specific reserves are established for known inventory obsolescence.
effect if actual results differ from assumptions if the market value of our products were to decrease due to changing market conditions, the company could be at risk of incurring the cost of additional reserves to adjust inventory value to a market value lower than stated cost. if our estimates regarding sales and backlog requirements are inaccurate, we may be exposed to the expense of increasing our reserves for slow moving and obsolete inventory.
description goodwill and indefinite-lived intangibles are required to be tested for impairment at least annually. the company performs its annual impairment test during the fourth quarter and more frequently when indicators of impairment are present. the company reviews goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level. the evaluation of impairment involves comparing the current fair value of the business to the recorded value (including goodwill).
judgments and uncertainties a number of significant assumptions and estimates are involved in the application of the impairment test, including the identification of macroeconomic conditions, industry and market considerations, cost factors, overall financial performance, wabtec specific events and share price trends and making the assessment on whether each relevant factor will impact the impairment test positively or negatively and the magnitude of any such amount.
effect if actual results differ from assumptions management considers historical experience and all available information at the time the fair values of its reporting units are estimated. however, actual amounts realized may differ from those used to evaluate the impairment of goodwill. if actual results are not consistent with our assumptions and judgments used in estimating future cash flows and asset fair values, we may be exposed to impairment losses that could be material to our results of operations. for example, based on the last quantitative analysis performed as of october 1, 2013, a decline in the terminal growth rate greater than 50 basis points would decrease fair market value by $175.2 million, or an increase in the weighted-average cost of capital by 100 basis points would result in a decrease in fair market value by $482.9 million. even with such changes the fair value of the reporting units would be greater than their net book values, necessitating no step 2 calculations. see note 2 in the "notes to consolidated financial statements" included in part iv, item 15 of this report for additional discussion regarding impairment testing.
judgments and uncertainties in general, reserves are provided for as a percentage of sales, based on historical experience. in addition, specific reserves are established for known warranty issues and their estimable losses.
effect if actual results differ from assumptions if actual results are not consistent with the assumptions and judgments used to calculate our warranty liability, the company may be at risk of realizing material gains or losses.
accounting for pensions and postretirement benefits:
description the company provides pension and postretirement benefits for its employees.  these amounts are determined using actuarial methodologies and incorporate significant assumptions, including the rate used to discount the future estimated liability, the long-term rate of return on plan assets and several assumptions relating to the employee workforce (salary increases, medical costs, retirement age and mortality).
judgments and uncertainties significant judgments and estimates are used in determining the liabilities and expenses for pensions and other postretirement benefits. the rate used to discount future estimated liabilities is determined considering the rates available at year-end on debt instruments that could be used to settle the obligations of the plan. the long-term rate of return is estimated by considering historical returns and expected returns on current and projected asset allocations and is generally applied to a five-year average market value of assets.  the differences between actual and expected asset returns are recognized in expense using the normal amortization of gains and losses per asc 715.
effect if actual results differ from assumptions if assumptions used in determining the pension and other postretirement benefits change significantly, these costs can fluctuate materially from period to period. the key assumptions in determining the pension and other postretirement expense and obligation include the discount rate, expected return on assets and health care cost trend rate. for example, a 1% decrease or increase in the discount rate used in determining the pension and postretirement expense would increase expense $2.9 million or decrease expense $2.3 million, respectively. a 1% decrease or increase in the discount rate used in determining the pension and postretirement obligation would increase the obligation $51.0 million or decrease the obligation $41.1 million, respectively. a 1% decrease or increase in the expected return on assets used in determining the pension expense would increase or decrease expense $2.2 million, respectively. if the actual asset values at december 31, 2014 had been 1% lower, the amortization of losses in the following year would decrease $0.1 million. a 1% decrease or increase in the health care cost trend rate used in determining the postretirement expense would decrease or increase expense $0.4 million. a 1% decrease or increase in the health care cost trend rate used in determining the postretirement obligation would decrease the obligation $4.6 million or increase the obligation $5.4 million, respectively.
description the company has issued incentive stock awards to eligible employees that vest upon attainment of certain cumulative three-year performance goals. the program is structured as a rolling three-year plan; each year starts a new three-year performance cycle with the most recently commenced cycle being 2012-2014. no incentive stock awards will vest for performance below the three-year cumulative threshold.  the company utilizes an economic profit measure for this performance goal.  economic profit is a measure of the extent to which the company produces financial results in excess of its cost of capital.  based on the company's achievement of the threshold and three-year cumulative performance, the stock awards vested can range from 0% to 200% of the shares granted.
judgments and uncertainties significant judgments and estimates are used in determining the estimated three-year performance, which is then used to estimate the total shares expected to vest over the three year vesting cycle and corresponding expense based on the grant date fair value of the award.  when determining the estimated three-year performance, the company utilizes a combination of historical actual results, budgeted results and forecasts.  in the initial grant year of a performance cycle, the company estimates the three-year performance at 100%.  as actual performance results for a cycle begin to accumulate and the company completes its budgeting and forecasting cycles the performance estimates are updated.  these judgments and estimates are reviewed and updated on a quarterly basis.
effect if actual results differ from assumptions if assumptions used in determining the estimated three-year performance change significantly, stock-based compensation expense related to the unvested incentive stock awards can fluctuate materially from period to period.  for example a 10% decrease or increase in the estimated vesting percentage for incentive stock awards would decrease or increase stock-based compensation expense by approximately $0.8 million and $0.8 million, respectively.
description wabtec records an estimated liability or benefit for income and other taxes based on what it determines will likely be paid in various tax jurisdictions in which it operates in accordance with asc 740-10 accounting for income taxes and accounting for uncertainty in income taxes.
judgments and uncertainties the estimate of our tax obligations are uncertain because management must use judgment to estimate the exposures associated with our various filing positions, as well as realization of our deferred tax assets. asc 740-10 establishes a recognition and measurement threshold to determine the amount of tax benefit that should be recognized related to uncertain tax positions.
effect if actual results differ from assumptions management uses its best judgment in the determination of these amounts. however, the liabilities ultimately realized and paid are dependent on various matters including the resolution of the tax audits in the various affected tax jurisdictions and may differ from the amounts recorded. an adjustment to the estimated liability would be recorded through income in the period in which it becomes probable that the amount of the actual liability differs from the recorded amount. a deferred tax valuation allowance is provided when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.
revenue recognition:
description revenue is recognized in accordance with asc-605 "revenue recognition." the company recognizes revenues on long-term contracts based on the percentage of completion method of accounting. the units-of-delivery method or other input-based or output-based measures, as appropriate, are used to measure the progress toward completion of individual contracts. contract revenues and cost estimates are reviewed and revised at a minimum quarterly and adjustments are reflected in the accounting period as such amounts are determined. certain pre-production costs relating to long term production and supply contracts have been deferred and will be recognized over the life of the contracts.
judgments and uncertainties revenue is recognized when products have been shipped to the respective customers, title has passed and the price for the product has been determined. contract accounting involves a judgmental process of estimating the total sales and costs for each contract, which results in the development of estimated profit margin percentages. for each contract with revenue recognized using the percentage of completion method, the amount reported as revenues is determined by calculating cost incurred to date as a percentage of the total expected contract costs to determine the percentage of total contract revenue to be recognized in the current period. due to the size, duration and nature of many of our contracts, the estimation of total sales and costs through completion is complicated and subject to many variables. total contract sales estimates are based on negotiated contract prices and quantities, modified by our assumptions regarding contract options, change orders, and price adjustment clauses (such as inflation or index-based clauses). total contract cost estimates are largely based on negotiated or estimated purchase contract terms, historical performance trends, business base and other economic projections. factors that influence these estimates include inflationary trends, technical and schedule risk, internal and subcontractor performance trends, business volume assumptions, asset utilization, and anticipated labor agreements. for long-term contracts, revenues and cost estimates are reviewed and revised quarterly at a minimum and adjustments are reflected in the accounting period as such amounts are determined. pre-production costs are recognized over the expected life of the contract usually based on the company's progress toward the estimated number of units expected to be delivered under the production or supply contract.
effect if actual results differ from assumptions should market conditions and customer demands dictate changes to our standard shipping terms, the company may be impacted by longer than typical revenue recognition cycles. the development of expected contract costs and contract profit margin percentages involves procedures and personnel in all areas that provide financial or production information on the status of contracts. due to the significance of judgment in the estimation process, it is likely that materially different revenue amounts could be recorded if we used different assumptions or if the underlying circumstances were to change. changes in underlying assumptions/estimates, supplier performance, or circumstances may adversely or positively affect financial performance in future periods. if the combined profit margin for all contracts recognized on the percentage of completion method during 2014 had been estimated to be higher or lower by 1%, it would have increased or decreased revenue and gross profit for the year by approximately $8.3 million. a few of our contracts are expected to be completed in a loss position. provisions are made currently for estimated losses on uncompleted contracts. a charge to expense for unrecognized portions of pre-production costs could be realized if the company's estimate of the number of units to be delivered changes or the underlying contract is cancelled.

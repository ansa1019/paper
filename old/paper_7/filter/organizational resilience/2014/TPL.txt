overview the trust was organized in 1888 and holds title to extensive tracts of land in numerous west texas counties which were previously the property of the texas and pacific railway company. we continue to manage those lands for the benefit of the holders of certificates of proprietary interest in the trust. our revenues are derived primarily from sales of land, oil and gas royalties, easements and sundry income, grazing leases of the land and interest. due to the nature of our operations, our revenue is subject to substantial fluctuations from quarter to quarter and year to year. we are a passive seller of land and do not actively solicit sales of land. in addition, the demand for, and sale price of, particular tracts of land is influenced by many factors beyond our control, including general economic conditions, the rate of development in nearby areas and the suitability of the particular tract for the ranching uses prevalent in western texas. the trust is not an oil and gas producer. rather, its oil and gas revenue is derived from retained perpetual non-participating oil and gas royalty interests. thus, in addition to being subject to fluctuations in response to the market prices for oil and gas, our oil and gas royalty revenues are also subject to decisions made by the owners and operators of the oil wells to which our royalty interests relate as to investments in and production from those wells. we monitor production reports by the oil and gas companies to assure that we are being paid the appropriate royalties. we review conditions in the agricultural industry in the areas in which our lands are located and seek to keep as much of our lands as possible under lease to local ranchers at competitive rates. in recent years, we have been successful at keeping over 98% of our land subject to grazing leases.
results of operations the trust's primary sources of income are revenue derived from sales of land, either for cash or a combination of cash and mortgage notes, and revenue derived from the trust's land and mineral interests.

critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america (gaap) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements. it is our opinion that we fully disclose our significant accounting policies in the notes to the financial statements. consistent with our disclosure policies, we include the following discussion related to what we believe to be our most critical accounting policies that require our most difficult, subjective or complex judgment.
valuation of notes receivable - management of the trust monitors delinquencies to assess the propriety of the carrying value of its notes receivable. at the point in time that notes receivable become delinquent, management reviews the operations information of the debtor and the estimated fair value of the collateral held as security to determine whether an allowance for losses is required. any required allowance for losses is recorded in the period of determination. at december 31, 2014 and 2013, there were no significant delinquencies and, as such, no allowances for losses have been recorded.
valuation of real estate acquired through foreclosure - the value of real estate acquired through foreclosure is established at the lower of cost or fair value less disposition costs at the date of foreclosure. cost is considered to be the aggregate of the outstanding principal and interest, past due ad valorem taxes and other fees associated with the foreclosure. subsequent to the foreclosure date, valuations are periodically performed or obtained by management when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the full carrying amount may not be recoverable. at such time, a valuation allowance is established to reduce the carrying value to the estimated fair value. valuation of the real estate is based on the estimates of management and is subject to judgment. at december 31, 2014 and 2013, no valuation allowances were recorded.
gain recognition on land sales - accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america dictate the manner in which the gain or loss on the sale of land is recorded. the trust has established policies for the sale of land which result in the full accrual method of gain recognition. this policy generally requires that the trust receive a minimum cash down payment of 25% of the sales price on each sale and that any related notes receivable require regular principal and interest payments, payable over terms from 5 to 15 years.

management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (md&a)
presentation the consolidated financial statements of general electric company (the company) combine the industrial manufacturing and services businesses of general electric company (ge) with the financial services businesses of general electric capital corporation (gecc or financial services). unless otherwise indicated by the context, we use the terms "ge" and "gecc" on the basis of consolidation described in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements in this form 10-k report.
net earnings of gecc and the effect of transactions between segments are eliminated to arrive at total consolidated data.
prior to january 28, 2011, we operated a media company, nbc universal, inc. (nbcu). effective january 28, 2011, we held a 49% interest in a media entity that included the nbc universal businesses (nbcu llc). on march 19, 2013, we completed the sale of our remaining 49% common equity interest to comcast corporation.
we integrate acquisitions as quickly as possible. revenues and earnings from the date we complete the acquisition through the end of the following fourth quarter are considered the acquisition effect of such businesses.
discussion of gecc's total assets excludes deferred income tax liabilities, which are presented within assets for purposes of our consolidating statement of financial position presentations for this filing.
see the glossary section of this form 10-k for a definition of equipment and services sales as used in this form 10-k report as compared to the product and services split on the statement of earnings.

consolidated earnings increased 1% primarily due to an increase in the operating profit of the industrial segments, partially offset by lower financial services income and the absence of the nbcu llc related income.                                                      consolidated earnings increased 4% on strong industrial segment growth and continued stabilization in financial services.
industrial segment profit increased 10% with growth driven by aviation, oil &amp; gas and power &amp; water.                                                                                                                                                                industrial segment profit increased 5% with growth driven by aviation and oil &amp; gas.

industrial sg&amp;a as a percentage of total sales decreased to 14.0% as a result of global cost reduction initiatives, primarily at power &amp; water and healthcare. this was partially offset by higher acquisition-related costs.                                       industrial sg&amp;a as a percentage of total sales decreased to 15.9% as a result of global cost reduction initiatives related to simplification efforts both in the industrial segments and corporate. this was partially offset by increased acquisition-related costs and higher restructuring.
see the "other consolidated information" section within the md&a of this form 10-k for a discussion of postretirement benefit plans costs, income taxes and geographic data.
segment operations segment revenues and profit segment revenues include both revenues and other income related to the segment.
segment profit is determined based on internal performance measures used by the chief executive officer (ceo) to assess the performance of each business in a given period. in connection with that assessment, the ceo may exclude matters such as charges for restructuring; rationalization and other similar expenses; acquisition costs and other related charges; technology and product development costs; certain gains and losses from acquisitions or dispositions; and litigation settlements or other charges, for which responsibility preceded the current management team.
segment profit excludes results reported as discontinued operations and accounting changes. segment profit also excludes the portion of earnings or loss attributable to noncontrolling interests of consolidated subsidiaries, and as such only includes the portion of earnings or loss attributable to our share of the consolidated earnings or loss of consolidated subsidiaries.
segment profit excludes or includes interest and other financial charges and income taxes according to how a particular segment's management is measured:
   interest and other financial charges and income taxes are excluded in determining segment profit (which we sometimes refer to as "operating profit") for the industrial segments.
   interest and other financial charges and income taxes are included in determining segment profit (which we sometimes refer to as "net earnings") for the ge capital segment.
certain corporate costs, such as shared services, employee benefits and information technology are allocated to our segments based on usage. a portion of the remaining corporate costs are allocated based on each segment's relative net cost of operations.
effective in the second quarter of 2014, we began including the effects of the gecc preferred stock dividends in our ge capital segment. previously, such dividends had been reported in the caption "corporate items and eliminations" in the company's summary of operating segments table. presenting ge capital segment results including the effects of the gecc preferred stock dividends is consistent with the way management measures the results of our financial services business. prior-period segment information has been recast to be consistent with how we currently evaluate the performance of the ge capital segment.
potential acquisitions impacting multiple segments ge's offer to acquire the thermal, renewables and grid businesses of alstom for approximately €12.4 billion (to be adjusted for the assumed net cash or liability at closing) was positively recommended by alstom's board of directors. in addition, ge, alstom and the french government signed a memorandum of understanding for the formation of three joint ventures in grid technology, renewable energy, and global nuclear and french steam power and alstom will invest approximately €2.6 billion in these joint ventures. in the fourth quarter of 2014, alstom completed its review of the proposed transaction with the works council and obtained approval from its shareholders. also in the fourth quarter of 2014, ge and alstom entered into an amendment to the original agreement where ge has agreed to pay alstom a net amount of approximately €0.3 billion of additional consideration at closing. in exchange for this funding, alstom has agreed to extend the trademark licensing of the alstom name from 5 years to 25 years as well as other contractual amendments. the proposed transaction continues to be subject to regulatory approvals. the transaction is targeted to close in 2015. the acquisition and alliances will impact our power & water and energy management segments.

significant trends &amp; developments
ending net investment we have communicated our goal of reducing ge capital's eni, excluding liquidity, most recently targeting a balance of less than $300 billion. eni is a metric used by us to measure the total capital we have invested in our financial services business. ge capital's eni (excluding liquidity) was $363 billion at december 31, 2014. to achieve this goal, we are more aggressively focusing our businesses on selective financial services products where we have deep domain experience, broad distribution, the ability to earn a consistent return on capital and are competitively advantaged, while managing our overall balance sheet size and risk. we have a strategy of exiting those businesses that are deemed to be non-strategic or that are underperforming. we have completed a number of dispositions in our businesses in the past and will continue to evaluate options going forward.
accordingly, in the short-term, as we reduce our eni through exiting non-core businesses, the overall level of our net earnings may be reduced, which potentially could include impairments, restructurings and other non-cash charges. however, over the long-term, we believe that this strategy will improve our long-term performance through higher returns as we will have a larger concentration of assets in our core businesses, as opposed to the underperforming or non-strategic assets we will be exiting; reduce liquidity risk as we pay down outstanding debt and diversify our sources of funding (with less reliance on the global commercial paper markets and an increase in alternative sources of funding such as deposits); and reduce capital requirements while strengthening capital ratios. additional information about our liquidity and how we manage this risk can be found in the financial resources and liquidity section of this form 10-k report.
the actions below are consistent with our strategy of reducing gecc eni and investing in our core businesses.

   $0.5 billion of higher eliminations and other, which was driven by $0.4 billion of higher inter-segment eliminations. also contributing to the decrease in revenues and other income was a $0.2 billion impairment related to an investment security in 2014 compared with a $0.1 billion impairment of an investment in a brazilian company in 2013.
operating costs increased $0.2 billion, primarily as a result of:
   $0.4 billion of lower gains from disposed businesses.
these increases to operating costs were partially offset by the following:
   $0.9 billion of lower costs of our principal retirement plans,
   $0.2 billion of lower restructuring and other charges. restructuring and other charges in 2014 included $0.2 billion of impairment related to an investment security at power &amp; water, $0.1 billion of asset write-offs at a consolidated nuclear joint venture in which we hold a 51% interest at power &amp; water and $0.1 billion curtailment loss on the principal retirement plans resulting from our agreement with electrolux to sell the appliances business, and
   $0.5 billion of lower eliminations and other, which was driven by $0.4 billion of lower corporate costs, which include research and development and functional spending in 2014. in 2013, eliminations and other costs included $0.1 billion impairment of an investment in a brazilian company.
2013 - 2012 commentary revenues decreased $0.1 billion primarily as a result of:
   $0.1 billion lower revenue and other income related to the operations and disposition of nbcu llc,
   $0.3 billion of higher gains from disposed businesses, which reflects the net effect of $0.5 billion of gains from industrial business dispositions in 2013 compared with a $0.3 billion gain on joint venture formation and a $0.1 billion loss on sale of a plant in 2012, and
   $0.3 billion of higher eliminations and other, which reflects a $0.1 billion pre-tax loss related to the impairment of an investment in a brazilian company and $0.2 billion of lower revenues related to a plant that was sold in 2012.
operating costs increased $1.3 billion primarily as a result of:
   $0.1 billion of lower nbcu llc related income,
   $0.1 billion of higher principal retirement plan costs,
   $1.3 billion of higher restructuring and other charges, and
   $0.1 billion of higher eliminations and other, which reflects the $0.1 billion of impairment referred to above.
these increases to operating costs were partially offset by $0.3 billion of higher gains on disposed businesses.

the 2014 loss from discontinued operations, net of taxes, primarily reflected the following:
   $0.2 billion after-tax effect of incremental reserves related to retained representation and warranty obligations to repurchase previously sold loans on the 2007 sale of wmc.
   2014 losses were partially offset by a $0.1 billion tax benefit related to the extinguishment of our loss-sharing arrangement for excess interest claims associated with the 2008 sale of ge money japan.
the 2013 loss from discontinued operations, net of taxes, primarily reflected the following:
   $1.6 billion after-tax effect of incremental reserves, primarily related to an agreement to extinguish our loss-sharing arrangement for excess interest claims associated with the 2008 sale of ge money japan,
   $0.2 billion after-tax effect of incremental reserves related to retained representation and warranty obligations to repurchase previously sold loans on the 2007 sale of wmc, and
   $0.2 billion after-tax loss on the planned disposal of consumer russia.
the 2012 loss from discontinued operations, net of taxes, primarily reflected the following:
   $0.6 billion after-tax effect of incremental reserves for excess interest claims related to our loss-sharing arrangement on the 2008 sale of ge money japan,
   $0.3 billion after-tax effect of incremental reserves related to retained representation and warranty obligations to repurchase previously sold loans on the 2007 sale of wmc, and
   2012 losses were partially offset by a $0.1 billion tax benefit related to the resolution with the internal revenue service regarding the tax treatment of the 2007 sale of our plastics business.

md&amp;a   other consolidated information
other consolidated information interest and other financial charges interest on borrowings and other financial charges amounted to $9.5 billion, $10.1 billion and $12.4 billion in 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. substantially all of our borrowings are in financial services, where interest expense was $8.4 billion, $9.3 billion and $11.6 billion in 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. gecc average borrowings declined from 2013 to 2014 and from 2012 to 2013, in line with changes in average gecc assets. interest rates have decreased over the three-year period primarily attributable to declining global benchmark interest rates. gecc average borrowings were $364.4 billion, $379.5 billion and $420.0 billion in 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. the gecc average composite effective interest rate was 2.3% in 2014, 2.4% in 2013 and 2.8% in 2012. in 2014, gecc average assets of $507.2 billion were 3.0% lower than in 2013, which in turn were 7% lower than in 2012. see the "liquidity and borrowings" section within the md&a of this form 10-k for a discussion of liquidity, borrowings and interest rate risk management.
postretirement benefit plans postretirement benefit plans costs were $4.8 billion, $6.0 billion and $5.5 billion in 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. costs decreased in 2014 primarily due to the effects of higher discount rates (principal pension plans' discount rate increased from 3.96% at december 31, 2012 to 4.85% at december 31, 2013) and lower loss amortization related to our principal pension plans, partially offset by lower expected investment return on pension plan assets. costs increased in 2013 primarily due to the continued amortization of 2008 investment losses and the effects of lower discount rates (principal pension plans' discount rate decreased from 4.21% at december 31, 2011 to 3.96% at december 31, 2012).
postretirement benefit actuarial assumptions are significant inputs to the actuarial models that measure benefit obligations and their related effects on operations:
   the society of actuaries recently issued new mortality tables projecting longer life expectancies that will result in higher postretirement benefit obligations for u.s. companies. we updated our mortality assumptions at december 31, 2014. the new mortality assumptions increased principal postretirement benefit obligations by approximately $4.6 billion at year end.
   considering the current and target asset allocations, as well as historical and expected returns on various categories of assets in which our plans are invested, we have assumed that the long-term return on our principal pension plan assets will be 7.5% for cost recognition in 2015, compared to 7.5% in 2014 and 8.0% in both 2013 and 2012.
gaap provides for recognition of differences between assumed and actual experience over a period no longer than the average future service of employees. see the "critical accounting estimates" section within the md&a of this form 10-k for additional information.
we expect the costs of our postretirement benefits to increase in 2015 by approximately $0.6 billion as compared to 2014, primarily because of the effects of lower discount rates and new mortality assumptions, which are partially offset by lower loss amortization related to our principal pension plans.
non-gaap operating pension costs*        1.5       1.8       1.7
md&amp;a   other consolidated information
operating earnings include service cost and prior service cost amortization for our principal pension plans as these costs represent expenses associated with employee service. operating earnings exclude non-operating pension costs/income such as interest cost, expected return on plan assets and non-cash amortization of actuarial gains and losses. we expect operating pension costs for these plans will be about $1.7 billion in 2015. the expected increase in operating pension costs is attributable primarily to the effects of lower discount rates and new mortality assumptions.
the ge pension plan was underfunded by $15.8 billion at the end of 2014 as compared to $4.7 billion at december 31, 2013. the ge supplementary pension plan, which is an unfunded plan, had projected benefit obligations (pbo) of $6.6 billion and $5.2 billion at december 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. our underfunding at year-end 2014 was significantly higher compared to 2013 primarily due to lower discount rates and new mortality assumptions. the decrease in our principal pension plans' discount rate increased the pbo at year-end 2014 by approximately $7.7 billion. the new mortality assumptions increased our pbo by approximately $4.0 billion at december 31, 2014. our ge pension plan assets were $48.3 billion at the end of both 2014 and 2013 as 2014 investment returns and participant contributions were offset by benefit payments made during the year. assets of the ge pension plan are held in trust, solely for the benefit of plan participants, and are not available for general company operations.
in august 2014, the u.s. government enacted the "highway and transportation funding act "(hatfa), which contained provisions that changed the interest rate methodology used to calculate employee retirement income security act (erisa) minimum pension funding requirements in the u.s. this change reduced our near-term annual cash funding requirements for the ge pension plan. we did not contribute to the ge pension plan in either 2014 or 2013. on an erisa basis, our preliminary estimate is that the ge pension plan was approximately 104% funded at january 1, 2015. the erisa funded status is higher than the gaap funded status primarily because the erisa prescribed interest rate in hatfa is calculated using an average interest rate. as a result, the erisa interest rate is higher than the year-end gaap discount rate. the higher erisa interest rate lowers pension liabilities for erisa funding purposes. our current estimate projects that we will not be required to make minimum pension funding contributions to the ge pension plan in 2015 or 2016.
at december 31, 2014, the fair value of assets for our other pension plans was $3.2 billion less than the respective projected benefit obligations. the comparable amount at december 31, 2013, was $2.5 billion. this increase was primarily attributable to lower discount rates, which were partially offset by investment returns. we expect to contribute $0.5 billion to our other pension plans in 2015, as compared to $0.7 billion in both 2014 and 2013.
the unfunded liability for our principal retiree health and life plans was $9.9 billion and $9.0 billion at december 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. this increase was primarily attributable to the effects of lower discount rates (retiree health and life plans' discount rate decreased from 4.61% at december 31, 2013 to 3.89% at december 31, 2014) and new mortality assumptions, which were partially offset by an amendment to our post-65 retiree health coverage. we fund our retiree health benefits on a pay-as-you-go basis. we expect to contribute $0.5 billion to these plans in 2015 compared with actual contributions of $0.5 billion in both 2014 and 2013.
the funded status of our postretirement benefits plans and future effects on operating results depend primarily on economic conditions and investment performance. for additional information about funded status, components of earnings effects and actuarial assumptions, see note 12 to the consolidated financial statements in this form 10-k report.
income taxes income taxes have a significant effect on our net earnings. as a global commercial enterprise, our tax rates are affected by many factors, including our global mix of earnings, the extent to which those global earnings are indefinitely reinvested outside the united states, legislation, acquisitions, dispositions and tax characteristics of our income. our tax rates are also affected by tax incentives introduced in the u.s. and other countries in furtherance of policies to encourage and support certain types of activity. our tax returns are routinely audited and settlements of issues raised in these audits sometimes affect our tax provisions.
md&amp;a   other consolidated information
ge and gecc file a consolidated u.s. federal income tax return. this enables ge to use gecc tax deductions and credits to reduce the tax that otherwise would have been payable by ge. the gecc effective tax rate for each period reflects the benefit of these tax reductions in the consolidated return. ge makes cash payments to gecc for these tax reductions at the time ge's tax payments are due.
   the increase in the consolidated provision for income taxes was attributable in part to decreased benefits from lower-taxed global operations including the absence of the 2013 benefits related to the sale of 68.5% of our swiss consumer finance bank, cembra money bank ag (cembra), through an ipo, partially offset by the benefits from the 2014 tax efficient disposition of gemb-nordic.
   the income tax provision also increased due to the non-repeat of the favorable resolution of audit matters in 2013.
   the decrease in the consolidated provision for income taxes was primarily attributable to an increase in tax benefits on lower-taxed global operations, including the tax benefit on the sale of a portion of cembra.
   the income tax provision was also lower due to favorable resolution of audit matters and lower income taxed at rates above the average tax rate.
   these decreases were partially offset by the absence of the 2012 benefit attributable to the high tax basis in the entity sold in the business property disposition.
on january 2, 2013, the american taxpayer relief act of 2012 was enacted and the law extended several provisions, including a two-year extension of the u.s. tax provision deferring tax on active financial services income and certain u.s. business credits, retroactive to january 1, 2012. under accounting rules, a tax law change is taken into account in calculating the income tax provision in the period enacted. because the extension was enacted into law in 2013, tax expense in 2013 reflected retroactive extension of the previously expired provisions.

indefinitely reinvested outside the u.s. and are not subject to current u.s. income tax. the rate of tax on our indefinitely reinvested non-u.s. earnings is below the 35% u.s. statutory rate because we have significant business operations subject to tax in countries where the tax on that income is lower than the u.s. statutory rate and because ge funds the majority of its non-u.s. operations through foreign companies that are subject to low foreign taxes.
the most significant portion of these benefits depends on the provision of u.s. law deferring the tax on active financial services income, which, as discussed below, is subject to expiration. a substantial portion of the remaining benefit related to business operations subject to tax in countries where the tax on that income is lower than the u.s. statutory rate is derived from our gecas aircraft leasing operations located in ireland. no other operation in any one country accounts for a material portion of the remaining balance of the benefit.
we expect our ability to benefit from non-u.s. income taxed at less than the u.s. rate to continue, subject to changes in u.s. or foreign law, including the expiration of the u.s. tax law provision deferring tax on active financial services income, as discussed in note 14 to the consolidated financial statements in this form 10-k report. in addition, since this benefit depends on management's intention to indefinitely reinvest amounts outside the u.s., our tax provision will increase to the extent we no longer indefinitely reinvest foreign earnings.

2014 - 2013 commentary our benefits from lower-taxed global operations decreased in 2014 principally because of the absence of the 2013 benefits, previously discussed, on the sale of a portion of cembra, lower benefits from the realization of prior-year losses and from the resolution of internal revenue service (irs) audits, partially offset by larger benefits from other indefinitely reinvested earnings including from the 2014 disposition of gemb-nordic.
2013 - 2012 commentary our benefits from lower-taxed global operations increased in 2013 principally because of the realization of benefits related to the sale of a portion of cembra, the realization of benefits for prior-year losses, and the resolution of irs audits.
other information to the extent global interest rates and non-u.s. operating income increase, we would expect tax benefits to increase, subject to management's intention to indefinitely reinvest those earnings. included in 2014 is the benefit from the indefinite reinvestment of the eligible earnings from the sale of gemb-nordic. included in 2013 is the benefit from the indefinite reinvestment of the eligible earnings from the sale of a portion of cembra.

associated income taxes differ for ge and for gecc; therefore, a separate analysis of each is presented in the paragraphs that follow.
we believe that the ge effective tax rate and provision for income taxes are best analyzed in relation to ge earnings before income taxes excluding the gecc net earnings from continuing operations, as ge tax expense does not include taxes on gecc earnings. for further information on this calculation, see the "supplemental information" section within the md&a of this form 10-k.
ge etr, excluding gecc earnings*   ge provision (benefit) for income taxes
   the ge provision for income taxes decreased in 2014 primarily because of increased benefits from lower taxed global operations ($0.8 billion).
   that decrease was partially offset by the decrease in the benefit of audit resolutions ($0.3 billion) shown below, an increase in income taxed at rates above the average tax rate ($0.3 billion), and the non-repeat of the 2013 benefit from the enactment of the extension of certain u.s. business credits ($0.1 billion), disclosed above.
   the ge provision for income taxes decreased in 2013 primarily because of the benefit of audit resolutions ($0.2 billion) shown below.
resolution of audit matters reduced the ge provision for income taxes by $0.1 billion, $0.4 billion and $0.1 billion in 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. the effects of such resolutions are included in the following captions in note 14 to the consolidated financial statements in this form 10-k report.

   the increase in gecc provision for income taxes of $1.1 billion was primarily attributable to the absence of the significant tax benefit related to the 2013 sale of a portion of cembra ($1.0 billion).
   the income tax provision also increased due to decreased benefits from lower-taxed global operations including the absence of the 2013 benefits from enactment of the extension of the u.s. tax provision deferring tax on active financial services income ($0.6 billion).
   the items increasing tax expense were partially offset by the benefits from the tax efficient disposition of gemb-nordic ($0.3 billion), which is reported in the caption "tax on global activities including exports" in the effective tax rate reconciliation in note 14 to the consolidated financial statements in this form 10-k report.
   the decrease in gecc provision for income taxes of $1.5 billion was primarily attributable to increased benefits from lower-taxed global operations ($1.7 billion), including the significant tax benefit related to the sale of a portion of cembra ($1.0 billion), and the 2013 tax benefits related to the extension of the u.s. tax provision deferring tax on active financial services income ($0.3 billion).
   the income tax provision also lower due to benefit from the resolution of the irs audit of the 2008-2009 tax years and items for other years ($0.1 billion), which is reported partially in the caption "tax on global activities including exports" and partially in the caption "all other-net" in the effective tax rate reconciliation in note 14 to the consolidated financial statements in this form 10-k report.

geographic data our global activities span all geographic regions and primarily encompass manufacturing for local and export markets, import and sale of products produced in other regions, leasing of aircraft, sourcing for our plants domiciled in other global regions and provision of financial services within these regional economies. thus, when countries or regions experience currency and/or economic stress, we often have increased exposure to certain risks, but also often have new opportunities that include, among other things, expansion of industrial and financial services activities through purchases of companies or assets at reduced prices and lower u.s. debt financing costs.
financial results of our non-u.s. activities reported in u.s. dollars are affected by currency exchange. we use a number of techniques to manage the effects of currency exchange, including selective borrowings in local currencies and selective hedging of significant cross-currency transactions. such principal currencies are the euro, the pound sterling, the canadian dollar, the japanese yen, the australian dollar and the brazilian real.
revenues revenues are classified according to the region to which products and services are sold. for purposes of this analysis, the u.s. is presented separately from the remainder of the americas.

ge, excluding gecc, non-u.s. revenues the increase in ge non-u.s. revenues, excluding gecc, in 2014 was primarily due to increases in growth markets of 15% in middle east, north africa and turkey (menat), 29% in sub-sahara, and 7% in latin america, partially offset by a decrease of 18% in australia & new zealand (anz).
the increase in 2013 was primarily due to increases in growth markets of 72% in algeria, 38% in sub-sahara and 7% in china offset by a decrease of 9% in europe. these revenues as a percentage of ge total revenues, excluding gecc, were 58% in both 2014 and 2013, compared with 57% in 2012.

the effects of currency fluctuations on reported results were as follows:
   decreased revenues by $0.3 billion in 2013, primarily driven by the japanese yen ($0.3 billion) and brazilian real ($0.2 billion), partially offset by the euro ($0.4 billion).
the effects of foreign currency fluctuations on earnings were minimal, with no single currency having a significant impact.
gecc non-u.s. revenues the decreases in gecc non-u.s. revenues in 2014 and 2013 were primarily a result of decreases in asia and europe, respectively. non-u.s. revenues as a percentage of total revenues were 39% in 2014, and 42% in both 2013 and 2012.
the effects of currency fluctuations on reported results were as follows:
the effects of foreign currency fluctuations on earnings were minimal, with no single currency having a significant impact.
the decrease in total assets of non-u.s. operations on a continuing basis reflected declines in europe, asia and americas due to the strengthening of the u.s. dollar against most major currencies, primarily the euro, the pound sterling and the japanese yen and dispositions at various businesses.
md&amp;a   statement of financial position
statement of financial position because ge and gecc share certain significant elements of their statements of financial position, the following discussion addresses significant captions in the consolidated statement. within the following discussions, however, we distinguish between ge and gecc activities in order to permit meaningful analysis of each individual consolidating statement.
major changes in our financial position during 2014
-   $15.2 billion of ge cash flows from operating activities
-   $0.6 billion from business dispositions
-   $(2.2) billion used to buyback treasury stock under our share repurchase program
-   $(2.1) billion used to acquire businesses
for additional information on ge cash, see the statement of cash flows section within the md&a of this form 10-k.
   investment securities increased $3.9 billion reflecting purchases of u.s. government and federal agency securities at synchrony financial and higher net unrealized gains in u.s. corporate and state and municipal securities driven by lower interest rates in the u.s. see note 3 to the consolidated financial statements in this form 10-k report.
-   pre-tax, other-than-temporary impairment losses (otti) recognized in earnings were $0.4 billion and $0.8 billion in 2014 and 2013, respectively. the 2014 amount primarily relates to other-than temporary impairments on equity securities, corporate debt securities, commercial and residential mortgage-backed securities (cmbs), residential mortgage-backed securities (rmbs) and asset-backed securities (abs). the 2013 amount primarily related to credit losses on corporate debt securities and other-than-temporary impairment on equity securities.
   gecc financing receivables-net decreased $16.0 billion. see the following financing receivables section for additional information.
   ge all other assets increased $1.0 billion primarily due to an increase in contract costs and estimated earnings at our power &amp; water and aviation businesses of $1.5 billion, partially offset by the reclassification of appliances and signaling balances to assets of businesses held for sale of $0.5 billion.
   gecc all other assets decreased $3.5 billion as a result of sales of certain real estate investments of $3.4 billion, a net decrease in equity and cost method investments of $1.5 billion and a net decrease in advances to suppliers of $0.9 billion, partially offset by a net increase in assets held for sale of $2.3 billion.
   deferred income taxes increased $2.3 billion primarily due to an increased deferred tax asset as a result of the increased postretirement benefit liabilities, partially offset by the impact of the adoption of a new accounting standard, which reduced our deferred tax asset balance. see note 1 to the consolidated financial statements in this form 10-k report.
   ge borrowings increased $3.0 billion. ge completed issuances of $3.0 billion of senior unsecured debt with maturities up to 30 years and reclassified $2.0 billion of long-term borrowings to short-term borrowings during the year.
   gecc borrowings decreased $31.0 billion. gecc had net repayments on these borrowings of $24.9 billion during the year, along with a net $9.1 billion reduction in the balances driven by the strengthening of the u.s. dollar against all major currencies.
   bank deposits increased $9.5 billion primarily due to increases at our banks of $12.6 billion, including synchrony financial of $9.2 billion, partially offset by the reclassification of budapest bank deposits to liabilities of businesses held for sale of $1.9 billion.
md&amp;a   statement of financial position
   ge all other liabilities increased $13.7 billion primarily due to an increase in the postretirement benefit liabilities of $13.9 billion primarily due to lower discount rate and new mortality assumptions. the impact of these changes was the primary driver for the decrease in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) - benefit plans of $7.3 billion. see notes 12 and 15 to the consolidated financial statements in this form 10-k report.
   accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) - currency translation adjustments decreased $2.6 billion driven by the strengthening u.s. dollar against all major currencies at december 31, 2014 compared with december 31, 2013. this decrease coincides with general decreases in balances of our major asset and liability categories, including: financing receivables; property, plant and equipment; goodwill; intangible assets; short-term borrowings and long-term borrowings.
financing receivables financing receivables is our largest category of assets and represents one of our primary sources of revenues. our portfolio of financing receivables is diverse and not directly comparable to major u.s. banks. a discussion of the quality of certain elements of the financing receivables portfolio follows.
our commercial portfolio primarily comprises senior secured positions with comparatively low loss history. the secured receivables in this portfolio are collateralized by a variety of asset classes, which for our cll business primarily include: industrial-related facilities and equipment, vehicles, corporate aircraft, and equipment used in many industries, including the construction, manufacturing, transportation, media, communications, entertainment, and healthcare industries. the portfolios in our real estate, gecas and energy financial services businesses are collateralized by commercial real estate, commercial aircraft and operating assets in the global energy and water industries, respectively. we are in a secured position for substantially all of our commercial portfolio.
our consumer portfolio is composed primarily of non-u.s. mortgage, sales finance, auto and personal loans in various european and asian countries and u.s. consumer credit card and sales finance receivables.
during the first quarter of 2014, we combined our cll europe and cll asia portfolios into cll international and we transferred our cll other portfolio to the cll americas portfolio. during the fourth quarter of 2014, we combined our consumer non-u.s. auto portfolio into our consumer non-u.s. installment and revolving credit portfolio. prior-period amounts were reclassified to conform to the current-period presentation.
our risk management process includes standards and policies for reviewing major risk exposures and concentrations, and evaluates relevant data either for individual loans or financing leases, or on a portfolio basis, as appropriate.
loans acquired in a business acquisition are recorded at fair value, which incorporates our estimate at the acquisition date of the credit losses over the remaining life of the portfolio. as a result, the allowance for losses is not carried over at acquisition. this may have the effect of causing lower reserve coverage ratios for those portfolios.
for purposes of the discussion that follows, "delinquent" receivables are those that are 30 days or more past due based on their contractual terms. loans purchased at a discount are initially recorded at fair value and accrete interest income over the estimated life of the loan based on reasonably estimable cash flows even if the underlying loans are contractually delinquent at acquisition. "nonaccrual" financing receivables are those on which we have stopped accruing interest. we stop accruing interest at the earlier of the time at which collection of an account becomes doubtful or the account becomes 90 days past due, with the exception of consumer credit card accounts, for which we continue to accrue interest until the accounts are written off in the period that the account becomes 180 days past due. recently restructured financing receivables are not considered delinquent when payments are brought current according to the restructured terms, but may remain classified as nonaccrual until there has been a period of satisfactory payment performance by the borrower and future payments are reasonably assured of collection.

allowance for losses as a percent of total financing receivables                                                         2.1                  2.0
(a)   of our $5.2 billion of nonaccrual loans at december 31, 2014, $2.7 billion are currently paying in accordance with the contractual terms.
financing receivables, before allowance for losses, decreased $16.1 billion from december 31, 2013, primarily as a result of the stronger u.s. dollar ($7.7 billion), the reclassification of budapest bank to assets of businesses held for sale and the sale of gemb-nordic ($5.3 billion), write-offs ($5.1 billion) and transfers to assets held for sale and equipment leased to others ($3.1 billion), partially offset by originations exceeding collections (which includes sales) ($5.7 billion).
nonaccrual receivables decreased $2.7 billion from december 31, 2013 primarily due to payoffs, collections and write-offs in our real estate and cll portfolios and asset sales and resolutions in consumer, primarily in our u.k. portfolio.
allowance for losses decreased $0.1 billion from december 31, 2013. allowance for losses decreased at commercial and real estate, primarily as a result of write-offs and resolutions. these decreases were offset by increases at consumer, primarily as a result of an increase in the projected net write-offs over the next 12 months in the u.s. consistent with the growth of related financing receivables, partially offset by the reclassification of budapest bank to assets of business held for sale and the sale of gemb-nordic. the allowance for losses as a percent of total financing receivables increased from 2.0% at december 31, 2013 to 2.1% at december 31, 2014 reflecting decreases in both the allowance for losses and the overall financing receivables balance as discussed above.

md&amp;a   financial resources and liquidity
financial resources and liquidity liquidity and borrowings we maintain a strong focus on liquidity. at both ge and gecc we manage our liquidity to help provide access to sufficient funding to meet our business needs and financial obligations throughout business cycles.
our liquidity and borrowing plans for ge and gecc are established within the context of our annual financial and strategic planning processes. at ge, our liquidity and funding plans take into account the liquidity necessary to fund our operating commitments, which include primarily purchase obligations for inventory and equipment, payroll and general expenses (including pension funding). we also take into account our capital allocation and growth objectives, including paying dividends, repurchasing shares, investing in research and development and acquiring industrial businesses. at ge, we rely primarily on cash generated through our operating activities, any dividend payments from gecc, and also have historically maintained a commercial paper program that we regularly use to fund operations in the u.s., principally within fiscal quarters.
gecc's liquidity position is targeted to meet its obligations under both normal and stressed conditions. gecc establishes a funding plan annually that is based on the projected asset size and cash needs of the company, which, over the past few years, has incorporated our strategy to reduce our ending net investment in ge capital. gecc relies on a diversified source of funding, including the unsecured term debt markets, the global commercial paper markets, deposits, secured funding, retail funding products, bank borrowings and securitizations to fund its balance sheet. we also rely on cash generated through collection of principal, interest and other payments on our existing portfolio of loans and leases to fund its operating and interest expense costs.
our 2015 gecc funding plan anticipates repayment of principal on outstanding short-term borrowings, including the current portion of long-term debt ($38.0 billion at december 31, 2014), through issuance of long-term debt and reissuance of commercial paper, cash on hand, dispositions, asset sales, and deposits and other alternative sources of funding. long-term maturities and early redemptions were $41.3 billion in 2014. interest on borrowings is primarily repaid through interest earned on existing financing receivables. during 2014, gecc earned interest income on financing receivables of $18.7 billion, which more than offset interest and other financial charges of $8.4 billion.
we maintain a detailed liquidity policy for gecc that requires gecc to maintain a contingency funding plan. the liquidity policy defines gecc's liquidity risk tolerance under different stress scenarios based on its liquidity sources and also establishes procedures to escalate potential issues. we actively monitor gecc's access to funding markets and its liquidity profile through tracking external indicators and testing various stress scenarios. the contingency funding plan provides a framework for handling market disruptions and establishes escalation procedures in the event that such events or circumstances arise.
md&amp;a   financial resources and liquidity
liquidity sources we maintain liquidity sources that consist of cash and equivalents of $90.2 billion, committed unused credit lines of $44.9 billion and high-quality, liquid investments of $1.2 billion.
(a)   at december 31, 2014, $2.8 billion of ge cash and equivalents was held in countries with currency controls that may restrict the transfer of funds to the u.s. or limit our ability to transfer funds to the u.s. without incurring substantial costs. these funds are available to fund operations and growth in these countries and we do not currently anticipate a need to transfer these funds to the u.s.
(b)   at december 31, 2014, gecc cash and equivalents of about $20.0 billion were in regulated banks and insurance entities and were subject to regulatory restrictions.
(c)   of this amount at december 31, 2014, $12.2 billion was considered indefinitely reinvested. indefinitely reinvested cash held outside of the u.s. is available to fund operations and other growth of non-u.s. subsidiaries; it is also available to fund our needs in the u.s. on a short-term basis through short-term loans, without being subject to u.s. tax. under the internal revenue code, these loans are permitted to be outstanding for 30 days or less and the total of all such loans is required to be outstanding for less than 60 days during the year. if we were to repatriate indefinitely reinvested cash held outside the u.s., we would be subject to additional u.s. income taxes and foreign withholding taxes.
(b)   total committed unused credit lines were extended to us by 50 financial institutions. gecc can borrow up to $44.4 billion under these credit lines. ge can borrow up to $14.2 billion under certain of these credit lines.
funding plan we reduced our ge capital eni, excluding liquidity, to $363 billion at december 31, 2014.
during 2014, ge completed issuances of $3.0 billion of senior unsecured debt with maturities up to 30 years. gecc completed issuances of $9.5 billion of senior unsecured debt (excluding securitizations described below) with maturities up to 40 years (and subsequent to december 31, 2014 through february 13, 2015, an additional $8.1 billion). in addition, in august 2014, synchrony financial completed issuances of $3.6 billion of senior unsecured debt with maturities up to 10 years and $8.0 billion of unsecured term loans maturing in 2019, and in october 2014 completed issuances of $0.8 billion unsecured term loans maturing in 2019 under the new bank term loan facility with third party lenders. subsequent to december 31, 2014 through february 13, 2015, synchrony financial issued an additional $1.0 billion of senior unsecured debt maturing in 2020.
(in billions)                                                                       ge             gecc average commercial paper borrowings during the fourth quarter of 2014               $8.1           $25.0
maximum commercial paper borrowings outstanding during the fourth quarter of 2014   10.6           25.1
md&amp;a   financial resources and liquidity
we securitize financial assets as an alternative source of funding. during 2014, we completed $11.1 billion of non-recourse issuances and $11.3 billion of non-recourse borrowings matured. at december 31, 2014, consolidated non-recourse securitization borrowings were $29.9 billion.
we have nine deposit-taking banks outside of the u.s. and two deposit-taking banks in the u.s. - synchrony bank (formerly ge capital retail bank), a federal savings bank (fsb), and ge capital bank, an industrial bank (ib). the fsb and ib currently issue certificates of deposit (cds) in maturity terms up to 10 years.
funding secured by real estate, aircraft and other collateral                     6.0
ge interest plus notes (including $0.1 billion of current long-term debt)         5.6
as a matter of general practice, we routinely evaluate the economic impact of calling debt instruments where gecc has the right to exercise a call. in determining whether to call debt, we consider the economic benefit to gecc of calling debt, the effect of calling debt on gecc's liquidity profile and other factors. during 2014, we called $0.4 billion of long-term debt.
exchange rate and interest rate risks exchange rate and interest rate risks are managed with a variety of techniques, including match funding and selective use of derivatives. we use derivatives to mitigate or eliminate certain financial and market risks because we conduct business in diverse markets around the world and local funding is not always efficient. in addition, we use derivatives to adjust the debt we are issuing to match the fixed or floating nature of the assets we are originating. we apply strict policies to manage each of these risks, including prohibitions on speculative activities. following is an analysis of the potential effects of changes in interest rates and currency exchange rates using so-called "shock" tests that seek to model the effects of shifts in rates. such tests are inherently limited based on the assumptions used (described further below) and should not be viewed as a forecast; actual effects would depend on many variables, including market factors and the composition of the company's assets and liabilities at that time.
   it is our policy to minimize exposure to interest rate changes. we fund our financial investments using debt or a combination of debt and hedging instruments so that the interest rates of our borrowings match the expected interest rate profile on our assets. to test the effectiveness of our hedging actions, we assumed that, on january 1, 2015, interest rates decreased by 100 basis points across the yield curve (a "parallel shift" in that curve) and further assumed that the decrease remained in place for the next 12 months. based on the year-end 2014 portfolio and holding all other assumptions constant, we estimated that our consolidated net earnings for the next 12 months, starting in january 2015, would decline by less than $0.1 billion as a result of this parallel shift in the yield curve.
md&amp;a   financial resources and liquidity
   it is our policy to minimize currency exposures and to conduct operations either within functional currencies or using the protection of hedge strategies. we analyzed year-end 2014 consolidated currency exposures, including derivatives designated and effective as hedges, to identify assets and liabilities denominated in other than their relevant functional currencies. for such assets and liabilities, we then evaluated the effects of a 10% shift in exchange rates between those currencies and the u.s. dollar, holding all other assumptions constant. this analysis indicated that our 2015 consolidated net earnings would decline by less than $0.1 billion as a result of such a shift in exchange rates. this analysis excludes any translation impact from changes in exchange rates on our financial results.
debt and derivative instruments, guarantees and covenants credit ratings as of december 31, 2014, ge's and gecc's long-term unsecured debt ratings from standard and poor's ratings service (s&p) were aa+ with a stable outlook and their short-term funding ratings from s&p were a-1+. we are disclosing these ratings to enhance understanding of our sources of liquidity and the effects of our ratings on our costs of funds. although we currently do not expect a downgrade in the credit ratings, our ratings may be subject to a revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating organization, and each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating.
principal debt and derivative conditions certain of our derivative instruments can be terminated if specified credit ratings are not maintained and certain debt and derivatives agreements of other consolidated entities have provisions that are affected by these credit ratings.
fair values of our derivatives can change significantly from period to period based on, among other factors, market movements and changes in our positions. we manage counterparty credit risk (the risk that counterparties will default and not make payments to us according to the terms of our standard master agreements) on an individual counterparty basis. where we have agreed to netting of derivative exposures with a counterparty, we offset our exposures with that counterparty and apply the value of collateral posted to us to determine the net exposure. we actively monitor these net exposures against defined limits and take appropriate actions in response, including requiring additional collateral.
swap, forward and option contracts are executed under standard master agreements that typically contain mutual downgrade provisions that provide the ability of the counterparty to require termination if the long-term credit ratings of the applicable ge entity were to fall below a-/a3. in certain of these master agreements, the counterparty also has the ability to require termination if the short-term ratings of the applicable ge entity were to fall below a-1/p-1. the net derivative liability after consideration of netting arrangements, outstanding interest payments and collateral posted by us under these master agreements was estimated to be $0.5 billion at december 31, 2014. see note 22 to the consolidated financial statements in this form 10-k report.
other debt and derivative agreements of consolidated entities include trinity, which comprises two entities that hold investment securities, the majority of which are investment grade, and were funded by the issuance of guaranteed investment contracts (gics). these gics include conditions under which certain holders could require immediate repayment of their investment should the long-term credit ratings of gecc fall below aa-/aa3 or the short-term credit ratings fall below a-1+/p-1, and are reported in investment contracts, insurance liabilities and insurance annuity benefits. the trinity assets and liabilities are disclosed in note (a) on our statement of financial position in the consolidated financial statements of this form 10-k report. another consolidated entity also had issued gics where proceeds are loaned to gecc. these gics included conditions under which certain holders could require immediate repayment of their investment should the long-term credit ratings of gecc fall below aa-/aa3. these obligations are included in the caption "long-term borrowings" on our statement of financial position in the consolidated financial statements in this form 10-k report. these three consolidated entities ceased issuing gics in 2010.

ratio of earnings to fixed charges, income maintenance agreement and subordinated debentures ge provides implicit and explicit support to gecc through commitments, capital contributions and operating support. for example, and as discussed below, ge has committed to keep gecc's ratio of earnings to fixed charges above a minimum level. gecc's credit rating is higher than it would be on a stand-alone basis as a result of this financial support. gecc currently does not pay ge for this support.
under an agreement between ge and gecc, ge will make payments to gecc, constituting additions to pre-tax income under the agreement (which increases equity), to the extent necessary to cause the ratio of earnings to fixed charges of gecc and consolidated affiliates (determined on a consolidated basis) to be not less than 1.10:1 for the period, as a single aggregation, of each gecc fiscal year commencing with fiscal year 1991. gecc's ratio of earnings to fixed charges was 1.84:1 for 2014. no payment for 2014 was required pursuant to this agreement. on february 24, 2015, ge and gecc amended this agreement, effective beginning in 2015, to exclude non-cash charges attributable to goodwill and intangibles (which are excluded from regulatory capital calculations) for purposes of calculating gecc's ratio of earnings to fixed charges. the amended agreement is filed as exhibit 10(y) hereto and is hereby incorporated by reference.
in addition, in connection with certain subordinated debentures of gecc that may be classified as equity (hybrid debt), during events of default or interest deferral periods under such subordinated debentures, gecc has agreed not to declare or pay any dividends or distributions or make certain other payments with respect to its capital stock, and ge has agreed to promptly return any payments made to ge in violation of this agreement. there were $7.1 billion of such debentures outstanding at december 31, 2014. see note 10 to the consolidated financial statements in this form 10-k report.

statement of cash flows - overview from 2012 through 2014
consolidated cash flows we evaluate our cash flow performance by reviewing our industrial (non-financial services) businesses and financial services businesses separately. cash from operating activities (cfoa) is the principal source of cash generation for our industrial businesses. the industrial businesses also have liquidity available via the public capital markets. our financial services businesses use a variety of financial resources to meet our capital needs. cash for financial services businesses is primarily provided from the issuance of term debt and commercial paper in the public and private markets and deposits, as well as financing receivables collections, sales and securitizations.
ge cash flows operating cash flows            investing cash flows            financing cash flows
with respect to ge cfoa, we believe that it is useful to supplement our ge statement of cash flows and to examine in a broader context the business activities that provide and require cash.
the most significant source of cash in ge cfoa is customer-related activities, the largest of which is collecting cash resulting from product or services sales. see the intercompany transactions and eliminations section for information related to transactions between ge and gecc. the most significant operating use of cash is to pay our suppliers, employees, tax authorities and others for a wide range of material and services. dividends from gecc, including special dividends, represent the distribution of a portion of gecc retained earnings, and are distinct from cash from continuing operations within the financial services businesses. the amounts included in ge cfoa are the total dividends, including special dividends from excess capital.

2014-2013 commentary ge cash from operating activities increased $0.9 billion primarily due to the following:
   an increase of operating cash collections of $4.9 billion to $109.7 billion in 2014. this increase is consistent with comparable ge segment revenue increases from sales of goods and services and higher collections on current receivables. these increases were partially offset by a decrease in progress collections.
   this increase is partially offset by an increase of operating cash payments of $1.0 billion to $97.5 billion in 2014 consistent with cost and expense increases, which was partially offset by the non-recurrence of payments made in 2013, including nbcu llc deal-related tax payments, and payouts under our long-term incentive plan.
   further, gecc paid dividends totaling $3.0 billion and $6.0 billion to ge, including special dividends of $1.0 billion and $4.1 billion in 2014 and 2013, respectively.
ge cash used for investing activities was $5.9 billion in 2014, compared with cash from investing activities of $4.8 billion in 2013, a decrease of $10.7 billion primarily due to the following:
   2013 proceeds of $16.7 billion from the sale of our remaining 49% common equity interest in nbcu llc to comcast corporation.
   this was partially offset by lower business acquisition activity of $5.9 billion primarily driven by the 2014 acquisitions of thermo fisher for $1.1 billion, cameron's reciprocating compression division for $0.6 billion, and api for $0.3 billion compared with the 2013 acquisitions of avio for $4.4 billion and lufkin for $3.3 billion.
   a decrease in net repurchases of ge shares for treasury in accordance with our share repurchase program of $8.1 billion.
   the 2013 repayment of $5.0 billion of ge unsecured notes compared with the issuance of $3.0 billion of unsecured notes in 2014.
   these decreases were partially offset by an increase in the dividends paid to shareowners of $1.0 billion.
2013-2012 commentary ge cash from operating activities decreased $3.5 billion primarily due to the following:
   a decrease of operating cash collections of $0.6 billion to $104.8 billion in 2013. the decrease is consistent with a decrease in collections on long-term contracts and increases in current receivables, partially offset by increased progress collections and improved segment revenues.
   ge operating cash payments increased by $2.5 billion to $96.5 billion in 2013. the increase is consistent with nbcu deal-related tax payments and payouts under our long-term incentive plan, partially offset by the non-recurrence of principal pension plan funding in 2012.
   additionally, gecc paid dividends totaling $6.0 billion and $6.4 billion to ge, including special dividends of $4.1 billion and $4.5 billion in 2013 and 2012, respectively.
ge cash from investing activities of $4.8 billion in 2013, compared with cash used for investing activities of $5.4 billion in 2012, an increase of $10.2 billion primarily due to the following:
   2013 proceeds of $16.7 billion from the sale of our remaining 49% common equity interest in nbcu llc to comcast.
   this was partially offset by the 2013 acquisitions of avio for $4.4 billion and lufkin for $3.3 billion.
   the 2013 repayment of $5.0 billion of ge unsecured notes compared with an issuance of $7.0 billion of unsecured notes in 2012.
   an increase in net repurchases of ge shares for treasury in accordance with our share repurchase program of $5.1 billion.

2013-2012 commentary gecc cash from operating activities decreased $1.9 billion primarily due to the following:
   a decrease in net cash collateral activity with counterparties on derivative contracts of $5.2 billion.
   this decrease was partially offset by an increase in net tax activity of $2.5 billion driven by net tax refunds in 2013, compared with net tax payments in 2012 and increased cash generated from higher net earnings from continuing operations of $0.9 billion.
   higher proceeds from sales of real estate properties of $7.3 billion.
   the 2013 acquisition of metlife bank, n.a., resulting in net cash provided of $6.4 billion.
   lower net loan repayments from our equity method investments of $4.9 billion.
   lower collections (which includes sales) exceeding originations of financing receivables of $1.9 billion.
   lower net repayments of borrowings, consisting primarily of net reductions in long-term borrowings and commercial paper of $24.0 billion.
   lower redemptions of guaranteed investment contracts of $2.3 billion.
   beginning in the second quarter of 2012, gecc restarted its dividend to ge. gecc paid dividends totaling $6.0 billion and $6.4 billion to ge, including special dividends of $4.1 billion and $4.5 billion in 2013 and 2012, respectively.
   these decreases were partially offset by lower proceeds from the issuance of preferred stock of $3.0 billion.
intercompany transactions and eliminations effects of transactions between related companies are made on an arms-length basis, are eliminated and consist primarily of gecc dividends to ge; ge customer receivables sold to gecc; gecc services for trade receivables management and material procurement; buildings and equipment (including automobiles) leased between ge and gecc; information technology (it) and other services sold to gecc by ge; aircraft engines manufactured by ge that are installed on aircraft purchased by gecc from third-party producers for lease to others; and various investments, loans and allocations of ge corporate overhead costs.
ge sells customer receivables to gecc in part to fund the growth of our industrial businesses. these transactions can result in cash generation or cash use. during any given period, ge receives cash from the sale of receivables to gecc. it also foregoes collection of cash on receivables sold. the incremental amount of cash received from sales of receivables in excess of the cash ge would have otherwise collected had those receivables not been sold, represents the cash generated or used in the period relating to this activity. the incremental cash generated in ge cfoa from selling these receivables to gecc increased ge's cfoa by $2.2 billion, $0.1 billion and $1.9 billion in 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively.

(a)   financing receivable amounts are classified based on the location or nature of the related obligor.
(b)   substantially all relates to non-sovereign obligors. included residential mortgage loans of approximately $24.7 billion before consideration of purchased credit protection. we have third-party mortgage insurance for less than 10% of these residential mortgage loans, which were primarily originated in france and the u.k.
(c)   investments and derivatives are classified based on the location of the parent of the obligor or issuer.
(d)   included $0.6 billion related to financial institutions, $0.2 billion related to non-financial institutions and $1.3 billion related to sovereign issuers. sovereign issuances totaled $0.1 billion related to italy. we held no investments issued by sovereign entities in the other focus countries.
(f)   net of cash collateral; entire amount is non-sovereign.
(g)   these assets are held under long-term investment and operating strategies, and our elto strategies contemplate an ability to redeploy assets under lease should default by the lessee occur. the values of these assets could be subject to decline or impairment in the current environment.
(h)   excluded $33.7 billion of cash and equivalents, which is composed of $25.3 billion of cash on short-term placement with highly rated global financial institutions based in europe, sovereign central banks and agencies or supranational entities, of which $1.1 billion is in focus countries, and $8.4 billion of cash and equivalents placed with highly rated european financial institutions on a short-term basis, secured by u.s. treasury securities ($4.1 billion) and sovereign bonds of non-focus countries ($4.3 billion), where the value of our collateral exceeds the amount of our cash exposure.
(i)   rest of europe included $1.9 billion and $0.1 billion of exposure for russia and ukraine, respectively, substantially all elto and financing receivables related to commercial aircraft in our gecas portfolio.
(k)   includes ordinary course of business lending commitments, commercial and consumer unused revolving credit lines, inventory financing arrangements and investment commitments.
we manage counterparty exposure, including credit risk, on an individual counterparty basis. we place defined risk limits around each obligor and review our risk exposure on the basis of both the primary and parent obligor, as well as the issuer of securities held as collateral. these limits are adjusted on an ongoing basis based on our continuing assessment of the credit risk of the obligor or issuer. in setting our counterparty risk limits, we focus on high-quality credits and diversification through spread of risk in an effort to actively manage our overall exposure. we actively monitor each exposure against these limits and take appropriate action when we believe that risk limits have been exceeded or there are excess risk concentrations. our collateral position and ability to work out problem accounts have historically mitigated our actual loss experience. delinquency experience has been relatively stable in our european commercial and consumer platforms in the aggregate, and we actively monitor and take action to reduce exposures where appropriate. uncertainties surrounding european markets could have an impact on the judgments and estimates used in determining the carrying value of these assets.
venezuela our activities related to venezuela generated revenues of approximately $0.6 billion in 2014, consisting of both exports to and operations within the country. substantially all of these revenues are denominated in u.s. dollars and euro but we also transact in bolivars for certain businesses.
determining the appropriate exchange rate for remeasurement of bolivar-denominated monetary assets and liabilities into u.s. dollars continues to be subject to uncertainty. during 2014, venezuela operated three different exchange mechanisms: cencoex (the official exchange mechanism), sicad1 and sicad2. in 2014, we became eligible to access the sicad1 exchange mechanism to settle certain future transactions, including the payment of dividends. in light of this development, we concluded the sicad1 rate is the most appropriate for measuring a majority of our monetary assets and recorded pre-tax charges of $66 million during 2014. we continued to access cencoex for certain of our qualifying imports and measure the associated bolivar-denominated net monetary assets at that rate. in february 2015, the venezuelan government eliminated sicad2 and introduced a new open market exchange mechanism (simadi). we will reevaluate the determination of the appropriate exchange rates for remeasurement in light of current developments, including the potential for a devaluation of the bolivar. net monetary assets subject to remeasurement were approximately $78 million at december 31, 2014, including approximately $19 million in bolivar-denominated cash and cash equivalents and approximately $41 million related to a non-consolidated investment.
we also continue to monitor other effects of the economic and operating environment in venezuela on our activities, including the impact on non-bolivar credit exposures and recoverable amounts of bolivar denominated non-monetary assets.
oil & gas industry the recent sharp decline in oil prices and the prospect of lower oil prices has mixed implications for the industries and countries in which we compete. in general, lower oil prices are expected to stimulate growth in oil importing countries while causing negative economic effects in many energy-exporting countries. certain parts of our oil & gas business will experience declines in orders and pricing pressures, while we expect that other parts will be largely unaffected. in response to this uncertain industry outlook, we have implemented cost actions and increased our focus on productivity. we expect that low oil prices will benefit our other businesses through lower direct material and other variable costs as well as through the expected stimulus-effect on growth in the u.s. and in other economies that rely on energy imports, including europe, japan, and india.
employee matters approximately 16,400 ge manufacturing and service employees in the united states are represented for collective bargaining purposes by one of 11 unions (approximately 82 different locals within such unions). a majority of such employees are represented by union locals that are affiliated with the iue-cwa, the industrial division of the communication workers of america, afl-cio, clc. during 2011, we negotiated four-year agreements with most of our u.s. unions. most of these contracts will terminate in june 2015, and we will be engaged in negotiations to attain new agreements. while results of 2015 union negotiations cannot be predicted, our recent past negotiations have resulted in agreements that increased costs.
critical accounting estimates accounting estimates and assumptions discussed in this section are those that we consider to be the most critical to an understanding of our financial statements because they involve significant judgments and uncertainties. many of these estimates include determining fair value. all of these estimates reflect our best judgment about current, and for some estimates future, economic and market conditions and their potential effects based on information available as of the date of these financial statements. if these conditions change from those expected, it is reasonably possible that the judgments and estimates described below could change, which may result in future impairments of investment securities, goodwill, intangibles and long-lived assets, incremental losses on financing receivables, increases in reserves for contingencies, establishment of valuation allowances on deferred tax assets and increased tax liabilities, among other effects. also see note 1 to the consolidated financial statements in this form 10-k report, which discusses our most significant accounting policies.
losses on financing receivables losses on financing receivables are recognized when they are incurred, which requires us to make our best estimate of probable losses inherent in the portfolio. the method for calculating the best estimate of losses depends on the size, type and risk characteristics of the related financing receivable. such an estimate requires consideration of historical loss experience, adjusted for current conditions, and judgments about the probable effects of relevant observable data, including present economic conditions such as delinquency rates, financial health of specific customers and market sectors, collateral values (including housing price indices, as applicable), and the present and expected future levels of interest rates. the underlying assumptions, estimates and assessments we use to provide for losses are updated to reflect our view of current conditions and are subject to the regulatory examination process, which can result in changes to our assumptions. changes in such estimates can significantly affect the allowance and provision for losses. it is possible that we will experience credit losses that are different from our current estimates. write-offs in both our consumer and commercial portfolios can also reflect both losses that are incurred subsequent to the beginning of a fiscal year and information becoming available during that fiscal year that may identify further deterioration on exposures existing prior to the beginning of that fiscal year, and for which reserves could not have been previously recognized. our risk management process includes standards and policies for reviewing major risk exposures and concentrations, and evaluates relevant data either for individual loans or financing leases, or on a portfolio basis, as appropriate.
further information is provided in the global risk management section and statement of financial position - financing receivables section within the md&a of this form 10-k, the asset impairment section that follows and in notes 1 and 6 to the consolidated financial statements in this form 10-k report.
revenue recognition on long-term product services agreements revenue recognition on long-term product services agreements requires estimates of profits over the multiple-year terms of such agreements, considering factors such as the frequency and extent of future monitoring, maintenance and overhaul events; the amount of personnel, spare parts and other resources required to perform the services; and future billing rate, cost changes and customers' utilization of assets. we routinely review estimates under product services agreements and regularly revise them to adjust for changes in outlook.
we also regularly assess customer credit risk inherent in the carrying amounts of receivables and contract costs and estimated earnings, including the risk that contractual penalties may not be sufficient to offset our accumulated investment in the event of customer termination. we gain insight into future utilization and cost trends, as well as credit risk, through our knowledge of the installed base of equipment and the close interaction with our customers that comes with supplying critical services and parts over extended periods. revisions may affect a product services agreement's total estimated profitability resulting in an adjustment of earnings; such adjustments increased earnings by $1.0 billion, $0.3 billion and $0.4 billion in 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. we provide for probable losses when they become evident.
further information is provided in notes 1 and 9 to the consolidated financial statements in this form 10-k report.
asset impairment asset impairment assessment involves various estimates and assumptions as follows:
investments we regularly review investment securities for impairment using both quantitative and qualitative criteria. for debt securities, if we do not intend to sell the security and it is not more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery of our amortized cost, we evaluate other qualitative criteria to determine whether a credit loss exists, such as the financial health of and specific prospects for the issuer, including whether the issuer is in compliance with the terms and covenants of the security. quantitative criteria include determining whether there has been an adverse change in expected future cash flows. for equity securities, our criteria include the length of time and magnitude of the amount that each security is in an unrealized loss position. our other-than-temporary impairment reviews involve our finance, risk and asset management functions as well as the portfolio management and research capabilities of our internal and third-party asset managers. see note 1 to the consolidated financial statements in this form 10-k report, which discusses the determination of fair value of investment securities.
further information about actual and potential impairment losses is provided in notes 1, 3 and 9 to the consolidated financial statements in this form 10-k report.
long-lived assets we review long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the related carrying amounts may not be recoverable. determining whether an impairment has occurred typically requires various estimates and assumptions, including determining which undiscounted cash flows are directly related to the potentially impaired asset, the useful life over which cash flows will occur, their amount, and the asset's residual value, if any. in turn, measurement of an impairment loss requires a determination of fair value, which is based on the best information available. we derive the required undiscounted cash flow estimates from our historical experience and our internal business plans. to determine fair value, we use quoted market prices when available, our internal cash flow estimates discounted at an appropriate interest rate and independent appraisals, as appropriate.
market values (obtained from third parties) of similar type and age aircraft, which are adjusted for the attributes of the specific aircraft under lease.
we recognized impairment losses on our operating lease portfolio of commercial aircraft of $0.4 billion and $0.7 billion in 2014 and 2013, respectively. impairment losses in 2014 primarily related to regional jets and older technology aircraft. the average age of aircraft we impaired in 2014 was 17 years compared with 7 years for our total fleet. provisions for losses on financing receivables related to commercial aircraft were an insignificant amount for both 2014 and 2013.
further information on impairment losses and our exposure to the commercial aviation industry is provided in notes 7 and 24 to the consolidated financial statements in this form 10-k report.
real estate we review the estimated value of our commercial real estate investments annually, or more frequently as conditions warrant. the cash flow estimates used for both estimating value and the recoverability analysis are inherently judgmental, and reflect current and projected lease profiles, available industry information about expected trends in rental, occupancy and capitalization rates and expected business plans, which include our estimated holding period for the asset. our portfolio is diversified, both geographically and by asset type. however, the global real estate market is subject to periodic cycles that can cause significant fluctuations in market values. based on the most recent valuation estimates available, the carrying value of our real estate investments exceeded their estimated value by about $1.2 billion. this amount is subject to variation dependent on the assumptions described above, changes in economic and market conditions and composition of our portfolio, including sales. commercial real estate valuations have shown signs of improved stability and liquidity in certain markets, primarily in the u.s. and japan; however, the pace of improvement varies significantly by asset class and market. accordingly, there continues to be risk and uncertainty surrounding commercial real estate values. declines in the estimated value of real estate below carrying amount result in impairment losses when the aggregate undiscounted cash flow estimates used in the estimated value measurement are below the carrying amount. as such, estimated losses in the portfolio will not necessarily result in recognized impairment losses. when we recognize an impairment, the impairment is measured using the estimated fair value of the underlying asset, which is based upon cash flow estimates that reflect current and projected lease profiles and available industry information about capitalization rates and expected trends in rents and occupancy and is corroborated by external appraisals. real estate recognized pre-tax impairments of $0.3 billion in its real estate held for investment in both 2014 and 2013. deterioration in economic conditions or prolonged market illiquidity may result in further impairments being recognized. furthermore, significant judgment and uncertainty related to forecasted valuation trends, especially in illiquid markets, result in inherent imprecision in real estate value estimates.
further information is provided in the risk management section and in note 9 to the consolidated financial statements in this form 10-k report.
goodwill and other identified intangible assets we test goodwill for impairment annually in the third quarter of each year using data as of july 1 of that year. the impairment test consists of two steps: in step one, the carrying value of the reporting unit is compared with its fair value; in step two, which is applied when the carrying value is more than its fair value, the amount of goodwill impairment, if any, is derived by deducting the fair value of the reporting unit's assets and liabilities from the fair value of its equity, and comparing that amount with the carrying amount of goodwill. we determined fair values for each of the reporting units using the market approach, when available and appropriate, or the income approach, or a combination of both. we assess the valuation methodology based upon the relevance and availability of the data at the time we perform the valuation. if multiple valuation methodologies are used, the results are weighted appropriately.
valuations using the market approach are derived from metrics of publicly traded companies or historically completed transactions of comparable businesses. the selection of comparable businesses is based on the markets in which the reporting units operate giving consideration to risk profiles, size, geography, and diversity of products and services. a market approach is limited to reporting units for which there are publicly traded companies that have the characteristics similar to our businesses.
under the income approach, fair value is determined based on the present value of estimated future cash flows, discounted at an appropriate risk-adjusted rate. we use our internal forecasts to estimate future cash flows and include an estimate of long-term future growth rates based on our most recent views of the long-term outlook for each business. actual results may differ from those assumed in our forecasts. we derive our discount rates using a capital asset pricing model and analyzing published rates for industries relevant to our reporting units to estimate the cost of equity financing. we use discount rates that are commensurate with the risks and uncertainty inherent in the respective businesses and in our internally developed forecasts. discount rates used in our reporting unit valuations ranged from 9.0% to 16.0%.
during the third quarter of 2014, as noted above, we performed our annual impairment test of goodwill for all of our reporting units. based on the results of our step one testing, the fair values of each of the ge reporting units exceeded their carrying values; therefore, the second step of the impairment test was not required to be performed for any of our reporting units and no goodwill impairment was recognized.
while all of our reporting units passed step one of our annual impairment testing, we identified one reporting unit for which the fair value was not substantially in excess of its carrying value. within our energy management operating segment, the power conversion reporting unit was determined to have a fair value in excess of its carrying value by approximately 10%. the goodwill associated with the power conversion reporting unit was $1.5 billion at december 31, 2014, representing approximately 2% of our total goodwill. while the goodwill of the reporting unit is not currently impaired, there could be an impairment in the future as a result of changes in certain estimates and assumptions. for example, the reporting unit's fair value could be adversely affected and result in an impairment of goodwill if actual cash flows are below estimated cash flows, the estimated cash flows are discounted at a higher risk-adjusted rate or market multiples decrease.
as of december 31, 2014, we believe that the goodwill is recoverable for all of the reporting units; however, there can be no assurances that the goodwill will not be impaired in future periods.
in 2013, while the real estate reporting unit's book value was within the range of its fair value, we further substantiated our real estate goodwill balance by performing the second step analysis in which the implied fair value of goodwill exceeded its carrying value by approximately $3.7 billion. in the current year, it was determined that the second step was not required, as the results of step one indicated that the fair value of the real estate reporting unit exceeded its book value.
estimating the fair value of reporting units requires the use of estimates and significant judgments that are based on a number of factors including actual operating results. it is reasonably possible that the judgments and estimates described above could change in future periods.
we review identified intangible assets with defined useful lives and subject to amortization for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the related carrying amounts may not be recoverable. determining whether an impairment loss occurred requires comparing the carrying amount to the sum of undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. we test intangible assets with indefinite lives annually for impairment using a fair value method such as discounted cash flows. for our insurance activities remaining in continuing operations, we periodically test for impairment our deferred acquisition costs and present value of future profits.
further information is provided in notes 1 and 8 to the consolidated financial statements in this form 10-k report.
pension assumptions pension assumptions are significant inputs to the actuarial models that measure pension benefit obligations and related effects on operations. two assumptions - discount rate and expected return on assets - are important elements of plan expense and asset/liability measurement. we evaluate these critical assumptions at least annually on a plan and country-specific basis. we periodically evaluate other assumptions involving demographic factors such as retirement age, mortality and turnover, and update them to reflect our experience and expectations for the future. actual results in any given year will often differ from actuarial assumptions because of economic and other factors.
accumulated and projected benefit obligations are measured as the present value of expected payments. we discount those cash payments using the weighted average of market-observed yields for high-quality fixed-income securities with maturities that correspond to the payment of benefits. lower discount rates increase present values and subsequent-year pension expense; higher discount rates decrease present values and subsequent-year pension expense.
our discount rates for principal pension plans at december 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012 were 4.02%, 4.85% and 3.96%, respectively, reflecting market interest rates.
to determine the expected long-term rate of return on pension plan assets, we consider current and target asset allocations, as well as historical and expected returns on various categories of plan assets. in developing future long-term return expectations for our principal benefit plans' assets, we formulate views on the future economic environment, both in the u.s. and abroad. we evaluate general market trends and historical relationships among a number of key variables that impact asset class returns such as expected earnings growth, inflation, valuations, yields and spreads, using both internal and external sources. we also take into account expected volatility by asset class and diversification across classes to determine expected overall portfolio results given current and target allocations. assets in our principal pension plans earned 5.9% in 2014, and had average annual returns of 9.0%, 5.9%, and 8.4% per year in the 5-, 10- and 25-year periods ended december 31, 2014, respectively. the average historical 10- and 25- returns were significantly affected by investment losses in 2008. based on our analysis of future expectations of asset performance, past return results, and our current and target asset allocations, we have assumed a 7.5% long-term expected return on those assets for cost recognition in 2015 compared to 7.5% in 2014 and 8.0% in 2013 and 2012.
changes in key assumptions for our principal pension plans would have the following effects.
   discount rate - a 25 basis point increase in discount rate would decrease pension cost in the following year by $0.2 billion and would decrease the pension benefit obligation at year-end by about $2.3 billion.
further information on our pension plans is provided in the other consolidated information - postretirement benefit plans section of the md&a and in note 12 to the consolidated financial statements in this form 10-k report.
income taxes our annual tax rate is based on our income, statutory tax rates and tax planning opportunities available to us in the various jurisdictions in which we operate. tax laws are complex and subject to different interpretations by the taxpayer and respective governmental taxing authorities. significant judgment is required in determining our tax expense and in evaluating our tax positions, including evaluating uncertainties. we review our tax positions quarterly and adjust the balances as new information becomes available. our income tax rate is significantly affected by the tax rate on our global operations. in addition to local country tax laws and regulations, this rate depends on the extent earnings are indefinitely reinvested outside the united states. indefinite reinvestment is determined by management's judgment about and intentions concerning the future operations of the company. at december 31, 2014 and 2013, approximately $119 billion and $110 billion of earnings, respectively, have been indefinitely reinvested outside the united states. most of these earnings have been reinvested in active non-u.s. business operations, and we do not intend to repatriate these earnings to fund u.s. operations. because of the availability of u.s. foreign tax credits, it is not practicable to determine the u.s. federal income tax liability that would be payable if such earnings were not reinvested indefinitely.
deferred income tax assets represent amounts available to reduce income taxes payable on taxable income in future years. such assets arise because of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, as well as from net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. we evaluate the recoverability of these future tax deductions and credits by assessing the adequacy of future expected taxable income from all sources, including reversal of taxable temporary differences, forecasted operating earnings and available tax planning strategies. these sources of income rely heavily on estimates. we use our historical experience and our short- and long-range business forecasts to provide insight. further, our global and diversified business portfolio gives us the opportunity to employ various prudent and feasible tax planning strategies to facilitate the recoverability of future deductions. amounts recorded for deferred tax assets related to non-u.s. net operating losses, net of valuation allowances, were $5.5 billion at both december 31, 2014 and 2013, including $0.6 billion and $0.8 billion at december 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively, of deferred tax assets, net of valuation allowances, associated with losses reported in discontinued operations, primarily related to our loss on the sale of ge money japan. such year-end 2014 amounts are expected to be fully recoverable within the applicable statutory expiration periods. to the extent we do not consider it more likely than not that a deferred tax asset will be recovered, a valuation allowance is established.
further information on income taxes is provided in the other consolidated information - income taxes section within the md&a and in note 14 to the consolidated financial statements in this form 10-k report.
derivatives and hedging we use derivatives to manage a variety of risks, including risks related to interest rates, foreign exchange and commodity prices. accounting for derivatives as hedges requires that, at inception and over the term of the arrangement, the hedged item and related derivative meet the requirements for hedge accounting. the rules and interpretations related to derivatives accounting are complex. failure to apply this complex guidance correctly will result in all changes in the fair value of the derivative being reported in earnings, without regard to the offsetting changes in the fair value of the hedged item.
in evaluating whether a particular relationship qualifies for hedge accounting, we test effectiveness at inception and each reporting period thereafter by determining whether changes in the fair value of the derivative offset, within a specified range, changes in the fair value of the hedged item. if fair value changes fail this test, we discontinue applying hedge accounting to that relationship prospectively. fair values of both the derivative instrument and the hedged item are calculated using internal valuation models incorporating market-based assumptions, subject to third-party confirmation, as applicable.
further information about our use of derivatives is provided in notes 1, 9, 21 and 22 to the consolidated financial statements in this form 10-k report.
fair value measurements assets and liabilities measured at fair value every reporting period include investments in debt and equity securities and derivatives. assets that are not measured at fair value every reporting period but that are subject to fair value measurements in certain circumstances include loans and long-lived assets that have been reduced to fair value when they are held for sale, impaired loans that have been reduced based on the fair value of the underlying collateral, cost and equity method investments and long-lived assets that are written down to fair value when they are impaired and the remeasurement of retained investments in formerly consolidated subsidiaries upon a change in control that results in deconsolidation of a subsidiary, if we sell a controlling interest and retain a noncontrolling stake in the entity. assets that are written down to fair value when impaired and retained investments are not subsequently adjusted to fair value unless further impairment occurs.
a fair value measurement is determined as the price we would receive to sell an asset or pay to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. in the absence of active markets for the identical assets or liabilities, such measurements involve developing assumptions based on market observable data and, in the absence of such data, internal information that is consistent with what market participants would use in a hypothetical transaction that occurs at the measurement date. the determination of fair value often involves significant judgments about assumptions such as determining an appropriate discount rate that factors in both risk and liquidity premiums, identifying the similarities and differences in market transactions, weighting those differences accordingly and then making the appropriate adjustments to those market transactions to reflect the risks specific to our asset being valued.
further information on fair value measurements is provided in notes 1, 21 and 22 to the consolidated financial statements in this form 10-k report.
other loss contingencies other loss contingencies are uncertain and unresolved matters that arise in the ordinary course of business and result from events or actions by others that have the potential to result in a future loss. such contingencies include, but are not limited to environmental obligations, litigation, regulatory proceedings, product quality and losses resulting from other events and developments.
when a loss is considered probable and reasonably estimable, we record a liability in the amount of our best estimate for the ultimate loss. when there appears to be a range of possible costs with equal likelihood, liabilities are based on the low-end of such range. however, the likelihood of a loss with respect to a particular contingency is often difficult to predict and determining a meaningful estimate of the loss or a range of loss may not be practicable based on the information available and the potential effect of future events and decisions by third parties that will determine the ultimate resolution of the contingency. moreover, it is not uncommon for such matters to be resolved over many years, during which time relevant developments and new information must be continuously evaluated to determine both the likelihood of potential loss and whether it is possible to reasonably estimate a range of possible loss. when a loss is probable but a reasonable estimate cannot be made, disclosure is provided.
disclosure also is provided when it is reasonably possible that a loss will be incurred or when it is reasonably possible that the amount of a loss will exceed the recorded provision. we regularly review all contingencies to determine whether the likelihood of loss has changed and to assess whether a reasonable estimate of the loss or range of loss can be made. as discussed above, development of a meaningful estimate of loss or a range of potential loss is complex when the outcome is directly dependent on negotiations with or decisions by third parties, such as regulatory agencies, the court system and other interested parties. such factors bear directly on whether it is possible to reasonably estimate a range of potential loss and boundaries of high and low estimates.
further information is provided in notes 2, 13 and 24 to the consolidated financial statements in this form 10-k report.
other items new accounting standards in may 2014, the financial accounting standards board (fasb) issued accounting standards update (asu) 2014-09, revenue from contracts with customers, which requires an entity to recognize the amount of revenue to which it expects to be entitled for the transfer of promised goods or services to customers. the asu will replace most existing revenue recognition guidance in gaap when it becomes effective. the new standard is effective on january 1, 2017. early application is not permitted. the standard permits the use of either the retrospective or modified retrospective (cumulative effect) transition method. we are evaluating the effect that asu 2014-09 will have on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. we have not yet selected a transition method nor have we determined the effect of the standard on our ongoing financial reporting.
in february 2015, the fasb issued asu 2015-02, amendments to the consolidation analysis. the asu amends the consolidation guidance for vies and general partners' investments in limited partnerships and modifies the evaluation of whether limited partnerships and similar legal entities are vies or voting interest entities. the asu is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after december 15, 2015, with early adoption permitted. we are currently evaluating the effect of the asu on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.
environmental matters our operations, like operations of other companies engaged in similar businesses, involve the use, disposal and cleanup of substances regulated under environmental protection laws. we are involved in a number of remediation actions to clean up hazardous wastes as required by federal and state laws. such statutes require that responsible parties fund remediation actions regardless of fault, legality of original disposal or ownership of a disposal site. expenditures for site remediation actions amounted to approximately $0.4 billion in each of the years 2014, 2013 and 2012. we presently expect that such remediation actions will require average annual expenditures of about $0.4 billion in 2015 and $0.3 billion in 2016.
in 2006, we entered into a consent decree with the environmental protection agency (epa) to dredge pcb-containing sediment from the upper hudson river. the consent decree provided that the dredging would be performed in two phases. phase 1 was completed in may through november of 2009. between phase 1 and phase 2 there was an intervening peer review by an independent panel of national experts. the panel evaluated the performance of phase 1 dredging operations with respect to phase 1 engineering performance standards and recommended proposed changes to the standards. on december 17, 2010, epa issued its decision setting forth the final performance standards for phase 2 of the hudson river dredging project, incorporating aspects of the recommendations from the independent peer review panel and from ge. in december 2010, we agreed to perform phase 2 of the project in accordance with the final performance standards set by epa and increased our reserve by $0.8 billion in the fourth quarter of 2010 to account for the probable and estimable costs of completing phase 2. in 2012, we completed the first year of phase 2 dredging and commenced work on planned upgrades to the hudson river wastewater processing facility. over the past four years we have dredged 2.2 million cubic yards from the river and, based upon that result and our best professional engineering judgment, we believe that our current reserve continues to reflect our probable and estimable costs for the remainder of phase 2 of the dredging project.
research and development
less customer funded r&amp;d (principally the u.s. government)         (721)         (711)         (680)
aviation accounts for the largest share of ge's research and development expenditures with funding from both ge and external funds. power & water and healthcare also made significant expenditures funded primarily by ge.
other we own, or hold licenses to use, numerous patents. new patents are continuously being obtained through our research and development activities as existing patents expire. patented inventions are used both within the company and are licensed to others.
ge is a trademark and service mark of general electric company.
because of the diversity of our products and services, as well as the wide geographic dispersion of our production facilities, we use numerous sources for the wide variety of raw materials needed for our operations. we have not been adversely affected by the inability to obtain raw materials.

md&amp;a   supplemental information
supplemental information financial measures that supplement u.s. generally accepted accounting principles measures (non-gaap financial measures)
we sometimes use information derived from consolidated financial information but not presented in our financial statements prepared in accordance with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles (gaap). certain of these data are considered "non-gaap financial measures" under u.s. securities and exchange commission rules. specifically, we have referred, in various sections of this form 10-k report, to:
   operating earnings, operating eps and operating eps excluding the effects of the 2011 preferred stock redemption, and industrial operating earnings
   industrial segment organic revenue growth
   industrial cash flows from operating activities (industrial cfoa) and ge cfoa excluding the effects of nbcu deal-related taxes
   operating and non-operating pension costs (income)
   average ge shareowners' equity, excluding effects of discontinued operations

operating earnings excludes non-service-related pension costs of our principal pension plans comprising interest cost, expected return on plan assets and amortization of actuarial gains/losses. the service cost, prior service cost and curtailment loss components of our principal pension plans are included in operating earnings. we believe that these components of pension cost better reflect the ongoing service-related costs of providing pension benefits to our employees. as such, we believe that our measure of operating earnings provides management and investors with a useful measure of the operational results of our business. other components of gaap pension cost are mainly driven by capital allocation decisions and market performance, and we manage these separately from the operational performance of our businesses. neither gaap nor operating pension costs are necessarily indicative of the current or future cash flow requirements related to our pension plan. we also believe that this measure, considered along with the corresponding gaap measure, provides management and investors with additional information for comparison of our operating results to the operating results of other companies. we believe that presenting operating earnings separately for our industrial businesses also provides management and investors with useful information about the relative size of our industrial and financial services businesses in relation to the total company. we also believe that operating eps excluding the effects of the $0.8 billion preferred dividend related to the redemption of our preferred stock (calculated as the difference between the carrying value and the redemption value of the preferred stock) is a meaningful measure because it increases the comparability of period-to-period results.

organic revenue growth measures revenue excluding the effects of acquisitions, business dispositions and currency exchange rates. we believe that this measure provides management and investors with a more complete understanding of underlying operating results and trends of established, ongoing operations by excluding the effect of acquisitions, dispositions and currency exchange, which activities are subject to volatility and can obscure underlying trends. we also believe that presenting organic revenue growth separately for our industrial businesses provides management and investors with useful information about the trends of our industrial businesses and enables a more direct comparison to other non-financial businesses and companies. management recognizes that the term "organic revenue growth" may be interpreted differently by other companies and under different circumstances. although this may have an effect on comparability of absolute percentage growth from company to company, we believe that these measures are useful in assessing trends of the respective businesses or companies and may therefore be a useful tool in assessing period-to-period performance trends.

we refer to cash generated by our industrial businesses as "industrial cfoa," which we define as ge's cash from continuing operating activities less the amount of dividends received by ge from gecc. this includes the effects of intercompany transactions, including ge customer receivables sold to gecc; gecc services for trade receivables management and material procurement; buildings and equipment (including automobiles) leased between ge and gecc; information technology (it) and other services sold to gecc by ge; aircraft engines manufactured by ge that are installed on aircraft purchased by gecc from third-party producers for lease to others; and various investments, loans and allocations of ge corporate overhead costs. we believe that investors may find it useful to compare ge's operating cash flows without the effect of gecc dividends, since these dividends are not representative of the operating cash flows of our industrial businesses and can vary from period-to-period based upon the results of the financial services businesses. we also believe that investors may find it useful to compare industrial cfoa excluding the effects of taxes paid related to the nbcu transaction. management recognizes that these measures may not be comparable to cash flow results of companies that contain both industrial and financial services businesses, but believes that this comparison is aided by the provision of additional information about the amounts of dividends paid by our financial services business and the separate presentation in our financial statements of the financial services (gecc) cash flows. we believe that our measures of industrial cfoa and cfoa excluding nbcu deal-related taxes provide management and investors with useful measures to compare the capacity of our industrial operations to generate operating cash flows with the operating cash flows of other non-financial businesses and companies and as such provide useful measures to supplement the reported gaap cfoa measure.

we define free cash flow as ge's cash from operating activities (continuing operations) less ge additions to property, plant and equipment, which are included in cash flows from investing activities. we believe that free cash flow is a useful financial metric to assess our ability to pursue opportunities to enhance our growth. we also believe that presenting free cash flow separately for our industrial businesses provides management and investors with useful information about the trends of our industrial businesses and enables a more direct comparison to other non-financial businesses and companies. management recognizes that the term free cash flow may be interpreted differently by other companies and under different circumstances. although this may have an effect on comparability of absolute percentage growth from company to company, we believe that these measures are useful in assessing trends of the respective businesses or companies and may therefore be a useful tool in assessing period-to-period performance trends.

our rotc calculation excludes earnings (losses) of discontinued operations from the numerator because gaap requires us to display those earnings (losses) in the statement of earnings. our calculation of average ge shareowners' equity may not be directly comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. we believe that it is a clearer way to measure the ongoing trend in return on total capital for the continuing operations of our businesses given the extent that discontinued operations have affected our reported results. we believe that this results in a more relevant measure for management and investors to evaluate performance of our continuing operations, on a consistent basis, and to evaluate and compare the performance of our continuing operations with the ongoing operations of other businesses and companies.

(c)   includes average noncontrolling interests, calculated using a five-point average partially offset by the estimated value of assets held by ge to support gecc.
our industrial rotc calculation excludes earnings (losses) of discontinued operations from the numerator.  we believe that this is a clearer way to measure the ongoing trend in return on industrial capital for the continuing operations of the business to the extent that discontinued operations have affected our reported results. our industrial shareowners' equity used in the denominator is adjusted for debt, noncontrolling interests and the estimated value of assets held by the ge parent to support gecc. we believe that these adjustments provide a more meaningful denominator in measuring the return on our industrial businesses. industrial rotc was 14.0% in 2014 versus 14.3% in 2013. in 2014, a 12% increase in the adjusted industrial return was more than offset by a 14% increase in the adjusted industrial capital. this increase in capital was principally driven by an increase in year-end 2013 discount rates, which reduced the pension deficit. our calculation of the return on industrial capital may not be directly comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. we believe that the adjustments described above result in a more relevant measure for management and investors to evaluate performance of our industrial continuing operations, on a consistent basis, and to evaluate and compare the performance of our industrial continuing operations with the continuing operations of other businesses and companies.

we have provided the gecc ratio of debt to equity on a basis that reflects the use of liquidity as a reduction of debt. for purposes of this ratio, we have also adjusted cash and debt balances to include amounts classified as assets and liabilities of businesses held for sale and discontinued operations. we believe that this is a useful comparison to a gaap-based ratio of debt to equity because liquidity balances may be used to reduce debt. the usefulness of this supplemental measure may be limited, however, as the total amount of liquidity at any point in time may be different than the amount that could practically be applied to reduce outstanding debt. despite this potential limitation, we believe that this measure, considered along with the corresponding gaap measure, provides investors with additional information that may be more comparable to other financial institutions and businesses.

(b)   liquidity includes cash and equivalents and $1.2 billion of debt obligations of the u.s. treasury at december 31, 2014.
we use eni to measure the size of our ge capital segment. we believe that this measure is a useful indicator of the capital (debt or equity) required to fund a business as it adjusts for non-interest bearing current liabilities generated in the normal course of business that do not require a capital outlay. we also believe that by excluding liquidity, we provide a meaningful measure of assets requiring capital to fund our ge capital segment as a substantial amount of liquidity resulted from debt issuances to pre-fund future debt maturities and will not be used to fund additional assets. liquidity consists of cash and equivalents and certain debt obligations of the u.s. treasury. as a general matter, investments included in liquidity are expected to be highly liquid, giving us the ability to readily convert them to cash. providing this measure will help investors measure how we are performing against our previously communicated goal to reduce the size of our financial services segment. we also believe that presenting our 2008 eni provides investors with information to better understand the progress we have made toward the goal of making gecc a smaller, more focused finance company.

item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations except as expressly stated, the financial condition and results of operations discussed throughout management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ("md&a") are those of t-mobile us, inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries.
overview the md&a is intended to provide a reader of our financial statements with a narrative explanation from the perspective of management of our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and certain other factors that may affect future results. the md&a is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, our audited consolidated financial statements for the three years ended december 31, 2014 included in part ii, item 8 of this form 10-k.
business overview we are the un-carrier. un-satisfied with the status quo. un-afraid to innovate. t-mobile is the fastest growing wireless company in the u.s., based on customer growth in 2014, currently providing wireless communications services, including voice, messaging and data, to over 55 million customers in the postpaid, prepaid, and wholesale markets. the un-carrier proposition is an approach that seeks to listen to the customer, address their pain points, bring innovation to the industry, and
improve the wireless experience for all. in practice, this means offering customers a great service on a nationwide lte network, devices when and how they want them, and plans that are simple, affordable and without unnecessary restrictions. going forward, we will continue to listen and respond to our customers, refine and improve the un-carrier proposition, and deliver the best value experience in the industry.
our un-carrier proposition is first and foremost about the customer. in 2014, we continued to aggressively address customer pain points with the launch of the following phases of our un-carrier proposition:
•   contract freedom - in january 2014, we announced phase 4.0, which reimburses customers' etfs when they switch from other carriers and trade in their eligible device.
•   test drive - in june 2014, we released phase 5.0, which allows consumers to test our network and an apple iphone 5s with unlimited nationwide service for seven days at no charge.
•   music freedom - in june 2014, we introduced phase 6.0, which allows simple choice customers to stream music from popular music services without it counting against their high-speed data allotment. additionally, we launched rhapsody unradio, which is available to our eligible simple choice customers at no additional cost or at a discounted price.
•   wi-fi un-leashed - in september 2014, we launched phase 7.0, which provides wi-fi calling and texting for simple choice customers on capable smartphones. in addition, we unveiled the t-mobile personal cellspot, a new device which provides customers with greater coverage in their home. finally, through a new partnership with gogo, customers with compatible devices can send and receive unlimited text, picture messages and receive visual voicemails on any gogo-equipped u.s.-based flight for free.
•   data stash - in december 2014, we introduced phase 8.0, giving customers the ability to roll their unused high-speed data automatically each month into a personal data stash so they can use it when they need it for up to a year. starting in january 2015, data stash will be automatically available at no extra charge to every t-mobile customer with a postpaid simple choice plan who has purchased additional lte data, 3gb or more for smartphones and 1 gb or more for tablets. in addition, beginning in january 2015, we will provide a one-time free data stash to start with of 10 gb of lte data to all qualifying customers, which will expire at the end of 2015.
financial highlights our primary financial focus is on growing adjusted ebitda, which we expect to continue to improve in 2015. adjusted ebitda increased to $5.6 billion in 2014, compared to $4.9 billion in 2013 and 2012. adjusted ebitda is primarily driven by increasing revenues. we generate revenues by offering affordable wireless communication services to our postpaid, prepaid and wholesale customers, as well as through sale of a wide selection of wireless devices and accessories. total revenues increased to $29.6 billion in 2014 compared to $24.4 billion in 2013 and $19.7 billion in 2012. we introduced our un-carrier proposition in 2013 with the objective of eliminating customer pain points from the unnecessary complexity of the wireless communication industry. we believe un-carrier phases 1.0 through 8.0 have been successful as evidenced by our strong customer growth momentum since the launch of our un-carrier proposition. total net customer additions were 8,334,000 in 2014, a significant improvement compared to 4,377,000 in 2013 and 203,000 in 2012.
we generate the majority of our service revenues by providing wireless communication services to branded postpaid customers. our ability to acquire and retain branded postpaid customers is important to our business in the generation of revenues. total branded postpaid net customer additions were 4,886,000 in 2014, a significant improvement compared to net customer additions of 2,006,000 in 2013 and net customer losses of 2,074,000 in 2012. in addition, we have continued to focus on retaining customers through churn reduction initiatives to improve customer experience. branded postpaid phone churn improved to 1.58% in 2014, compared to 1.69% in 2013 and 2.33% in 2012. improvements in branded postpaid net customer additions and churn were driven by the continued success of our un-carrier proposition and strong customer response to promotions. we expect further growth in our branded postpaid net customer additions in 2015 as we continue to offer competitive pricing and improve our network and customer experience.
we have also increased our service revenues from branded prepaid customers through the business combination with metropcs in 2013 and the expansion of the metropcs brand in 2014. in addition, we experienced increases in equipment sales from significant growth in the number of devices sold on higher gross customer additions and upgrade volumes, including redemptions through jump!.
our most significant expenses are related to acquiring and retaining high-quality customers, compensating employees, and operating and expanding our network. we expect operating expenses will continue to increase to support our strong customer growth. operating expenses were $28.1 billion in 2014, compared to $23.4 billion in 2013 and $26.1 billion in 2012. improvements in gross customer additions caused significant growth in the number of devices sold, which resulted in higher cost of equipment sales, and employee-related costs, such as commissions. in addition, employee-related costs increased as a result of increases in the number of retail and customer support employees needed to support customer growth. we also increased promotional activities to attract new customers. we have incurred expenses as part of the network modernization due to increased depreciation expense related to the build out of the lte network and costs related to decommissioning of the metropcs cdma network and certain other redundant cell sites.
liquidity and capital resources highlights the success of our un-carrier proposition and continued modernization of our network has further repositioned t-mobile to provide customers with an unrivaled customer experience, which requires substantial investment in our business. our principal sources of liquidity are our cash and cash equivalents and cash generated from operations, proceeds from the issuance of long-term debt and the issuance of common and preferred stock, the sale of certain service receivables related to a factoring arrangement, and financing arrangements of vendor payables which effectively extend payment terms. in 2014, we completed an offering of new senior unsecured notes in aggregate principal amounts of $3.0 billion, using a portion of the proceeds from the issuance of the notes to redeem senior unsecured notes of $1.0 billion with a higher interest rate, and completed a public offering of 20 million shares of preferred stock for net proceeds of $982 million. see note 8 - debt and note 14 - additional financial information of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii, item 8 of this form 10-k. in addition, in 2014, we entered into a two-year factoring arrangement to sell certain service accounts receivable on a revolving basis with a current maximum funding limit of $640 million. see note 4 - factoring arrangement of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii, item 8 of this form 10-k.
we have substantially completed the process of upgrading our network to lte, which provides our customers with the fastest nationwide lte services. our lte network covered 265 million people as of december 31, 2014, compared to more than 200 million people as of december 31, 2013. this surpassed our year-end goal of covering 250 million people with the fastest nationwide lte network. we are targeting 300 million people with lte by the end of 2015. in addition, we are currently in the process of building out our network to utilize our recently acquired 700 mhz a-block spectrum licenses. cash capital expenditures for property and equipment, which are primarily related to our network modernization, were $4.3 billion in 2014 compared to $4.0 billion in 2013 and $2.9 billion in 2012. we expect cash capital expenditures for property and equipment to be in the range of $4.4 billion to $4.7 billion in 2015.
we provide mobile communication services using spectrum licenses, consisting of 700 mhz a-block, aws and pcs licenses. in 2014, we completed transactions for the acquisition of 700 mhz a-block, aws and pcs spectrum licenses, primarily from verizon, with an aggregate fair value of $4.8 billion, which covers approximately 150 million people, in exchange for cash and the transfer of certain aws and pcs spectrum. in addition, in 2014, we entered into agreements, which are expected to close in 2015, for the acquisition of 700 mhz a-block, aws and pcs spectrum licenses with an estimated aggregate fair value of approximately $0.5 billion, which cover more than 40 million people, for cash and the exchange of certain aws and pcs spectrum licenses, which cover approximately 6 million people. the transactions are subject to regulatory approval and other customary closing conditions. upon closing of these pending transactions, we will own 700 mhz a-block covering 190 million people in total. in january 2015, the fcc announced t-mobile was the winning bidder of aws spectrum licenses covering approximately 97 million people for an aggregate bid price of $1.8 billion. t-mobile expects to receive the aws spectrum licenses, subject to regulatory approval, in the second quarter of 2015. these transactions are expected to further enhance our portfolio of u.s. nationwide broadband spectrum. see note 6 - goodwill, spectrum licenses and intangible assets and note 16 - subsequent events of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii, item 8 of this form 10-k. in 2015, we will seek to opportunistically acquire additional spectrum in private party transactions to further enhance our portfolio of u.s. nationwide broadband spectrum and enable the expansion of lte coverage to new markets.
see "results of operations" below for further discussion of changes in revenues and operating expenses and "performance measures" for a description of performance measures, such as adjusted ebitda and churn. the comparability of results in this form 10-k for the year ended december 31, 2014 and 2013 is affected by the inclusion of metropcs results after the completion of the business combination on april 30, 2013.

revenues branded postpaid revenues increased $1.2 billion, or 9%, in 2014, compared to 2013. the increase was primarily attributable to growth in the number of average branded postpaid customers driven by the continued success of our un-carrier proposition and strong customer response to promotions for services and devices. additional increases resulted from customer adoption of upgrade and insurance programs and changes in requalification requirements for corporate discount programs. the increase was partially offset by lower branded postpaid average revenue per account ("arpa"). see "performance measures" for a description of arpa. branded postpaid arpa was negatively impacted by continued growth of our simple choice plans, which have lower monthly service charges compared to traditional bundled plans. branded postpaid customers on simple choice plans increased over the past twelve months to 89% of the branded postpaid customer base as of december 31, 2014, compared to 69% as of december 31, 2013.
branded prepaid revenues increased $2.0 billion, or 41% in 2014, compared to 2013. the increase was primarily driven by growth of the customer base from the expansion of the metropcs brand and an increase in promotional activities. in addition, the inclusion of metropcs operating results for the full year period following the business combination in april 2013 contributed to the increase.
wholesale revenues increased $118 million, or 19%, in 2014, compared to 2013. the increase was primarily attributable to growth in customer programs and monthly plans, including data, offered by our mvno partners and changes to our mvno contractual arrangements.
roaming and other service revenues decreased $78 million, or 23%, in 2014, compared to 2013, primarily due to a decline in etfs following our introduction of the no annual service contract feature of the simple choice plan launched in march 2013.
equipment sales increased $1.8 billion, or 35%, in 2014, compared to 2013. the increase was primarily attributable to significant growth in the number of devices sold due to higher gross customer additions and higher device upgrade volumes, including jump! redemptions. the volume of device sales increased 48% in 2014, compared to 2013. additionally, the inclusion of metropcs operating results for the full year period in 2014 following the business combination in april 2013 contributed to the increase. the increase was partially offset by reimbursements of other carriers' etfs and a lower average revenue per device sold.
we financed $5.8 billion of equipment sales revenues through eip during 2014, an increase from $3.3 billion in 2013, resulting from growth of our simple choice plans. additionally, customers had associated eip billings of $3.6 billion in 2014, compared to $1.5 billion in 2013.
operating expenses cost of services increased $509 million, or 10%, in 2014, compared to 2013. the increase was primarily due to the inclusion of metropcs operating results for the full year period in 2014 following the business combination in april 2013. additionally, higher lease expense primarily relating to spectrum license lease agreements resulting from spectrum swap transactions contributed to the increase.
cost of equipment sales increased $2.6 billion, or 38%, in 2014, compared to 2013. the increase was primarily attributable to significant growth in the number of devices sold due to higher gross customer additions and higher device upgrade volumes, including jump! redemptions. additionally, the inclusion of metropcs operating results for the full year period in 2014 following the business combination in april 2013 contributed to the increase. the volume of device sales increased 48% in 2014, compared to 2013. the increase was partially offset by a lower average cost per device sold.
selling, general and administrative increased $1.5 billion, or 20%, in 2014, compared to 2013. the increase was primarily due to higher employee-related costs as a result of increases in the number of retail and customer support employees, higher commissions driven by increased gross customer additions and higher promotional costs. additionally, the inclusion of metropcs operating results for the full year period in 2014 following the business combination in april 2013 and higher stock-based compensation contributed to the increase.
depreciation and amortization increased $785 million, or 22%, in 2014, compared to 2013. the increase was primarily associated with the build-out of the t-mobile lte network, which increased the depreciable asset base. additionally, the inclusion of metropcs operating results for the full year period in 2014 following the business combination in april 2013, including accelerated depreciation related to the decommissioning of the metropcs cdma network, contributed to the increase.
cost of metropcs business combination of $299 million in 2014 primarily reflects network decommissioning costs associated with the business combination. in 2014, we began decommissioning the metropcs cdma network and certain other redundant network cell sites. network decommissioning costs, which are excluded from adjusted ebitda, primarily relate to the acceleration of lease costs for cell sites that would have otherwise been recognized as cost of services over the remaining lease term had we not decommissioned the cell sites. we intend to decommission certain cell sites and incur additional network decommissioning costs in the range of $500 million to $600 million, a majority of which are expected to be recognized in 2015. see note 2 - business combination with metropcs of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii, item 8 of this form 10-k for more information. cost of metropcs business combination of $108 million in 2013 reflects personnel-related costs and professional services costs associated with the business combination.
gains on disposal of spectrum licenses of $840 million in 2014 primarily consisted of non-cash gains from spectrum license transactions with verizon, and to a lesser extent, a non-cash gain from a spectrum license transaction with at&t during the
fourth quarter of 2014. see note 6 - goodwill, spectrum licenses and intangible assets of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii, item 8 of this form 10-k for more information.
other, net decreased $49 million, or 91%, in 2014, compared to 2013. the decrease was primarily due to our 2013 restructuring program to align our operations to our new strategy and position the company for future growth. costs associated with the 2013 restructuring program primarily consisted of severance and other personnel-related costs.
interest expense to affiliates decreased $400 million, or 59%, in 2014, compared to 2013. the decrease was primarily due to lower debt balances with deutsche telekom in 2014, resulting from the recapitalization of t-mobile prior to the business combination in april 2013 and deutsche telekom's sale of non-reset notes in the aggregate principal amount of $5.6 billion in october 2013. to a lesser extent, additional decreases resulted from fair value adjustments related to embedded derivative instruments associated with the senior reset notes issued to deutsche telekom in the recapitalization.
interest expense increased $528 million, or 97% in 2014, compared to 2013. the increase was primarily the result of higher debt balances in 2014 compared to 2013, including senior notes issued in 2013, the assumption of metropcs long-term debt in connection with the business combination in april 2013, the reclassification of non-reset notes from long-term debt to affiliates to long-term debt following deutsche telekom's sale of the non-reset notes in october 2013, and to a lesser extent, the issuance of new senior unsecured notes in september 2014.
interest income increased $170 million, or 90% in 2014, compared to 2013. the increase was the result of significant growth in devices financed through eip. interest associated with eip receivables is imputed at the time of sale and then recognized over the financed installment term.
other income (expense), net decreased $100 million in 2014, compared to 2013. the decrease was primarily due to the recognition of foreign currency translation gains in 2013 related to the retirement of derivative instruments prior to the business combination in april 2013. this decrease was offset in part by a non-cash gain recognized in 2014 on the extinguishment of $1.0 billion of 7.875% senior notes due in 2018.
income taxes income tax expense increased $150 million in 2014, compared to 2013. the increase was primarily due to higher pre-tax income. the effective tax rate was 40.2% in 2014, compared to 31.4% in 2013. the increase in the effective tax rate for 2014 compared to 2013 was primarily due to an increase in the valuation allowance on certain state income tax attributes, which was partially offset by an increase in federal tax credits and a reduction in the effect of puerto rico taxes on the effective tax rate.
guarantor subsidiaries pursuant to the indenture and the supplemental indentures, the long-term debt, excluding capital leases, are fully and unconditionally guaranteed, jointly and severally, on a senior unsecured basis by t-mobile us, inc. ("parent") and certain of t-mobile usa's ("issuer") 100% owned subsidiaries ("guarantor subsidiaries"). in 2014, t-mobile entered into a two-year factoring arrangement to sell certain service accounts receivable on a revolving basis. in connection with the factoring arrangement, the company formed the factoring spe, which is included in the non-guarantor subsidiaries condensed consolidating financial information.
the financial condition of the parent, issuer and guarantor subsidiaries is substantially similar to the company's consolidated financial condition. similarly, the results of operations of the parent, issuer and guarantor subsidiaries are substantially similar to the company's consolidated results of operations. as of december 31, 2014 and december 31, 2013, the most significant components of the financial condition of the non-guarantor subsidiaries were property and equipment of $537 million and $595 million, respectively, long-term financial obligations of $2.3 billion and $2.1 billion, respectively, and stockholders' deficit of $1.5 billion and $1.3 billion, respectively. the most significant components of the results of operations of our non-guarantor subsidiaries in 2014 were services revenues of $1.3 billion, offset by costs of equipment sales of $702 million resulting in a net comprehensive loss of $38 million. similarly, for 2013, services revenues of $823 million were offset by costs of equipment sales of $552 million, resulting in a net comprehensive loss of $52 million.
revenues branded postpaid revenues decreased $1.4 billion, or 9%, in 2013, compared to 2012. the decrease was primarily attributable to lower arpa. branded postpaid arpa was negatively impacted by the growth of our simple choice plans which have lower priced rate plans than other branded postpaid rate plans. compared to other traditional bundled postpaid price plans, simple choice plans result in lower service revenues but higher equipment sales at the time of the purchase as the plans do not include a bundled sale of a discounted device. branded postpaid customers on simple choice plans more than doubled over the past twelve months to 69% of the branded postpaid customer base at december 31, 2013, compared to 30% at december 31, 2012.
branded prepaid revenues increased $3.2 billion in 2013, compared to 2012. of the increase, approximately $2.9 billion was due to the inclusion of metropcs's operating results following the business combination in april 2013. excluding metropcs operating results, the increase in 2013 resulted primarily from an increase in average branded prepaid customers driven by the success of t-mobile's monthly prepaid service plans, including data services that also have higher arpu.
wholesale revenues increased $69 million, or 13%, in 2013, compared to 2012. the increase was primarily attributable to growth of the average number of mvno customers for the period. the increase in mvno customers was due in part to growth of government subsidized lifeline programs offered by our mvno partners along with mvno partnerships launched in the fourth quarter of 2012. however, a significant portion of our mvno partners' recent customer growth has been in lower arpu products that result in revenues that do not increase in proportion with customer growth.
roaming and other service revenues decreased $89 million, or 21%, in 2013, compared to 2012. the decrease was primarily attributable to lower early termination fees of $58 million due to the no annual service contract features of simple choice plans launched in march 2013. additionally, international voice and domestic data revenues decreased due to rate reductions negotiated with certain roaming partners.
equipment sales increased $2.8 billion, or 124%, in 2013, compared to 2012. the increase was primarily attributable to significant growth in the number of devices sold and an increase in the rate of customers upgrading their device. additionally, equipment sales increased due to growth in the sales of smartphones, which have higher average revenue per device sold as compared to other devices. this was driven by our introduction of both the apple iphone 5 and the samsung galaxy s®4 in the second quarter of 2013, and the apple iphone 5s and iphone 5c in the third quarter of 2013. additionally, the inclusion of metropcs's operating results following the business combination in april 2013 contributed approximately $450 million to the increase in equipment sales in 2013.
we financed $3.3 billion of equipment sales revenues through equipment installment plans in 2013, a significant increase from $946 million in 2012 resulting from growth in simple choice plans. additionally, customers had associated equipment installment plan billings of $1.5 billion in 2013, compared to $450 million in 2012.
operating expenses cost of services increased $618 million, or 13%, in 2013, compared to 2012. of the increase, approximately $800 million was due to the inclusion of the operating results of metropcs following the business combination in april 2013. cost of services, excluding metropcs, decreased due to lower roaming expenses of $126 million related to reduced roaming rates negotiated with certain roaming partners. additionally, due to the network transition to enhanced telecommunication lines with higher capacity, we were able to accommodate higher data volumes at a lower cost.
cost of equipment sales increased $3.5 billion, or 103%, in 2013, compared to 2012. the increase in cost of equipment sales was primarily attributable to a 67% increase in the volume of devices sold during 2013. the increase was partially attributable to higher average cost per device sold due in part to a 90% increase in the sale of smartphones units in 2013, compared to 2012. additionally, the inclusion of metropcs's operating results following the business combination in april 2013 contributed approximately $950 million to the increase in cost of equipment sales in 2013.
selling, general and administrative increased $586 million, or 9%, in 2013, compared to 2012. of the increase, approximately $650 million was attributable to the inclusion of operating results of metropcs following the business
combination in april 2013. selling, general and administrative expenses, excluding metropcs, decreased $61 million, or 1%, primarily driven by $241 million in lower bad debt expense, net of recoveries, as a result of improved credit quality of our customer portfolio. this decrease was partially offset by higher commission expenses driven by increased gross customer additions in 2013.
depreciation and amortization increased $440 million, or 14%, in 2013, compared to 2012. depreciation and amortization attributable to metropcs following the business combination in april 2013 was approximately $550 million. depreciation and amortization expenses, excluding metropcs, decreased in 2013 as 2012 included increased depreciation expense due to the shortening of useful lives of certain network equipment to be replaced in connection with network modernization efforts.
cost of metropcs business combination increased $101 million in 2013, compared to 2012 due primarily to personnel related costs associated with the change in control, professional services costs and network integration expenses associated with the business combination between t-mobile usa and metropcs. see also note 2 - business combination with metropcs of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii, item 8 of this form 10-k.

branded prepaid net customer additions were 1,244,000 in 2014, compared to branded prepaid net customer additions of 328,000 in 2013. the increase in customer development was attributable to higher branded prepaid gross customer additions due to the growth and expansion of the metropcs brand, including the launch into additional markets following the metropcs business combination in april 2013. this increase was offset in part by higher deactivations from the competitive environment in the prepaid market.
branded prepaid net customer additions, excluding customers of metropcs acquired as a result of the business combination, were 328,000 in 2013, compared to 1,007,000 branded prepaid net customer additions in 2012. the decrease was partly a result of qualified upgrades of branded prepaid customers to branded postpaid plans as the un-carrier proposition eliminates
annual service contracts to credit worthy customers that have historically been utilizing prepaid products. in addition, the robust competitive environment in the prepaid market resulted in higher branded prepaid customer deactivations, partially offset by higher branded prepaid gross customer additions due in part to the expansion of the metropcs brand, including the launch into 30 additional markets since the completion of the business combination.

wholesale net customer additions were 2,043,000 in 2013, compared to wholesale net customer additions of 1,270,000 in 2012. the growth in mvno customers was due in part to government subsidized lifeline programs offered by our mvno partners along with ongoing growth from mvno partnerships launched in the fourth quarter of 2012.

(1)   stock-based compensation includes tax impacts and may not agree to stock based compensation expense in the consolidated financial statements. gains on disposal of spectrum licenses and other, net transactions may not agree in total to the gains on disposal of spectrum licenses and other, net in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss) primarily due to certain routine operating activities, such as insignificant or routine spectrum license exchanges that would be expected to reoccur, and are therefore included in adjusted ebitda.
adjusted ebitda increased 15% for 2014, compared to 2013. adjusted ebitda was positively impacted by increased branded postpaid revenues resulting from the continued success of our un-carrier value proposition and strong customer response to promotional activities, as well as the inclusion of metropcs operating results since the business combination in 2013, including branded prepaid revenue growth from expansion of the metropcs brand. these increases were partially offset by higher selling, general and administrative expenses and losses on equipment sales.
adjusted ebitda was consistent for 2013, compared to 2012. the inclusion of metropcs's operating results since may 1, 2013, contributed approximately $1.0 billion in adjusted ebitda for 2013. excluding the adjusted ebitda contributed by metropcs's operating results, adjusted ebitda was negatively impacted by the reduction in service revenues, which declined primarily due to impacts from customers migrating to simple choice plans, which result in lower arpu. additionally, adjusted ebitda was negatively impacted by increases in cost of equipment sales from higher sales volumes, partially offset by increases in equipment sales. increases in costs of equipment sales and equipment sales were driven by higher gross customer additions and the launch of new handsets in 2013. in addition, equipment sales increased in 2013 due to a higher proportion of customers choosing simple choice plans for which we do not include a bundled sale of a discounted device.
adjusted ebitda in the first quarter of 2015 is expected to be significantly impacted by a large investment to front end customer growth in 2015, similar to what we did in 2014. in addition, the first quarter of 2015 will reflect the accounting treatment of un-carrier 8.0 - data stash, which is expected to have a non-cash impact in the range of $100 million to $150 million. the accounting treatment of the initial 10 gb allotment, which is a revenue deferral, is expected to fully reverse itself during 2015.
liquidity and capital resources our principal sources of liquidity are our cash and cash equivalents and cash generated from operations, proceeds from issuance of long-term debt and issuance of common and preferred stock, the sale of certain service receivables related to a factoring arrangement, and financing arrangements of vendor payables which effectively extend payment terms. in addition, we have entered into an unsecured revolving credit facility with deutsche telekom that allows for up to $500 million in borrowings. as of december 31, 2014, our cash and cash equivalents were $5.3 billion. we expect our current sources of funding to be sufficient to meet the anticipated liquidity requirements of the company in the next 12 months and intend to use our current sources of funding for general corporate purposes, including capital investments, enhancing our financial flexibility and opportunistically acquiring additional spectrum in private party transactions. we determine future liquidity requirements, for both operations and capital expenditures, based in large part upon projected financial and operating performance. we regularly review and update these projections for changes in current and projected financial and operating results, general economic conditions, the competitive landscape and other factors. there are a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause our financial and operating results and capital requirements to differ materially from our projections, which could cause future liquidity to differ materially from our assessment. we may seek to raise additional debt or equity capital to the extent our projections regarding our liquidity requirements change or on an opportunistic basis when there are favorable market conditions. further, we may consider entering into factoring arrangements to sell certain eip receivables as an additional source of liquidity.
prior to the completion of the business combination with metropcs in april 2013, our sources of liquidity were cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments with deutsche telekom included in accounts receivable from affiliates, and cash generated from operations.
as of december 31, 2014, our total capital consisted of total debt of $22.0 billion, excluding our long-term financial obligation related to the tower transaction, and stockholders' equity of $15.7 billion. in 2014, we completed an offering of new senior unsecured notes in aggregate principal amounts of $3.0 billion and used a portion of the proceeds from the issuance of the notes to redeem senior unsecured notes of $1.0 billion with a higher interest rate. in addition, in 2014, we completed a public offering of 20 million shares of preferred stock for net proceeds of $982 million. unless converted earlier, each share of the preferred stock will automatically convert in 2017 into between 1.6119 and 1.9342 shares of common stock depending on the applicable market value of the common stock. see note 8 - debt and note 14 - additional financial information of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii, item 8 of this form 10-k for further information.
in 2014, we completed transactions for the acquisition of 700 mhz a-block, aws and pcs spectrum licenses, primarily with verizon, for cash and the transfer of certain aws and pcs spectrum licenses. upon closing of the transactions in 2014, we paid $2.5 billion with cash on hand and transferred certain aws and pcs spectrum licenses. in addition, in 2014, the fcc began conducting an auction of aws spectrum licenses and t-mobile provided the fcc with a deposit of $417 million in connection with the auction. in january 2015, the fcc announced t-mobile was the winning bidder of aws spectrum licenses covering approximately 97 million people for an aggregate bid price of $1.8 billion. t-mobile will pay the fcc the remaining $1.4 billion for the aws spectrum licenses in march 2015 with cash on hand. t-mobile expects to receive the aws spectrum licenses, subject to regulatory approval, in the second quarter of 2015.
in 2014, we entered into a two-year factoring arrangement to sell certain receivables on a revolving basis as an additional source of liquidity. the factoring arrangement has a current maximum funding limit of $640 million, subject to change upon notification to certain third parties. we sold receivables related to the factoring arrangement for net cash proceeds of $610 million in 2014. see note 4 - factoring arrangement of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii, item 8 of this form 10-k for further information.
the indentures governing the long-term debt, excluding capital leases, contain covenants that, among other things, limit our ability to: incur more debt; pay dividends and make distributions on our common stock; make certain investments; repurchase stock; create liens or other encumbrances; enter into transactions with affiliates; enter into transactions that restrict dividends or distributions from subsidiaries; and merge, consolidate, or sell, or otherwise dispose of, substantially all of their assets. certain provisions of each of the indentures and the supplemental indentures relating to the long-term debt restrict the ability of the issuer to loan funds or make payments to the parent. however, the issuer is allowed to make certain permitted payments to the
parent under the terms of each of the indentures and the supplemental indentures relating to the long-term debt. we were in compliance with all restrictive debt covenants as of december 31, 2014.
capital expenditures our liquidity requirements have been driven primarily by capital expenditures for spectrum licenses and the construction, expansion and upgrading of our network infrastructure.
the property and equipment capital expenditures in 2014 and 2013 primarily relate to our network modernization and deployment of lte. the capital expenditures in 2012 were primarily associated with the continued expansion of our network coverage. during 2012, we were developing plans to deploy lte in 2013 after the terminated at&t transaction. as such, capital spending was lower in 2012 than in subsequent periods.
we expect cash capital expenditures for property and equipment to be in the range of $4.4 billion to $4.7 billion in 2015. this does not include purchases of spectrum licenses.
cash flows the following table summarizes the consolidated statements of cash flows:
net cash provided by operating activities      $4,146                $3,545                $3,862
the historical cash flows of t-mobile usa should not be considered representative of the anticipated cash flows of t-mobile us, inc., the combined company resulting from the business combination.
operating activities cash provided by operating activities was $4.1 billion in 2014, compared to $3.5 billion in 2013. the increase in cash flow provided by operating activities was driven by several factors. our operating income, exclusive of non-cash items such as depreciation and amortization and gains from spectrum license transactions, increased slightly compared to the prior year. this was primarily a result of increases in branded postpaid revenues due to our acceleration of customer growth partially offset by higher selling, general and administrative costs and losses on equipment sales. net changes in working capital increased slightly. this was primarily a result of increases in accounts payable and accrued liabilities due to the timing of vendor payments and proceeds from the sales of certain service receivables related to the factoring arrangement. the increases in working capital were mostly offset by increases in eip receivables as the result of significant growth in devices financed through eip and increases in inventories.
cash provided by operating activities was $3.5 billion in 2013, compared to $3.9 billion in 2012. the decrease in cash flow provided by operating activities was driven by several factors. our operating income, exclusive of non-cash items such as impairment charges and depreciation and amortization, declined compared to the same period in the prior year primarily as a result of decreases in branded postpaid revenues. net changes in working capital decreased slightly due to increases in eip receivables, offset in part by increases in accounts payable and accrued liabilities due in part to timing of vendor payments.
investing activities cash used in investing activities was $7.2 billion in 2014, compared to $2.1 billion used in 2013. in 2014, cash used in investing activities primarily consisted of purchases of property and equipment of $4.3 billion as a result of our network modernization and purchases of intangible assets of $2.9 billion due primarily to the acquisition of 700 mhz a-block spectrum licenses. in 2013, cash used in investing activities primarily consisted of purchases of property and equipment of $4.0 billion as a result of our network modernization. this was partially offset by cash and cash equivalents acquired in connection with the business combination with metropcs of $2.1 billion and the settlement of a short-term loan receivable, net with deutsche telekom of $300 million.
cash used in investing activities was $2.1 billion in 2013, compared to $3.9 billion used in 2012. the decrease was primarily due to the cash and cash equivalents acquired in connection with the business combination with metropcs of $2.1 billion. the decrease was partially offset by $1.1 billion higher purchases of property and equipment in 2013, as compared to 2012, as a result of t-mobile's network modernization in 2013 described above.
financing activities cash provided by financing activities was $2.5 billion in 2014, compared to $4.0 billion in 2013. the decrease was primarily due to higher repayments of long-term debt of $1.0 billion, lower net proceeds from the issuance of stock of $805 million, higher net repayments of short-term debt of $174 million and lower proceeds from the exercise of stock options of $110 million. the decrease was partially offset by higher net proceeds from the issuance of long-term debt of $499 million.
cash provided by financing activities was $4.0 billion in 2013, compared to $57 million in 2012. the increase was primarily due to net proceeds of $2.5 billion from the issuance of long-term debt, net proceeds from the issuance of common stock of $1.8 billion, and proceeds from the exercises of stock options issued of $137 million. the increase was offset by repayments of short-term debt for purchases of property and equipment of $244 million, the purchase of cook inlet's interest in civs vii of $80 million, and a distribution to deutsche telekom of $41 million in connection with the recapitalization of t-mobile usa effected immediately prior to the completion of the business combination with metropcs.
contractual obligations current accounting standards require disclosure of material obligations and commitments to make future payments under contracts, such as debt, lease agreements, and purchase obligations. see note 8 - debt and note 13 - commitments and contingencies of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii, item 8 of this form 10-k.
the following table provides aggregate information about t-mobile's contractual obligations as of december 31, 2014:
capital lease obligations, including interest                           49                     102                   107                       319                     577
financial obligation (2)                                               166                     332                   332                     1,316                   2,146
operating leases, including dedicated transportation lines           2,289                   4,073                 3,420                     5,520                  15,302
(1)   represents principal amounts of long-term debt at maturity, excluding unamortized premium from purchase price allocation fair value adjustment, capital lease obligations and vendor financing arrangements.
(2)   future minimum payments, including principal and interest payments and imputed lease rental income, related to the long-term financial obligation recorded in connection with the tower transaction. see note 9 - tower transaction and related long-term financial obligation of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii, item 8 of this form 10-k for further information.
(3)   t-mobile calculated the minimum obligation for certain agreements to purchase goods or services based on termination fees that can be paid to exit the contract. termination penalties are included in the above table as payments due in less than one year, as this is the earliest t-mobile could exit these contracts. for certain contracts that include fixed volume purchase commitments and fixed prices for various products, the purchase obligations are calculated using fixed volumes and contractually fixed prices for the products that are expected to be purchased. this table does not include open purchase orders as of december 31, 2014 under normal business purposes.
(4)   represents future undiscounted cash flows related to decommissioned metropcs cdma network and certain other redundant cell sites as of december 31, 2014. see note 2 - business combination with metropcs of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii, item 8 of this form 10-k for further information.
certain commitments and obligations are included in the table based on the year of required payment or an estimate of the year of payment. other long-term liabilities, excluding network decommissioning, have been omitted from the table above due to the uncertainty of the timing of payments, combined with the absence of historical trending to be used as a predictor of such payments. in addition, dividends on preferred stock have been excluded from the table above as no dividends were declared for the year ended december 31, 2014. see note 14 - additional financial information of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii, item 8 of this form 10-k for further information.
the purchase obligations reflected in the table above are primarily commitments to purchase handsets and accessories, equipment, software, programming and network services, and marketing activities, which will be used or sold in the ordinary course of business. these amounts do not represent t-mobile's entire anticipated purchases in the future, but represent only those items for which t-mobile is contractually committed. the company also has purchase obligations that vary with the level of the company's sales of certain products. the future development of sales of those products could result in purchase obligations in excess of the amounts shown in the table above. where t-mobile is committed to make a minimum payment to the supplier regardless of whether it takes delivery, t-mobile has included only that minimum payment as a purchase obligation. additionally, included within purchase obligations are amounts for the acquisition of spectrum licenses, which are subject to regulatory approval and other customary closing conditions.
off-balance sheet arrangements in 2014, t-mobile entered into a two-year factoring arrangement to sell certain service accounts receivable on a revolving basis as an additional source of liquidity. as of december 31, 2014, t-mobile derecognized net receivables of $768 million upon
sale through the factoring arrangement.  see note 4 - factoring arrangement of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii, item 8 of this form 10-k for further information.
related party transactions see note 14 - additional financial information of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii, item 8 of this form 10-k for information regarding related party transactions.
disclosure of iranian activities under section 13(r) of the securities exchange act of 1934
section 219 of the iran threat reduction and syria human rights act of 2012 added section 13(r) to the exchange act of 1934, as amended ("exchange act").  section 13(r) requires an issuer to disclose in its annual or quarterly reports, as applicable, whether it or any of its affiliates knowingly engaged in certain activities, transactions or dealings relating to iran or with designated natural persons or entities involved in terrorism or the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.  disclosure is required even where the activities, transactions or dealings are conducted outside the u.s. by non-u.s. affiliates in compliance with applicable law, and whether or not the activities are sanctionable under u.s. law.
as of the date of this report, we are not aware of any activity, transaction or dealing by us or any of our affiliates in 2014 that requires disclosure in this report under section 13(r) of the exchange act, except as set forth below with respect to affiliates that we do not control and that are our affiliates solely due to their common control with deutsche telekom. we have relied upon deutsche telekom for information regarding their activities, transactions and dealings.
deutsche telekom, through certain of its non-u.s. subsidiaries, is party to roaming and interconnect agreements with the following mobile and fixed line telecommunication providers in iran, some of which are or may be government-controlled entities: gostaresh ertebatat taliya, irancell telecommunications services company ("mtn irancell"), telecommunication kish company, mobile telecommunication company of iran, and telecommunication infrastructure company of iran. in 2014, gross revenues of all deutsche telekom affiliates generated by roaming and interconnection traffic with iran were less than $2 million and estimated net profits were less than $2 million.
in addition, deutsche telekom, through certain of its non-u.s. subsidiaries, operating a fixed line network in their respective european home countries (in particular germany), provides telecommunications services in the ordinary course of business to the embassy of iran in those european countries. gross revenues and net profits recorded from these activities in 2014 were less than $0.4 million. we understand that deutsche telekom intends to continue these activities.
critical accounting policies and estimates preparation of our consolidated financial statements in accordance with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles ("gaap") requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of certain assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, as well as related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. significant accounting policies are fundamental to understanding our financial condition and results as they require the use of estimates and assumptions which affect the financial statements and accompanying notes. see note 1 - summary of significant accounting policies of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii, item 8 of this form 10-k for further information.
critical accounting policies, which we discuss further below, are those which are both most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results, and require management to make difficult, subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters which are inherently uncertain. estimates are based on historical experience, where applicable, and other assumptions that management believes are reasonable under the circumstances. these estimates are inherently subject to judgment and actual results could differ from those estimates.
allowances we maintain an allowance for estimated losses resulting from the failure of customers to make required payments. when determining the allowance, we consider the probability of recovery based on past experience taking into account current collection trends and general economic factors. collection risks are assessed for each type of receivable, including eip receivables, based upon historical and expected write-offs, net of recoveries, and an analysis of the aged accounts receivable balances with reserves generally increasing as the receivable ages. to the extent that actual loss experience differs significantly from historical trends or assumptions, the required allowance amounts could differ from the estimate. we write off account balances if collection efforts are unsuccessful and future collection is unlikely, based on customer credit ratings and the length of time from the original billing date.
we offer certain retail customers the option to pay for devices and other accessories in installments using an eip. at the time of an installment sale, we impute a discount for interest as there is no stated rate of interest on the eip receivables and record the eip receivables at their present value, which is determined by discounting all expected future payments at the imputed interest rate. the difference between the present value of the eip receivables and their face amount results in a discount which is recorded as a direct reduction to the carrying value with a corresponding reduction to equipment sales. we determine the imputed discount rate based primarily on current market interest rates and the amount of expected credit losses on the eip receivables. as a result, we do not recognize a separate valuation allowance at the time of issuance as the effects of uncertainty about future cash flows are included in the initial present value measurement of the receivable. the current portion of the eip receivables is included in equipment installment plan receivables, net and the long-term portion of the eip receivables is included in equipment installment plan receivables due after one year, net. the imputed discount on eip receivables is amortized over the financed installment term using the interest method and recognized as interest income in other income (expenses), net.
subsequent to the initial determination of the imputed discount, we assess the need for and, if necessary, recognize an allowance for credit losses to the extent the expected credit losses on the gross eip receivables exceed the remaining unamortized imputed discount balances.  the allowance is based on a number of factors, including collection experience, aging of the accounts receivable portfolio, credit quality of the customer base and other qualitative factors such as macro-economic conditions.
total imputed discount and allowances as of december 31, 2014 and 2013 was approximately 7.4% and 8.6%, respectively, of the total amount of gross accounts receivable, including eip receivables.
depreciation depreciation commences once assets have been placed in service and is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of each asset. depreciable life studies are performed periodically to confirm the appropriateness of depreciable lives for certain categories of property, plant and equipment. these studies take into account actual usage, physical wear and tear, replacement history and assumptions about technology evolution. when these factors indicate that an asset's useful life is different from the previous assessment, the remaining book values are depreciated prospectively over the adjusted remaining estimated useful life. see note 1 - summary of significant accounting policies and note 5 - property and equipment of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii, item 8 of this form 10-k for information regarding depreciation of assets, including management's underlying estimates of useful lives.
evaluation of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment we assess the carrying value of goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets (spectrum licenses) for potential impairment annually as of december 31 or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that assets might be impaired.
we may elect to first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not the fair value of the single reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform the two-step goodwill impairment test. if we do not perform a qualitative assessment, or if the qualitative assessment indicates it is more likely than not the fair value of the single reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, goodwill is tested for impairment based on a two-step test. in the first step, we compare the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value. the fair value of the reporting unit is determined using a market method, which is based on market capitalization. we recognize market capitalization is subject to volatility and will monitor changes in market capitalization to determine whether declines, if any, necessitate an interim impairment review. in the event market capitalization does decline below its book value, we will consider the length, severity and reasons for the decline when assessing whether potential impairment exists, including considering whether a control premium should be added to the market capitalization. we believe short-term fluctuations in share price may not necessarily reflect the underlying aggregate fair value. historically, we estimated the fair value of the reporting unit using a discounted cash flow approach due to the absence of comparable observable market data.  the discounted cash flow method utilizes future cash flow assumptions based on estimates of revenues, ebitda margin and a long-term growth rate taking into consideration expected industry and market conditions. the cash flows are then discounted using a weighted average cost of capital reflecting the risks associated with the business and the projected cash flows. if the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds the fair value, the second step of the test is performed.
in the second step, we determine the fair values of all of the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit, including those that currently may not be recorded. the excess of the fair value of the reporting unit over the sum of the fair value of all of those assets and liabilities represents the implied goodwill amount. if the implied fair value of goodwill is lower than the carrying amount of goodwill, then an impairment loss is recognized for the difference.
we test spectrum licenses for impairment on an aggregate basis, consistent with the management of the overall business at a national level. we may elect to first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of an intangible asset group is less than its carrying value. if we do not perform the qualitative assessment, or if the qualitative assessment indicates it is more likely than not the fair value of the intangible asset group is less than its carrying amount, we calculate the estimated fair value of the intangible asset group. if the carrying amount of spectrum licenses exceeds the fair value, an impairment loss is recognized.  we estimate the fair value of the spectrum licenses using the greenfield approach, which is an income approach that estimates the price at which an orderly transaction to sell the asset would take place between market participants at the measurement date under current market conditions. the greenfield approach values the spectrum licenses by calculating the cash flow generating potential of a hypothetical start-up company that goes into business with no assets except the asset to be valued (in this case, spectrum licenses). the value of the spectrum licenses can be considered as equal to the present value of the cash flows of this hypothetical start-up company. we base the assumptions underlying the greenfield approach on a combination of market participant data and our historical results, trends and business plans. future cash flows in the greenfield approach are based on estimates and assumptions of market participant revenues, ebitda margin, network build-out period, and a long-term growth rate for a market participant. the cash flows are discounted using a weighted average cost of capital.
the valuation approaches utilized to estimate fair value for the purposes of the impairment tests of goodwill and spectrum licenses require the use of assumptions and estimates, which involve a degree of uncertainty. if actual results or future expectations are not consistent with the assumptions, this may result in the recording of significant impairment charges on goodwill or spectrum licenses. the most significant assumptions within the valuation models are the discount rate, revenues, ebitda margins and the long-term growth rate. as a result of an impairment test performed in 2012, we recorded an impairment charge on goodwill. see note 1 - summary of significant accounting policies and note 6 - goodwill, spectrum licenses and intangible assets of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii, item 8 of this form 10-k for information regarding our annual impairment test and impairment charges.
guarantee liabilities in 2013, we introduced a handset upgrade program, jump!, which provides enrolled customers a specific-price trade-in right to upgrade their device. participating customers must purchase a device from us, have a qualifying monthly wireless service plan with us, and finance their handset using our eip, which is treated as a single multiple-element arrangement when entered into at
or near the same time. upon qualifying jump! program upgrades, the customers' remaining eip balance is settled provided they trade in their eligible used device in good working condition and purchase a new handset from us on a new eip.
for customers who enroll in the trade-in program, we defer a portion of equipment sales revenue which represents the estimated value of the specified-price trade-in right guarantee. the guarantee liabilities are valued based on various economic and customer behavioral assumptions, which require judgment, including the customer's estimated remaining eip balance at trade-in, the expected fair value of the used device at trade-in, and probability and timing of trade-in. when the customer upgrades their device, the difference between the trade-in credit to the customer and the fair value of the returned handset is recorded against the guarantee liabilities. all assumptions are reviewed periodically.
rent expense most of the leases on our tower sites have fixed rent escalations which provide for periodic increases in the amount of rent payable over time. we calculate straight-line rent expense for each of these leases based on the fixed non-cancellable term of the lease plus all periods, if any, for which failure to renew the lease imposes a penalty on us in such amount that a renewal appears, at lease inception, to be reasonably assured. we make significant assumptions at lease inception in determining and assessing the factors that constitute a "penalty". in doing so, we primarily consider costs incurred in acquiring and developing new sites, the useful life of site improvements and equipment costs, future economic conditions and the extent to which improvements in wireless technologies can be incorporated into a current assessment of whether an economic compulsion will exist in the future to renew a lease.
income taxes we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities based on temporary differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates expected to be in effect when these differences are realized. a valuation allowance is maintained against deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. the ultimate realization of a deferred tax asset depends on the ability to generate sufficient taxable income of the appropriate character and in the appropriate taxing jurisdictions within the carryforward periods available. we consider many factors when determining whether a valuation allowance is needed, including recent cumulative earnings experience by taxing jurisdiction, expectations of future income, the carryforward periods available for tax reporting purposes and other relevant factors.
we account for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in the financial statements in accordance with the accounting guidance on the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. we assess whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination based on the technical merits of the position and adjust the unrecognized tax benefits in light of changes in facts and circumstances, such as changes in tax law, interactions with taxing authorities and developments in case law.
recently issued accounting standards see note 1 - summary of significant accounting policies of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii, item 8 of this form 10-k for information regarding recently issued accounting standards.

item 7   managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations
overview managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is intended to help the reader understand the results of operations and financial condition of resmed inc and subsidiaries. it is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with the selected financial data and consolidated financial statements and notes included elsewhere in this report.
we are a leading developer, manufacturer and distributor of medical equipment for treating, diagnosing, and managing sleep-disordered breathing (sdb) and other respiratory disorders. during the fiscal year, we continued our efforts to build awareness of the consequences of untreated sdb and to grow our business in this market. in our efforts, we have attempted to raise awareness through market and clinical initiatives and by highlighting the increasing link between the potential effects sdb can have on co-morbidities such as cardiac disease, diabetes, hypertension and obesity.
there are many studies being conducted that provide new evidence that treating sdb and osa can improve health, quality of life and also mitigate the dangers of sleep apnea in occupational health and safety, especially in the transport industry. evidence continues to mount supporting the role of sdb therapy for disease prevention, improvement of quality of life and healthcare cost reduction. the following three recent studies support the role of sdb therapy for disease prevention, improvement of quality of life and healthcare cost reduction:
                                                    in a resmed-sponsored study published in population health management involving 22,000 members on the union pacific railroad health plan, findings suggest that a low-cost, patient-focused sdb education campaign can improve healthcare outcomes and reduce medical expenses. first, the study showed that members of the union pacific plan who had untreated sdb had higher medical expenses than employees without the disease and, second, it demonstrated that treatment of sdb with positive airway pressure (pap) therapy reduced medical costs, in-patient costs and hospital admissions. after the campaign was initiated, the healthcare plan realized cost savings of $4.9 million over a two-year period.
   a study published in the june 2012 issue of the american journal of managed care demonstrated that newly diagnosed sdb patients who initiated pap therapy had significantly lower hospitalization risk and lower all-cause healthcare costs compared to patients who did not use pap.
   in the july 2013 issue of the journal of cardiac failure, a study showed that central sleep apnea and severe obstructive sleep apnea are independent risk factors for six-month cardiac hospital readmission.
we are committed to ongoing investment in research and development and product enhancements. during fiscal year 2014, we invested approximately $118.2 million on research and development activities, which represents approximately 8% of net revenues. since the development of cpap, we have developed a number of innovative products for the treatment of sdb and other respiratory disorders including airflow generators, diagnostic products, mask systems, headgear and other accessories. during fiscal year 2014, we released new products across both our mask and flow generator categories, including the airfit p10, airfit n10 and airfitf10 masks and the astral, our new generation life support ventilator. the release of these products as well as the release of vpap copd, quattro air, swift fx bella, swift fx nano and resmeds sleepseeker in fiscal 2013, and a robust product pipeline, will continue to provide us with a strong platform for future growth.
net revenue in fiscal year 2014 increased to $1,555.0 million, an increase of 3% compared to fiscal year 2013. gross profit increased for the year ended june 30, 2014 to $989.8 million, from $940.7
million for the year ended june 30, 2013, an increase of $49.1 million or 5%. our net income for the year ended june 30, 2014 was $345.3 million or $2.39 per diluted share compared to net income of $307.1 million or $2.10 per diluted share for the year ended june 30, 2013.
total operating cash flow for fiscal year 2014 was $391.3 million and at june 30, 2014, our cash and cash equivalents totaled $905.7 million. our total assets increased by 7% to $2.4 billion and our stockholders equity was $1.8 billion. during fiscal year 2014, we repurchased 4.4 million shares at a cost of $208.1 million under our share repurchase program, compared to 4.3 million shares at a cost of $188.0 million during fiscal year 2013. we paid a quarterly dividend of $0.25 per share during fiscal 2014 with a total amount of $141.5 million paid to stockholders.
in order to provide a framework for assessing how our underlying businesses performed, excluding the effect of foreign currency fluctuations, we provide certain financial information on a constant currency basis, which is in addition to the actual financial information presented. in order to calculate our constant currency information, we translate the current period financial information using the foreign currency exchange rates that were in effect during the previous comparable period. however, constant currency measures should not be considered in isolation or as an alternative to u.s. dollar measures that reflect current period exchange rates, or to other financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles.
net revenues.    net revenue increased for the year ended june 30, 2014 to $1,555.0 million from $1,514.5 million for the year ended june 30, 2013, an increase of $40.5 million or 3%. the increase in net revenue was attributable to an increase in unit sales of our flow generators, masks and accessories, partially offset by a decline in average selling prices. movements in international currencies against the u.s. dollar positively impacted net revenues by approximately $17.0 million for the year ended june 30, 2014. excluding the impact of foreign currency movements, sales for the year ended june 30, 2014 increased by 2% compared to the year ended june 30, 2013.
net revenue in north and latin america decreased for the year ended june 30, 2014 to $839.1 million from $851.6 million for the year ended june 30, 2013, a decrease of $12.5 million or 1%. the decrease in net revenue is primarily attributable to increased competitor activity and a decline in average selling prices, partially offset by an increase in unit sales of our flow generators, masks and accessories.
net revenue in markets outside north and latin america increased for the year ended june 30, 2014 to $715.8 million from $662.8 million for the year ended june 30, 2013, an increase of $53.0 million or 8%. movements in international currencies against the u.s. dollar favorably impacted international revenues by approximately $17.0 million during the year ended june 30, 2014. excluding the impact of foreign currency movements, international sales for the year ended june 30, 2014 increased by 5%, compared to the year ended june 30, 2013. the increase in sales outside north and latin america predominantly reflects an increase in unit sales of our flow generators, masks and accessories.
net revenue from flow generators for the year ended june 30, 2014 totaled $846.7 million from $823.5 million for the year ended june 30, 2013, an increase of 3%, including an increase of 7% outside north and latin america and a decrease of 2% in north and latin america. net revenue from masks and other accessories totaled $708.3 million, an increase of 3%, including an increase of 10% outside north and latin america and a 1% decrease in north and latin america, for the year ended june 30, 2014, compared to the year ended june 30, 2013.
* constant currency numbers exclude the impact of movements in international currencies.
gross profit.    gross profit increased for the year ended june 30, 2014 to $989.8 million from $940.7 million for the year ended june 30, 2013, an increase of $49.1 million or 5%. gross profit as a percentage of net revenue was 63.7% for the year ended june 30, 2014, compared with the 62.1% for the year ended june 30, 2013. the improvement in gross margins was primarily due to cost savings attributable to manufacturing and supply chain improvements, favorable change in product mix as sales of our higher margin products represented a higher proportion of our sales, positive foreign currency impact due to the depreciation of the australian dollar against the u.s. dollar and euro, and a favorable geographic mix of sales, partially offset by declines in our average selling prices.
selling, general and administrative expenses.    selling, general and administrative expenses increased for the year ended june 30, 2014 to $450.4 million from $430.8 million for the year ended june 30, 2013, an increase of $19.6 million or 5%. the selling, general and administrative expenses were favorably impacted by the movement of international currencies against the u.s. dollar, which decreased our expenses by approximately $4.6 million, as reported in u.s. dollars. excluding the impact of foreign currency movements, selling, general and administrative expenses for the year ended june 30, 2014 increased by 6% compared to the year ended june 30, 2013. as a percentage of net revenue, selling, general and administrative expenses for the year ended june 30, 2014 was 29.0%, compared to 28.4% for the year ended june 30, 2013.
the increase in selling, general and administrative expenses was primarily due to an increase the number of sales and administrative personnel to support our growth and other expenses related to the increase in our sales including activities targeted at increasing the awareness and diagnosis of sdb, as well as an increase in our patent litigation expenses.
research and development expenses.    research and development expenses decreased for the year ended june 30, 2014 to $118.2 million from $120.1 million for the year ended june 30, 2013, a decrease of $1.9 million or 2%. the research and development expenses were favorably impacted by the depreciation of the australian dollar against the u.s. dollar, which decreased our expenses by approximately $9.0 million, as reported in u.s. dollars. excluding the impact of foreign currency movements, research and development expenses for the year ended june 30, 2014 increased by 6% compared to the year ended june 30, 2013. as a percentage of net revenue, research and development expenses were 7.6% for the year ended june 30, 2014 compared to 7.9% for the year ended june 30, 2013.
the increase in research and development expenses in constant currency terms was primarily due to an increase in the number of research and development personnel, consulting and contractor expenses and an increase in materials and tooling costs incurred to facilitate development of new products.
amortization of acquired intangible assets.    amortization of acquired intangible assets for the year ended june 30, 2014 totaled $9.7 million compared to $10.1 million for the year ended june 30, 2013.
restructuring expenses.    during the year ended june 30, 2014 we completed a reorganization of our commercial and research and development teams. as a result of this reorganization we terminated the employment of approximately 1% of our employees at a total cost of $6.3 million.
total other income, net.    total other income, net for the year ended june 30, 2014 was $26.0 million, a decrease of $4.3 million compared with $30.3 million for the year ended june 30, 2013. the decrease in total other income, net, was due primarily to lower interest income resulting from lower interest rates on cash balances held, and the depreciation of the australian dollar against the u.s. dollar, partially offset by gains on foreign currency transactions.
income taxes.    our effective income tax rate decreased to 19.9% for the year ended june 30, 2014 from 20.2% for the year ended june 30, 2013. our effective income tax rate is affected by the geographic mix of our taxable income, including lower taxes associated with our singapore and malaysia manufacturing operations. our singapore and malaysia operations operate under certain tax holidays and tax incentive programs which will expire in whole or in part at various dates through june 30, 2020. as of june 30, 2014, we have not provided for u.s. income taxes for the undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries. we intend these earnings to be permanently reinvested outside the united states.
net income and earnings per share.    as a result of the factors above, our net income for the year ended june 30, 2014 was $345.3 million compared to net income of $307.1 million for the year ended june 30, 2013, an increase of 12% over the year ended june 30, 2013. as a result of the increase in our net income and lower share count due to our stock repurchases, our earnings per share for the year ended june 30, 2014 was $2.39 per diluted share compared to $2.10 per diluted share for the year ended june 30, 2013, an increase of 14% over the year ended june 30, 2013.
net revenues.    net revenue increased for the year ended june 30, 2013 to $1,514.5 million from $1,368.5 million for the year ended june 30, 2012, an increase of $145.9 million or 11%. the increase in net revenue was attributable to an increase in unit sales of our flow generators, masks and accessories. movements in international currencies against the u.s. dollar negatively impacted revenues by approximately $15.1 million for the year ended june 30, 2013. excluding the impact of unfavorable foreign currency movements, sales for the year ended june 30, 2013 increased by 12% compared to the year ended june 30, 2012.
net revenue in north and latin america increased for the year ended june 30, 2013 to $851.6 million from $749.0 million for the year ended june 30, 2012, an increase of $102.6 million or 14%. we believe this increase primarily reflected growth in the overall sdb market and market share gains in the apap and bilevel flow generator segments.
net revenue in markets outside north and latin america increased for the year ended june 30, 2013 to $662.8 million from $619.5 million for the year ended june 30, 2012, an increase of $43.4 million or 7%. excluding the impact of unfavorable foreign currency movements, international sales for the year ended june 30, 2013 increased by 9%, compared to the year ended june 30, 2012. we believe this increase in sales outside north and latin america predominantly reflects growth in the overall sdb market.
net revenue from flow generators for the year ended june 30, 2013 totaled $823.5 million from $736.6 million for the year ended june 30, 2012, an increase of 12%, including increases of 18% in north and latin america and 7% elsewhere. net revenue from mask systems, motors and other accessories totaled $690.9 million, an increase of 9%, including increases of 11% in north and latin
america and 7% elsewhere, for the year ended june 30, 2013, compared to the year ended june 30, 2012. we believe these increases primarily reflect growth in the overall sdb market and market share gains in the apap and bilevel flow generator segments.
* constant currency numbers exclude the impact of movements in international currencies.
gross profit.    gross profit increased for the year ended june 30, 2013 to $940.7 million from $820.7 million for the year ended june 30, 2012, an increase of $119.9 million or 15%. gross profit as a percentage of net revenue was 62.1% for the year ended june 30, 2013, compared with the 60.0% for the year ended june 30, 2012. the improvement in gross margins was primarily due to cost savings attributable to manufacturing and supply chain improvements, and favorable change in product mix as sales of our higher margin products represented a higher proportion of our sales, partially offset by declines in our average selling prices.
selling, general and administrative expenses.    selling, general and administrative expenses increased for the year ended june 30, 2013 to $430.8 million from $402.6 million for the year ended june 30, 2012, an increase of $28.2 million or 7%. as a percentage of net revenue, selling, general and administrative expenses for the year ended june 30, 2013 was 28%, compared to 29% for the year ended june 30, 2012.
the increase in selling, general and administrative expenses was primarily due to an increase in the number of sales and administrative personnel to support our growth and other expenses related to the increase in our sales including activities targeted at increasing the awareness and diagnosis of sdb.
research and development expenses.    research and development expenses increased for the year ended june 30, 2013 to $120.1 million from $109.7 million for the year ended june 30, 2012, an increase of $10.4 million or 9%. as a percentage of net revenue, research and development expenses were 8% for the year ended june 30, 2013 compared to 8% for the year ended june 30, 2012.
the increase in research and development expenses was primarily due to an increase in the number of research and development personnel, consulting and contractor expenses and an increase in materials and tooling costs incurred to facilitate development of new products.
education, research and settlement charge.    during the year ended june 30, 2013 we agreed to pay the university of sydney $24.8 million to establish two perpetual academic chairs, fund future research in the fields of sleep medicine and biomedical engineering, and settle legal proceedings between us. we expensed the full amount of $24.8 million ($17.7 million, net of tax) in the year ended june 30, 2013 within our operating expenses and separately disclosed the amount as an education, research and settlement charge.
amortization of acquired intangible assets.    amortization of acquired intangible assets for the year ended june 30, 2013 totaled $10.1 million compared to $14.0 million for the year ended june 30, 2012. the reduction in amortization expense was mainly attributable to certain acquired intangibles reaching the end of their useful life and therefore being fully amortized.
total other income, net.    total other income, net for the year ended june 30, 2013 was $30.3 million, a decrease of $7.2 million compared with $37.5 million for the year ended june 30, 2012. the decrease in total other income, net, was due primarily to losses on foreign currency transactions, partially offset by an increase in interest income, due primarily to an increase in cash balances held.
income taxes.    our effective income tax rate decreased to 20.2% for the year ended june 30, 2013 from 23.2% for the year ended june 30, 2012. the lower effective income tax rate was primarily due to a change in the geographic mix of our taxable income, including the lower statutory tax rates and other incentives associated with our singapore and malaysia manufacturing operations.
net income.    as a result of the factors above and share repurchases, our net income and earnings per share for the year ended june 30, 2013 was $307.1 million or $2.10 per diluted share compared to net income of $254.9 million or $1.71 per diluted share for the year ended june 30, 2012, an increase of 21% and 23%, respectively, over the year ended june 30, 2012.
liquidity and capital resources as of june 30, 2014 and june 30, 2013, we had cash and cash equivalents of $905.7 million and $876.0 million, respectively. working capital was $1.3 billion and $874.8 million at june 30, 2014 and june 30, 2013, respectively. the increase in working capital balance is primarily due to the renewal of our long term credit facility.
as of june 30, 2014 and june 30, 2013, our cash and cash equivalent balances held within the united states amounted to $29.0 million and $38.2 million, respectively. our remaining cash and cash equivalent balances at june 30, 2014 and june 30, 2013, of $876.7 million and $837.8 million, respectively, were held by our non-u.s. subsidiaries, indefinitely invested outside the united states. our cash and cash equivalent balances are held at highly rated financial institutions.
as of june 30, 2014, the cumulative amount of undistributed earnings from our foreign subsidiaries was approximately $1.5 billion, and those undistributed earnings are considered permanently reinvested. we intend to reinvest the cash and cash equivalents of those entities whose undistributed earnings are permanently reinvested in our international operations. we reassess our reinvestment assertions each reporting period and currently believe that we have sufficient sources of liquidity to support our assertion that the undistributed earnings held by foreign subsidiaries may be considered to be reinvested permanently. if these earnings had not been permanently reinvested, deferred taxes of approximately $344 million would have been recognized in our consolidated financial statements.
we repatriated $191 million and $185 million to the u.s. in fiscal years 2014 and 2013, respectively, from earnings generated in each of those years. the amount of the current year foreign earnings that we have repatriated to the u.s. in the past has been determined, and the amount that we expect to repatriate during fiscal year 2015 will be determined, based on a variety of factors, including current year earnings of our foreign subsidiaries, foreign investment needs and the cash flow needs we have in the u.s., such as for the repayment of debt, dividend distributions, and other domestic obligations. the majority of our repatriation of foreign subsidiaries earnings to the u.s. has historically occurred at year-end, although we may repatriate funds earlier in the year based on our business needs. when we repatriate funds to the u.s., we are required to pay taxes in the u.s. on these amounts based on applicable u.s. tax rates, net of any foreign tax that would be allowed to be deducted or taken as a credit against u.s. income tax. we paid $10.7 million and $19.3 million in additional u.s. federal income taxes in fiscal years 2014 and 2013, respectively, as a result of repatriation of foreign earnings generated in those years.
inventories at june 30, 2014 increased by $19.6 million or 13% to $165.4 million compared to june 30, 2013 inventories of $145.8 million. the increase in inventories was due mainly to recent new product introductions and an increase in inventories held to support the increase in unit sales.
accounts receivable, net of allowance for doubtful accounts, at june 30, 2014 were $359.6 million, an increase of $41.2 million or 13% over the june 30, 2013 accounts receivable balance of $318.3 million. accounts receivable days sales outstanding of 76 days at june 30, 2014 increased by 11 days compared to 65 days at june 30, 2013. the increase in our accounts receivable balance and days sales is mainly due to longer payment terms in our domestic market. our allowance for doubtful accounts as a percentage of total accounts receivable at june 30, 2014 and 2013 was 3.0% and 3.0%, respectively. the credit quality of our customers remains broadly consistent with our past experience.
during the year ended june 30, 2014, we generated cash of $391.3 million from operations. this was slightly lower than the cash generated from operations for the year ended june 30, 2013 of $402.8 million, which was primarily the result of the increase in our inventory balance. movements in foreign currency exchange rates during the year ended june 30, 2014 had the effect of increasing our cash and cash equivalents by $30.7 million, as reported in u.s. dollars. during fiscal years 2014 and 2013, we repurchased 4.4 million and 4.3 million shares at a cost of $208.1 million and $188.0 million, respectively. during fiscal years 2014 and 2013, we also paid dividends totaling $141.5 million and $97.2 million, respectively.

*the above guarantees mainly relate to requirements under contractual obligations with insurance companies transacting with our german subsidiaries and guarantees provided under our facility leasing obligations.
credit facility on october 31, 2013, we entered into a credit agreement, as borrower, with lenders, including union bank, n.a., as administrative agent, joint lead arranger, swing line lender and letters of credit issuer, and hsbc bank usa, national association, as syndication agent and joint lead arranger. our obligations under the credit agreement are guaranteed by resmed corp. and resmed motor technologies inc., two of our u.s. subsidiaries.
the credit agreement provides a $700 million senior unsecured five-year revolving credit facility, with an uncommitted option to increase the credit facility by an additional $300 million. the credit facility also includes a $25 million sublimit for letters of credit. the credit facility terminates on october 31, 2018, when all unpaid principal and interest under the loans must be repaid. the outstanding principal amount due under the credit facility will bear interest at a rate equal to libor
plus 1.0% to 2.0% (depending on the then-applicable leverage ratio). at june 30, 2014, the interest rate that was being charged on the outstanding principal amount was 1.2%. an applicable commitment fee of 0.15% to 0.25% (depending on the then-applicable leverage ratio) applies on the unused portion of the credit facility.
when we entered into the credit agreement, we used a portion of the proceeds from the initial funding of the credit facility to repay the outstanding balance under our previous revolving credit facility with union bank, n.a and other lenders. on that repayment, the previous credit agreement, dated as of february 10, 2011, between us and lenders (including union bank, n.a., as administrative agent, swing line lender and l/c issuer, hsbc bank usa, national association, as syndication agent and union bank, n.a., hsbc bank usa, national association, commonwealth bank of australia and wells fargo bank), was terminated and the commitments under the previous credit agreement were also terminated.
our obligations under the current credit agreement are unsecured but are guaranteed by two of our u.s. subsidiaries. the credit agreement contains customary covenants, including certain financial covenants and an obligation that we maintain certain financial ratios, including a maximum leverage ratio of funded debt to ebitda (as defined in the credit agreement) and an interest coverage ratio. the entire principal amount of the credit facility and any accrued but unpaid interest may be declared immediately due and payable if an event of default occurs, as defined in the credit agreement. events of default under the credit agreement include failure to make payments when due, the occurrence of a default in the performance of any covenants in the credit agreement or related documents, or certain changes of control of resmed inc., resmed corp., resmed motor technologies inc., resmed limited, resmed holdings ltd/llc or resmed eap holdings llc.
at june 30, 2014, we were in compliance with our debt covenants and there was $300.0 million outstanding under the credit agreement.
we expect to satisfy all of our liquidity requirements through a combination of cash on hand, cash generated from operations and debt facilities.
tax expense our income tax rate is governed by the laws of the regions in which our income is recognized. to date, a substantial portion of our income has been subject to income tax in australia where the statutory rate was 30% in fiscal years 2014, 2013 and 2012. during fiscal years 2014, 2013 and 2012, our consolidated effective tax rate has fluctuated between approximately 20% and approximately 23%. these fluctuations have resulted from, and future effective tax rates will depend on, numerous factors, including the amount of research and development expenditures for which an additional australian tax credit is available, the level of foreign earnings repatriated to the u.s., the geographic mix of taxable income and other tax credits or benefits available to us under applicable tax laws, including the lower statutory tax rates and other incentives associated with our singapore and malaysia manufacturing operations.
critical accounting principles and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect our reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. we evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis, including those estimates related to allowance for doubtful accounts, inventory adjustments, warranty obligations, goodwill, impaired assets, intangible assets, income taxes, deferred tax valuation allowances and stock-based compensation costs.
we state these accounting policies in the notes to the consolidated financial statements and at relevant sections in this discussion and analysis. the estimates are based on the information that is currently available to us and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. actual results could vary from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
we believe that the following critical accounting policies affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements:
(1)    allowance for doubtful accounts. we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments, which results in bad debt expense. we determine the adequacy of this allowance by periodically evaluating individual customer receivables, considering a customers financial condition, credit history and current economic conditions. if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate, resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments, additional allowances may be required.
(2)    inventory adjustments. inventories are stated at lower of cost or market and are determined by the first-in, first-out method. we review the components of inventory on a regular basis for excess, obsolete and impaired inventory based on estimated future usage and sales. the likelihood of any material inventory write-downs depends on changes in competitive conditions, new product introductions by us or our competitors, or rapid changes in customer demand.
(3)    valuation of goodwill, intangible and other long-lived assets. we make assumptions in establishing the carrying value, fair value and estimated lives of our goodwill, intangibles and other long-lived assets. the criteria used for these evaluations include managements estimate of the assets continuing ability to generate positive income from operations and positive cash flow in future periods compared to the carrying value of the asset, as well as the strategic significance of any identifiable intangible asset in our business objectives. if assets are considered to be impaired, we recognize as impairment the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds their fair value. we base useful lives and related amortization or depreciation expense on our estimate of the period that the assets will generate revenues or otherwise be used by us. factors that would influence the likelihood of a material change in our reported results include significant changes in the assets ability to generate positive cash flow, loss of legal ownership or title to the asset, a significant decline in the economic and competitive environment on which the asset depends, significant changes in our strategic business objectives, utilization of the asset, and a significant change in the economic and/or political conditions in certain countries.
we conducted our annual review for goodwill impairment during the final quarter of fiscal 2014 using a quantitative assessment. the results of our annual review indicated that no impaired goodwill exists as the fair value for each reporting unit significantly exceeded its carrying value.
(4)    income tax. we assess our income tax positions and record tax benefits for all years subject to examination based upon managements evaluation of the facts, circumstances, and information available at the reporting date. where we determine that it is not more likely than not that we would be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets in the future, an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would be charged to income tax expense in the period such determination is made. likewise, if we later determine that it is more likely than not that the net deferred tax assets would be realized, the previously provided valuation allowance would be reversed. these changes to the valuation allowance, and resulting increases or decreases in income tax expense, could have a material effect on our operating results.
our income tax returns are based on calculations and assumptions that are subject to examination by various tax authorities. in addition, the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with
uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws. although currently immaterial, we recognize liabilities for uncertain tax positions based on a two-step process. the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, if any. the second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50% likely of being realized upon settlement. while we believe we have appropriate support for the positions taken on our tax returns, we regularly assess the potential outcomes of examinations by tax authorities in determining the adequacy of our provision for income taxes, and adjust the income tax provision, income taxes payable and deferred taxes in the period in which the facts that give rise to a revision become known.
(5)    provision for warranty. we provide for the estimated cost of product warranties at the time the related revenue is recognized. we determine the amount of this provision by using a financial model, which takes into consideration actual historical expenses and potential risks associated with our different products. we use this financial model to calculate the future probable expenses related to warranty and the required level of the warranty provision. although we engage in product improvement programs and processes, our warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates and costs incurred to correct those product failures. should actual product failure rates or estimated costs to repair those product failures differ from our estimates, we would be required to revise our estimated warranty provision.
(6)    revenue recognition. we generally record revenue on product sales at the time of shipment, which is when title transfers to the customer. we initially defer service revenue received in advance from service contracts and recognize that deferred revenue ratably over the life of the service contract. we initially defer revenue we receive in advance from rental unit contracts and recognize that deferred revenue ratably over the life of the rental contract. otherwise, we recognize revenue from rental unit contracts ratably over the life of the rental contract. we include in revenue freight charges we bill to customers. we charge all freight-related expenses to cost of sales. taxes assessed by government authorities that are imposed on and concurrent with revenue-producing transactions, such as sales and value added taxes, are excluded from revenue.
we do not normally offer a right of return or other recourse with respect to the sale of our products, other than returns for product defects or other warranty claims. we do not recognize revenues if we offer a right of return or variable sale prices for subsequent events or activities. however, as part of our sales processes we may provide upfront discounts for large orders, one-time special pricing to support new product introductions, sales rebates for centralized purchasing entities or price-breaks for regular order volumes. we record the costs of all such programs as an adjustment to revenue. our products are predominantly therapy-based equipment and require no installation. therefore, we have no significant installation obligations.
(7)    stock-based compensation. we measure the compensation cost of all stock-based awards at fair value on the date of grant. we recognize that value as compensation expense over the service period, net of estimated forfeitures. we estimate the fair value of employee stock options and purchase rights granted using a black-scholes valuation model. the fair value of an award is affected by our stock price on the date of grant as well as other assumptions including the estimated volatility of our stock price over the term of the awards, the expected dividend per share and the expected life of the awards. the risk-free interest rate assumption we use is based upon the u.s. treasury yield curve at the time of grant appropriate for the expected life of the awards. expected volatilities are based on a combination of historical volatilities of our stock and the implied volatilities from tradeable options of our stock corresponding to the expected term of the options. we use a combination of the historic and implied volatilities as the addition of the implied volatility is more representative of our future stock price trends. while there is a tradeable market of options on our common stock, less emphasis is
placed on the implied volatility of these options due to the relative low volumes of these traded options and the difference in the terms compared to our employee options. in order to determine the estimated period of time that we expect employees to hold their stock options, we use historical rates by employee groups. the estimation of stock awards that will ultimately vest requires judgment, and to the extent actual results differ from our estimates, such amounts will be recorded as a cumulative adjustment in the period estimates are revised. the aforementioned inputs entered into the black-scholes valuation model we use to fair value our stock awards are subjective estimates and changes to these estimates will cause the fair value of our stock awards and related stock-based compensation expense we record to vary.
we estimate the fair value of restricted stock units based on the market value of the underlying shares as determined at the grant date less the fair value of dividends that holders are not entitled to, during the vesting period. we estimate the weighted average grant date fair value of performance restricted stock units, or prsus, which contain a market condition, using a monte-carlo simulation valuation model.

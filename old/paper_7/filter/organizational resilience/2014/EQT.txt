•marcellus sales volumes of 378.2 bcfe, 38% higher than 2013
•gathered volumes of 590.5 tbtu, 27% higher than 2013

•   recognized impairment of proved and unproved oil and gas properties of $267.3 million (pre-tax) in the ohio utica and permian basin income from continuing operations attributable to eqt corporation for 2014 was $385.6 million, $2.53 per diluted share, compared with $298.7 million, $1.97 per diluted share, in 2013. the $86.9 million increase in income from continuing operations attributable to eqt corporation was primarily attributable to a 26% increase in production sales volumes, favorable gains on derivatives not designated as hedges, increases in contracted transmission capacity and throughput and gathered volumes, favorable changes in hedging ineffectiveness, and lower interest expense. these factors were partially offset by impairments of long-lived assets, higher net income attributable to noncontrolling interests of the partnership, higher transportation and processing expenses, higher income tax expense, higher selling, general and administrative (sg&a) expense and higher depreciation, depletion and amortization (dd&a) expense.
operating income was $853.4 million in 2014 compared to $654.6 million in 2013, an increase of $198.8 million. eqt production sales volumes increased 26% primarily as a result of increased production from the 2014 and 2013 drilling programs in the marcellus acreage partially offset by the normal production decline in the company's producing wells. the average realized price to eqt production for sales volumes was $3.23 per mcfe in 2014 compared to $3.15 per mcfe in 2013. eqt production total net operating revenues for the year ended december 31, 2014 included $83.8 million of derivative gains for derivative instruments not designated as hedging instruments compared to $0.3 million of derivative losses for the year ended december 31, 2013. the $83.8 million of derivative gains for derivative instruments not designated as hedging instruments for the year ended december 31, 2014 included $36.5 million of cash settlements received, which is included in the average realized price to eqt production of $3.23 per mcfe in 2014. the year ended december 31, 2014 also included a $24.8 million gain for hedging ineffectiveness of financial hedges compared to a $21.3 million loss for ineffectiveness of financial hedges for the year ended december 31, 2013.
transmission net operating revenues increased as a result of higher firm transmission contracted capacity and throughput for third parties and eqt production, as well as higher interruptible transmission service. the increase in transmission net operating revenues is the result of increased production development in the marcellus play. gathering net operating revenues increased due to a 27% increase in gathered volumes, partially offset by an 11% decrease in the average gathering fee. the gathered volume increase was driven by higher volumes gathered for eqt production in the marcellus play. the decrease in the average gathering fee resulted from increased gathered volumes in the marcellus play, as the marcellus gathering rate is lower than the rate in other areas.
operating expenses for 2014 were $1,650.5 million compared to $1,227.0 million in 2013, an increase of $423.5 million. excluding the $267.3 million impairment charge (described in more detail in business segment results of operations - eqt production) and $26.2 million increase in depreciation and depletion, operating expenses increased $130.0 million. this increase was primarily attributable to higher transportation and processing expenses and higher sg&a costs consistent with the growth in the production and midstream businesses.
on may 7, 2014, a wholly owned subsidiary of the company, eqt gathering contributed a high-pressure gathering system to eqm gathering, a wholly owned subsidiary of the partnership, in exchange for $1.18 billion (the jupiter transaction). eqm gathering is consolidated by the company as it is still controlled by the company.
on may 7, 2014, the partnership completed an underwritten public offering of 12,362,500 common units, which included the full exercise of the underwriters' overallotment option, representing partnership limited partner interests. the partnership received net proceeds of approximately $902.5 million from the offering, after deducting the underwriters' discount and offering expenses of approximately $34.0 million. as of december 31, 2014, the company held a 2% general partner interest, all incentive
distribution rights and a 34.4% limited partner interest in the partnership. the company's limited partner interest in the partnership consists of 3,959,952 common units and 17,339,718 subordinated units.
in june 2014, the company exchanged certain assets with range. the company received approximately 73,000 net acres and approximately 900 producing wells, most of which are vertical wells, in the permian basin of texas. in exchange, range received approximately 138,000 net acres in the company's nora field of virginia, the company's working interest in approximately 2,000 producing vertical wells in the nora field, the company's remaining 50% ownership interest in nora llc, which owns the supporting gathering system in the nora field, and $167.3 million in cash.
in august 2014, the partnership issued 4.00% senior notes (4.00% senior notes) due august 1, 2024 in the aggregate principal amount of $500.0 million. net proceeds of the offering of $492.3 million were used to repay the outstanding borrowings under the partnership's credit facility and for general partnership purposes.
income from continuing operations attributable to eqt corporation for 2013 was $298.7 million, $1.97 per diluted share, compared with $135.9 million, $0.90 per diluted share, in 2012. the $162.8 million increase in income from continuing operations attributable to eqt corporation between periods was primarily attributable to a 43% increase in natural gas volumes sold, increases in contracted transmission capacity and throughput and gathered volumes, the gain on sale of certain energy marketing contracts by eqt energy in december 2013 and lower interest expense. these factors were partially offset by higher dd&a expense, higher income tax expense, higher sg&a expense and higher net income attributable to noncontrolling interests of the partnership.
operating income was $654.6 million in 2013 compared to $389.6 million in 2012, an increase of $265.0 million. the increase in operating income was attributable to a 43% increase in natural gas volumes sold, increased transmission pipeline revenues and gathered volumes and a $19.6 million pre-tax gain from the disposal of customer contracts by eqt energy, partially offset by higher dd&a expense and higher sg&a expense.
production sales volumes increased in 2013 compared to 2012 primarily as a result of increased production from the 2013 and 2012 drilling programs in the marcellus acreage. this increase was partially offset by the normal production decline in the company's producing wells. the average realized price to eqt production for sales volumes was $3.15 per mcfe in 2013 compared to $3.00 per mcfe in 2012. gathering net operating revenues increased due to a 39% increase in gathered volumes, partially offset by a 17% decrease in the average gathering fee. the gathered volume increase was driven by higher volumes gathered for eqt production in the marcellus play. the decrease in the average gathering fee resulted from increased gathered volumes in the marcellus play, as the marcellus gathering rate is lower than the rate in other areas.
operating expenses for 2013 were $1,227.0 million compared to $987.6 million in 2012, an increase of $239.4 million. this increase was primarily attributable to higher dd&a charges attributable to higher production volumes at a production depletion rate of $1.50 per mcfe in 2013 compared to $1.52 per mcfe in 2012 and higher production-related and sg&a costs consistent with the growth in the production and midstream businesses.
on july 22, 2013, sunrise pipeline, llc (sunrise), a subsidiary of the company, merged with and into equitrans, a subsidiary of the partnership, with equitrans continuing as the surviving company (the sunrise merger). equitrans continues to be consolidated by the company as it is still under common control.
on july 22, 2013, the partnership completed an underwritten public offering of 12,650,000 common units representing partnership limited partner interests. following the offering and the closing of the sunrise merger, the company retained a 44.6% equity interest in the partnership, which includes 3,443,902 common units, 17,339,718 subordinated units and a 2% general partner interest. the partnership received net proceeds of $529.4 million from the offering, after deducting the underwriters' discount and offering expenses of $20.9 million.
on december 17, 2013, the company and its wholly owned subsidiary, distribution holdco, llc, completed the disposition of their ownership interests in equitable gas and homeworks to png companies llc (the equitable gas transaction).  as consideration for the transaction, the company received total cash proceeds of $748.0 million, select midstream assets, including the avc facilities, with a fair value of $140.9 million and other contractual assets with a fair value of $32.5 million.

business segment results of operations business segment operating results from continuing operations are presented in the segment discussions and financial tables on the following pages.  operating segments are evaluated on their contribution to the company's consolidated results based on operating income.  other income, interest and income taxes are managed on a consolidated basis.  headquarters' costs are billed to the operating segments based upon a fixed allocation of the headquarters' annual operating budget.  differences between budget and actual headquarters expenses totaling $36.9 million, $45.4 million and $35.6 million were not allocated to the operating segments for the years ended december 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. unallocated expenses consist primarily of incentive compensation, administrative costs and for 2013 and 2012, corporate overhead charges previously allocated to the company's distribution segment that were reclassified to headquarters as part of the recast of those periods to reflect the discontinued operations presentation.
the company has reported the components of each segment's operating income from continuing operations and various operational measures in the sections below, and where appropriate, has provided information describing how a measure was derived. eqt's management believes that presentation of this information provides useful information to management and investors regarding the financial condition, operations and trends of each of eqt's business segments without being obscured by the financial condition, operations and trends for the other segments or by the effects of corporate allocations of interest, income taxes and other income.  in addition, management uses these measures for budget planning purposes. the company's management reviews and reports the eqt production segment results with third-party transportation and processing costs reflected as a deduction from operating revenues as management believes this presentation provides a more useful view of average net sales price and is consistent with industry practices. third-party costs incurred to gather, process and transport gas produced by eqt production to market sales points are recorded as a portion of transportation and processing costs in the statements of consolidated income. purchased gas costs at eqt midstream include natural gas purchases, including natural gas purchases from affiliates, purchased gas costs adjustments and other gas supply expenses. these purchased gas costs are primarily with affiliates and are eliminated in consolidation. consistent with the consolidated results, energy trading contracts recorded within storage, marketing and other are reported net within operating revenues, regardless of whether the contracts are physically or financially settled. the company has reconciled each segment's operating income to the company's consolidated operating income and net income in note 4 to the consolidated financial statements.

(b)         ngls and crude oil were converted to mcfe at the rate of six mcfe per barrel for all periods.
(c)         includes $167.3 million of cash capital expenditures and $349.2 million of non-cash capital expenditures for the exchange of assets with range during the year ended december 31, 2014; $114.2 million of cash capital expenditures for the purchase of acreage and marcellus wells from chesapeake energy corporation and its partners (chesapeake) during the year ended december 31, 2013; and certain labor overhead costs including a portion of non-cash stock-based compensation expense and non-cash capital expense accruals that were not paid at the applicable year-end.
eqt production's operating income totaled $506.0 million for 2014 compared to $371.2 million for 2013.  the $134.8 million increase in operating income was primarily due to increased sales of produced natural gas and ngls and a higher average realized price partially offset by an increase in operating expenses, which includes $267.3 million of noncash impairment charges. impairment charges consist of $105.2 million associated with proved properties in the permian basin of texas related to the 2014 decline in commodity prices. impairment charges also include $86.6 million associated with undeveloped properties and $75.5 million associated with proved properties in the utica shale of ohio as a result of insufficient recovery of hydrocarbons to support continued development along with the decline in commodity prices.
total net operating revenues were $1,612.7 million for 2014 compared to $1,168.7 million for 2013. the $444.0 million increase in total net operating revenues was primarily due to a 26% increase in production sales volumes, a favorable gain on derivatives not designated as hedges, a favorable change in hedging ineffectiveness and a 3% increase in the average realized price to eqt production.  the increase in production sales volumes was the result of increased production from the 2014 and 2013 drilling programs, primarily in the marcellus play. this increase was partially offset by the normal production decline in the company's producing wells.
total net operating revenues for the year ended december 31, 2014 included a $24.8 million gain for hedging ineffectiveness of financial hedges compared to a $21.3 million loss for ineffectiveness of financial hedges for the year ended december 31, 2013. the year ended december 31, 2014 also included $83.8 million of derivative gains for derivative instruments not designated as hedging instruments compared to $0.3 million of derivative losses for the year ended december 31, 2013.  the gains for the year ended december 31, 2014 relate to favorable changes in the fair market value of basis swaps and nymex collars that were not designated as hedging instruments, due to decreased nymex and basis prices as of december 31, 2014. the $83.8 million of derivative gains for derivative instruments not designated as hedging instruments for the year ended december 31, 2014 included $36.5 million of cash settlements received, which is included in the average price discussion above.
the $0.08 per mcfe increase in the average realized price to eqt production was the net result of an increase in the average nymex natural gas price net of cash settled derivatives combined with a per unit decrease in midstream revenue deductions, partly offset by a lower average natural gas differential of $0.40 per mcf.  the average differential includes lower appalachian basin basis of $0.91 per mcf, favorable recoveries of $0.45 per mcf and favorable settlements of basis swaps of $0.06 per mcf.  recoveries represent differences in natural gas prices between the appalachian basin and the sales points of other markets reached by utilizing transportation capacity, differences in natural gas prices between appalachian basin and fixed price sales contracts, term sales with fixed differentials to nymex and other marketing activity, including capacity releases.  for the year ended december 31, 2014, eqt production recognized higher recoveries compared to 2013 primarily by using its contracted transportation capacity to sell gas in higher priced markets, particularly during the winter months when market prices in the united states northeast region were significantly higher than the appalachian basin prices. much of these higher revenues resulted from sales off of the company's texas eastern transmission (tetco) and tennessee gas pipeline capacity, including additional tetco capacity that came online in 2014.  effective february 2014, the company acquired new tetco capacity of 245,000 mmbtu per day that enables the company to reach markets in eastern pennsylvania.  effective november 2014, additional tetco capacity of 300,000 mmbtu per day came online that enables the company to reach markets in new jersey as well as markets along the gulf coast.  additionally, the company executed natural gas sales with fixed differentials to nymex for the 2014 summer term during the fourth quarter of 2013 and first quarter of 2014 when market prices were favorable compared to actual appalachian basin basis during the summer of 2014.
operating expenses totaled $1,134.2 million for 2014 compared to $797.4 million for 2013. the increase in operating expenses was the result of impairments of long-lived assets of $267.3 million, as previously mentioned, and increases in sg&a, production taxes, dd&a, loe and exploration expenses. sg&a expense increased in 2014 primarily as a result of higher personnel costs of $12.4 million, including incentive compensation expenses, higher litigation and environmental reserves of $6.2 million,
and an increase in professional services of $4.9 million. production taxes increased due to an $11.6 million increase in severance taxes and property taxes as a result of higher market sales prices and higher production sales volumes in certain jurisdictions subject to these taxes. production taxes also increased due to a $5.1 million increase in the pennsylvania impact fee, primarily as a result of an increase in the number of wells drilled in pennsylvania. depletion expense increased as a result of higher production sales volumes in 2014 partially offset by a lower overall depletion rate. the increase in loe was mainly a result of increased marcellus activity in 2014, including a $2.8 million increase in salt water disposal expenses and a $2.7 million increase in labor expenses, along with expenses related to the exchange of properties with range. exploration expense increased in 2014 primarily as a result of increased geophysical activity compared to the prior year.
in connection with an asset exchange with range during the second quarter of 2014, the company received acreage and producing wells in the permian basin of texas in exchange for acreage, producing wells, the company's 50% ownership interest in a supporting gathering system in the nora fields of virginia and cash of $167.3 million. in conjunction with the transaction, eqt production recognized a pre-tax gain of $27.4 million in 2014, which is included in gain on sale / exchange of assets in the statements of consolidated income. the $27.4 million pre-tax gain included a $28.0 million pre-tax gain related to the de-designation of certain derivative instruments that were previously designated as cash flow hedges because it was probable that the forecasted transactions would not occur. any subsequent changes in fair value of these derivative instruments will be recognized within the results of operations for eqt production.
eqt production's operating income totaled $371.2 million for 2013 compared to $187.9 million for 2012.  the $183.3 million increase in operating income was primarily due to increased sales of produced natural gas and ngls and a higher average realized price partially offset by an increase in operating expenses.
total net operating revenues were $1,168.7 million for 2013 compared to $793.8 million for 2012. the $374.9 million increase in total net operating revenues was primarily due to a 43% increase in production sales volumes and a 5% increase in the average realized price to eqt production.  the increase in production sales volumes was the result of increased production from the 2012 and 2011 drilling programs, primarily in the marcellus play. this increase was partially offset by the normal production decline in the company's producing wells.
the $0.15 per mcfe increase in the average realized price to eqt production was the net result of a per unit decrease in midstream revenue deductions and an increase in the average nymex natural gas price net of cash settled derivatives, partly offset by a lower average natural gas differential of $0.28 per mcf and lower ngl prices. the average differential includes lower appalachian basin basis of $0.13 per mcf and lower recoveries of $0.15 per mcf. the lower recoveries primarily related to decreases in the sales of unused capacity.
total net operating revenues for the year ended december 31, 2013 included a $21.3 million loss for hedging ineffectiveness of financial hedges compared to a $0.1 million loss for ineffectiveness of financial hedges in the year ended december 31, 2012.
operating expenses totaled $797.4 million for 2013 compared to $605.9 million for 2012. the increase in operating expenses was the result of increases in dd&a, loe, exploration expenses, sg&a and production taxes. depletion expense increased as a result of higher production sales volumes in 2013 partially offset by a slightly lower overall depletion rate. the increase in loe was mainly a result of increased marcellus activity in 2013, including a $6.5 million increase in salt water disposal expenses and a $3.1 million increase in labor expenses in that region. the increase in exploration expense was due to increased impairments of unproved lease acreage of $8.7 million resulting from lease expirations during 2013, slightly offset by a reduction in geophysical activity compared to the prior year. sg&a expense increased in 2013 primarily as a result of higher personnel costs of $4.6 million, including incentive compensation expenses, and higher environmental reserves of $1.9 million partially offset by a decrease in franchise taxes of $2.2 million.
production taxes increased primarily due to an increase in severance and property taxes related to higher market sales prices and higher production sales volumes. severance and property taxes were offset by a $3.1 million decrease in the pennsylvania impact fee. during 2013, the pennsylvania impact fee was $12.2 million compared to $15.3 million in 2012, of which $6.7 million represented a retroactive fee for pre-2012 marcellus wells.

(a)        includes certain labor overhead costs including a portion of non-cash stock-based compensation expense and capital accruals not paid as of the respective year end.
(b)        as discussed in note 7 to the company's consolidated financial statements, in connection with an asset exchange with range during the second quarter of 2014, the company received acreage and producing wells in the permian basin of texas in exchange for acreage, producing wells, the company's 50% ownership interest in a supporting gathering system in the nora field of virginia and cash of $167.3 million. in conjunction with this transaction, eqt midstream recognized a pre-tax gain of $6.8 million, which is included in gain on sale / exchange of assets in the statement of consolidated income for the year ended december 31, 2014.
eqt midstream's operating income totaled $384.3 million, an increase of $55.5 million in 2014 compared to 2013. the increase was the result of increased transmission and gathering net operating revenues partly offset by increased operating expenses, lower gains on asset sales and a decrease in storage, marketing and other net operating revenues.
transmission net operating revenues increased by $65.9 million as a result of higher firm transmission contracted capacity and throughput of $61.9 million for third parties and eqt production, including $14.7 million related to the avc facilities, and higher interruptible transmission service. the increase in transmission net operating revenues is the result of increased development activity in the marcellus shale.
gathering net operating revenues increased due to a 27% increase in gathered volumes partly offset by an 11% decrease in the average gathering fee.  the gathered volume increase was primarily driven by higher affiliate volumes, which accounted for 84% of the increase, as a result of increased activity in the marcellus play. the average gathering fee decreased due to a higher mix of gathered volumes in the marcellus play as these volumes have a lower average fee compared to huron and other volumes.
these increases in net operating revenues were partly offset by a decrease in storage, marketing and other net operating revenues as a result of $9.3 million of reduced marketing revenues primarily as a result of the sale of certain energy marketing contracts on december 31, 2013 and $9.0 million of lower revenues on ngls marketed for non-affiliated producers as a result of lower prices and volumes, partly offset by increased storage revenues on the avc facilities.
total operating revenues increased $85.0 million primarily as a result of increased transmission and gathering revenue, partly offset by reduced gas marketing activity. total purchased gas costs decreased $24.5 million primarily as a result of reduced gas marketing activity.
operating expenses totaled $277.5 million, an increase of $41.1 million in 2014 compared to 2013.  o&m expense increased as a result of $8.6 million in higher compression and pipeline operating expenses related to an increase in marcellus activity and operating the avc facilities as well as higher labor costs. the increase in sg&a was primarily the result of increased personnel costs including incentive compensation of $9.8 million, increased overhead allocated from affiliates of $4.2 million and increased professional services of $2.3 million. dd&a increased as a result of additional assets placed in-service, including the avc facilities.
in 2013, the company sold certain energy marketing contracts to a third party for $20.0 million.  in conjunction with this transaction, the company recognized a pre-tax gain of $19.6 million in 2013. in connection with an asset exchange with range during 2014, the company received acreage and producing wells in the permian basin of texas in exchange for acreage, producing wells, the company's 50% ownership interest in a supporting gathering system in the nora field of virginia and cash of $167.3 million. in conjunction with this transaction, eqt midstream recognized a pre-tax gain of $6.8 million. the difference in the gains on these two transactions resulted in the decrease in gain on sale / exchange of assets in 2014 compared to 2013.
eqt midstream's operating income totaled $328.8 million for 2013 compared to $237.3 million for 2012. the increase in operating income was primarily the result of increased transmission and gathering net operating revenues and gains on asset sales, partly offset by increased operating expenses and a decrease in storage, marketing and other net operating revenues.
the $96.1 million increase in total net operating revenues was due to a $56.1 million increase in transmission net operating revenues and $49.2 million increase in gathering net operating revenues, partially offset by a decrease in storage, marketing and other net operating revenues.
transmission net operating revenues increased from the prior year primarily as a result of $44.0 million of additional firm capacity reservation revenues and usage charges, $10.1 million of fees associated with transported volumes in excess of firm capacity and increased pipeline safety revenues.
gathering net operating revenues increased due to a 39% increase in gathered volumes, partly offset by a 17% decrease in the average gathering fee.  the gathered volume increase was driven by higher volumes gathered for eqt production in the marcellus play.  the average gathering fee decreased due to the mix of gathered volumes as marcellus volumes increased while huron and other volumes, which have a higher gathering fee, decreased.
storage, marketing and other net operating revenues decreased from the prior year primarily as a result of lower realized margins and reduced activity due to lower price spreads. in addition, revenues on ngls marketed for non-affiliated producers decreased by $2.8 million primarily as a result of lower liquids pricing partially offset by slightly higher liquids volumes.
on december 31, 2013, the company sold certain energy marketing contracts to a third party for $20.0 million.  these contracts were natural gas sales agreements with approximately 1,000 end use customers with total volumes of approximately 12 bcf in 2013.  in conjunction with this transaction, the company recognized a pre-tax gain of $19.6 million in 2013, which is included in gain on sale / exchange of assets in the statements of consolidated income.
total operating revenues increased $108.5 million primarily as a result of the increase in gathered volumes and increased transmission revenue, partly offset by the lower gathering rate. total purchased gas costs increased $12.4 million primarily as a result of an increase in commodity prices.
operating expenses totaled $236.4 million for 2013 compared to $212.1 million for 2012.  the increase in sg&a was primarily the result of increased personnel costs of $5.9 million including incentive compensation expenses, $2.2 million of increased overhead allocated from affiliates, a $2.1 million unfavorable change in bad debt expense primarily as a result of lower recoveries from the lehman brothers settlement in 2013 and $2.0 million of lower reserve reductions in 2013, primarily related to the expected recovery of a long-term, volume-based regulatory asset.  dd&a increased as a result of additional assets placed in-service.  o&m expenses were flat to the prior year as increases in personnel and other gathering and transmission business expenses in 2013 were offset by reduced compressor operating expenses.
other income includes equity in earnings of nonconsolidated investments, primarily the company's prior investment in nora llc, of $3.4 million, $7.6 million and $6.1 million for the years ended december 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. in connection with the asset exchange with range in 2014, the company transferred its 50% ownership interest in nora llc to range.
other income for the year ended december 31, 2014 also included $3.2 million of afudc compared to $1.2 million of afudc in 2013, a $2.0 million increase primarily as a result of construction activity on the late 2013 acquisition of the avc and the jefferson expansion project.
other income for the year ended december 31, 2013 also included $1.2 million of afudc compared to $6.8 million of afudc in 2012, a $5.6 million decrease as a result of the sunrise pipeline being placed into service during the third quarter of 2012. the company also recognized a gain on the sale of leases of $0.4 million in 2013 compared to a gain on the sale of leases of $2.0 million in 2012.
interest expense decreased $6.2 million in 2014 compared to 2013 due to higher capitalized interest of $35.0 million on increased marcellus well development in 2014 compared to $22.9 million in 2013, partially offset by an increase in interest expense of $8.3 million related to the partnership's issuance of 4.00% senior notes due 2024 in the aggregate principal amount of $500.0 million during the third quarter of 2014.
interest expense decreased $42.1 million in 2013 compared to 2012 primarily as a result of a $23.3 million payment to settle a forward-starting interest rate swap recorded as expense in 2012 and the company's repayment of $200.0 million of 5.15% senior notes that matured in the fourth quarter of 2012. this decrease was also attributable to higher capitalized interest of $22.9 million on increased marcellus well development in 2013 compared to $15.6 million in 2012.
during the third quarter of 2011, the company entered into an interest rate hedge in anticipation of refinancing $200.0 million of long-term debt scheduled to mature in november 2012.  the company retired the debt using cash on hand and recognized a $23.3 million expense in the year ended december 31, 2012 to close the interest rate hedge.
the weighted average annual interest rates on the company's long-term debt, excluding the partnership's long-term debt, was 6.4% for 2014, 2013 and 2012.  the weighted average annual interest rate on the partnership's long-term debt was 4.0% for 2014. the partnership had no long-term debt outstanding in 2013 and 2012. the company did not have any short-term loans outstanding at any time during the years ended december 31, 2014 and 2012. the maximum amount of outstanding short-term loans at any time under the company's credit facility during the year ended december 31, 2013 was $178.5 million. the average daily balance of short-term loans outstanding for the company during the year ended december 31, 2013 was approximately $12.1 million at a weighted average annual interest rate of 1.7%. the maximum amount of outstanding short-term loans at any time under the partnership's credit facility during the year ended december 31, 2014 was $450 million, and the average daily balance of short-term loans outstanding was approximately $119 million at a weighted average annual interest rate of 1.7%. the partnership had no short-term loans outstanding at any time during the years ended december 31, 2013 and 2012.
income tax expense increased $38.9 million in 2014 compared to 2013 as a result of higher pre-tax income partly offset by a decrease in the company's effective income tax rate from 33.6% to 29.6%.  the decrease in the rate in 2014 compared to 2013 was primarily related to an internal reorganization of subsidiaries resulting in a reduction of state taxes as well as an increase in noncontrolling interests related to the partnership's ownership structure. for both periods, the overall rate was lower than the federal statutory rate as the company consolidates 100% of the pre-tax income related to the noncontrolling public limited partners' share of partnership earnings, but is not required to record an income tax provision with respect to the portion of the partnership's earnings allocated to the noncontrolling public limited partners.  the partnership's earnings increased primarily due to the sunrise merger in 2013 and the jupiter transaction in 2014, each of which also resulted in increases in the noncontrolling limited public partners' share of partnership earnings (as described in note 3 to the consolidated financial statements).
income tax expense increased $103.7 million in 2013 compared to 2012 as a result of higher pre-tax income and an increase in the company's effective income tax rate from 32.4% to 33.6%. the increase in the rate from 2012 to 2013 was primarily due to an increase in pre-tax book income on state tax paying entities as well as a shift in the company's business to states with higher income tax rates. this was partially offset by state tax benefits of $9.8 million realized in 2013 primarily related to the sunrise merger and the equitable gas transaction which allowed the company to utilize nols that had previously been fully reserved. as described in the preceding paragraph, the overall rate was reduced in both periods because the company is not required to record an income tax provision with respect to the portion of the partnership's earnings allocated to its noncontrolling public limited partners.
the company was in an overall federal taxable income position for 2014 and 2013 primarily as a result of the jupiter transaction in 2014 and taxable gains generated from the sunrise merger and the equitable gas transaction in 2013.  the company was in an overall federal tax net operating loss (nol) position for 2012.  starting in 2013, the company began to utilize the nols it generated in previous years.  for federal income tax purposes, the company deducts a portion of drilling costs as intangible drilling costs (idcs) in the year incurred.  idcs, however, are sometimes limited for purposes of the alternative minimum tax (amt) and can result in the company paying amt even when utilizing a regular tax nol.  see note 9 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the company's income taxes.

income from discontinued operations, net of tax       $1,371                $91,843               $47,493
income from discontinued operations, net of tax, was $1.4 million for the year ended december 31, 2014 compared to $91.8 million for the year ended december 31, 2013.  on december 17, 2013, the company and distribution holdco, llc completed the disposition of their ownership interests in equitable gas and homeworks to png companies llc. income from discontinued operations in 2014 resulted from working capital adjustments to the sales price completed in 2014.
income from discontinued operations, net of tax, was $91.8 million for the year ended december 31, 2013 compared to $47.5 million for the year ended december 31, 2012.  the $44.3 million increase in 2013 compared to 2012 was primarily the result of a $43.8 million gain recognized on the equitable gas transaction during 2013. excluding the gain recognized on the equitable gas transaction, results for discontinued operations were relatively unchanged in 2013 compared to 2012 as favorable adjustments for the completion of a regulatory gas cost audit and colder weather in 2013 were offset by reduced revenues as a result of competitive contract renewals and an increase in bad debt expense.
net income attributable to noncontrolling interests of the partnership was $124.0 million for the year ended december 31, 2014 compared to $47.2 million for the year ended december 31, 2013.  the increase resulted from higher capacity reservation revenues and higher gathering revenues in the partnership, as well as increased noncontrolling interests in 2014.  noncontrolling interests in the partnership increased from 55.4% to 63.6% during the year ended december 31, 2014 as a result of the underwritten public offering of additional common units representing limited partner interests in the partnership in may 2014 in connection with the jupiter transaction.
net income attributable to noncontrolling interests of the partnership was $47.2 million for the year ended december 31, 2013 compared to $13.0 million for the year ended december 31, 2012.  the increase resulted from higher capacity reservation revenues in the partnership, which completed its ipo in the third quarter of 2012, as well as increased noncontrolling interests in 2013.  noncontrolling interests in the partnership increased from 40.6% to 55.4% during the year ended december 31, 2013 as a result of the underwritten public offering of additional common units representing limited partner interests in the partnership in july 2013 in connection with the sunrise merger.
outlook the company is committed to profitably developing its natural gas, ngl and oil reserves through environmentally responsible, cost-effective and technologically advanced horizontal drilling.  the market price for commodities can be volatile and these fluctuations can impact, among other things, the company's revenues, earnings, liquidity, reserves, dd&a rates and development plans.
average daily prices for nymex west texas intermediate crude oil ranged from a high of $107.26 per barrel to a low of $44.45 per barrel from january 1, 2014 through february 9, 2015. average daily prices for nymex henry hub natural gas ranged from a high of $6.15 per mmbtu to a low of $2.58 per mmbtu from january 1, 2014 through february 9, 2015. in addition, the market price for natural gas in the appalachian basin continues to be lower relative to henry hub as a result of the increased supply of natural gas in the northeast region.  in january 2015, in response to decreases in commodity prices in late 2014, the company reduced its 2015 capital expenditure spending plan, excluding acquisitions, by approximately $450 million. the company is unable to predict future potential movements in the market price for natural gas, including appalachian basis, oil and ngls and thus, cannot predict the ultimate impact of prices on its operations. if commodity prices continue to trend lower as they did in the latter part of 2014, reduced operating cash flows could signal a need to further reduce capital spending.
the company believes the outlook for its businesses is favorable despite the continued uncertainty of natural gas, ngl and oil prices. the company's resource base, financial strength, risk management, including commodity hedging strategy and disciplined investment of capital provide it with an opportunity to exploit and develop its positions and maximize efficiency through economies of scale in its key operating areas.
total capital investment, excluding acquisitions, is expected to be approximately $2.55 billion in 2015, revised from the company's previous estimate of approximately $3.0 billion, to reflect the current decrease in commodity prices. capital spending for well development (primarily drilling) in 2015 is expected to be approximately $1.85 billion, to support the drilling of approximately 191 gross wells, including 122 marcellus wells, 59 upper devonian wells and 10 other wells.  estimated sales volumes are expected to be 575 - 600 bcfe for an anticipated production sales volume growth of approximately 23% in 2015, while ngl volumes are expected to be 9,000 - 10,000 mbbls. to support continued growth in production, the company plans to invest approximately $0.7 billion on midstream infrastructure in 2015.  the 2015 capital spending plan is expected to be funded by cash on hand, cash flow generated from operations, proceeds from midstream asset sales (dropdowns) to the partnership and partnership capital raises.
in july 2014, the partnership announced that it will construct and own the ohio valley connector (ovc) pipeline. the ovc includes a 36-mile pipeline that will extend the partnership's transmission and storage system from northern west virginia to clarington, ohio, at which point it will interconnect with the rockies express pipeline and the texas eastern pipeline. in december 2014, the partnership submitted the ovc certificate application to the ferc and anticipates receiving the certificate in the second half of 2015. subject to ferc approval, construction is scheduled to begin in the third quarter of 2015 and the pipeline is expected to be in-service by mid-year 2016. the ovc will provide approximately 850 bbtu per day of transmission capacity and the 36-mile pipeline portion is estimated to cost approximately $300 million, of which $120 million to $130 million is expected to be spent in 2015. the partnership has entered into a 20-year precedent agreement with the company for a total of 650 bbtu per day of firm transmission capacity on the ovc.
in september 2014, the company and an affiliate of nextera energy, inc. announced the formation of the mvp llc joint venture that will construct and own the mvp. the company expects to transfer its interest in mvp llc to the partnership. the approximately 300-mile pipeline will extend from the partnership's existing transmission and storage system in wetzel county, west virginia to pittsylvania county, virginia. the company expects that the partnership will own the largest interest in the joint venture and will operate the mvp, which is estimated to cost a total of approximately $2.5 billion to $3.5 billion, excluding afudc, with the partnership funding its proportionate share through capital contributions made to the joint venture. in 2015, the partnership's capital contributions are expected to be approximately $75 million to $85 million and will be primarily in support of environmental and land assessments, design work and materials. this investment is included in the midstream totals above. expenditures are expected to increase substantially as construction commences, with the bulk of the expenditures expected to be made in 2017 and 2018. the joint venture has secured a total of 2.0 bcf per day of firm capacity commitments at 20-year terms and is currently in negotiation with additional shippers who have expressed interest in the mvp project. as a result, the final project scope, including pipe diameter and total capacity, has not yet been determined; however the voluntary pre-filing process with the ferc began in october 2014. the pipeline, which is subject to ferc approval, is expected to be in-service during the fourth quarter of 2018.
in december 2014, the company announced that it intends to file a registration statement with the sec for an ipo of common units of a master limited partnership (holdco) that will own the general partner and the incentive distribution rights of the partnership, as well as the company's 21.3 million limited partner units. eqt will file a registration statement for the ipo with the sec during the first quarter of 2015. under the proposed structure, eqt expects to sell a small percentage of holdco to the public in the ipo, subject to market conditions. at the close of the ipo, eqt would own the general partner of holdco, and more than 80% percent of holdco's common units. eqt intends to use the net proceeds from the ipo for the development of its existing assets, future capital expenditures, and general corporate purposes.
the company continues to focus on creating and maximizing shareholder value through the implementation of a strategy that economically accelerates the monetization of its asset base and prudently pursues investment opportunities, all while maintaining a strong balance sheet with solid cash flow.  while the tactics continue to evolve based on market conditions, the company is considering arrangements, including asset sales and joint ventures, to monetize the value of certain mature assets for re-deployment into its highest value development opportunities.
capital resources and liquidity the company's primary sources of cash for the year ended december 31, 2014 were cash flows from operating activities, proceeds from the underwritten public offering of the partnership's common units and proceeds from the partnership's issuance of long-term debt. the company's primary use of cash in 2014 was for capital expenditures.
operating activities the company's net cash provided by operating activities increased $251.8 million from $1,162.9 million in 2013 to $1,414.7 million in 2014. the increase in operating activities was primarily the result of a 26% increase in natural gas and ngl volumes sold, increases in contracted transmission capacity and gathered volumes and a $14.6 million decrease in interest payments, partially offset by a $41.1 million increase in income tax payments primarily due to taxes paid on transactions.
the company's net cash provided by operating activities increased $366.1 million from $796.8 million in 2012 to $1,162.9 million in 2013. the increase was primarily attributable to a 43% increase in natural gas and ngl volumes sold, increases in transmission pipeline throughput and gathered volumes and a $44.7 million decrease in interest payments, partially offset by a $136.1 million increase in income tax payments primarily due to taxes paid on the sunrise merger and equitable gas transaction.
while the company is unable to predict future movements in the market price for commodities, current prices are lower than average 2014 levels. if current low price trends continue, this trend would negatively impact the company's cash flows from operating activities during the year ended december 31, 2015.
investing activities cash flows used in investing activities totaled $2,444.2 million for 2014 as compared to $999.8 million for 2013. the $1,444.4 million increase was primarily attributable to higher capital expenditures in 2014 including the $167.3 million payment in 2014 in connection with the range asset exchange, compared to proceeds received from the equitable gas transaction of $740.6 million in 2013. as further described below, the company increased cash capital expenditures from continuing operations by $724.9 million from 2013 to 2014.
cash flows used in investing activities totaled $999.8 million for 2013 as compared to $1,370.5 million for 2012. the $370.7 million decrease was attributable to the proceeds received from the equitable gas transaction of $740.6 million and from the sale of certain energy marketing contracts of $23.0 million, partially offset by higher capital expenditures in 2013. as further described below, the company increased cash capital expenditures from continuing operations by $380.1 million from 2012 to 2013.

*        the company capitalizes certain labor overhead costs including a portion of non-cash stock-based compensation expense and capital accruals that have not yet been paid. these accrued capital expenditures in the table above were $99 million, $70 million and $24 million for the years ended december 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. the year ended december 31, 2014 also included $349 million of non-cash capital expenditures for the exchange of assets with range.
the company is estimating a 2015 capital expenditure spending plan of approximately $2.55 billion, including $1.85 billion for well development (primarily drilling) and $0.7 billion for midstream infrastructure. the company does not forecast property acquisitions within its capital spending plan.
capital expenditures for drilling and development totaled $1,717 million and $1,237 million during 2014 and 2013, respectively. the company spud 345 gross wells (342 net wells) in 2014, including 196 horizontal marcellus wells with approximately 1.1 million feet of pay, 41 horizontal upper devonian wells with approximately 260,000 feet of pay, 103 horizontal huron wells with approximately 605,000 feet of pay and 5 other wells. the company spud 225 gross wells (224 net wells) in 2013, including 146 horizontal marcellus wells with approximately 720,000 feet of pay, 22 horizontal upper devonian wells with approximately 110,000 feet of pay, 50 horizontal huron wells with approximately 300,000 feet of pay and 7 other wells. the $480 million increase in capital expenditures for well development was driven by an increase in completed frac stages, an increase in wells spud and higher spending in the huron play. capital expenditures for 2014 also included $724 million for property acquisitions, including $349 million of non-cash capital expenditures for the exchange of assets with range.
capital expenditures for the midstream operations totaled $455 million for 2014. during 2014, eqt midstream turned in-line approximately 60 miles of pipeline and 80,000 horsepower of compression primarily in the marcellus play. eqt midstream also added approximately 475 mmcf per day of incremental gathering capacity and 750 mmcf per day of incremental transmission capacity in 2014. during 2013, midstream capital expenditures were $369 million. eqt midstream turned in-line approximately 49 miles of pipeline and 2,100 horsepower of compression primarily within the marcellus play. eqt midstream also added 385 mmcf per day of incremental gathering capacity and 450 mmcf per day of incremental transmission capacity in 2013.

see item 7a, "quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk," and note 5 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the company's hedging program.
other items off-balance sheet arrangements in connection with the sale of its noresco domestic operations in december 2005, the company agreed to maintain in place guarantees of certain warranty obligations of noresco.  the savings guarantees provided that once the energy-efficiency construction was completed by noresco, the customer would experience a certain dollar amount of energy savings over a period of years.  the undiscounted maximum aggregate payments that may be due related to these guarantees were approximately $153 million as of december 31, 2014, extending at a decreasing amount for approximately 13 years.
in december 2014, the company issued a $130 million performance guarantee (the original mvp guarantee) in connection with its subsidiary's obligations to fund the company's proportionate share of the construction budget for the mvp. upon the ferc's initial release to begin construction of the mvp, the original mvp guarantee will terminate, and the company will be obligated to issue a new guarantee in an amount equal to 33% of the subsidiary's remaining obligations to make capital contributions to mvp llc in connection with the then remaining construction budget.  upon the transfer of the company's interest in the joint venture to the partnership, the partnership will assume these obligations to provide performance assurances for the mvp. see note 18 to the consolidated financial statements for additional discussion regarding the mvp joint venture.
the noresco and the mvp guarantees are exempt from asc topic 460, guarantees.  the company has determined that the likelihood it will be required to perform on these arrangements is remote and any potential payments are expected to be immaterial to the company's financial position, results of operations and liquidity.  as such, the company has not recorded any liabilities in its consolidated balance sheets related to these guarantees.
rate regulation as described under "regulation" in item 1, "business," the company's transmission and storage operations and a portion of its gathering operations are subject to various forms of rate regulation.  as described in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, regulatory accounting allows the company to defer expenses and income as regulatory assets and liabilities which reflect future collections or payments through the regulatory process.  the company believes that it will continue to be subject to rate regulation that will provide for the recovery of the deferred costs.
schedule of contractual obligations the table below presents the company's long-term contractual obligations as of december 31, 2014 in total and by periods in accordance with sec rules, which excludes the company's contractual obligations relating to its natural gas transportation agreements with the partnership and mvp llc. for a description of the transportation agreements, see "commitments and contingencies" below and note 18 to the consolidated financial statements.

purchase obligations are primarily commitments for demand charges under existing long-term contracts and binding precedent agreements with various third-party pipelines, some of which extend up to approximately 20 years. the company has entered into agreements to release some of its capacity to various third parties. operating leases are primarily entered into for various office locations and warehouse buildings, as well as dedicated drilling rigs in support of the company's drilling program. the obligations for the company's various office locations and warehouse buildings totaled approximately $93.6 million as of december 31, 2014. the company has agreements with orion drilling company, savanna drilling, llc and several other drillers to provide drilling equipment and services to the company over the next four years. these obligations totaled approximately $132.0 million as of december 31, 2014.
the other liabilities line represents commitments for total estimated payouts for the 2014 value driver award program. see "critical accounting policies involving significant estimates" below and note 16 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion regarding factors that affect the ultimate amount of the payout of these obligations.
as discussed in note 9 to the consolidated financial statements, the company had a total reserve for unrecognized tax benefits at december 31, 2014 of $57.0 million, of which $10.1 million is offset against deferred tax assets since it would primarily reduce the related nol carryover and research and experimentation tax credit carryforwards. the company is currently unable to make reasonably reliable estimates of the period of cash settlement of these potential liabilities with taxing authorities; therefore, this amount has been excluded from the schedule of contractual obligations.
commitments and contingencies in the ordinary course of business, various legal and regulatory claims and proceedings are pending or threatened against the company.  while the amounts claimed may be substantial, the company is unable to predict with certainty the ultimate outcome of such claims and proceedings.  the company accrues legal and other direct costs related to loss contingencies when actually incurred.  the company has established reserves it believes to be appropriate for pending matters and, after consultation with counsel and giving appropriate consideration to available insurance, the company believes that the ultimate outcome of any matter currently pending against the company will not materially affect the company's financial position, results of operations or liquidity.
eqt energy has capacity commitments relating to natural gas transportation agreements with the partnership and mountain valley pipeline, llc. as of december 31, 2014, future payments related to these agreements totaled $10.3 billion. these capacity commitments have terms extending up to 20 years.
see note 18 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the company's commitments and contingencies.
recently issued accounting standards in may 2014, the financial accounting standards board issued accounting standards update (asu) no. 2014-09, revenue from contracts with customers. the standard requires an entity to recognize revenue in a manner that depicts the transfer of goods or services to customers at an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. asu no. 2014-09 will replace most of the existing revenue recognition requirements in united states gaap when it becomes effective. the guidance in asu no. 2014-09 is effective for public entities for annual reporting periods beginning after december 15, 2016, including interim periods therein. early adoption is not permitted. the company is currently evaluating the method of adoption and impact this standard will have on its financial statements and related disclosures.
critical accounting policies involving significant estimates the company's significant accounting policies are described in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements.  the discussion and analysis of the consolidated financial statements and results of operations are based upon the company's consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles.  the preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities.  the following critical accounting policies, which were reviewed by the company's audit committee, relate to the company's more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements.  actual results could differ from those estimates.
accounting for oil and gas producing activities:  the company uses the successful efforts method of accounting for its oil and gas production activities.
the carrying values of the company's proved oil and gas properties are reviewed for indications of impairment when events or circumstances indicate that the remaining carrying value may not be recoverable. the estimated future cash flows used to test those properties for recoverability are based on risk-adjusted proved and, in some cases, probable reserves, utilizing assumptions about the use of the asset, market prices for oil and gas and future operating costs.  proved oil and gas properties that have carrying amounts in excess of estimated future cash flows would be written down to fair value, which would be estimated by discounting the estimated future cash flows using discount rate assumptions that marketplace participants would use in their estimates of fair value.
capitalized costs of unproved properties are evaluated at least annually for recoverability on a prospective basis.  indicators of potential impairment include changes brought about by economic factors, potential shifts in business strategy employed by management and historical experience.  if it is determined that the properties will not yield proved reserves, the related costs are expensed in the period in which that determination is made.
the company believes that the accounting estimate related to the accounting for oil and gas producing activities is a "critical accounting estimate" as the evaluations of impairment of proved properties involves significant judgment about future events such as future sales prices of natural gas and ngls, future production costs, estimates of the amount of natural gas and ngls recorded and the timing of those recoveries. see note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the company's impairments of proved and unproved oil and gas properties.
oil and gas reserves:  proved oil and gas reserves, as defined by sec regulation s-x rule 4-10, are those quantities of oil and gas, which, by analysis of geoscience and engineering data, can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible from a given date forward, from known reservoirs and under existing economic conditions, operating methods and government regulations prior to the time at which contracts providing the right to operate expire, unless evidence indicates that renewal is reasonably certain, regardless of whether deterministic or probabilistic methods are used for the estimation.
the company's estimates of proved reserves are made and reassessed annually using geological and reservoir data as well as production performance data. reserve estimates are prepared and updated by the company's engineers and audited by the company's independent engineers.  revisions may result from changes in, among other things, reservoir performance, development plans, prices, economic conditions and governmental restrictions.  decreases in prices, for example, may cause a reduction in some proved reserves due to reaching economic limits sooner.  a material change in the estimated volumes of reserves could have an impact on the depletion rate calculation and the financial statements, including cash flow to the company and strength of the balance sheet.
the company estimates future net cash flows from natural gas and oil reserves based on selling prices and costs using a 12-month average price, calculated as the unweighted arithmetic average of the first-day-of-the-month price for each month within
the 12-month period, which is subject to change in subsequent periods.  operating costs, production and ad valorem taxes and future development costs are based on current costs with no escalation.  income tax expense is computed using expected future tax rates and giving effect to tax deductions and credits available under current laws and which relate to oil and gas producing activities.
the company believes that the accounting estimate related to oil and gas reserves is a "critical accounting estimate" because the company must periodically reevaluate proved reserves along with estimates of future production and the estimated timing of development expenditures.  future results of operations, cash flow to the company and strength of the balance sheet for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by changes in the company's assumptions.
income taxes:  the company recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the company's consolidated financial statements or tax returns.
the company has recorded deferred tax assets principally resulting from federal and state nol carryforwards, an alternative minimum tax credit carryforward, incentive compensation and investment in the partnership. the company has established a valuation allowance against a portion of the deferred tax assets related to the state nol carryforwards, as it is believed that it is more likely than not that these deferred tax assets will not all be realized.  no other significant valuation allowances have been established, as it is believed that future sources of taxable income, reversing temporary differences and other tax planning strategies will be sufficient to realize these deferred tax assets.  any determination to change the valuation allowance would impact the company's income tax expense and net income in the period in which such a determination is made.
the company also estimates the amount of financial statement benefit to record for uncertain tax positions as described in note 9 to the company's consolidated financial statements.
the company believes that accounting estimates related to income taxes are "critical accounting estimates" because the company must assess the likelihood that deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and exercise judgment regarding the amount of financial statement benefit to record for uncertain tax positions.  when evaluating whether or not a valuation allowance must be established on deferred tax assets, the company exercises judgment in determining whether it is more likely than not (a likelihood of more than 50%) that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.  the company considers all available evidence, both positive and negative, to determine whether, based on the weight of the evidence, a valuation allowance is needed, including carrybacks, tax planning strategies, reversal of deferred tax assets and liabilities and forecasted future taxable income.  in making the determination related to uncertain tax positions, the company considers the amounts and probabilities of the outcomes that could be realized upon ultimate settlement of an uncertain tax position using the facts, circumstances and information available at the reporting date to establish the appropriate amount of financial statement benefit.  to the extent that an uncertain tax position or valuation allowance is established or increased or decreased during a period, the company must include an expense or benefit within tax expense in the income statement.  future results of operations for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by changes in the company's assumptions.
derivative instruments: the company enters into derivative commodity instrument contracts primarily to mitigate exposure to commodity price risk associated with future sales of natural gas production. the company also enters into derivative instruments to hedge other forecasted natural gas purchases and sales, to hedge basis and to hedge exposure to fluctuations in interest rates.
the company estimates the fair value of all derivative instruments using quoted market prices, where available. if quoted market prices are not available, fair value is based upon models that use as inputs market-based parameters, including but not limited to forward curves, discount rates, broker quotes, volatilities and nonperformance risk. nonperformance risk considers the effect of the company's credit standing on the fair value of liabilities and the effect of the counterparty's credit standing on the fair value of assets. the company estimates nonperformance risk by analyzing publicly available market information, including a comparison of the yield on debt instruments with credit ratings similar to the company's or counterparty's credit rating, the yield of a risk-free instrument and credit default swap rates where available. the values reported in the financial statements change as these estimates are revised to reflect actual results, or market conditions or other factors change, many of which are beyond the company's control.
in addition, the derivative commodity instruments used to mitigate exposure to commodity price risk associated with future sales of natural gas production may limit the benefit the company would receive from increases in the prices of natural gas and may expose the company to margin requirements. given the company's price risk management position and price volatility, the company may be required from time to time to deposit cash with or provide letters of credit to its counterparties in order to satisfy these margin requirements.
the company believes that the accounting estimates related to derivative instruments are "critical accounting estimates" because the company's financial condition, results of operations and liquidity can be significantly impacted by changes in the market value of the company's derivative instruments due to the volatility of natural gas prices, both nymex and basis, and by changes in margin requirements. future results of operations for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by changes in the company's assumptions.
contingencies and asset retirement obligations:  the company is involved in various regulatory and legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business.  the company records a liability for contingencies based upon its assessment that a loss is probable and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated.  the company considers many factors in making these assessments, including history and specifics of each matter.  estimates are developed in consultation with legal counsel and are based upon an analysis of potential results.
the company also accrues a liability for legal asset retirement obligations based on an estimate of the timing and amount of their settlement.  for oil and gas wells, the fair value of the company's plugging and abandonment obligations is required to be recorded at the time the obligations are incurred, which is typically at the time the wells are spud. the company is required to operate and maintain its natural gas pipeline and storage systems, and intends to do so as long as supply and demand for natural gas exists, which the company expects for the foreseeable future. therefore, the company believes that the substantial majority of its natural gas pipeline and storage system assets have indeterminate lives.
the company believes that the accounting estimates related to contingencies and asset retirement obligations are "critical accounting estimates" because the company must assess the probability of loss related to contingencies and the expected amount and timing of asset retirement obligations.  in addition, the company must determine the estimated present value of future liabilities.  future results of operations for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by changes in the company's assumptions.
share-based compensation: the company awards share-based compensation in connection with specific programs established under the 1999, 2009 and 2014 long-term incentive plans.  awards to employees are typically made in the form of performance-based awards, time-based restricted stock and stock options. awards to directors are typically made in the form of phantom units.
performance-based awards expected to be satisfied in cash are treated as liability awards.  awards under the 2014 eqt value driver award program are treated as liability awards.  phantom units (which vest upon grant) expected to be satisfied in cash are also treated as liability awards.  for liability awards, the company is required to estimate, on grant date and on each reporting date thereafter until vesting and payment, the fair value of the ultimate payout based upon the expected performance through, and value of the company's common stock on, the vesting date.  the company then recognizes a proportionate amount of the expense for each period in the company's financial statements over the vesting period of the award, in the case of a performance-based award, and until payment, in the case of phantom units.  the company reviews its assumptions regarding performance and common stock value on a quarterly basis and adjusts its accrual when changes in these assumptions result in a material change in the fair value of the ultimate payouts.
performance-based awards expected to be satisfied in company common stock or partnership common units are treated as equity awards. awards under the 2012 executive performance incentive program, the 2013 executive performance incentive program, the 2013 value driver award program, the 2014 executive performance incentive program, the 2014 eqm value driver award program and the eqm total return program, which remained outstanding at december 31, 2014, are treated as equity awards.  for equity awards, the company is required to determine the grant date fair value of the awards, which is then recognized as expense in the company's financial statements over the vesting period of the award.  determination of the grant date fair value of the awards requires judgments and estimates regarding, among other things, the appropriate methodologies to follow in valuing the awards and the related inputs required by those valuation methodologies.  most often, the company is required to obtain a valuation based upon assumptions regarding risk-free rates of return, dividend or distribution yields, expected volatilities and the expected term of the award.  the risk-free rate is based on the u.s. treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant.  the dividend or distribution yield is based on the historical dividend or distribution yield of the company's common stock or the partnership's common units, as applicable, and any changes expected thereto, and, where applicable, of the common stock of the peer group members at the time of grant.  expected volatilities are based on historical volatility of the company's common stock or the partnership's common units and, where applicable, the common stock of the peer group members at the time of grant.  the expected term represents the period of time elapsing during the applicable performance period.
for time-based restricted stock awards, the grant date fair value of the awards is recognized as expense in the company's financial statements over the vesting period, historically three years.  for phantom units (which vest on date of grant) expected to be satisfied in equity, the grant date fair value of the awards is recognized as an expense in the company's financial statements in
the year of grant. the grant date fair value, in both cases, is determined based upon the closing price of the company's common stock on the date of the grant.
for non-qualified stock options, the grant date fair value is recognized as expense in the company's financial statements over the vesting period, typically two or three years.  the company utilizes the black-scholes option pricing model to measure the fair value of stock options, which includes assumptions for a risk-free interest rate, dividend yield, volatility factor and expected term.  the risk-free rate for periods within the contractual life of the option is based on the u.s. treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant.  the dividend yield is based on the dividend yield of the company's common stock at the time of grant.  the expected volatility is based on historical volatility of the company's common stock at the time of grant.  the expected term represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding based on historical option exercise experience at the time of grant.
the company believes that the accounting estimates related to share-based compensation are "critical accounting estimates" because they may change from period to period based on changes in assumptions about factors affecting the ultimate payout of awards, including the number of awards to ultimately vest and the market price and volatility of the company's common stock.  future results of operations for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by changes in the company's assumptions.  see note 16 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the company's share-based compensation.
